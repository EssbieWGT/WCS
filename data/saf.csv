Adrienne Murray & James BrooksTechnology Reporters

An aviation rarity touched down in the Norway's second city of Bergen earlier this month.

Alia had flown 100 miles (160km) in 55 minutes on battery power alone.

Built by US aerospace company Beta Technologies, the electric plane is designed for cargo operations - carrying up to 560kg (half a tonne) loads.

The flight had simulated a planned cargo route between the coastal cities of Stavanger and Bergen, and for the next few months test-flights will be carried out, as part of the country's move towards establishing low-emission aviation.

At the helm was pilot Jeremy Degagne, ""If you do the drive, it's four and a half hours. And we did the flight in 52 minutes.""

""It is an important milestone for Norway as an international test arena,"" says Karianne Helland Strand, a director at Norwegian airport operator, Avinor.

The test-flights in Norway follow a whirlwind European tour, which kicked off in Ireland, and saw Alia debut at the Farnborough and Paris Air Shows, as well as making stops in Germany and Denmark.

Alia can fly up to 400km (250 miles) on a single charge, and refuel in less than 40 minutes by plugging-in, just like an electric car.

The same fixed-wing model can be configured for medical transport or passenger travel with up to five seats, and this June it undertook the first electric demonstration flight carrying passengers into New York's JFK airport.

Beta, which counts Amazon as an investor and UPS as a customer, hopes to get US certification for its plane this year.

""I'm convinced that the next major breakthrough in aerospace will come on the back of electric propulsion,"" says Beta's chief revenue officer Shawn Hall, who's a former fighter pilot.

""We're now able to significantly lower the operating cost and it's environmentally beneficial from a carbon perspective.""

Alia is one of the most advanced projects, among dozens of firms exploring electric propulsion in aviation.

It would be one way of reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint - which currently accounts for 3% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

However, the Pipistrel Velis Electro remains the only electric plane to receive full certification from European authorities, despite clearing that hurdle five years ago.

With a range of 185km and 50 minutes of flight time, the Slovenian-built Pipistrel is limited to training and not for shuttling passengers from A to B.

But successes like that have been overshadowed by a string of failures in electric aviation.

Even aviation giant Airbus has backed away from the market. In January it announced that development of its CityAirbus electric aircraft would be put on hold.

Range remains the major limitation to electric flight. Even the best lithium ion batteries are bulky and heavy, with much lower energy density than jet fuel.

They have ""not improved significantly"" over the past two decades, reckons Guy Gratton, an aviation expert and professor at Cranfield University.

For electric flight to take-off, a ""revolution"" in battery chemistry is needed, he says.

Given those limitations, some are looking at alternative technology.

Just as hybrid cars were a stepping stone towards electric vehicles; plane-makers are now also experimenting with hybrid technology.

Among the aviation start-ups trying to get electric passenger planes off the ground, is Heart Aerospace.

It recently shifted its entire operations from Sweden to the US, which its management said would help it focus ""resources"" and be closer to clients, including the airlines Mesa and United.

The firm has developed a 30-seater, prototype plane, the X1, which the BBC saw before it was shipped to the United States.

If all goes to plan during upcoming test-flights, it will become the largest battery-powered plane to fly. ""It has about two tons of batteries in it,"" explained chief technology officer Benjamin Stabler.

For its real-world operations, though, Heart is adopting a fundamentally different design: a hybrid plane, powered by batteries, but carrying fuel as backup.

""You don't need as [many] batteries,"" argues Mr Stabler, which makes it lighter and cheaper, and also allows for more paying passengers.

""For a normal route, it would fly all-electric from takeoff to landing,"" he explained.

""If you want to go a longer distance, or if there's a diversion, you can switch over to the turbines.""

The aircraft could travel 200km in electric-only flight. With the hybrid technology, which is scheduled for test-flights in 2026, it could fly 400km with 30 passengers, or up to 800km with 25, the firm claims.

""Public transport flying, quite rightly, requires a significant amount of energy reserve,"" says Prof Grattan.

""So hybridisation and the use of conventional fuels to carry safety reserves makes good sense,"" adds the professor, who has previously advocated this approach.

It's still not clear what the future of aviation will look like.

Greener fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) have attracted investment, along with hydrogen-based systems.

All will have to prove their commercial viability and safety, and much work needs to be done.

""This is a really challenging thing to do, electrifying aviation and removing the carbon,"" said Mr Stabler.",https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/99c1/live/f825df80-8d7f-11f0-b391-6936825093bd.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 20:56:07.863309

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005.
The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel.
Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

The EU ETS is a cap-and-trade system that was launched in 2005. The system requires polluters to pay for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, helping bring overall emissions down while generating revenue to finance a transition to green energy. The program covers emissions from electricity and heat generation, industrial manufacturing, aviation and maritime transport.

The European Commission in 2023 amended the EU ETS Directive to help accelerate the use of SAF by granting free EU ETS allowances for use of the fuel. Starting in 2024, 20 million EU ETS allowances, worth approximately €1.5 billion, are set aside to support SAF uptake.

For 2024, the support amounts to approximately 1.3 million allowances, which are worth approximately €100 million, distributed between 53 operators.

According to the European Commission, the support system covers all or part of the price difference between fossil kerosene and the eligible SAF used by individual commercial aircraft operators on their flights covered by effective carbon pricing through the EU ETS. This support comes on top of the EU ETS incentive for using SAF, as operators are not required to surrender allowances for the use of these fuels – an advantage worth around €25 million in 2024. Taken together, the ETS incentive for use of SAF in 2024 amounts to around €125 million (€100 million from ETS allowances and €25 million from ETS zero rating of sustainable fuels). In addition, the EU ETS finances the Innovation Fund to support innovative clean tech projects, including in the aviation sector, to further reduce its climate impact.

The companies joined Federal Treasurer Jim Chalmers MP, Federal Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen MP, Kara Cook MP, Member for Bonner and representatives from the Australian Workers Union, Bioenergy Australia and the National Farmers’ Federation at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Queensland for the Sept. 17 announcement.

The new program aims to stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of lower-carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, according to the Australian government. Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks such as canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

“Today, around 70% of Australia’s canola is exported unprocessed, with much of it used overseas for renewable fuel production,” said Jesse Scott, head of Agri-Energy for GrainCorp. “We want to bring that value-add home and turn our canola into renewable fuels, to ensure there’s a future made in Australia.

“This project is about using Australia’s strengths in agriculture to fuel a new energy industry – one that helps to cut emissions while driving investment in the regions. As the energy transition gains pace, GrainCorp is proud to be part of this momentum and to help position Australian agriculture as a key player in the solution.”

A global agribusiness, GrainCorp operates the largest grain storage and handling network on the east coast of Australia, operating more than 150 regional receival sites and 20 million tonnes of storage capacity. GrainCorp also operates seven bulk port terminals with up to 15 million tonnes of elevation capacity.

In July 2024, GrainCorp, IFM and Ampol signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels supply chain in Australia. This collaboration combines GrainCorp’s feedstock and supply chain capabilities, Ampol’s refining and distribution infrastructure, and IFM’s long-term investment expertise to accelerate the transition to low-carbon liquid fuels.

Under the MOU, Ampol and IFM are assessing the feasibility for a renewable fuels facility with capacity to produce over 750 million liters annually at Ampol’s Lytton Refinery in Brisbane. At the same time, GrainCorp is exploring the feasibility of building a new canola processing facility to supply Australian canola oil to the future plant.

The partners have actively championed supply and demand policy mechanisms to stimulate and foster a robust domestic market for LCLF, which will see the establishment of a new Australian industry and support local jobs.

“Australia has a compelling advantage in infrastructure, technical expertise and availability of raw materials necessary to develop a domestic renewable fuels capability,” said Matt Halliday, managing director for Ampol. “To take advantage of the opportunity in front of us in standing up a domestic renewable fuels industry requires the right government policy and support, so today’s announcement is very much welcomed and an important step forward.”",https://www.world-grain.com/ext/resources/2025/06/16/Biofuels_SCHARFSINN86---STOCK.ADOBE.COM_e.jpg?height=635&t=1750078921&width=1200,N,,2025-09-18 17:56:29.619243

An interview with Robert Chad, Area Manager who oversees France, Belgium, The Netherlands & Southern Europe (Italy, Greece, Cyprus, and Malta), and all our member airlines in these markets *.

·How has the policy focus evolved in your markets since the pandemic?

Many of the markets witnessed a strong resurgence, which was often referred to as “Travel Revenge”. This is a testimony that people view travel as an essential part of their life. We have seen diverse responses in terms of policy making, fromabusive increased airport charges, and imposed noise restrictions (of whichAmsterdam and Brussels are the most emblematic), to efforts in support ofSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and everything in between. In France, we are witnessing a full spectrum of policies affecting aviation. This includes a 200 million EUR support for Sustainable Aviation Fuel projects, but also the flight ban on routes that can be operated by rail in less than 2h30 (a symbolic measure with little environmental benefit), as well as a significant tax hike. 2025 has also seen a drastic increase of the Solidarity Tax, which further questions the consistency of the government’s approach towards aviation, which is referred to as a “sector of excellence” for the country. But then again, all this is not surprising considering France has boasted five (!) different Transport ministers since the COVID19 pandemic… and we may have a sixth one in the coming days. To that extent, at the end of 2024, we issued and shared a Policy Briefto illustrate the importance of aviation and the necessary steps for the government to take.

·Sustainable Aviation Fuels represent the main solution for the industry to deliver its Fly Net Zero 2050 commitment. What update can you provide, notably on the required sufficient availability and ‘affordable’ pricing, as well as the book and claim system?

All governments in my cluster are now fully aware of this, but responses differ. Some countries have a clear roadmap to reach the 2050 goal, while others are only now setting up decarbonization roundtables to discuss the way forward, and some have neither of these advances in place. From our discussions with policymakers, there is a clear acknowledgement of the need of a Book and Claim system, however some raise the concern of the challenge to effectively control and track the environmental benefit across the process. We need to come up with an optimal solution, as SAF will not be available in all airports, at least not in the coming years. At our last AGM in Delhi, the pricing distortion point was clearly addressed. Many of our members had to pay unreasonable SAF compliance fees due to the current market conditions.

·As of late, we have been witnessing increasing aviation bashing and greenwashing measures from Governments. What actions have you or will you put in place to counter this trend?

The political ‘panic’ response to pressure aviation is risky and can have disastrous effects on the sector and the economy in general. IATA published late last year a series of Value of Aviation reports, which highlight the criticality of the sector for connectivity, economies, and societies. In France, we went one step further by sharing thePolicy Brief with all the Parliament Members to ensure these policymakers acquire a full understanding of the importance of their decisions with regards to our industry.

Airlines are committed to addressing their environmental footprint. This includes “noise”, which is now clear to all policymakers. Unfortunately, after the flight capping at Amsterdam, others such as Brussels have considered following suit, often without applying the necessaryBalanced Approach. Governments should look at the sector with ‘unbiased’ fresh eyes, fully understanding the value and benefits of aviation, the connectivity it provides, and keep in mind that the industry supports 15 of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This would facilitate smarter policymaking, stability and consistency.

·Italy represents a best practice when it comes to accessibility, notably with the ‘One Click Away’ project. How can we ensure other countries follow in its footsteps?

This topic is particularly important to me. People deserve to and must travel in a dignified way. This journey starts at the flight search and booking process. Not one stakeholder in all my cluster disagrees with this affirmation. Authorities must serve as ‘sponsors’ -like Italy with ENAC- enabling and facilitating change through platforms and initiatives. We are making advancement in France, and engaged other countries to follow. Airlines are supportive, and many of them have expanded the ‘One Click Away’ initiative to all their websites! From our side, we are engaging all stakeholders (airlines, authorities, airports, associations of disabled persons, association of travel agents, airports …) to explain the concept and facilitate adoption, and IATA played an active role in theINCLAVI (INCLusive AVIation) project which just concluded.

According to IATA leaders Willie Walsh and Mary Owens Thomsen, SAF could account for up to two-thirds of the required emissions reductions. However, current fuel production levels remain far below what is needed.

“We are disappointed by the pace of SAF production,” emphasized IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “At present, the target of 5% SAF usage by 2030 is unlikely to be met. Focus must be placed on stimulating production, because the shortage is not on the demand side, but on the supply side. Airlines have committed to purchasing fuel, showing that demand exists, but production is lagging.”

The situation in Europe and the UK is particularly concerning, where mandates to include 2% SAF in fuel blends have driven up jet fuel prices but have not significantly increased production.

“The money that could be spent on purchasing SAF is effectively boosting fuel suppliers’ profits — this is unacceptable,” Walsh noted.

IATA Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist Mary Owens Thomsen added that there is a significant gap between the expected returns from traditional oil companies and renewable energy projects.

“In the US, some SAF projects have yielded margins over 20%, whereas renewable energy projects generally achieve about 5%. Government support should focus on renewable energy to scale up production of low-carbon fuels, including SAF,” she said.

IATA emphasizes that aviation must have priority access to feedstocks for SAF production. Walsh pointed out that electrification or hybrid technologies only cover short-haul routes, while around 80% of emissions come from flights over 1,500 kilometers. Even the most efficient modern aircraft still rely on liquid fuel, and their operational lifespan can reach 20–25 years.

Thomsen stressed that there is no shortage of feedstock for SAF production — the main obstacles are technological maturity and commercial readiness. “Without accelerating technology deployment through incentives, even available feedstocks will not translate into the necessary production capacity,” she explained.

Regarding potential adjustments to the net-zero targets amid political instability and climate skepticism, Walsh noted that despite challenges and high transition costs, the industry remains committed to its long-term goals. “The technical feasibility of SAF is resolved; now the focus must be on making it commercially viable for the industry,” he said.

Overall, IATA experts urge governments to actively incentivize SAF production, direct support toward renewable energy rather than the traditional oil sector, and ensure fair access for aviation to feedstocks.

Regulatory pressures, coupled with emerging financial mechanisms, are creating a fertile ground for transformative investments in sustainable aviation.

Regulatory Pressures: A Catalyst for Change

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) remains at the forefront of shaping the industry's environmental agenda. Its Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), established in 2016, aims to cap emissions through carbon credits and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ]. However, the feasibility of CORSIA's targets—particularly a 5% SAF blend by 2030—has been called into question due to supply constraints and high production costs Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ]. The upcoming triennial ICAO assembly in 2025 will likely address these challenges, with a focus on tightening SAF mandates and operational efficiency standards Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ].

Parallel regulatory shifts are emerging at the regional level. The EU Taxonomy for sustainable activities now includes aviation, introducing metrics like the Global Replacement Ratio to curb fleet growth New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, the UK is exploring a principles-based green taxonomy to incentivize investments in hard-to-abate sectors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. These frameworks signal a broader trend: regulators are increasingly tying financial incentives to environmental performance, creating both risks and opportunities for airlines and investors.

Investment Opportunities: Decoding the Sustainable Aviation Ecosystem

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remains the cornerstone of the industry's decarbonization strategy. With the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF is a critical lever for compliance with regulatory mandates Global emissions deal a priority for airlines at UN aviation assembly |[ 1 ]. Yet, its adoption remains nascent, with less than 1% of global jet fuel currently in use despite 73% of airlines having formal uptake plans New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This gap underscores a significant investment opportunity.

Public and private funding mechanisms are accelerating SAF's scalability. Governments, including the U.S. and EU, are deploying grants, tax credits, and subsidies through programs like the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) and the Renewable Energy Directive (RED II) New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Meanwhile, venture capital and private equity firms are stepping in to bridge the innovation gap. Breakthrough Energy Ventures, founded by Bill Gates, has invested in SAF startups such as LanzaTech and Fulcrum BioEnergy, while energy giants like

and are forming strategic partnerships to secure long-term SAF supply chains New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ].

The ICAO's newly launched Finvest Hub further amplifies these efforts by connecting decarbonization projects—particularly SAF production and clean energy infrastructure—with global investors New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. This platform highlights the importance of international collaboration, especially for developing nations, in achieving the industry's 2050 net-zero goals.

Strategic Imperatives for Investors

For investors, the transition to sustainable aviation presents a dual opportunity: mitigating regulatory risks while capitalizing on high-growth sectors. The economic implications of inaction are stark. Studies indicate that airlines could face operational losses if SAF costs are not passed on to passengers, underscoring the need for diversified investment strategies New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Conversely, early adopters of SAF and clean technologies stand to gain first-mover advantages in a market projected to expand exponentially.

However, the path is not without challenges. SAF's current high costs and limited infrastructure require sustained capital inflows and policy support. Investors must also navigate geopolitical uncertainties, such as the EU's stringent emission caps and the UK's evolving regulatory framework New Report: Sustainable Aviation Outlook Report 2025 |[ 2 ]. Diversifying portfolios across SAF producers, clean energy infrastructure, and carbon offset platforms can help mitigate these risks.

Conclusion: A Call for Collaborative Action

As the aviation industry gears up for the 2025 UN Assembly, the imperative to invest in sustainable aviation has never been clearer. Regulatory frameworks are tightening, technological innovations are maturing, and financial mechanisms are aligning to support a low-carbon future. For investors, the challenge lies in balancing short-term costs with long-term gains while navigating a rapidly evolving landscape.

The coming year will be decisive. With ICAO's Finvest Hub, the EU Taxonomy, and private-sector partnerships driving momentum, the time to act is now. By channeling capital into sustainable aviation, investors can not only future-proof their portfolios but also play a pivotal role in reshaping the industry's environmental legacy.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758165806383.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-18 11:56:21.306039

According to Microsoft, the new 5 year agreement “will deliver sustainable AI infrastructure for all of Europe,” to help meet “the exponentially growing demand for efficient, scalable and sustainable AI compute power.”

Microsoft launched a series of “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, including commitments to become carbon negative, water positive and zero waste by 2030, as well as to protect more land than it uses by that date. The company’s carbon footprint has grown since 2020, however, driven largely by significant growth in data centers to meet increasing demand for AI computing power, and earlier this year, Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa acknowledged that the rapid growth of AI has created challenges for the company’s sustainability goals.

In addition to investing heavily in carbon removal solutions, Microsoft has unveiled a series of measures to help address its value chain emissions footprint, including introducing a policy for some of its key suppliers to use 100% carbon-free electricity, and launching a new supplier decarbonization team focused on tackling emissions from cloud and AI operations.

Jon Tinter, President of Business Development and Ventures for Microsoft, said:

“We are incredibly excited for what this means for our customers, in Norway and across Europe, providing the latest and most advanced AI services from Microsoft. It is inspiring to see how Nscale and Aker are building cutting edge, sustainable AI infrastructure, and adding this facility to our comprehensive Microsoft cloud offering in Europe demonstrates our unwavering commitment to customers on the continent.”

The new agreement follows the establishment in July 2025 of a new joint venture between Nscale and Aker to launch “Stargate Norway,” a major AI infrastructure project in Norway, targeting a 100,000 NVIDIA GPUs by the end of 2026, to be powered by renewable energy, and designed to provide secure, scalable, and energy-efficient infrastructure for AI workloads across Europe.

According to the companies, the location of the project was chosen for its abundant hydropower and low local electricity demand, in addition to attributes including the cool climate, and the area’s established industrial infrastructure.

The contract, valued at approximately $6.2 billion, will be delivered in staged deployments beginning in 2026.

Øyvind Eriksen, President & CEO of Aker said:

“This agreement with Microsoft – a long-standing partner to Aker – is a milestone for the joint venture with Nscale and for Norway’s role in enabling sovereign AI infrastructure.

The first production of ‘drop-in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

“Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste,” the government said in a statement.

“Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.”

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

The new production-linked incentive builds on the government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

Viable propulsion

In December last year, Stralis successfully completed a hydrogen-electric powered propeller spin test on Clyde, a registered six-seat Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft at Brisbane Airport.

The process used high-temperature proton exchange membrane (HT-PEM) fuel cells fuelled by green hydrogen and according to Steffen Geries, Chief Operating Officer at Stralis, it is completely emissions-free.

“Hydrogen electric propulsion uses green hydrogen, produced from renewable sources, which combines with oxygen in a fuel cell to create electricity for an electric motor, with water vapour and heat as the only by-products,” Geries said.

On the back of the successful ground testing, the company is now scaling the technology across multiple aircraft platforms.

“The first larger application will be a 15-seat retrofitted Beechcraft aircraft called B1900D-HE, designed to achieve an 800 km range, but our flagship product will be a 50-seat aircraft for regional aviation, capable of a 3000 km range,” Geries said.

“At this scale, hydrogen-electric propulsion offers its strongest performance and economic advantage – significantly undercutting the operating costs of conventional fossil-fuel aircraft in the same category.”

In the longer term, Stralis sees the potential to scale to even larger aircraft, as electric motors become more powerful and fuel cell systems continue to improve. With ongoing advancements, hydrogen-electric propulsion could extend well beyond the regional market, Geries said.

Importantly, the underlying technology isn’t limited to aviation. HT-PEM fuel cells are well-suited for any application that requires high specific power and is sensitive to weight and volume constraints.

“That includes marine vessels, heavy-duty trucking, portable power systems, and other mobility sectors where clean, lightweight and high-output energy is essential.”

Onboard storage

To get to this point, the engineering team has had to overcome one of the toughest challenges in hydrogen aviation: storage.

“Hydrogen in its gaseous form requires substantial volume, which is an issue for aircraft where space and weight are tightly constrained,” Geries said. “We’ve overcome this by storing the hydrogen on board as a cryogenic liquid at -254°C. This significantly improves energy density by volume and enables longer range capability.”

Liquid hydrogen also offers several advantages over battery-electric flight, he added.

“Where batteries add substantial weight and suffer from limited energy density and long charging times, liquid hydrogen is lighter and supports faster turnaround times. Refuelling is performed by pumping liquid hydrogen into onboard cryogenic tanks.”",https://createdigital.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Stralis.jpg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:30.183255

The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices.","After dropping down the priority list for CEOs, sustainability has once again resumed growing in importance for corporate leaders, who now speak less about sustainability, but increasingly tie it to business value, as consumers and B2B buyers reward businesses for providing sustainable products and services, according to a new survey released by global management consultancy Bain & Company.

Among the key trends highlighted by the report is the importance placed by business to business (B2B) buyers on sustainability factors, with half of those surveyed reporting that they currently spend more with sustainable suppliers, and half also planning to drop suppliers that don’t meet sustainability criteria over the next three years.

While last year’s survey found a decline in CEOs’ prioritization in sustainability relative to other topics as companies shifted from a “hype” phase of setting sustainability commitments to the more difficult process of starting initiatives to reach those goals, the new report indicated that the importance of sustainability for CEOs has bottomed out, and increased for the first time in three years.

The resumed increase in sustainability as a CEO priority comes despite an ESG backlash in the headlines, and as executives increasingly view sustainability from a business value perspective. According to Bain’s analysis of more than 35,000 statements made by CEOs over the past several years, there has been a clear shift in business leaders views of sustainability, from a compliance and moral lens, to one focused on aligning sustainability with core business risks and operational factors. The study found, for example, that in 2025, 54% of CEOs linked sustainability to business value, up from only 34% in 2018.

Despite finding that CEOs are speaking less overall about sustainability, the report also found, however, that companies are ramping their sustainability efforts, with 10% of companies increasing their Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) ambitions, for example, compared with only 4% scaling back, and two thirds of companies on track to achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions targets.

Among the 750 B2B companies surveyed for the report, Bain found that the large majority expect sustainability to have a positive impact on their business over the next three years, and that this belief is particularly strong among companies with year-over-year revenue growth greater than that of their peers, with 90% of these companies agreeing, compared with 60% of other respondents.

As B2B companies increasingly see business value in sustainability, their buying behavior is following suit, according to the survey, which found that 49% of companies are already buying more from their more sustainable suppliers, up from 39% last year, and 68% plan to do so over the next three years. Additionally, 26% of respondents are leaving suppliers that don’t meet their sustainability criteria – while this has declined from last year, 49% expect to do so by 2028, according to the survey.

Additionally, the survey found that more than 80% of B2B buyers paid a premium for their most recent purchase of a sustainable product, and that a third are currently willing to pay more than 5% extra for more sustainable products, while 60% expect to do so in three years.

The survey also found a shift in focus for B2B buyers from the sustainability of a supplier’s operations to the sustainability of the supplier’s product offering. The survey found that buyers expect “sustainability of offers” to increase to become the second top purchasing criteria – behind only “quality” – over the next three years, up from fourth place currently, while “sustainability of suppliers’ operations” is expected to remain unchanged in fifth place.

The report also included a survey of more than 14,000 consumers across 8 countries, finding that 79% reported being concerned about environmental sustainability, a slight decline from the prior year. While the large majority remain concerned about sustainability, the survey found that consumers are adopting a wide range of sustainable practices, including 49% reporting lower energy use, 46% recycling, 41% using reusable products, and 38% buying fewer disposable items. Overall, 32% of respondents reported adopting six or more sustainable habits daily, with 70% wanting to adopt more.

The consumer survey identified cost as the primary barrier to adopting more sustainable practices. In the U.S., for example, while consumers reporting that that they are willing to pay up to a 13% premium for sustainable products, Bain cited New York University data finding that there is a 28% average premium for sustainable products.

In the report, Jean-Charles van den Branden, Leader of Bain’s Global Sustainability practice, and François Faelli, Global Head of Capabilities at Bain said:

Led by cornerstone investors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, and joined by International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund signals a major step toward transforming the aviation industry’s fuel supply chain. The initiative marks one of the most significant collective investments in SAF to date, addressing two critical industry challenges: limited availability and high production costs.

Climate Innovation Takes Flight

BEV will act as the fund’s investment manager, bringing its deep technical expertise, rigorous evaluation processes, and a track record of nurturing climate tech startups. The goal: to identify and scale SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions, compete with fossil-based jet fuels on cost, and work seamlessly with today’s aviation infrastructure. “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector’s environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity. The oneworld BEV Fund is built to scale breakthrough SAF technologies with staying power,” said Eric Toone, Chief Technology Officer at Breakthrough Energy and Managing Partner at BEV.

Why SAF Matters Now

Air travel currently accounts for about 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, but demand for aviation is expected to rise in the coming decades. SAF—fuels made from renewable or waste sources—can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. However, SAF still accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel use, and the sector has struggled to attract the scale of investment needed to grow. That’s where this fund steps in. The oneworld BEV Fund will prioritize innovations that are not only cleaner but also cost-effective and scalable, helping to build a diverse and resilient supply chain for aviation fuel in the decades to come.

Collective Action Across Alliances

What’s particularly notable is the cross-alliance collaboration. While oneworld member airlines lead the effort, Singapore Airlines, a Star Alliance member, has also invested in the fund—showcasing an industry-wide recognition of the need for climate action. “Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action,” said Lee Wen Fen, Chief Sustainability Officer at Singapore Airlines. “This investment demonstrates our strong support for driving innovation in next-generation fuels.”

According to Robert Isom, CEO of American Airlines and Chairman of oneworld, the airline and oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices by investing in the SAF technologies of the future.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2023/12/775dcf0a-adobestock_410592669-2100-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-18 08:57:40.508313

American Airlines CEO and oneworld Chairman Robert Isom said:

“We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

According to a recent report by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), however, while SAF production is anticipated to double in 2025, it will still account for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption. Efforts to meaningfully increase the production of SAF face barriers including high initial costs and feedstock challenges.

In its announcement of the new fund, oneworld highlighted some of the challenges facing the first generation of SAF, including insufficient investment to date to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, as well as concerns around lifecycle environmental impact, adding that the partners in the new fund will focus on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

Sustainable aviation future","New funding under the EU Emissions Trading System supports 53 airlines in their transition to sustainable aviation fuels

The European Union has taken the following steps toward greener air travel by allocating approximately €100 million in emissions allowances to support airlines that used Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) in 2024.

This move is part of a bigger effort to accelerate the aviation sector’s shift away from fossil fuels and reduce its overall climate impact.

The funding comes from the EU’s Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), the bloc’s flagship carbon market mechanism, and is aimed at closing the cost gap between traditional fossil-based jet fuel and SAF. SAF is a low-carbon alternative that can be integrated with existing aircraft technology and infrastructure, offering significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle.

New support mechanism for airlines

Under the latest amendment to the EU ETS Directive, a new dedicated support system has been introduced to promote the uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuels . Starting in 2024, the EU set aside 20 million emissions allowances, valued at roughly €1.5 billion, for commercial airlines that use SAF on their flights, subject to carbon pricing under the ETS.

For the first year of the scheme, around 1.3 million allowances, equivalent to approximately €100 million at current carbon prices, were distributed among 53 commercial aircraft operators across the EU. These allowances help offset the additional cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel, making it a more financially viable option for airlines.

More benefits for SAF users

Airlines using Sustainable Aviation Fuels under the ETS framework benefit in two ways. First, they receive free allowances to help cover the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene. Second, emissions from SAF are “zero-rated” under the EU ETS, meaning that airlines do not need to surrender carbon allowances for the emissions associated with the use of SAF.

In 2024, the value of this zero-rating is estimated at around €25 million, adding to the €100 million worth of free allowances granted. Combined, the total incentive for SAF usage under the EU ETS this year reaches approximately €125 million.

This financial boost is designed to encourage more operators to switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuels and to increase overall demand, which could eventually help lower prices through economies of scale and supply chain development.

In addition to direct support through allowances, the EU ETS continues to fund the Innovation Fund, which backs cutting-edge clean technology projects, including those in aviation. This multi-pronged approach aims to drive both immediate adoption of SAF and long-term technological change within the industry.

To maintain transparency and ensure accountability, the European Commission has also published a list of all 53 operators that received allowances, along with the quantities allocated to each. This transparency is intended to build trust in the support system and demonstrate the EU’s commitment to fair and effective climate action.

A new report from the London School of Economics warns that an overwhelming majority of corporate climate transition plans lack credibility, with companies continuing to defer meaningful emissions reductions. The study analyzed disclosures from 2,000 publicly traded firms worth $87 trillion and found that only 2% had shifted capital away from high-carbon assets. Moreover, 22% failed basic climate tests, like emissions reporting. While a whopping 95% of companies acknowledge climate change, only 10% demonstrate actual integration into business operations. The report also highlights a growing gap between policy commitments and implementation, with many firms relying on unproven technologies or excluding scope 3 emissions, which are absolutely critical in measuring the carbon impact of a company’s supply chains.

New report uncovers environmental destruction from Chinese gold mines in DRC

A new report from peace group PAX accuses Chinese miners of illegally extracting gold in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), devastating both the natural environment and communities. Backed by Congolese cooperatives and local governments, semi-industrial operations have scarred over 155 miles of waterways, destroyed farmland, and polluted ecosystems with mercury and cyanide. Industrial mining has been damaging the environment in the DRC since the rise in global demand for critical minerals, and this report reveals that existing protections are proving ineffective. Congolese communities are facing health crises, water shortages, and displacement, with devastating reports of children drowning in abandoned mining pits. Researchers warn that the operations are greatly worsening poverty and violence in the region. China, a top gold consumer, denies sanctioning illegal activity by its nationals.

Airlines invest in $150M sustainable aviation fuel fund

Alaska and American Airlines have invested in a $150 million fund managed by Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, aiming to accelerate next-generation sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Also supported by oneworld alliance members, including IAG, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, and Singapore Airlines, the fund seeks to scale alternatives to fossil jet fuel and slowly cut aviation’s 3% share of global emissions. Current SAF supply represents less than 1% of jet fuel production, and costs remain high. Breakthrough Energy is targeting innovative fuels such as engineered algae and hydrogen-based options to drive down costs and unlock large-scale commercial adoption. The biggest challenge lies in scaling production fast enough to meet demand while overcoming cost barriers that keep SAF uncompetitive with conventional jet fuel.

Trump’s push to scrap quarterly reports gains surprising support from ESG investors

Trump’s call to replace quarterly earnings reports with semi-annual updates has drawn unexpected support from sustainability-focused investors. Advocates argue that quarterly reporting promotes short-termism and distracts management from long-term issues such as climate risks. Many European investors believe that reducing the frequency of reporting cycles could strengthen sustainability strategies without compromising transparency, provided that proper safeguards are in place. Critics, however, warn that the need for such safeguards is exactly why the U.S. may not see the same benefits as the EU, Britain, New Zealand, and Australia. U.S. disclosure rules lack equivalents for profit warnings and continuous updates, raising risks for both investors and sustainability.

Changing the fuel specifications for Jet-A/Jet-A1 could possibly be achieved sooner and with less expense than increasing SAF production.

IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.
In all, ICAO has accepted 14 working papers from IATA for consideration at the assembly.","IATA’s top executives, including Director General Willie Walsh, have outlined the key issues they will raise at the forthcoming 42nd ICAO Assembly in Montreal, with aviation sustainability at the top of their list.

In a pre-brief for media on Sept. 17, Walsh said it was “critical” to secure stronger support for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and for the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (CORSIA) agreement that was established at the 39th ICAO Assembly in 2016. These were “key enablers” of aviation’s commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, Walsh said.

Growing the availability of SAF and making it more affordable have become major goals of IATA in the post-pandemic years, but they also seem increasingly out of reach. Walsh said the problem was “one of supply, not demand,” and he was concerned progress in growing production was not sufficient. Government mandates make fuel companies more profitable rather than putting money into SAF production, a situation Walsh said was “unacceptable.”

IATA will ask ICAO to support its efforts to create a functioning SAF market, step up economic incentives for fuel producers for SAF production, and make policy interventions to address anomalies.

There has been a renewed focus on CORSIA recently after SAF production took center stage from 2021 when aviation’s 2050 goal was agreed to and the quality of some offsetting programs were questioned. But IATA is putting CORSIA front and center at the ICAO Assembly, with Walsh describing it as the most important issue to be addressed. He said the global, market-based measure to address carbon emissions was a “fantastic action” taken in 2016 and needed to be reinforced.

The problem is that states continue to create or augment national and regional aviation taxes and schemes that undercut CORSIA’s credibility. Moreover, only one state, Guyana, has issued CORSIA eligible emissions units (EEUs) which generate climate finance and enable airlines to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA wants ICAO states to reaffirm their commitment to making CORSIA the only economic measure to manage aviation’s climate impact and to make available sufficient CORSIA EEUs for airlines to be able to fulfill their CORSIA obligations.

IATA SVP sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said offsets were a key lever to achieving net zero. CORSIA offsets are related to certified CO2 emissions reduction projects, mostly in developing countries, and airlines directly help finance those projects.

“It’s a really beneficial program for everybody involved and connects obviously with a global carbon market,” Owens Thomsen said. “Together, we’re building the global climate finance infrastructure by promoting and engaging in this program. But the problem is that there are administrative requirements under the Paris agreement that countries are obliged to do. We need to take these credits off the Paris agreements register and make them available for airlines under ICAO’s CORSIA.”

Additionally, states can opt to sell these credits to airlines, to other countries or to keep them, while airlines are obliged to buy them. “This is all very problematic, and we’re trying to make it easier for the states to release these credits in our favor by hook and by crook,” Owens Thomsen said.

Other issues that IATA will raise at the assembly, which runs from Sept. 23 through Oct. 3, include ignoring a potential revision to how an airline’s corporate tax dues are assessed that would upend the long-applied system of basing those taxes on the airline’s resident base.

There are also some safety-based issues that IATA wants addressed, including reinforcing ICAO Annex 13 that requires a final accident report to be filed within a year of the occurrence. Walsh said that in the case of accidents that occurred between 2018 and 2023, about 43% had yet to file a report. “It’s very important to share those reports to ensure these accidents are not repeated,” Walsh said. “It’s very important that states fulfill their obligations under Annex 13.”

IATA will also ask the assembly to increase the maximum pilot age rule for multi-pilot international operations from 65 to 67, while maintaining the requirement that pilots over 60 have medical examinations every six months. He said this was based on evidence and data that it would not bring any safety risks. The pilots’ union ALPA opposes such a move.

For the industry as a whole and for DHL Group in particular, the next decisive step is to advance the electrification of heavy-duty transport and to make aviation cleaner using modern fleets and sustainable aviation fuels.""

The global postal industry's sustainability measures and objectives

Since 2008, postal companies - key players in the global transport and logistics sector - have been working together on sustainability through the introduction of the Environmental Measurement and Monitoring System (EMMS), followed in 2019 by the Sustainability Measurement and Management System (SMMS). These postal operators have reduced their total annual CO2 emissions by one third and have pledged to cut emissions by 50% by 2030.

The sustainable use of resources has long been a priority for the postal sector in its efforts to minimize environmental impact. The industry is focusing on two key areas: ensuring that postal facilities are increasingly run on renewable electricity, and progressively replacing its global fleet of 600,000 vehicles with alternative vehicles powered by cleaner fuels.

In addition, postal operators are working to cut CO2 emissions in the last mile by expanding the use of delivery vehicles with alternative drive systems. Increasingly, the industry is also focusing on heavy goods transport, where decarbonization is critical to reducing environmental impact. Across the sector, more electric vans and trucks are being added to fleets, while alternative fuels are being tested for air freight. Postal companies are also optimizing truck loading and route planning to further shrink their environmental footprint.

Another key focus is reducing the 1.57 million metric tons of Scope 2 emissions produced annually by postal buildings. Expanding the use of renewable energy will be essential to achieving the industry's 2030 climate targets. A number of postal operators are already making use of solar power, with plans to significantly increase this in the coming years.

Sustainability at DHL Group

DHL Group is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from 40 million metric tons of CO2e (as of 2021) to less than 29 million by 2030, based on the Science-Based Targets initiative. This will be achieved through various measures, such as gradually increasing the proportion of sustainable fuels (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) used across the aircraft fleet or biogas for CNG trucks), further electrification of the delivery and road transport fleet, CO2-neutral building design, and emission-reduced product offerings.

The company also made great strides last year: in 2024, the DHL Group used 74 kilotons of sustainable aviation fuel across its own fleet. This corresponds to a blending ratio of 3.5% in its aircraft - the highest proportion across all airlines worldwide. This year, the Group has increased the number of electric delivery vehicles to 35,000 in its German mail and parcel business alone, making it the largest e-fleet in Europe. 40,000 specially installed charging stations ensure that 95% of the electricity used for charging is green, and 450 CNG (biogas) trucks are used for road transport between parcel centers. Photovoltaic systems, heat pumps, and building automation are used at 160 newly built delivery depots, and 195 buildings are equipped with photovoltaics - with a technically available output of approximately 22 MWp.

The scheme is intended to reduce the price disparity between conventional fossil-based kerosene and SAF, which remains significantly more expensive.

By offering free allowances, the EU is providing operators with a cost offset for each tonne of SAF uplifted on flights subject to ETS carbon pricing.

The Commission noted that this measure builds on existing incentives. Airlines already benefit from not having to surrender allowances for SAF use, an advantage worth an additional €25 million this year.

Combined, the direct allocation of allowances and the zero-rating of SAF under the ETS amount to around €125 million in support for 2024.

A long-term framework

This distribution marks the first application of a broader SAF support mechanism introduced in the recent revision of the EU ETS Directive.

The legislation set aside 20 million allowances – valued at around €1.5 billion at current carbon market prices – to be allocated over the coming years.

Officials hope the framework will give airlines greater confidence to invest in SAF contracts, while also stimulating production across the bloc.

The uptake of SAF currently represents less than 1% of aviation fuel consumption in Europe, despite being one of the few viable near-term solutions for reducing sectoral emissions.

Broader climate investment

Beyond the SAF allocation, the EU ETS also channels revenues into the Innovation Fund, which finances a range of clean technology projects, including in aviation.

The Commission underlined that the SAF incentive sits into this broader effort to decarbonise transport and ensure the sector contributes to Europe’s climate neutrality goals.

Industry implications

While the €100 million allocation offers welcome relief to operators facing high fuel costs, industry leaders stress that long-term SAF affordability will depend on scaling up supply.

The EU’s mechanism is therefore seen as a transitional tool, supporting early adopters while helping build a market for sustainable fuels at a commercial scale.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/18/Flight-Emissions-1536x864-1.png,N,,2025-09-18 04:56:08.737373

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy.
These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.
All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?
Strengthening multilateral cooperation The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing.","The year 2025 begins with persistent global geopolitical tensions. The war between Ukraine and Russia drags on, conflict in the Middle East is heating up, and the United States-China trade war continues. All of this could send shockwaves through the global energy market — including in Indonesia.

Indonesia still relies heavily on imported crude oil and natural gas. In 2024, Indonesia spent US$36.28 billion on imported crude oil and natural gas — leaving it highly vulnerable to sudden price hikes caused by war or trade tariffs.

When war broke out in Ukraine in 2022, oil shot past US$100 a barrel — and Indonesia’s subsidy budget ballooned.

These geopolitical tensions should serve as a wake-up call to hasten the transition to renewable energy. Beyond reducing emissions, expanding domestic renewables would cut import dependence and bolster national energy security.

Ironically, Indonesia’s recent diplomacy with the United States (US) has deepened its reliance on imported energy, with President Prabowo Subianto approving US$15 billion (Rp244 trillion) in crude oil and LPG imports in exchange for lower trade tariffs.

These global shocks further expose Indonesia’s deep dependence on imported fossil fuels, making the shift to renewables not just a climate necessity but a strategic imperative for energy security and economic resilience.

Rooftop solar: A quick solution stuck in limbo

Rooftop solar is among the fastest ways to scale up renewable energy. To spur adoption, the government has introduced regulations such as the 2021 rooftop solar grid rule, the 2024 reform and quota regulation, and the 2024 local content rule for solar projects.

However, these regulations have drawn sharp criticism. The 2021 regulation capped the capacity of rooftop solar that could connect to PLN, the state electricity company. Meanwhile, the 2024 quota regulation abolished the net-metering scheme, which had allowed households to offset electricity bills by feeding excess power back into the grid.

These restrictions have discouraged public adoption of rooftop solar, slowing down Indonesia’s progress toward its renewable energy goals.

Australia offers a strong example: it leads the world in rooftop solar adoption through federal subsidies under the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme, complemented by state-level rebates and interest-free loan programs.

As a result, rooftop solar installation costs can be reduced to 70% of market prices, making solar panels affordable for households and small businesses.

Expanding large-scale renewables and infrastructure

Beyond rooftop solar, Indonesia must accelerate large-scale projects like the Cirata Floating Solar Plant, and expand electricity infrastructure for transport and industry.

This is critical given that industry (45.94%) and transport (36.11%) — both account for the bulk of national energy consumption — are still heavily dependent on coal, natural gas, and oil.

Expanding the national grid and building electric vehicle (EV) charging networks are critical for enabling a smooth transition to clean, electricity-based industry and transport.

Scaling up renewable fuel production

Not all sectors can readily switch to electricity; aviation, maritime, and heavy industry will continue to remain reliant on chemical fuels.

Indonesia must also scale up renewable fuel production — including green hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, bioethanol, sustainable aviation fuel, and biodiesel — ensuring they are produced using renewable electricity and sustainable feedstocks, while avoiding deforestation by prioritising waste-based sources.

PLN has begun developing a hydrogen supply chain for industry and fuel-cell vehicles — one of its largest initiatives is the Garuda Green Hydrogen (GH2), a partnership with Saudi energy giant ACWA Power, set to operate in 2026. The hydrogen will be converted into ammonia to support Indonesia’s domestic fertiliser industry.

Other hydrogen projects underway include Gresik Green Hydrogen (ACWA Power and Pupuk Indonesia), Jambi Green Hydrogen (Sembcorp and Transgasindo), Kujang Green Ammonia (Pupuk Indonesia and Fortescue Future Industries), and East Sumba Solar/Fuel Cell (HDF Energy). All projects are scheduled to begin operations between 2026 and 2027.

Indonesia has also begun producing sustainable aviation fuels. State-owned oil company Pertamina’s Cilacap Refinery started output of Bioavtur J2.4 in 2021 — a 2.4% palm oil-based blend with fossil jet fuel — with a capacity of 9,000 barrels per day. The technology was developed by Pertamina Research and Technology Innovation (RTI) and Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) since 2010.

Pertamina is also developing new facilities to produce sustainable fuels — including gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel from used cooking oil — at its refineries in Cilacap, Plaju, and Sungai Gerong.

All this demonstrates that Indonesia has both the capacity and resources to advance renewable energy — so why does it still lean so heavily on imports?

Strengthening multilateral cooperation

The biggest challenge in Indonesia’s energy transition is financing. To address this, Indonesia must strengthen multilateral cooperation, particularly with its Asia-Pacific neighbours, including ASEAN members and Australia.

Incentives like tax holidays can draw in foreign investors, while streamlined licensing reforms will ease the flow of foreign capital.

Funding could also be mobilised through partnerships with global institutions such as the Quad coalition (Australia, India, Japan, and the United States), the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and the World Bank.

Indonesia has also agreed to export 3.4 GW of clean electricity to Singapore until 2035, backed by US$30-50 billion in solar investments, plus another US$2.7 billion for solar panel and battery manufacturing.

The program is projected to generate US$4-6 billion in annual foreign exchange revenue.

Pertamina has also supplied SAF to Virgin Australia during the Bali International Air Show on September 18-19, 2024.

By prioritising three key actions — accelerating electrification, advancing renewable fuels, and strengthening multilateral cooperation — Indonesia has a major opportunity to fast-track its energy transition.

Stronger energy security would not only protect Indonesia from global shocks but also lay the foundation for sustainable economic growth in the decades to come.",https://images.theconversation.com/files/686256/original/file-20250819-56-cgbipo.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C793%2C9504%2C4752&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-18 02:56:12.376722

The grant enables Altalto to integrate NX Circular™ gasification and NX CPO™ technology from NEXTCHEM with Velocys’ proven MicroFTL™ technology, strengthening its position as the most advanced municipal solid waste-to-SAF project in the UK—and globally.

Altalto is designed to produce 30 million litres (23kT) of sustainable aviation fuel annually from residual waste streams, enough to power over 500 London–New York flights per year.

Once operational, the project will deliver more than 100,000 tonnes of CO₂-equivalent savings annually, support the circular economy by diverting waste from landfill and incineration, and create hundreds of jobs in the Humber region.

The project now has planning consent, strong government support, and selected technology partners across the full value chain, including waste sourcing, gasification, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and fuel upgrading.

We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president: • Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.
• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998.","Across America’s heartland, corn farmers have begun to bring in a record harvest—only to face some of the lowest prices in years. They’ve done their job; now Washington needs to do its part. Outdated federal rules—like obsolete pump labeling and unnecessary equipment certifications—are suppressing demand for ethanol and, by extension, undercutting a new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.

The clearest way to boost crop demand is to expand access to higher ethanol blends, especially E15. Nationwide, year-round E15 availability could create demand for over 2 billion bushels of corn and sorghum, while saving consumers 10–30 cents per gallon at the pump. That’s why we need Congress to pass the Nationwide Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act this fall, which would finally put E15 fuel regulations on a level playing field with E10.

But the need for legislative action goes beyond that. In August, a bipartisan group of senators and representatives introduced the Ethanol for America Act. This bill would require the EPA to finalize a long-stalled rule—first proposed in January 2021—to modernize E15 labeling and equipment standards. Originally proposed at the end of the first Trump administration, the rule sat idle under President Biden. It includes commonsense steps: updating or removing E15 pump labels, allowing flexibility in underground storage tank requirements and ensuring future fuel infrastructure is compatible with higher ethanol blends.

Finalizing this rule should be an easy win—and we urge policymakers and the administration to get the job done as soon as possible. In 2024, President Trump said gas stations should be able to “use the existing pumps” for E15. We agree, and recommended these steps in a recent letter to the president:

• Eliminate E15 Misfueling Mitigation Plan requirements.

• Establish a presumption of E15 compatibility for all fuel dispensers, underground storage tank systems, and hanging hardware installed after 1998.

We think SAF before 2029 is achievable, indeed needed, with the right will and sense of urgency.
“A local Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry has the potential to create significant economic benefit for regional Australia, enhance our domestic fuel security and support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector,” said Fiona Messent, Qantas’ chief sustainability officer.","“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net-zero targets,” said Acting Transport and Infrastructure Minister Murray Watt.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Government figures show that Australia currently exports around $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimating a domestic low-carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 and deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2-e in cumulative emissions reduction.

According to Treasurer Jim Chalmers, the economic benefits of low-carbon fuels are about “making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation”.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains. This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia,” he said.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

The aviation industry has welcomed the announcement, with companies such as Jet Zero Australia, Airbus, and Qantas all offering their support.

“As a company focused on bringing the regions to the runway with SAF, we are extremely excited about this new funding support and what it means for our most advanced project, Project Ulysses,” said Jet Zero CEO Ed Mason.

“We have seen voices supporting SAF broaden to include Defence and agricultural bodies such as the National Farmers Federation, Canegrowers and Grains Australia.”

Stephen Forshaw, Airbus chief representative for Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific, said the government should also now look at demand-side policies, including a SAF blending mandate.

“We know Australia has the feedstock. The industry has been waiting for the right policy signals from the Government, and this very significant supply-side support package amounts to take-off clearance for producers and those who are weighing the opportunity to produce here,” he said.

“We welcome the Government engaging in an industry consultation process to determine how the scheme should be implemented, and hope this can be done quickly. We think SAF before 2029 is achievable, indeed needed, with the right will and sense of urgency.

“Australia will win from this policy. The creation of thousands of new jobs in regional Australia, and the improvement of our fuel security position as a nation are key reasons why this policy is good for the country.”

Qantas, which also backs SAF projects in concert with Airbus and has so far committed around $100 million, says it “looks forward to continued collaboration with Government and industry as part of further consultation processes”.

“A local Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) industry has the potential to create significant economic benefit for regional Australia, enhance our domestic fuel security and support the decarbonisation of the aviation sector,” said Fiona Messent, Qantas’ chief sustainability officer.

“Qantas invests in a number of local SAF initiatives and projects, enabled by our $400 million Climate Fund, with this announcement another step toward establishing a thriving SAF industry in Australia and seizing Australia’s unique low carbon liquid fuels opportunity.”

Virgin Australia has also welcomed the news, with chief corporate affairs and sustainability officer Christian Bennett saying the move “recognises the critical role that sustainable aviation fuel can play in aviation’s decarbonisation journey”.

“As the policy landscape further develops, our focus remains squarely on least cost decarbonisation and ensuring that sustainable fuels, which are currently around 3-5 times more expensive than

It also accelerated the retrofit of so-called ‘scimitar’ winglets to its Boeing 737-800NG fleet, modifications that reduce fuel use as well as aircraft noise. It is targeting 409 such installations by 2026.

Elsewhere, in January of this year, Ryanair commenced the procurement of a 2% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend at airports across the EU and UK.

‘Align with global efforts’

‘Ryanair is committed to ensuring that the Group’s operations align with global efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change,’ the company said in the report. ‘To facilitate this, the Group developed a comprehensive Climate Transition Plan that outlines the Group’s approach to reducing carbon emissions through fleet renewal and new technologies, promoting the scaling and use of SAF, and prioritising action on climate change across our business.’

Also in the 2025 financial year, Ryanair extended its funding partnership with Trinity College Dublin’s Sustainable Aviation Research Centre to 2030, with an additional €2.5 million commitment. The partnership supports research into SAF, zero-carbon propulsion, and non-CO₂ emissions.

During the year, Ryanair retained ESG ratings of A from MSCI, A- from CDP, and continued to rank first among global large-cap airlines by Sustainalytics. In addition, its near-term emissions reduction targets were validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and are classified as being in line with a 1.5ºC trajectory.

Pathway to Net Zero

Looking ahead, Ryanair noted that its board has ultimate oversight and responsibility over its climate transition plan, adding that its Pathway to Net Zero strategy remains a pillar of its overall strategy.

‘The Group recognises that transition risk costs will arise,’ it added. ‘The Group has a strong history in maintaining a young, fuel-efficient fleet. Any breakthrough in new technology engines will be procured as part of ongoing fleet renewal and is not expected to be outside the normal course of fleet renewal.

‘Additionally, while SAFs currently trade at a premium of 3x – 4x compared to the cost of normal jet kerosene, the long-term outlook is for price convergence.’

Elsewhere, in terms of safety, Ryanair launched a new five-year Safety Strategy in December of last year, focusing on managing growth across the Group’s airlines, integrating the Boeing 737 MAX-10 into operations, and aligning with new EU cybersecurity regulations.

The fund has raised an initial $150 million through contributions from American, Alaska, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, IAG and Singapore Airlines.

American and Alaska describe themselves on 17 September as “cornerstone investors” and new partners with Breakthrough Energy Ventures, a fund founded by Bill Gates and other billionaires in 2016 to support less-pollutive energy technologies.

The fund will support next-generation SAF production, as well as growth of “alternative fuel markets” and supply chains to meet the airline sector’s projected long-term demand, according to the Oneworld carriers.

American chief executive Robert Isom says that establishing the SAF fund with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is a “business decision”, framing the adoption of alternative fuels as a route to cutting operational costs and reaching larger scale.

”We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come,” Isom says.

Ben Minicucci, Alaska’s CEO, says that Breakthrough Energy Ventures will provide “scientific, technical and commercial expertise” to make strategic decisions that will “create the market for next-generation fuels”.

The fund will seek to support early-growth companies that could potentially discover more-efficient and cost-effective SAF production methods, and help those companies deliver scalable products.

An array of start-ups are exploring innovative production pathways, such as making SAF from used cooking oils and municipal waste.

Current SAF technology has so far yielded lacklustre industry uptake, with such fuel making up a tiny fraction of global jet fuel burn. Industry consensus is that SAF remains expensive and in short supply, with global airline executives expressing desire for greater access to it.

SAF also comes along with land-use concerns, especially if feedstock such as corn is used as jet fuel rather than feeding populations. Highly touted climate benefits are also questionable, as it burns cleaner than conventional jet fuel but still releases carbon dioxide into Earth’s upper atmosphere.

But with Airbus and Boeing unlikely to launch more-efficient, next-generation commercial aircraft platforms before the mid-2030s, SAF remains the airline sector’s most immediate hope for curbing air pollution.

Notably, Alaska Air Group has a target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, 10 years ahead of the industry-wide target of 2050.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/6/6/2/112662_shutterstock_1439488982_576586.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 16:56:10.907936

Delta’s Sustainability Push According to Delta, Maeve is the airline’s fifth “revolutionary fleet” partner helping it study new airframes, fuel reduction strategies, and alternative fuels such as SAF.
The system is being optimized for regional aircraft, “though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline,” Delta said.","In a bid to reduce fuel consumption, Delta Air Lines is supporting the development of a hybrid-electric regional airliner.

The airline—which, like much of the aviation industry, aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050—on Wednesday revealed it partnered with Dutch developer Maeve Aerospace to help make the company’s Maeve Jet 500 commercially viable for regional missions. Maeve claims the design will reduce fuel consumption and emissions by 40 percent using conventional fuel. Those savings could be even higher, up to 95 percent, with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In a news release, Delta described the hybrid-electric concept as a “first-of-its-kind interpretation of a regional aircraft that brings the economics and comfort of a narrowbody aircraft to short-haul operations.”

“As we work toward the next generation of aircraft, we look to partners like Maeve who embody the bold, forward-thinking innovation we champion at Delta,” said Kristen Bojko, Delta’s vice president of fleet.

The exclusive partnership with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab cements the carrier as Maeve’s North American global airline partner. It comes just days after SkyWest, one of its regional affiliates, took an equity stake in Maeve in exchange for exclusive launch customer rights.

Delta also contracts with Republic Airways—which in June agreed to take delivery of Beta Technologies’ all-electric CX300—and is the sole owner of regional carrier Endeavor Air. Endeavor’s fleet comprises CRJ-700 and CRJ-900 aircraft from MHI RJ, which is also supporting the Maeve Jet’s development.

The Dutch company’s design approximates the CRJ-900, which can accommodate up to 90 passengers, cruise at Mach 0.82, and cover 1,550 nm. By comparison, the Maeve Jet is designed for up to 100 passengers, with a Mach 0.75 cruise speed and range of 1,450 nm with 76 passengers. At full capacity, its range declines to about 950 nm—still robust enough for trips between Chicago and Los Angeles.

The model uses a five-abreast seating configuration—atypical for a regional jet—that can be reconfigured for multiple classes. It is expected to consume about 5.5 gallons of fuel per seat on 500 nm trips. Compared to existing jets, Maeve says it will achieve 20 percent lower operating costs on those missions.

These capabilities are enabled by a few key features. Propulsion comes from a pair of rear fuselage-mounted hybrid-electric powerplants from Pratt & Whitney Canada. The engines are coupled with a swirl reduction system that enables a smaller rotor diameter and reduced cabin noise.

Moving the propulsion system to the tail allows Maeve to use a low-wing configuration. The wing itself features a high aspect ratio, which per Maeve significantly reduces fuel and is “optimised for short range missions and better take off field performance compared to current jets.”

Beyond Delta and SkyWest, the developer has an agreement with Japan Air Lines to further support the Maeve Jet’s development and study its operational requirements in Japan.

Delta’s Sustainability Push

According to Delta, Maeve is the airline’s fifth “revolutionary fleet” partner helping it study new airframes, fuel reduction strategies, and alternative fuels such as SAF.

In March, for example, it partnered with blended-wing body (BWB) aircraft developer JetZero to study a design it believes will be 50 percent more fuel efficient than existing midrange aircraft. Competitor United Airlines has also invested in JetZero and could order up to 200 BWB aircraft.

Delta is exploring electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) air taxi services in New York and Los Angeles in partnership with Joby Aviation. United and Southwest Airlines have similar partnerships with air taxi developer Archer Aviation.

The carrier works closely with manufacturing titans Airbus and Boeing. It has been a key partner in the former’s ZeroE hydrogen commercial aircraft project since 2022 and this year partnered with its UpNext innovation lab.

Airbus, in exchange, supports the Sustainable Skies Lab and is backing Delta’s Minnesota SAF hub. Delta is also part of the coalition supporting NASA and Boeing’s X-66 Sustainable Technology Demonstrator. Boeing in April proposed a simple, thin-wing design for the X-66, which was originally intended to feature a transonic truss-braced wing.

The Sustainable Skies Lab on Wednesday also partnered with Texas-based Green Taxi Solutions to develop taxiing technology for electric aircraft. The goal is to reduce fuel use, operating costs, taxi time, and emissions. The system is being optimized for regional aircraft, “though the vision extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline,” Delta said.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/maeve_hero.png,N,,2025-09-17 15:56:40.640570

Start with curiosity Curiosity begins with active listening.
When someone challenges our ideas, it’s easy to see it as a personal attack, which causes us to react emotionally to defend ourselves.
It’s hard to change opinions and win arguments if you’re not genuinely interested in finding a solution.
Curiosity can spark discussion when we aim to change opinions and win arguments.","Much of the FBI Academy training focused on immersing new agents, like myself, in controlled exercises where failure was expected. Our responses to these failures helped develop the mental skills necessary to recover when facing the unknown. During these exercises, we often lost critical resources that we relied on to succeed or reach our goals.

I learned to develop skills that would help me navigate through change and chaos. Leaders need these same skills because they face similar real-world challenges — the failure of established procedures or the emergence of innovative competitors that require leaders to be flexible and strategic.

Often, this requires re-examining long-held opinions about how to do business and interact with people. Mental agility isn’t just about being quick-minded — it’s about being able to pivot and stay resilient; in other words, to learn continuously about our environment. The best way to know more about our environment is to be curious.

Curiosity is crucial for changing opinions because it promotes open-minded exploration and reduces defensiveness. When we’re curious, we’re more willing to ask questions, seek new information and listen actively instead of judging or dismissing.

We live in a time where disagreements can feel like a battle for moral high ground. Curiosity is a vital tool that transforms a challenge from a threat into an opportunity for learning and growth. Curiosity allows us to adapt our behavior and change our strategy based on new feedback. It also helps us to make sound strategic decisions quickly in rapidly changing conditions.

1. Start with curiosity

Curiosity begins with active listening. In the book The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, Stephen R. Covey emphasizes the importance of listening as a crucial skill when trying to influence others.

Genuinely listen to and acknowledge the other person’s perspective. Repeat what you believe they said. This prevents confusion and demonstrates that you understand their viewpoint, which can lower their defenses and create a more open environment. Test their arguments by asking questions, but not in a confrontational way. If you need to challenge each other, focus on a battle of ideas, not egos.

Approach the conversation with a calm mindset. Show vulnerability if needed — this actually makes you more relatable and softens the other person’s stance. Start by agreeing with something in their viewpoint, even if you don’t agree with the entire position. This fosters a sense of connection and makes them more receptive to new ideas. It’s not about backing down or sacrificing your stance. It’s about building enough trust for someone even to consider changing theirs.

Rather than arguing with them, ask thoughtful questions that encourage introspection and help them see inconsistencies or reconsider their stance over time.

My tip: Use the word “because” when giving reasons, as studies show people are more persuaded when a rationale is provided, even if it’s a simple one.

2. Use stories

People seldom respond only to facts. Beliefs are connected to identity, emotion and a need for internal harmony. We hold on to familiar viewpoints because they help us feel safe and connected to our communities. That’s why confrontation often fails: when someone feels judged, they stop listening.

Stories serve two purposes. First, they grab your audience’s attention and evoke empathy. When you need to connect emotionally and make your message relatable, stories help simplify complex ideas and build a connection with your audience.

Second, stories encourage people to become curious about your values and mindset. Use a story to engage your audience and help them understand the impact of your perspective.

To persuade others, you need to address their feelings, communicate your reasons clearly and demonstrate that you’re worth listening to.

My tip: Storytelling works best when it creates emotional engagement. But avoid using stories to hide facts you’re unsure of — this could backfire if the facts are scrutinized.

3. Stick to facts, not emotions

One of the biggest obstacles to reaching an agreement in arguments is letting our emotions take control. When someone challenges our ideas, it’s easy to see it as a personal attack, which causes us to react emotionally to defend ourselves. At the same time, our emotions can also block our judgment and make it harder to understand the other person’s perspective.

This is when it’s crucial to stick to facts because we tend to think that we know more about an issue than we actually do. The illusion of explanatory depth (IOED) is the belief that we understand more about the world than we actually do. It’s often not until someone asks us to explain a concept that we realize our limited understanding of it.

Ask the other person where they obtained their information so you can verify the accuracy of their opinion. Ask them to explain how the policy they were advocating would function. Then, ask them to trace, step by step, from start to finish, the causal path from the policy to the effects it was supposed to produce. People who are asked to provide explanations often soften their views because they are less certain in their support or opposition to the policy.

It’s hard to change opinions and win arguments if you’re not genuinely interested in finding a solution. Agree on what a successful resolution looks like, and stay focused on that goal. When you know your ideal outcome, you’re more likely to work toward finding the best answer.

My tip: Facts are most effective when the evidence is strong and the audience values logic and clarity.

Curiosity can spark discussion when we aim to change opinions and win arguments. This approach works best when we provide reasons alongside questions, share stories to foster emotional connection and rely on facts while asking others to explain their reasoning. It reveals gaps in understanding and helps soften rigid opinions.

With international travel rebounding post-pandemic and carbon emissions rising, the urgency to decarbonize has never been greater. At the 2023 ICAO Assembly, member states reached a landmark agreement to reduce aviation's carbon intensity by 5% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, primarily through the accelerated adoption of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and other low-carbon technologiesICAO agrees a global framework and emissions goal[ 1 ]. This framework, known as CAAF/3, has transformed SAF from a niche innovation into a central pillar of the industry's energy transition. For investors, the implications are clear: the next decade will demand unprecedented investment in SAF infrastructure, policy alignment, and technological scaling.

The Global Framework and Its Investment Imperatives

The CAAF/3 agreement outlines four “building blocks” for decarbonization: policy and planning, regulatory frameworks, implementation support, and financingICAO CAAF/3 framework[ 2 ]. Central to this is the creation of the ICAO Finvest Hub, a platform designed to connect decarbonization projects with public and private capital, particularly for developing nationsICAO Finvest Hub[ 3 ]. This initiative underscores the recognition that SAF infrastructure cannot be built by market forces alone. Governments and multilateral institutions must bridge the gap between aspirational targets and tangible progress.

The urgency is further amplified by the stark mismatch between current SAF production and projected demand. According to the CleanBridge Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel 2025 report, only 22 SAF plants are operational globally, with a pipeline of 144 projects. Yet, as of June 2025, only seven of these projects have reached final investment decision (FID), and just one new project secured FID in the past six monthsOnly 1 In 20 SAF Projects Is Moving Forward Globally[ 4 ]. This glacial pace of development highlights the critical need for policy intervention and financial innovation.

Regional Hotspots and Strategic Investment Opportunities

The United States and the Middle East are emerging as pivotal regions for SAF infrastructure. In the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has catalyzed a wave of public-private partnerships. The Biden-Harris administration recently allocated $291 million in grants under the Fueling Aviation's Sustainable Transition (FAST) program, including $16.8 million to

Similarly, Infinium's Project Roadrunner in Texas, backed by $935 million in debt financing, aims to produce 23,000 tons of e-SAF annuallyUS scales up SAF with major developments[ 6 ]. These projects are part of a broader U.S. to leverage its 40% share of global biofuel production to dominate the SAF marketSupply and Development Pipeline GSAF2025[ 7 ].

The Middle East, meanwhile, is leveraging its solar energy abundance and low-cost feedstock to position itself as a global SAF hub.

However, progress remains uneven. While the UAE and Saudi Arabia have made strides, regulatory frameworks and domestic demand for SAF are still nascent, creating both risks and opportunities for investors willing to engage earlyGlobal aviation to cut 5% emissions by 2030 via SAF: ICAO[ 9 ].

Europe, though ahead in regulatory maturity, faces its own challenges. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a 2% SAF blend by 2025, but existing production capacity is insufficient to meet this targetFunding and Investment Ecosystem GSAF2025 | CleanBridge[ 10 ]. Neste, the world's largest SAF producer, is expanding its facilities in Finland, but the continent's reliance on imported feedstock and the lack of harmonized cross-border infrastructure remain hurdlesNeste’s SAF production[ 11 ].

Financing the Transition: Mechanisms and Market Dynamics

The SAF investment ecosystem is increasingly diverse, blending public grants, private equity, and innovative financial instruments. In the U.S., the IRA's tax credits for SAF producers have attracted venture capital firms like Breakthrough Energy Ventures, which is backing advanced biofuel technologiesBreakthrough Energy Ventures and SAF[ 12 ]. Green bonds and sustainability-linked loans are also gaining traction, with projects like LanzaJet's Ethanol-to-Jet facility in Georgia illustrating how environmental performance metrics can attract capitalLanzaJet’s Ethanol-to-Jet facility[ 13 ].

However, the sector's reliance on subsidies raises questions about long-term viability. As noted by

, SAF demand is projected to outpace supply by 2030, necessitating strategic financing to close the gapWith SAF demand on track to outpace supply, strategic financing of new capacity can close the gap[ 14 ]. This is where the ICAO Finvest Hub and similar platforms could play a transformative role, particularly in developing economies where access to capital remains a barrierICAO Finvest Hub[ 15 ].

Challenges and the Path Forward

Despite the momentum, several challenges persist. First, the slow pace of project execution—only 5% of global SAF projects reaching FID—reflects the sector's dependence on policy certainty and feedstock availabilityOnly 1 In 20 SAF Projects Is Moving Forward Globally[ 16 ]. Second, airlines' demand for SAF far exceeds current production, creating a “chicken-and-egg” dilemma where producers hesitate to scale without guaranteed off-take agreementsSustainable Aviation Fuels Need a Faster Takeoff | BCG[ 17 ]. Third, the lack of standardized accounting systems for SAF credits complicates cross-border participation, particularly for smaller operatorsICAO CAAF/3 framework[ 18 ].

To overcome these hurdles, governments must accelerate regulatory clarity and expand incentives. For investors, the key lies in diversifying portfolios across regions and technologies. While bio-SAF remains the most commercially viable option today, e-SAF (synthetic fuels produced via green hydrogen) and waste-to-fuel technologies represent high-growth opportunities, albeit with higher capital intensitySAF Investment Trends - netzeroinsights.com[ 19 ].

Conclusion

The decarbonization of aviation is no longer a distant aspiration but an urgent imperative. The CAAF/3 framework has set the stage for a global transition, but its success hinges on the ability of investors, policymakers, and industry leaders to collaborate. For those willing to navigate the complexities of this nascent market, the rewards are substantial: not only in financial returns but in shaping a sustainable future for global mobility. As the sector moves from promise to practice, the next five years will determine whether aviation can truly take off into a cleaner era.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758131281864.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-17 14:56:33.782507

ClimaHtech Green Flight, a wholly owned subsidiary of CATAGEN, will produce SAF using patented modular reactor technology powered by off-grid renewable and low-carbon electricity. This decentralised approach means production can continue even during grid disruptions, offering greater resilience and flexibility.

Unlike traditional SAF projects that rely on large centralised facilities, ClimaHtech’s modular production units are designed to be manufactured off-site and quickly deployed close to renewable energy sources or directly at airports. This allows fuel to be made where it’s needed most, with minimal infrastructure delays.

Each unit will use an industrial waste stream and renewable power to produce up to 1 million litres of SAF annually. The fuel offers a more than 90% reduction in emissions from production to flight, compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

As part of the launch, CATAGEN announced strategic partnerships with Ryanair and Shell Aviation, who have signed offtake agreements to support the production and use of this next-generation sustainable fuel.

Steven Fitzgerald, Ryanair director of sustainability & finance, explained: “Progressing towards our sustainability goals depends on securing scalable and affordable SAF.

""CATAGEN’s decentralised SAF model allows production to be brought closer to demand, enabling faster deployment and reducing the bottlenecks that slow down traditional SAF projects. We see this as a critical pathway to reducing our emissions while continuing to deliver affordable travel.”

Ken McHutcheon, supply & operations manager, Shell Aviation Ireland, continued: “Shell Aviation is committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel, but the industry needs both volume and speed. CATAGEN’s decentralised, modular approach provides a new way of producing SAF that can complement centralised facilities, shorten timelines, and provide more flexible access to fuel. This model has the potential to reduce reliance on imported SAF, increase energy independence, unlock new markets and accelerate the industry’s journey to net zero.”

Mel Courtney, CEO ClimaHtech Green Flight, added: “The UK has a mandate to have 10% of flights using SAF by 2030, with the EU having a 70% target by 2050. On current supply, these targets are ambitious, with the International Air Transport Association currently estimating demand surpassing 360 million tonnes by 2050, up from 1 million tonnes that were available in 2024.

“To reach these targets, we need technologies that can be scaled up alongside the development of surrounding infrastructures around airports. In the UK, challenges around energy security have been made clear, hence the push from government to increase our use of renewables in the grid. Our approach to SAF should match this approach and be accessible to the market where it is needed to be deployed.

“The launch of ClimaHtech Green Flight is the next step in our plan to decarbonise the aviation industry.”

CATAGEN was the first company to submit a SAF sample to the EU SAF Clearing House in 2024 and is progressing through fast-track certification on the ASTM D7566 Annex A1 approved pathway. The company’s pre-production units, supported by the UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, are already operational.

CATAGEN’s first-of-a-kind (FOAK) SAF production system will reach commercial operation in a short time horizon, producing 1 million litres of SAF per year. With these offtake partnerships in place, CATAGEN is now positioned to scale a network of decentralised production units worldwide, offering production sites up to 10 million litres.","https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmM4OGM4MjFkLTY3NzYtNGQ2NS05NjAyLWE3MDUzYjQwMGQyMzpjMmE4NjgyOS1iZTM4LTRjNDQtYjM2OC1mOTIwMTQzNTI0YWU=.jpg?width=640&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-09-17 13:56:14.825241

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called on governments to use the 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), which begins in Montreal on 23 September, to deliver concrete support for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and to safeguard the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the industry’s agreed global climate framework.

IATA said ICAO has accepted 14 working papers from the airline association for the Assembly, which will set the organisation’s work programme for the next three years. While the submissions cover a wide range of safety, regulatory, and operational topics, IATA made clear that accelerating decarbonization is its overriding priority.

Walsh: “SAF is absolutely critical” to net zero targets

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, expressed urgency in addressing the SAF cost and supply gap during a press briefing ahead of the Assembly.

“SAF is absolutely critical to the industry achieving its net zero CO₂ emissions by 2050,” he said “We’re disappointed at the progress made in relation to production. It’s not where we need it to be … the problem, as we see it, is one of supply and not one of demand.”

IATA warned that current SAF mandates in the EU and UK have raised costs without significantly increasing production, and urged states to instead support the creation of a functioning SAF market through direct incentives for fuel producers and timely policy interventions to remove market anomalies.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s SVP Sustainability and Chief Economist, said policy support is vital to close the return-on-investment gap between renewable and fossil energy.

“This is not a shortfall of demand — there’s a shortfall of expected returns in renewable energy… oil companies might earn 20% returns, renewable energy might earn 5%. We need policymakers to help us bridge that 15-point gap,” she said.

Owens Thomsen noted that under the US Inflation Reduction Act, some SAF projects have reached profit margins above 20%, showing that “it’s entirely possible if the right policies are in place.”

Reaffirming CORSIA’s role in a sustainable future for aviation

IATA is also pressing governments to recommit to CORSIA as the sole global economic measure to manage aviation’s carbon emissions. The scheme, adopted at ICAO’s 39th Assembly in 2016, could generate up to $17 billion in climate finance by 2035—but its credibility is being undermined, IATA warned, by the spread of overlapping national and regional aviation taxes.

“CORSIA was a fantastic achievement, but we need to see that agreement turned into practice,” Walsh said. “As of today, only one country, Guyana, has made available to the industry what we call CORSIA Eligible Units… these are critical to enable the industry to fulfil its obligations.”

Owens Thomsen emphasised that these certified offset units are “the gold standard” in carbon markets and deliver socio-economic co-benefits in developing countries, but that states are slow to release them due to administrative burdens and competing claims under the Paris Agreement.

“States have optionality, but airlines have an obligation to buy them,” she said. “That is very problematic.”

Other IATA priorities for the ICAO Assembly

Beyond SAF and CORSIA, IATA is also pushing for progress on several other regulatory and safety priorities, including:

Airline Taxation: urging states to reject a proposed shift to source-based corporate taxation under the UN’s Model Tax Treaty, which IATA argues could create significant administrative burdens and risk double taxation

Consumer Protection: calling for alignment with ICAO’s Core Principles to avoid what IATA describes as a growing patchwork of national passenger rights rules

Radio Spectrum: protecting aviation-critical frequencies, such as the 4.2–4.4 GHz band for radio altimeters, from 5G/6G interference

Accident Investigations: ensuring timely publication of final reports under ICAO Annex 13 (only 57% of 2018–2023 accidents currently have public final reports)

GNSS Interference: coordinating military and civil authorities to mitigate rising jamming and spoofing incidents

Aircraft Mandates: creating a mechanism to set realistic implementation timelines for ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices (SARPs)

Pilot Age Limits: raising the retirement age for multi-pilot international operations from 65 to 67, while maintaining safety safeguards

Walsh said the Montreal meeting is a pivotal opportunity to align governments on common global standards.

“Everybody wants flying to be safe, efficient and more sustainable,” he said. “The coming weeks in Montreal are essential to set the agenda, but even more important is the following three years of work to achieve what is agreed.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/United-SAF-subsidy-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-09-17 13:56:19.370320

The mandate was officially enforced on 1 January 2025, and requires fuel suppliers to ensure a minimum of 2% of their jet fuel is sustainable. This will rise to 22% by 2040 in an effort to reduce harmful emissions released into the atmosphere.

Initially introduced by the Conservative administration in 2022; the Labour government reaffirmed the previous party’s commitment to the mandate upon its coming to power in 2024, introducing its own Revenue Certainty Mechanism (RCM), which aims to reduce the risks of transitioning to SAF production for new companies.

As we reach the latter end of 2025, the question now is: how far has the industry come during the first nine months of the mandate?

Independent Efforts

With the mandate now fully in place, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a number of new initiatives launched by the UK government, as well as a few solutions offered by airports and bodies themselves.

In January, London Stansted Airport, in collaboration with Cambridge Cleantech, announced that it would begin exploring opportunities for its own production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the East of England.

Announced at a roundtable event attended by speakers from a range of organisations including Jet2, SSE, LanzaTech and Innovate UK; Stansted’s efforts to produce its own SAF would leverage the East of England’s existing infrastructure, with the region forecasted to contribute 10.2 billion GBP in economic value and create over 60,000 green jobs by 2050.

March saw Farnborough Airport (FAB) announce intentions to produce & provide roughly 10,000 tonnes of SAF from local waste sources each year, 12.5 million litres per annum.

One of the world’s first airports to offer SAF for a price equivalent to that of Jet A1 fuel in 2022; FAB intends to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products either sourced locally or from larger landfill sites, instead of using waste cooking oil or hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA).

Elsewhere, The International Air Transport Association (IATA) launched its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform, which aims to facilitate SAF procurement between both airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with appropriate offers.

The platform seeks to develop long-term relationships and partnerships between airlines and producers by connecting the two parties via a dedicated source and without unnecessary fees.

Government Initiatives

In May the Government set out brand-new measures to accelerate the support of SAF, pledging an additional 400,000 GBP in funding to accelerate both its production and delivery to market, as well as the introduction of the aforementioned RCM scheme.

In July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane named 17 companies to share 63 million GBP to scale UK SAF production under the Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), which has to date pledged 198 million GBP for the scaling of cleaner aviation technologies across the country.

Companies receiving the funding include OXCCU Tech, which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport as well as LanzaJet, which is set to build a commercial-scale plant in Teesside.

With other countries such as Budapest and the United States undergoing final preparations to begin utilising sustainable aviation fuel, it’s clear to see that the UK is making steady strides toward the full adoption of SAF across the country – with airports and independent bodies leading the charge.

“I have a son with asthma,” said National City resident Marguerita Moreno in public comments at Monday’s meeting.
Ethanol is one of the fuels that would be delivered at the proposed National City transfer station.
Alvarez spokesperson Chris Jonsmyr said Alvarez had not taken a position on the fuel transfer station.
“The [planning] commissioners did the right thing.” “I’m happy,” said National City resident Carmen Arroyo.","The National City Planning Commission on Monday voted 4-1 to reject a controversial fuel depot on the city’s west side that would have brought a steady stream of oil tanker rail cars and big rig trucks to an industrial neighborhood abutting homes, churches and an elementary school.

Before a packed and vocal audience of residents, environmental activists and community leaders, planning commissioners said the proposal to build a biofuels transfer station on derelict railroad property less than a mile from City Hall would endanger residents’ health and perpetuate what they called a “cycle” of unwise development decisions in the city.

“National City is not a dumping ground,” said Planning Commissioner Randi Castle-Salgado after casting a no vote on the project. “This is part of the environmental racism here…We can’t stand for this anymore.”

The Planning Commission’s rejection of the project came despite vocal support from a local construction workers union, which said the transfer station would bring badly needed jobs to an economically struggling city.

Debate over the project highlighted a widening divide both in San Diego and throughout California between proponents of economic development and environmental advocates who say California’s longstanding commitment to environmental causes is weakening.

For more than two years, Texas-based energy and logistics company USD Clean Fuels has sought to build a 7.5-acre fuel depot in National City that would transfer ethanol and other biologically derived fuels from long-haul rail cars to big rig trucks for local delivery.

Company representatives said at Monday’s Planning Commission meeting that, though the transfer station would service up to 72 delivery trucks per day around the clock, it actually would reduce overall truck traffic in the San Diego region by making it possible to bring biofuels to the region by rail.

Currently, biofuels, including ethanol, biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel, are refined in the Los Angeles-area and brought to San Diego by truck. USD representatives said the transfer station would eliminate long-haul truck trips by shifting biofuels to more environmentally friendly trains.

USD Chief Administrative Officer Bill Frerking said Monday that the project was “for the benefit of the environment in National City and the greater San Diego area” because it would reduce overall diesel emissions and make it easier for local consumers to use biofuels.

“Cleaner air is associated with cleaner fuels,” he said.

Opponents of the project vehemently disagreed.

“I have a son with asthma,” said National City resident Marguerita Moreno in public comments at Monday’s meeting. “Our health is more important than money.”

“We are low income and that’s why you’re trying to take advantage of us,” said resident Marguerita Garcia to USD representatives.

Frerking and other USD representatives at Monday’s meeting declined to comment on the Planning Commission vote.

In a statement emailed Tuesday, a company spokesperson said, “We appreciated the opportunity to present to the commissioners and hear their comments and questions about the project, as well as the community comments. USD Clean Fuels will continue to follow all applicable state and local processes as it evaluates next steps for the project. We remain committed to making a positive contribution to the National City community by working with our customers, regulators, and prospective neighbors to find a path forward that advances the goals of cleaner air through eliminating millions of truck miles delivering those fuels today.”

If USD appeals the Planning Commission rejection, National City Councilmembers will take up the proposal at a future meeting, likely next month. Councilmembers could vote to ratify the Commission’s decision or overturn it and allow the project to move forward.

Debate over the project on Monday highlighted shifting terrain in California’s longstanding tug-of-war between economic development and environmental advocacy.

At a time when costs in the state are rising and working-class voters, including in South San Diego County, are reevaluating their political loyalties, projects like the National City transfer station that might once have been uniformly opposed now draw a less predictable mix of allies and opponents.

In the audience at Monday’s meeting were roughly a dozen unionized construction workers holding signs supporting the project, which they said would bring unionized jobs to National City and lower consumer costs by making fuel transportation more efficient.

“Our members are highly skilled, well trained and ready to deliver the quality construction this project requires,” said Kelvin Barrios, director of governmental affairs for Local 89 of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “This means good-paying local jobs, while also contributing to cleaner fuels and cleaner air for our local families and communities.”

Barrios said USD had agreed to hire only construction companies that employ union workers.

The Planning Commision vote on the fuel depot came as state lawmakers in Sacramento capped a contentious legislative session that tempered or even reversed parts of California’s long pro-environment track record.

Lawmakers, including Democrats from San Diego County, approved rolling back parts of California’s landmark Environmental Quality Act, made it easier to drill for oil in parts of the San Joaquin Valley and loosened restrictions on high-density housing construction near transit centers.

One of the bills approved by legislators was authored by South San Diego County Assemblymember David Alvarez, whose district includes National City. Alvarez’s bill, now awaiting a signature from Gov. Gavin Newsom, would increase the amount of ethanol allowed in California gasoline.

Ethanol is one of the fuels that would be delivered at the proposed National City transfer station.

Alvarez spokesperson Chris Jonsmyr said Alvarez had not taken a position on the fuel transfer station. “This is for local experts and the community to decide,” Jonsmyr said.

Environmentalists and residents on Monday celebrated the Planning Commission vote.

“The community has made it loud and clear they do not want this dangerous project in their neighborhood poisoning the lungs of their children,” said Jose Franco Garcia, executive director of Environmental Health Coalition, a local environmental group that worked to rally opposition to the transfer station. “The [planning] commissioners did the right thing.”

“I’m happy,” said National City resident Carmen Arroyo. “The people [on the Planning Commission] helped us and heard us…We are having no more of these kinds of projects in National City.”",https://voiceofsandiego.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/vito-di-stefano-9-17-24-9.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 11:56:19.288561

""Our investment in this fund demonstrates Singapore Airlines’ strong support for developing and commercialising next generation Sustainable Aviation Fuels. Reducing the carbon emissions of jet fuel demands collective action across the entire aviation ecosystem, and such initiatives will drive innovation towards meaningful progress in this crucial energy transformation.""

– Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry’s environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

oneworld BEV Fund aims to identify, enable and scale lower carbon jet fuel of the future to support consumer demand, economic development, jobs and technology innovation

DALLAS/FORT WORTH, Texas, Sept. 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- oneworld alliance and member airlines, in partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures (BEV), today announced the launch of a new investment fund designed to address the limited availability and high cost of today's Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). The fund, led by cornerstone investors Alaska Airlines and American Airlines, seeks to accelerate the global development of long-term aviation fuel solutions that are cost effective, scalable, and have lower emissions than conventional fuels.

The oneworld BEV Fund will:

invest in novel, next-generation Sustainable Aviation Fuel technologies

support the growth of alternative fuel markets to meet the long-term needs of the global aviation industry

create economic value for investors and regions around the world

drive technology innovation

develop a diverse and resilient SAF supply chain to meet future demand

""By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making a business decision to accelerate the development of novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve,"" said Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines and chairman of oneworld. ""We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.""

""Alaska Airlines is excited to work alongside oneworld carriers to invest in innovative and cost-competitive SAF technology to drive the long-term energy transformation for our industry,"" said Ben Minicucci, chief executive officer of Alaska Air Group. ""In Breakthrough Energy Ventures, we have a partner with the scientific, technical and commercial expertise to make effective investment decisions that will create the market for next-generation fuels and power our industry in the years ahead.""

""Investing in SAF with Breakthrough Energy Ventures is part of oneworld's strategy to create a future of aviation that solves problems at scale and serves the needs of the greater aviation community,"" said Nat Pieper, chief executive officer of oneworld. ""At oneworld, our member airlines are united in their long-term mission to address carbon emissions and invest in technologies that can improve speed to market of innovative fuels across the globe. By working together, we'll be better positioned to create long-term solutions for the energy transformation of an industry that is vital to global economic growth.""

BEV, Breakthrough Energy Venture's capital fund founded by Bill Gates, will serve as the fund's investment manager, bringing deep technical expertise, a rigorous diligence model, and extensive experience supporting the growth of early-stage climate technology companies. By leveraging its resources to support the energy transformation of one of the most challenging sectors for climate mitigation, BEV aims to advance fuel technologies that offer the greatest potential for tackling the sector's emissions and securing long-term commercial success.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to addressing the sector's environmental impact and represents a major commercial opportunity,"" said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy and managing partner at Breakthrough Energy Ventures. ""The oneworld BEV Fund is built to identify and scale breakthrough SAF technologies that can deliver real emissions reductions for jet fuel, compete with fossil-based fuels on cost, and integrate seamlessly with today's aviation infrastructure. These are complex systems-level challenges that will take time to solve, and the fund is built with the long-term vision and staying power to help bring solutions to market.""

The fund is also supported by oneworld alliance member airlines International Airlines Group (IAG), Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines. Recognizing the power of collective action, oneworld and Breakthrough Energy Ventures made an early decision to welcome non-alliance investors, including Singapore Airlines, which shares the alliance's commitment to accelerating industry-wide progress in SAF.

""Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most viable pathway for the aviation industry to progress to reach net zero. With our oneworld partners we have actively supported collective efforts on sustainability and today's announcement further highlights the potential of collaboration, demonstrating how leading airlines can come together with the goal to accelerate action. To unlock SAF's full potential, we are calling for supportive policy frameworks that help attract investment and enable the infrastructure needed to kickstart production.""

- Mr. Luis Gallego, chief executive officer, IAG

""As an airline with significant long-haul operations, scaling innovation to make SAF more accessible and cost-competitive is critical to Cathay Pacific's future. This investment reflects our belief that only through collective action – across geographies and industries – can we build a resilient and scalable SAF ecosystem that delivers meaningful environmental progress and supports the future of our industry. And with Asia continuing to play a pivotal role in the global SAF ecosystem, we're proud to help lead this momentum from the region.""

- Ms. Lee Wen Fen, chief sustainability officer, Singapore Airlines

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. Airlines and manufacturers continue to invest in modern aircraft, engines and operational efficiencies. Demand for air travel is expected to rise in the coming decades, and SAF, which today can reduce lifecycle emissions of jet fuel by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, is a crucial tool for mitigating the industry's environmental impact. While SAF can significantly decrease the carbon dioxide emissions from aircraft engines, the first-generation SAF in production today has come with challenges. The SAF industry has not yet attracted the investment required to scale production at competitive prices in line with market needs, and lifecycle environmental impact is a concern. oneworld and its partners are focused on supporting new technologies that can scale the availability of cost-competitive SAF, while minimizing other environmental impacts.

The CFRs stipulate that commercial fuel producers (gasoline, diesel fuel) must use a certain share of ""biofuels""---that is, ethanol, bio-diesel or similar non-fossil-fuel derived energetic chemicals in their final fuel product.
According to a 2023 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, ""the cost to lower income households represents a larger share of their disposable income compared to higher income households.
The CFRs were also---in theory---designed to stimulate Canada's lower-carbon fuel industry to satisfy domestic demand by fuel producers.
Instead, these producers are now looking to U.S. imports to comply with the CFRs, while Canadian lower-carbon fuel producers languish and fade away.","To state the obvious, poorly-devised government policies can not only fail to provide benefits but can actually do more harm than good.

For example, the federal government's so-called ""Clean Fuel Regulations"" (or CFRs) meant to promote the use of low-carbon emitting ""biofuels"" produced in Canada. The CFRs, which were enacted by the Trudeau government, went into effect in July 2023. The result? Higher domestic biofuel prices and increased dependence on the importation of biofuels from the United States.

Here's how it works. The CFRs stipulate that commercial fuel producers (gasoline, diesel fuel) must use a certain share of ""biofuels""---that is, ethanol, bio-diesel or similar non-fossil-fuel derived energetic chemicals in their final fuel product. Unfortunately, Canada's biofuel producers are having trouble meeting this demand. According to a recent report, ""Canada's low carbon fuel industry is struggling,"" which has led to an ""influx of low-cost imports"" into Canada, undermining the viability of domestic biofuel producers. As a result, ""many biofuels projects---mostly renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel---have been paused or cancelled.""

Adding insult to injury, the CFRs are also economically costly to consumers. According to a 2023 report by the Parliamentary Budget Officer, ""the cost to lower income households represents a larger share of their disposable income compared to higher income households. At the national level, in 2030, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to households ranges from 0.62 per cent of disposable income (or $231) for lower income households to 0.35 per cent of disposable income (or $1,008) for higher income households.""

Moreover, ""Relative to disposable income, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to the average household in 2030 is the highest in Saskatchewan (0.87 per cent, or $1,117), Alberta (0.80 per cent, or $1,157) and Newfoundland and Labrador (0.80 per cent, or $850), reflecting the higher fossil fuel intensity of their economies. Meanwhile, relative to disposable income, the cost of the Clean Fuel Regulations to the average household in 2030 is the lowest in British Columbia (0.28 per cent, or $384).""

So, let's review. A government mandate for the use of lower-carbon fuels has not only hurt fuel consumers, it has perversely driven sourcing of said lower-carbon fuels away from Canadian producers to lower-cost higher-volume U.S. producers. All this to the deficit of the Canadian economy, and the benefit of the American economy. That's two perverse impacts in one piece of legislation.

Remember, the intended beneficiaries of most climate policies are usually portrayed as lower-income folks who will purportedly suffer the most from future climate change. The CFRs whack these people the hardest in their already-strained wallets. The CFRs were also---in theory---designed to stimulate Canada's lower-carbon fuel industry to satisfy domestic demand by fuel producers. Instead, these producers are now looking to U.S. imports to comply with the CFRs, while Canadian lower-carbon fuel producers languish and fade away.

Poorly-devised government policies can do more harm than good. Clearly, Prime Minister Carney and his government should scrap these wrongheaded regulations and let gasoline and diesel producers produce fuel---responsibly, but as cheaply as possible---to meet market demand, for the benefit of Canadians and their families.

The funding package is designed to spur private investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and biodiesel, positioning Australia to become a major player in the global biofuels market.

“Australia has an enviable opportunity to produce cleaner and low-carbon liquid fuels for jets, vessels, construction machines, and heavy trucks to achieve net zero,” the government said in a statement, citing the nation’s advanced farming techniques and access to affordable renewable energy.

Finance Minister Jim Chalmers described the initiative as a down payment on a “completely new industry in Australia.” He added: “It’s about making Australians, and our economy, big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.”

Australia, already one of the world’s largest producers of biofuel feedstocks such as sugarcane, canola, and sorghum, exports much of its production while importing the bulk of its gasoline. Canola, in particular, has become a critical feedstock for Europe’s biodiesel industry.

Farmers have long lobbied for government backing, arguing that without support, a domestic biofuels industry would struggle to take off.

“This isn’t just about cleaner fuels,” said Su McCluskey, interim CEO of the National Farmers’ Federation. “It’s also about creating jobs and diversifying farm businesses.”

Independent assessor Peterson Solutions has confirmed that the company’s NovaSAF1 facility is on track to receive dual ISCC EU certification for advanced biofuels and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO). The recognition underscores the company’s innovative approach of combining manure-derived biogas with renewable electricity.

“We’re proving that SAF can meet the toughest sustainability standards while reaching cost levels that make sense for airlines,” said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. “Our goal is to make sustainable flight the new standard, not the exception.”

Traditionally, airlines have struggled with SAF scarcity and high costs. Syzygy’s model leverages modular hub-and-spoke production, where smaller facilities convert biogas into Fischer-Tropsch crude, which is then refined into SAF at centralized hubs. The company argues that the economics are viable at capacities of around 100,000 tonnes per year—scales large enough to be impactful, yet achievable.

According to the NovaSAF Pricing Framework, advanced bio-SAF could be produced in Europe at around $1,800 per tonne, with e-SAF at $3,000 per tonne. In the U.S., federal incentives could bring effective SAF pricing down to parity with fossil jet fuel, with credits adding $5–8 per gallon in value.

Syzygy is now seeking structured offtake agreements with airlines, as regulatory and ESG deadlines approach. “This is the moment to secure your future fuel supply,” Best said. “Airlines that act early will gain access to scalable, compliant volumes of SAF—ensuring not just regulatory alignment, but a pathway to net zero.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-09-17 07:56:49.052728

September 2025 brought yet another announcement about Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in the Tees Valley. This time it was a big one. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen flew to Saudi Arabia to announce, among other things, that Alfanar would be investing £2bn in a SAF project at Seal Sands in Billingham. That’s an impressive number. Or at least it will be if it ever gets off the drawing board.

Fake Sheikh

Some cynics might argue that Houchen flew to the middle east to draw attention from the fact that he’s been caught in a lie over another Saudi Arabian firm, Sabic. After the closure of the Olefins 6 cracker at Wilton, he’d reassured Teesside that “We’re working directly with Sabic at the moment on trying to help them around employee support”, when he’d done no such thing.

Tell me another

But when it comes to Alfanar’s Lighthouse Green Fuel (LGF) project, Teessiders will feel that they’ve heard this story before. And they have, several times. It was first announced more than four years ago. This was in August 2021, as a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Alfanar and BP. A few months later, in March 2022, Ben Houchen announced that Alfanar would be investing a mere £1bn in the project, creating 700 jobs.

Think of a number, then double it

This time round, Houchen claims that Alfanar has doubled the investment at LGF to £2bn and more than doubled the number of promised jobs to 2,000. You can read more here. And, as is common with these hyperbolic press statements, Ben Houchen was careful not to announce a timescale.

Getting on with the job?

In June 2022, Alfanar gave an impression that LGF was underway, and would be producing SAF by 2027. Not only that, it promised to build another two SAF plants.

Fast forward to May 2024, and Alfanar was holding a public consultation. This time they increased the total of promised jobs at LGF from 700 to 840. But they didn’t inflate the investment amount this time, sticking with £1bn.

There is a magic money tree after all?

So, zero SAF from the company to date, and for the foreseeable future. But, it has refined its method of extracting public funding. In December 2021, Alfanar achieved a £2.4mn win in the “Green Fuels, Green Skies” competition organised by the Department for Transport (DfT). Less than a year later it was given a grant of £11mn from the DfT’s Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF). This was followed by a further £8.7mn in November 2023 and, finally, £8mn in July 2025 from the same funding pot.

But wait, there’s more

LGF is just one of six SAF projects that has been announced for Teesside over the past four years. And, despite the almost ceaseless flurry of press releases and photo opportunities since then, they haven’t produced a single drop of SAF between them. So, what is stalling these projects? Here’s a guide to the proposals, and the companies behind them:

Abundia

Texas-based Abundia e-fuels, also known as Jet – AB2L, intends to produce SAF from sawmill and forestry residues. However, there are serious doubts about the sustainability of this feedstock. Just as with Alfanar, Abundia has received grant funding from the AFF. It received £4.5mn in November 2023. The DfT re-announced this grant in July 2025. The DfT also predicted that Abundia’s SAF plant at Wilton International will go online in 2026.

Arcadia e-Fuels

Arcadia, another Texas-based firm, received £12.3mn in AFF funding in November 2023. But things have gone quiet since that grant was announced two years ago. And Arcadia has never stated exactly where it intends to build its Teesside SAF plant. The company intends to convert biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. However, the green hydrogen won’t be available now due to the cancellation of BP’s HyGreen project. There’s an acute shortage of CO2 too. This scheme, also known as Project NABOO, is a long shot.

Nova Pangaea Technologies

Nova Pangaea’s plans are known as Project Speedbird, a nod to UK aviation history. The company is registered as LanzaJet UK Ltd. The sole director of this company is based in Illinois. Nova Pangaea built a demonstration SAF plant at Wilton International as long ago as February 2021. But, curiously, a July 2025 press release from the DfT states that the plant is still in development. In its 2023 announcement, the TVCA claimed that the plant was expected to be operational in 2025.

Hat Trick

Nova Pangaea has scored three times with the DfT. Firstly, £480,000 from the “Green Fuels, Green Skies” competition in December 2021, followed by AFF grants of £9mn in November 2023, and £10mn in July 2025. This is another project that intends to process woody residues. Sustainability isn’t guaranteed at Nova Pangaea if, indeed, it ever operates.

Willis Sustainable Fuels

Willis’ project is known as “Carbonshift Power-to-Liquid”. The company intends to build a plant at Dorman Point near Grangetown. The plan is to convert CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. Again, the lack of available green hydrogen and CO2 must call the viability of this project into question. At the time that Willis received its AFF grant of £4.7mn in November 2023, it predicted an initial production start date of 2026. But a more recent press release has pushed this back to 2028.

SkyFuel Teesside

ETFuels’ project “SkyFuel Teesside” is a latecomer to the party. It’s yet another Texas-based company. However, the company website lists a registered address in Dublin, Ireland. It lists its Teesside project as being in “Redcar”, which probably means Wilton International. Yes, it’s another recipient of AFF cash, having received £5mn in July 2025. ETFuels intends to produce “methanol to jet” using biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen into SAF. A pattern is emerging here. Good luck sourcing the CO2 and the green hydrogen.

Keep on trucking

Something that the proponents of Teesside SAF never mention is the logistics of their operation. In terms of SAF plants using wood residues, this means hundreds of lorry journeys each week delivering feedstock. The finished SAF then has to be trucked to the nearest refinery for blending with fossil fuel. That’s in Immingham, 125 miles away. The blended aviation fuel will then be taken by lorry to airports throughout the country.

So what’s the national picture?

The DfT published an SAF Mandate in December 2024, which obliges “the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix”. The mandate started in January 2025. SAF is expected to meet 2% of total UK jet fuel demand this year, “increasing linearly to 10% in 2030 and then to 22% in 2040.”

Falling behind

But the industry is struggling to meet its first target, with SAF having only supplied 1.29% of the aviation fuel mix in the first half of this year. In some months, the supply of SAF is almost negligible. The table below has been produced from statistics released by the DfT on 14 August 2025. A link to the data can be found here.

Don’t put all of your eggs in one basket

According to the Royal Aeronautical Society, “as of early 2025, the UK only has one industrial-scale SAF refinery facility. Owned by Phillips 66 and located in Humberside since 2017, the facility produces fuel from sustainable waste feedstocks.” Will Teesside’s six SAF plants ride to the rescue?

Missed SAF targets – does it matter?

So, does it matter if the UK misses its SAF targets? Well, for anyone concerned about the devastating impact of aviation on climate change, it’s bad news. But, tackling climate change isn’t the point of SAF. Even if the SAF targets are met, they’ll be made irrelevant by the exponential growth of air travel.

Biodiversity loss, changing global market dynamics and rising inequality are affecting food systems all over the world, but especially in Asia.

Asia's agri-food future will depend on its food systems becoming less fragmented and fragile, and more inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

The networks of activities, organizations and infrastructure that bring food from the fields to our tables provide much more than nutrition, these food systems also secure the livelihoods of families and communities around the world.

In Asia, 40% of the workforce is employed in a food-related job, according to the Asian Development Bank. But food systems are becoming increasingly strained by biodiversity loss, changing global market dynamics and rising inequality.

Progress on developing more robust sustainable food systems to mitigate the effects of these issues in places like Asia depends on deep regional expertise and farmer-focused networks. Combined with global insights and multi-sector partnerships, this can catalyze innovative food system solutions and help them to scale.

Efforts to mobilize capital and technology, and to shape inclusive policies and standards, must reach millions of smallholders (farmers of less than 10 hectares, who often work with family members) to create measurable, lasting environmental, social and economic impact across Asia. Multi-stakeholder collaboration can play a crucial role in such efforts, becoming a transformative force for the future of food.

That’s why, 10 years ago, the World Economic Forum, in partnership with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), launched Grow Asia. Its work addresses the pressing challenge of how to feed a growing population while ensuring food systems are inclusive, resilient and sustainable.

Since then, the Grow Asia network has become a vibrant ecosystem of more than 775 partners – governments, companies, civil society, academia and farmer organizations – all working together to create scalable solutions. Its supports five countries – Cambodia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines and Vietnam – and 44 value chains, providing more than 3.7 million smallholders and rural enterprises with technology, financial services and training. This has increased farm incomes by more than $81 million annually in selected agri-food value chains.

A strategic food system partnership

These results have been achieved by bringing together uncommon partners – investors, policy-makers, agri-food companies, philanthropies and producer organizations. The annual Grow Asia Investment Forum, for example, helps to unlock capital for sustainable and inclusive food systems by creating space for dialogue and forging new pathways for blended finance.

One of the key highlights at this year’s Grow Asia event will be the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition (FMC) for Food. Launched at COP28, FMC for Food brings together more than 50 partner organizations with a combined $900 billion in annual revenues to use their collective purchasing power to de-risk the net-zero transition and scale resilient, low-emission food commodities.

This model has already unlocked opportunities in other industries, opening new markets for clean steel, sustainable aviation fuel and shipping. The coalition is now focusing on beef, dairy, rice and row crops – commodities that are critical for food security, farmer livelihoods and climate action.

Connecting global demand commitments with local innovation and farmer adoption will ensure that sustainable practices are not only piloted but scaled. By linking smallholder farmers to the markets, new capital and innovation will define the future of agriculture.

4 strategies to strengthen Asia’s food systems

The urgency of the climate crisis, shifting global markets and rising inequality means going further and faster to make food systems more robust and sustainable. The next decade will be critical in defining and leading transboundary efforts to build food systems that nourish people, empower farmers and protect the planet.

It will take a four-pronged approach to strengthen Asia's food systems during the decade ahead:

1. Expanding access to finance and markets for smallholders

Around 80% of Southeast Asia’s farmers are smallholders. But most remain excluded from formal financial systems. Unlocking $1 billion in sustainable funding by 2030 through blended finance, impact investment and inclusive business models, will give these farmers the resources and market connections to thrive. The GrowBeyond programme will accelerate this shift, advancing responsible investment aligned with regenerative agriculture.

2. Building sustainable supply chains and restoring soil health

Action on regenerative agriculture can help to improve soil health, restoring biodiversity, nutrient density and water retention. The GrowRight programme aims to enable millions of smallholder farmers to transition to regenerative practices, improving their livelihoods while meeting growing demand for sustainable sourcing and safeguarding Asia’s natural capital. Meanwhile, the GrowHer programmes will continue to ensure that women, who make up a significant share of Southeast Asia’s agricultural workforce, are empowered as equal participants in this transformation.

3. Driving digital transformation for inclusive agri-tech

Connecting the millions of smallholders in Southeast Asia to data-driven tools – from AI-powered advisory services to blockchain-enabled supply chain platforms – can help to reduce post-harvest losses, strengthen market access and ensure small farmers are not left behind in the digital economy. The GrowVentures programme is a catalyst for digital transformation, investing in initiatives that drive technological innovation and help to scale agri-food start-ups across the region.

4. Accelerating climate-resilient farming

Adaptive practices can help farmers withstand extreme weather, shifting rainfall patterns and rising sea levels. Such practices include using drought-resistant crops, precision irrigation and agroforestry to boost yields in the most vulnerable areas while reducing environmental risk. The work of the GrowBeyond Fund focuses on adaptation strategies that build resilience at both the farm and landscape level.

This development comes as part of a groundbreaking partnership with Petrolimex Aviation, a leading fuel supplier in Vietnam, further solidifying Vietjet’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions and promoting environmentally friendly practices within the aviation industry.

A Historic Milestone in Sustainable Aviation

On October 17, 2024, a special event took place in Ho Chi Minh City, where Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation officially launched their collaboration to fuel flights with SAF. The signing ceremony was attended by top officials, including Uong Viet Dung, the Director General of the Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority; Phạm Văn Thanh, Chairman of Petrolimex; and Vietjet’s leadership team, including CEO Dinh Viet Phuong and Standing Vice President To Viet Thang.

This partnership marks the first time in Vietnam that Petrolimex Aviation has blended and supplied 1,200 m³ of SAF for Vietjet flights. The introduction of SAF is not only a commercial milestone but also a strategic leap forward, setting the foundation for a sustainable fuel supply chain in Vietnam. With the production of SAF adhering to the ISCC EU standard, it meets stringent international sustainability and CO₂ emission reduction requirements, setting an example for other countries and airlines to follow.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is made from renewable and sustainable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass, and urban waste. The use of SAF has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuels, making it an essential part of the aviation industry’s strategy to combat climate change.

The fuel is not only safe for commercial operations but also meets all aviation standards, making it a viable alternative for airlines looking to reduce their environmental impact. Vietjet’s adoption of SAF is a significant step toward reducing the airline’s carbon footprint and supporting Vietnam’s sustainable development goals.

Commitment to Green and Sustainable Development

The introduction of SAF into Vietjet’s operations underscores the airline’s commitment to green development and its role in driving the country’s National Green Growth Strategy. As the first airline in Vietnam to publish an ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) sustainability report, Vietjet has positioned itself as a leader in sustainable aviation.

Vietjet’s CEO, Dinh Viet Phuong, stated that the use of SAF in its flights is part of the airline’s long-term strategy to incorporate sustainable practices into its operations. With 576 modern aircraft on order, Vietjet is not just focusing on reducing emissions in the short term but is actively shaping a green, sustainable future for aviation. By using SAF, Vietjet aims to contribute significantly to global sustainability goals while simultaneously enhancing Vietnam’s standing in the international aviation community.

The Impact of SAF on Vietnam’s Aviation Industry

The partnership between Vietjet and Petrolimex Aviation has broader implications for Vietnam’s aviation industry and its commitment to environmental stewardship. Uong Viet Dung, the Director General of the Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority, highlighted that the launch of SAF is strategically important for establishing a domestic SAF supply chain. This will not only help meet international aviation fuel standards but also encourage cooperation among airlines, fuel suppliers, and regulatory agencies to boost SAF usage throughout Vietnam and beyond.

As Petrolimex continues to invest in the development of SAF technology at its Nha Be Oil Depot, it is laying the groundwork for expanding SAF production capabilities in the country. This initiative reflects Petrolimex’s commitment to supporting the green transition and advancing Vietnam’s sustainable development in the aviation sector. The company has also become the first in Vietnam to import SBC hydrocarbons, which are synthesized from biologically renewable materials for SAF production.

Vietjet’s Green Fleet and Future Goals

Vietjet’s long-term environmental strategy focuses on reducing emissions and pioneering the use of clean fuel. By adopting SAF, the airline is contributing significantly to protecting the environment and fulfilling its sustainability goals. This commitment goes hand in hand with Vietnam’s aspirations for growth in the global aviation industry, positioning the country as a leader in sustainable aviation in Southeast Asia.

Vietjet’s Standing Vice President, To Viet Thang, emphasized that today’s cooperation with Petrolimex Aviation is a pivotal moment for the airline and the country. This partnership aligns with Vietjet’s broader green agenda and positions the airline as an influential player in advancing sustainable air travel. As the global aviation industry increasingly turns to cleaner fuel options, Vietjet’s use of SAF serves as an example for other airlines and industries to follow in their efforts to mitigate climate change and build a more sustainable future.

Vietjet’s Green Transition and Vietnam’s Sustainable Future

By becoming a pioneer in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, Vietjet is helping to drive the shift toward greener and more sustainable air travel in Vietnam and the global aviation industry. The use of SAF, alongside Vietjet’s green fleet and long-term sustainability goals, is an important part of Vietnam’s environmental strategy. With a clear commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050, Vietjet’s efforts complement the country’s broader goals of sustainable growth and responsible tourism.

Through this collaboration with Petrolimex Aviation, Vietjet is contributing to the global green transition, marking a significant step in Vietnam’s aviation industry toward cleaner, more sustainable practices. As the aviation sector increasingly turns toward sustainable fuels, Vietjet’s efforts to embrace SAF underscore the airline’s vision for a more sustainable, eco-friendly future.

Sustainable Aviation in Vietnam: The Road Ahead

The successful use of SAF by Vietjet represents a critical turning point in the aviation industry’s green transition. With airlines around the world looking for ways to reduce their environmental impact, Vietnam is proving to be a leader in the sustainable aviation fuel movement. As Petrolimex continues to refine its SAF production capabilities and other airlines follow Vietjet’s lead, the future of aviation looks set to be much greener and more sustainable.

By continuing to invest in clean energy solutions like SAF, Vietjet and Vietnam are setting an example for the global aviation industry, showing that sustainable air travel is not just a possibility but a reality that can help protect the planet while ensuring the continued growth and success of the aviation industry.",https://www.gleaf.in/uploads//blogs/b290ac0ec8941ae4425c64132a057052.jpg,N,,2025-09-17 08:56:40.818109

Soyabean oil remained the primary feedstock and the blending rate was projected at 6.6% – below the 7.5% mandate – while production capacity remained unchanged, operating at over 70% idle.
“The local biofuels sector has been stagnant in the past several years because of laws regulating the sector, official policy or lack thereof, and political/economic decisions,” the USDA said.
The proposal would set a biodiesel blending mandate of 7.5% – with 5% of it reserved for small and medium producers – rising to 10% by 2031 under a fully liberalised market.

“The local biofuels sector has been stagnant in the past several years because of laws regulating the sector, official policy or lack thereof, and political/economic decisions,” the USDA said.

Biodiesel mandates had changed (up and down) several times and historically had not been reached, the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) Global Agricultural Information Network (GAIN) report said.

The only notable biofuel policy development was in November 2024 when the administration submitted a bill to Congress to establish a new regulatory framework for biofuels aimed at promoting sustainability, energy efficiency and greater competition through price deregulation.

The proposal would set a biodiesel blending mandate of 7.5% – with 5% of it reserved for small and medium producers – rising to 10% by 2031 under a fully liberalised market.

However, the bill had not passed through Congress, the USDA said.

In August 2024, Liga Bioenergetica, a group formed by the six provinces which had an important role in biofuel production in the country, had presented a bill focused exclusively on biodiesel and bioethanol.

The bill focused on revamping the biofuel sector, increasing production and use, while reducing petrol and diesel imports and would allow Argentina to advance its environmental and climate change commitments, the USDA said.

The country’s 2006 and 2021 biofuels laws remain contentious, with most small-and-medium-sized biodiesel producers concerned they would open the official mandate to large companies leaving few smaller producers able to compete once the market is fully liberalised in 2031, according to the report.

“Biofuels continue to play only a small role supporting Argentina’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 as the programme stagnated and has not advanced in meaningful ways,” the USDA said.

“At the same time, there are currently no policies in place to advance commercialisation of new biofuels, such as renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel.”

Argentina’s biofuels sector receives no direct financial support, relying instead on mandated blending rates, which have been reduced in recent years, particularly for biodiesel, according to the report.

Biodiesel exports remained a main pillar of the local industry but varied significantly year by year based on policies, market dynamics in export destinations and the price of diesel and biodiesel relative to the price of soyabean oil, the USDA said.

The European Union (EU) continues to be the main market for Argentine biodiesel, according to the report.",https://www.ofimagazine.com/content-images/news/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Argentina-biodiesel-prices.jpg?mtime=1633508243,N,,2025-09-17 07:57:13.532253

This investment will help ensure we have strong supply chains for the more sustainable fuels that can power our trucks, cargo ships and planes into the future.

The new ten‑year Cleaner Fuels Program will stimulate private investment in Australian onshore production of low carbon liquid fuels, such as renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

The first production of ‘drop‑in’ cleaner fuels, which can be directly substituted for existing fuels and work in today’s engines, is estimated by 2029.

Australia has the ingredients needed to make cleaner liquid alternatives to fossil fuels, with ready access to feedstocks like canola, sorghum, sugar and waste.

Thanks to our advanced farming practices and access to cheap and reliable renewable energy, Australia is in an enviable position to produce cleaner, low carbon liquid fuels that jets, ships, construction machines and heavy trucks need to reach net zero.

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value‑adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production‑linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2‑e in cumulative emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

Quotes attributable to the Treasurer, Jim Chalmers MP

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy, Chris Bowen MP

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Quotes attributable to Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Murray Watt

“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net‑zero targets.

“Low carbon fuels have the potential to be a $36 billion industry here in Australia, and we have the opportunity to lead the way on the production of these new fuels.

“We have the renewable feedstocks, access to clean energy and a strong agriculture base, all of which will allow us to develop this new industry, create new jobs and power how Australians move for decades to come.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Julie Collins MP

“We’re committed to unlocking more opportunities to harness our feedstocks, which is why this investment is great news for our farmers and our regional communities.

“Producing more low carbon liquid fuels right here in Australia won’t just benefit our fuel security and emissions reduction, it will support Australian farmers, foresters and our regions.

“Our farmers and foresters have always been innovators and our Government is putting their expertise and world‑class production practices at the centre of growing Australia’s low carbon liquid fuel industry.

While solar and wind are vital to the clean energy transition, they are not always practical for industries like aviation, shipping and heavy freight. With demand for practical, scalable solutions rising, low-carbon biofuels could become a game-changer in reducing emissions while creating jobs across regional Australia.

What are low-carbon biofuels and why this matters

Low-carbon biofuels, often called low-carbon liquid fuels, are alternatives to fossil fuels made from renewable feedstocks. These can include crops like sorghum, sugar and canola, or waste materials such as used cooking oil and tallow. The fuels produced range from renewable diesel and biodiesel to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Crucially, many are ‘drop-in’ fuels, meaning they can replace or blend with conventional fuels without requiring major changes to engines or infrastructure.

This makes them particularly attractive for transport modes that are difficult to electrify or power with hydrogen in the short term. Heavy haulage, shipping and aviation can benefit from low-carbon biofuels sooner rather than later.

How they work in practice

Low-carbon biofuels are produced through several key steps. First, the feedstock is sourced from agriculture or waste streams. Next, conversion processes like hydroprocessing, fermentation or chemical upgrading turn the feedstock into liquid fuel. Finally, the refined fuel is distributed and used either directly or in blends with fossil fuels.

The versatility of these fuels means they can cut emissions without waiting for massive infrastructure overhauls. Trucks, planes and ships can start reducing their carbon footprint with minimal disruption.

Environmental impact: the promise and the pitfalls

The promise

When produced sustainably, low-carbon biofuels offer significant greenhouse gas savings. Some studies suggest Australia could avoid around 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2050 if the industry scales up. Domestic production also strengthens fuel security, reducing reliance on imports and protecting supply chains. Beyond climate benefits, the industry promises billions in economic value and thousands of regional jobs.

The pitfalls

The environmental credentials of biofuels depend on how feedstocks are grown and processed. If cultivation is carbon-intensive or leads to deforestation or biodiversity loss, the net benefit shrinks. Land competition with food crops is another risk. Scaling production requires investment in refining, certification and infrastructure. Costs remain high for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, meaning government policy and market demand will shape the speed of uptake.

Labor’s latest announcement

The $1.1 billion Cleaner Fuels Program announced by the Labor Government will provide grants over 10 years to build Australia’s capacity to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the initiative as a central part of building a “Future Made in Australia,” adding:

“We want to make sure that Australia is at the forefront of this global shift, cutting emissions while creating good jobs at home.”

The funding signals a strong commitment to tackling emissions from transport and industry while opening new export opportunities. The government estimates the low-carbon fuels sector could grow into a $36 billion industry by 2050, cutting millions of tonnes of emissions and securing long-term economic gains.

What’s expected from leadership and industry

Policy certainty will be essential to attract private investment. Standards for sustainability, certification of fuels, and clear guarantees of origin will build confidence in the sector. Feedstock sustainability is also critical; if done right, Australia could turn agricultural residues and waste into a climate solution, not a liability.

Building the necessary refining, blending and distribution facilities will take time, but early action is key. By the mid-2030s, low-carbon fuels must be produced at scale if they are to meet Australia’s climate targets.

Strengthening fuel security

Low-carbon biofuels offer Australia a rare chance to cut emissions in some of the hardest-to-abate sectors without waiting for next-generation technology. With Labor’s $1.1 billion commitment, the pathway is clearer than ever. If the fuels are produced sustainably, they could become a cornerstone of Australia’s clean energy future, slashing emissions, strengthening fuel security, and creating jobs where they are needed most.",https://www.energymatters.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Low-carbon-biofuel.png,N,,2025-09-16 21:56:28.591509

Liquid fuels make up around half of Australia’s national energy use. Replacing those fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives would deliver a massive climate and economic opportunity.

Australia already exports nearly $4 billion of suitable feedstocks like canola and tallow. But the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) estimates an Australian low carbon liquid fuel industry could be worth $36 billion by 2050 – highlighting the untapped potential of developing local refining and value-adding capability.

Funding to make cleaner fuel on Australian shores, from Australian feedstock will help back Australian innovators from the farmer to the fuel bowser, make our fuel supply greener and more resilient and make low carbon fuels available for early adopters.

Details about eligibility will be considered through public consultation and design work to take place this financial year. Grants will be awarded through a competitive process to ensure we get value for taxpayer funds.

The new production-linked incentive builds on the Government’s support through the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative and the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. Recipients will also need to deliver benefits according to the community benefit principles under the Future Made in Australia Act.

The Government is also supporting the market by expanding the Guarantee of Origin Scheme to include low carbon liquid fuels and has established a fuel quality standard for renewable diesel.

A recent report from the CEFC found that a mature Australian low carbon liquid fuels industry could deliver around 230 million tonnes CO2-e in cumulative

emissions reduction by 2050. This is equivalent to 2.3 times Australia’s current annual transport emissions, or the annual emissions from 86 million cars.

Quotes attributable to the Treasurer Jim Chalmers:

“Low carbon liquid fuels are an enormous economic opportunity for Australia.

“It’s about making Australians and our economy big beneficiaries of the global net zero transformation.

“Developing this industry has potential to make us an indispensable part of growing global net zero supply chains.

“This is a downpayment on developing an entirely new industry in Australia.

“From the farm to the refinery, from primary production to processing, this will create more jobs and more opportunities for Australian workers and businesses.

“It’s another way we’re helping Australians grasp the big benefits on offer in the transformation to cleaner and cheaper energy – to help lift wages, grow living standards, create jobs and grow our economy.”

Quotes attributable to Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen:

“Making cleaner fuels here, from Australian feedstocks, creates the path for emissions reduction in sectors that are hardest to clean up, like plane travel and construction machines.

“Across the nation we have 2 billion litres worth of projects in the pipeline, many of which are ready to scale up production. A new thriving domestic industry with more jobs in our regions, from farmers growing the inputs to workers refining the fuels of the future is within our reach.

“$1.1 billion for low carbon liquid fuels production here in Australia builds on the $250 million we have already allocated to low carbon liquid fuels research and development through the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund.”

Quotes attributable to Acting Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government Murray Watt:

“As demand for air travel grows, and more goods are moved by road and rail, it’s essential we invest in future fuels that allow us to facilitate this increasing demand while meeting our net-zero targets.",https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/themes/custom/ministerinfrastructure/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-16 20:56:15.475112

NFF Interim Chief Executive Su McCluskey joined the Treasurer and Minister Bowen at the announcement. Ms McCluskey said being at today’s announcement demonstrates the vital role farmers will play in supplying Australia’s low-carbon liquid fuels industry.

“This is an important acknowledgement that agriculture is a critical component of Australia’s cleaner fuels future,” Ms McCluskey said.

“Farmers already supply products that power biofuel industries overseas; this investment will help to support a domestic industry.”

The new program will support the production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel using Australian-grown feedstocks such as canola, sorghum and sugar, alongside agricultural byproducts.

“NFF members like GrainGrowers and Canegrowers have for years worked on developing policy settings that encourage domestic production, enabling their growers to access new markets and ensure their sectors remain profitable and sustainable,” Ms McCluskey said.

“A strong domestic biofuels industry will help diversify the market opportunities for producers, a key element of risk management.”

“This isn’t just about cleaner fuels. It’s about creating jobs, diversifying farm businesses, and ensuring our regions remain at the forefront of Australia’s transition to net zero.”

The NFF has long called for increased domestic production of biofuels. The industry’s 2030 Roadmap to a $100 billion industry highlights biofuels as a critical lever for growth by helping to diversify farm income, improve resilience, and contribute to Australia’s climate commitments.

“Alongside the sustainability benefits, building this industry here will also strengthen Australia’s sovereign fuel capability by reducing our reliance on imports.”

The NFF said it also looks forward to working with its members and Government in the development of the Government’s ‘National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy’ to ensure feedstock supply is sustainable, competitive and well-integrated with regional development.

Quotes attributable to GrainGrowers CEO, Shona Gawel:

“Today’s announcement is a welcome investment in Australia’s LCLF industry. Domestic LCLF production can strengthen Australia’s energy security and unlock new economic opportunities, ensuring Australia remains fuel-secure, sustainable, and resilient.

“Australia produces an abundance of crops suitable for biofuel production, including canola and other oilseeds. Our world-class sector and established grain supply chains are well-placed to supply domestic LCLF production.”

Quotes attributable to CANEGROWERS CEO, Dan Galligan:

“Almost half of the Queensland’s sugarcane is recognised by the world’s three biggest sustainability gatekeepers as a global leader in sustainable farming. This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks.

“Our growing region stretches along the Queensland coastline, alongside major population hubs. We also have a cane rail network stretching thousands of kilometres, linking farms to mills and multiple deep-water ports.

“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels. With sugarcane feedstock alone, Queensland could deliver more than 30% of Australia’s aviation fuel demand.

Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.","I. Background

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) into law, marking a significant turn in US clean energy policy. The new law dismantles or narrows many of the clean energy tax credits introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). For developers, manufacturers, and investors, the message is clear: access to federal tax credits is shrinking, and the rules for eligibility are tightening.

Days after signing the OBBBA, on July 7, President Trump reinforced this policy shift with an executive order (EO 14315) directing federal agencies to end support for wind, solar, and other “green” technologies. Treasury was tasked with enforcing accelerated deadlines and stricter rules to prevent projects from using safe harbors to lock in credits for wind and solar. Together, the OBBBA and EO 14315 set the stage for a new framework that scales back incentives and imposes tougher compliance hurdles, particularly around foreign ownership and supply chain sourcing.

II. New IRS Guidance: “Beginning of Construction” Rules

The IRS acted quickly, following EO 14315 with Notice 2025-42, which provides new rules addressing when wind and solar projects are considered to have “begun construction” for purposes of qualifying for the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) under Sections 45Y and 48E, respectively.[1] This notice significantly narrows the pathways available to developers.

The familiar “5% safe harbor” introduced under Notice 2013-29 and further clarified under various IRS notices, such as Notice 2018-59 and Notice 2022-61 (Prior Notices), is eliminated for most wind and solar projects. Instead, taxpayers must now satisfy the “physical work test,” which requires that physical work of a significant nature begins before July 5, 2026. That said, the 5% safe harbor is preserved for small-scale solar projects (1.5 MW or less), recognizing the unique challenges for distributed generation.

Qualifying work under the physical work test can include on-site activities such as excavation for wind turbine foundations or installation of racking for solar panels, as well as certain off-site manufacturing activities performed pursuant to binding written contracts. Preliminary steps like permitting or site clearing are not counted toward the physical work test.

Once construction begins, projects must maintain a continuous program of construction (i.e., the “continuity requirement”). That said, the “continuity safe harbor” from the Prior Notices still exists. If a project is placed in service within four years of the end of the year in which construction began, the project is treated as having satisfied the continuity requirement. If the construction period extends beyond the four-year safe harbor, a solar developer can no longer rely on merely showing “continuous efforts” but must be able to demonstrate a continuous program of construction that involves continuing physical work of a significant nature.

Fortunately, Notice 2025-42 preserves a list of excusable disruptions, such as weather, interconnection delays, and permitting delays, for purposes of satisfying the continuity requirement.

Finally, it is worth noting that Notice 2025-42 specially provides that the “beginning of construction” rules set forth in the notice are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the new restrictions on foreign involvement discussed below. Such guidance is currently being prepared by Treasury.

For developers, the takeaway is clear: simply incurring costs or securing contracts will no longer be sufficient. Projects must demonstrate physical progress of a significant nature on or before the July 4, 2026 deadline to remain eligible for PTCs or ITCs without being subject to the accelerated December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline.

III. Change Under the OBBBA

New Restrictions on Foreign Involvement

A central feature of the OBBBA is the creation of the Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) regime. The goal is to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector, especially from countries deemed adversarial to the United States, such as China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

The rules operate on two levels:

Specified Foreign Entities (SFEs): entities directly tied to adversarial governments or named in laws like the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act.

Foreign-Influenced Entities (FIEs): entities where an SFE has significant influence, such as owning at least 25%, holding certain debt interests, or having contractual control.

Even if a developer isn’t itself an SFE or FIE, projects can still lose eligibility if (1) they begin construction after December 31, 2025, and (2) they rely too heavily on goods or services sourced from PFEs. Treasury will measure this through a “material assistance” test, which compares overall project costs with the portion tied to PFEs. The thresholds will tighten overtime — wind and solar projects must show 40% non-PFE content in 2026, rising to 60% by 2030. Similar rules will apply across technologies, from batteries to inverters to critical minerals.

While official safe harbor tables won’t arrive until late 2026, transitional relief allows developers to rely on IRS Notice 2025-08 and supplier certifications in the meantime. Developers will need to closely track supply chains now, as eligibility will become progressively harder to maintain. As noted above, the “beginning of construction” rules under Notice 2025-42 for purposes of determining whether a project is eligible for PTCs or ITCs are not intended to address the “beginning of construction” rules for purposes of determining whether a project is subject to the “material assistance” restrictions. Until Treasury issues specific guidance, the historic “beginning of construction” rules remain applicable for this purpose.

Key Changes by Credit

Investment Tax Credit (Section 48E): Wind and solar face early termination deadlines — in order to be eligible for this credit, construction must begin on or before July 4, 2026, or, for projects beginning construction after July 4, 2026, such projects must be placed in service by the end of 2027. As discussed earlier, Notice 2025-42 introduced new rules on when wind and solar projects are considered to have begun construction, which further narrows eligibility. That said, other technologies like geothermal, nuclear, and hydrogen retain longer timelines, with a gradual phaseout starting in 2034.

Production Tax Credits (Section 45Y): Similarly, wind and solar projects must meet the July 4, 2026 “beginning of construction” date or the December 31, 2027 placed-in-service deadline. Other technologies, such as geothermal, hydrogen, and nuclear projects, are subject to the same phaseout schedule as the Section 48E ITCs.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credits (Section 45X): Wind components produced and sold after December 31, 2027 are ineligible for the Section 45X credit. With respect to critical minerals, the OBBBA (1) included metallurgical coal as an applicable critical mineral, and (2) provided for a critical mineral phaseout beginning in 2031 (except for metallurgical coal, which phases out beginning in 2030). In addition, the OBBBA tightened the definition of “battery modules” eligible for the Section 45X credit by clarifying that a battery module is comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality. The PFE rules also apply here, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate sourcing strategies.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q): Credit amounts are equalized at $17 per ton (base) for carbon captured from industrial and power facilities (increased to $85 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied) and $36 per ton (base) for direct air capture (increased to $180 per ton if the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are satisfied), regardless of end use. But PFE restrictions will now limit who can claim or transfer the Section 45Q credits.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (Section 45U): The Section 45U credit for electricity production at existing nuclear power plants that were operational at the time of enactment of the IRA (i.e., placed in service prior to August 16, 2022) remains intact through 2032, but with new restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. Specifically, after December 31, 2027, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel was not sourced from covered nations or “covered entities” (unless pursuant to a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023). In addition, SFEs are not eligible to claim the Section 45U credit after the date of enactment of the OBBBA, and FIEs cannot claim the Section 45U credit for tax year beginning after the second anniversary of the date of enactment.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Eligibility for the per kilogram credit for qualified clean hydrogen production now requires construction to begin before 2028, significantly shortening the runway for new projects. Projects beginning construction after December 31, 2027, will no longer be eligible.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (Section 45Z): The Section 45Z credit for the production of certain transportation fuel and sustainable aviation fuel has been extended and is available through 2029, but with narrowed eligibility and stricter sourcing rules. PFE restrictions also apply. For example, for fuel produced after December 31, 2025, the enhanced rate for sustainable aviation fuel is no longer available and the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20%.

Direct Pay and Transferability (Sections 6417 and 6418): Both remain available, but credits cannot be transferred to PFEs (immediately for SFEs and two years later for FIEs).

IV. Looking Ahead

The OBBBA fundamentally reshapes clean energy incentives by accelerating phaseouts, shortening deadlines, and layering in complex new foreign entity restrictions. While certain technologies like nuclear and hydrogen retain more favorable treatment, the overarching trend is a sharp contraction in federal support for wind, solar, and PFE-linked projects.

Below is a list of action items for developers to do now:

Move quickly on project starts. Wind and solar developers must begin construction on or before July 4, 2026 to preserve credit eligibility while retaining the four-year “continuity safe harbor” to place the project in service; otherwise, such projects that begin construction after the first anniversary of the enactment of the OBBBA have to be placed in service by the end of 2027.

Focus on the Physical Work Test. For wind and solar projects, developers can no longer “begin construction” by satisfying a 5% safe harbor (other than certain small-scale solar projects of 1.5 MW or less). Paying or incurring costs for the manufacturing of project components is no longer enough — developers must plan for tangible, qualifying construction steps that constitute physical work of a significant nature, both for purposes of showing that construction began and for purposes of maintaining a continuous program of construction.

Track supply chains. The introduction of the PFE regime intended to limit foreign influence in the US clean energy sector means that developers and manufacturers must strengthen the supplier due diligence process and carefully document sourcing of key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance and build strategies to reduce foreign exposure.

Plan for shorter timelines. Credits phase out sooner for wind, solar, and certain manufacturing components, so consider accelerated construction and financing schedules.

Monitor Treasury guidance. Future notices (including notices regarding the PFE regime and the beginning of construction rules for the PFE regime) will shape enforcement and safe harbor rules; staying up to date will be critical to avoid disqualification.

In this new era, careful planning and compliance will be essential to securing clean energy tax incentives, and maintaining strong documentation will be key to supporting credit eligibility and ensuring investors and tax credit purchasers that the underlying credits are secure.

Already, over ₹3,000 crore has been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.
European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully,” he said.
Concerns remain over food security if agricultural feedstocks are diverted to fuel production.
“With proper planning, innovation, and collaboration, India has the potential to become a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel.”","Airlines across the world will not adopt sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) unless they become cost-competitive with conventional jet fuel, Jimmy Olsson, President of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Association (Safa), has said, reports Businessworld.

Speaking to BW Businessworld, Olsson stressed that the responsibility lies with fuel producers to innovate and bring down SAF costs while maintaining environmental integrity. “If you set up your SAF plant in the correct manner, it is very much financially viable,” he said, adding that the entire value chain — from feedstock collection to final fuel production — needs to be reimagined.

India, one of the world’s fastest-growing aviation markets, currently accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global aviation turbine fuel (ATF) demand, exporting nearly half of its production. Passenger traffic is projected to rise from 220 million in 2023-24 to nearly 390 million by 2030, while freight volumes are expected to more than double to 5.1 million tonnes, according to a Deloitte study.

ATF demand is likely to reach 15–16 million tonnes by 2030. This rapid growth, coupled with increasing carbon emissions, makes SAF adoption critical.

India has announced blending mandates of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. SAF is expected to contribute between 53 and 66 per cent toward India’s net-zero aviation targets by 2050.

Abundant domestic feedstocks — including agricultural residues, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and used cooking oil — provide a strong foundation. These can cut carbon intensity by up to 84 per cent, ICAO studies show.

“With careful planning, technological adoption, and efficient supply chains, SAF can be produced and supplied in a way that is practical, financially sustainable, and beneficial to all stakeholders,” Olsson said.

At present, SAF costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock. Agricultural residue-based SAF is priced at USD 550–650 per tonne, used cooking oil at USD 800–900, and sugarcane at USD 300–400.

Domestic demand at 5 per cent blending is expected to reach 0.8 million tonnes by 2030, but with a production potential of 8–10 million tonnes, India could not only meet domestic needs but also export. Already, over ₹3,000 crore has been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.

Olsson noted that at low blending mandates of 1–5 per cent, the cost impact on airlines is minimal. “Even low-cost carriers can adopt SAF without affecting profitability. European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully,” he said.

Concerns remain over food security if agricultural feedstocks are diverted to fuel production. Olsson argued that linking SAF to farmer incomes, employment, and sustainable practices is essential.

India’s crop residue management programmes, particularly in Punjab and Haryana, have already reduced stubble burning by up to 69 per cent, cutting a million tonnes of CO2 emissions and adding USD 14 million to farmer incomes. “Any sustainable SAF business in India must consider all stakeholders — it must support rural livelihoods, remain affordable, and not compromise food security,” Olsson emphasised.

With domestic SAF production potential far exceeding projected demand, India has the opportunity to reduce aviation emissions while positioning itself as an exporter.

United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark

NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United CEO Scott Kirby was in Newark (EWR) today to celebrate the airline's operational turnaround at EWR and discuss the bright future for the carrier's premier East Coast hub.

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline's history.** In addition, United's Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" said Kirby. ""I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

""Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. ""United's continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region's world-class transportation infrastructure.""

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR's maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

""We're building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,"" said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. ""This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.""

United invests more in Newark destinationsAs the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United's industry-leading international network.

United's most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

This summer, EWR had more international departures (over 20,000) and more departures to Europe (more than 8,200) than any other United hub

This summer, all of United's 32 European destinations were served from EWR

In 2025, United serves 82 international destinations from EWR

EWR serves the most international destinations unique to United (seven) of any hub

By the end of 2025, United will have grown its international network in EWR by 12 destinations since 2018, including the six additions this year

EWR has more widebody departures than any other United hub

United hiring in Newark United proudly employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including more than 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants.

United looks to hire another 2,500 employees before the end of 2026.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Comes to NewarkUnited will be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to one million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

I am excited to see this legislation move forward,” said Rep. Steffen.

SAF is jet fuel made from renewable, often low value, energy crops. Under AB 222, in order to qualify for the credit, the fuel must be produced in Wisconsin, derived largely from renewable sources, and energy crops must be grown in the U.S. The credit will take effect in 2028.

“Wisconsin has the talent, the drive, and the natural resources to be a world leader in the production of SAF. Our forests’ health is at risk if we do not continue to find new uses for our fiber. SAF is truly a win-win on every front,” said Sen. Quinn.

Innovative European startup company Maeve Aerospace has signed an agreement with SkyWest to become an equity investor and the launch customer of the hybrid-electric MAEVE Jet.

SkyWest, the holding company of SkyWest Airlines, is the world’s largest regional airline.

With a fleet size approaching 500 regional jets, mainly Bombardier CRJ variants and Embraer 175s, the airline covers North America on behalf of American Eagle, United Express, Delta Connection and Alaska Airlines, carrying 42 million passengers in 2024.

“Today marks a significant milestone in regional aviation as we collaborate with SkyWest to bring the MAEVE Jet to life,” said Martin Nuesseler, Maeve Aerospace Chief Technology Officer.

“This investment, made by the largest regional airline in the world, not only validates our vision but also establishes a partnership that supports the development of the MAEVE Jet by providing important input from an operator to generate a real impact in the market and for more sustainable air travel. Together, we are redefining the future of regional connectivity.”

Why is SkyWest partnering with Maeve?

Maeve’s aircraft design has evolved in recent years. From an all-electric high-wing propeller-driven aircraft with eight engines to the twin hybrid electric engine M80 in 2023, and now to its current form – the MJ 500 MAEVE jet, a 76 to 100-seat, rear-engined, hybrid-electric open-rotor regional aircraft.

Financial terms of the equity deal have not been disclosed, but SkyWest is understood to be investing more than just money. The airline has committed to providing input into design, performance, and operations during the development phase, giving the developers important real-world feedback from an airline that could, in theory, become one of its most important clients.

The partnership and announcement of ‘launch customer’ status for SkyWest implies that the airline will take early deliveries of the new aircraft, once certified. Should that come about, it could provide SkyWest with a much-needed new technology replacement for its ageing CRJ fleet.

According to Planespotters data, SkyWest’s 138-strong CRJ-700 fleet averages over 20 years of age, with some of the oldest examples 25 years old or more. Its 57 CRJ-900s are, on average, younger, although some individuals are more than two decades old.

SkyWest has already ordered more Embraer E175s, but will be looking ahead to the next technology aircraft. Embraer shelved its plans for an E175-E2, leaving airlines reliant on small regional jets with an older technology model. While the MAEVE Jet might be some years away, it’s a hope for SkyWest and a more efficient future fleet.

For a startup like Maeve, securing SkyWest as a launch customer is a powerful vote of confidence.

The company markets its MAEVE Jet as the first clean-sheet regional jet to be introduced in over 20 years. It promises a hybrid-electric regional aircraft that will let airlines cut fuel burn and CO₂ emissions by up to 40% with conventional fuel, and up to 95% when partnered with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

MHI RJ Aviation Group is also partnering with Maeve Aerospace

Also teaming up last year with Maeve Aerospace is MHI RJ Aviation Group, a Canadian-based subsidiary of MHI (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries).

MHI are no stranger to the world of regional jet design, with its subsidiary Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation having developed the SpaceJet. The aircraft first flew in prototype form in November 2015, but ultimately the project ended during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The scope clause also had an effect, as it limits regional jets to 76 seats and a maximum takeoff weight of 86,000lb to protect mainline pilot jobs. This was a key reason the Mitsubishi MRJ SpaceJet failed in the US market. Maeve avoids this pitfall by designing its aircraft to remain within scope clause limits, making it a viable option for regional carriers.

Whilst there is no timeline yet for certification or entry into service for the MAEVE Jet, the market for hybrid-electric airliners is heating up, with competition from California-based Heart Aerospace.

Although the Heart ES-30 design is considerably smaller and slower, with only 30 seats, they do have 250 orders from customers such as United, Mesa Airlines, and ES-30 launch customer Air Canada.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Maeve-Aerospace-MAEVE-Jet-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-16 15:56:29.893361

The company's NovaSAF™ Pricing Framework, published today as a white paper, provides validation that its biogas to both RFNBO and Bio SAF pathway can meet the tough EU sustainability mandates and airline price targets.

Independent assessors at Peterson Solutions have confirmed Syzygy's NovaSAF1 facility is set for dual ISCC EU certification for both advanced biofuels and RFNBO, recognizing its innovative use of manure-based biogas and renewable electricity.

""We're proving that SAF can meet the toughest sustainability standards while reaching cost levels that make sense for airlines,"" said Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics. ""Our goal is to make sustainable flight the new standard, not the exception.""

Why this matters

For airlines under mounting pressure to meet EU mandates, U.S. incentives, and CORSIA requirements, SAF has often been too scarce and too expensive. Syzygy's strategy promises a different outcome. By marrying low-cost biogenic feedstocks with renewable electricity, NovaSAF positions itself as a credible alternative to HEFA biofuels, which dominate the market today but are constrained by feedstock availability.

Syzygy's model hinges on hub-and-spoke production, where modular units produce Fischer-Tropsch crude from biogas, which is then upgraded to SAF at centralized hubs. The company argues the economics work at scales starting around 100,000 tons per year—small enough to be achievable, large enough to matter.

The company says NovaSAF costs can beat today's bioSAF prices in a variety of scenarios, including high feedstock cost scenarios such as $25/MMBtu for biogas or $0.15/kWh for renewable power. In Europe, SAF prices could track at $1,800/ton for advanced biofuels and $3,000/ton for e-SAF. In the U.S., incentives could bring effective pricing down to parity with fossil jet fuel, with credits adding $5–8 per gallon in value.

A call to early movers

Syzygy is actively opening structured offtake discussions now, aiming to lock in commitments as SAF mandates and ESG deadlines loom. ""This is the moment to secure your future fuel supply,"" Best said. ""Airlines that act early will gain access to scalable, compliant volumes of SAF—ensuring not just regulatory alignment, but a pathway to net zero.""

United had its best operational summer ever at Newark, putting the airport on par with John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport for on-time performance, Kirby said. More than 6 million people flew on-time through Newark this past summer.

The turnaround follows a two-month period in April and May when Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) was plagued by a series of technology outages that cut off communication with air-traffic controllers and resulted in flight delays and cancellations. Some controllers took trauma-related leave, adding to a staffing shortage at the Philadelphia facility that manages Newark’s airspace.

But since that time, bookings and customer confidence about flying through Newark have rebounded, Kirby said, thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees. Factors in the turnaround include:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), which had limited Newark flight operations to 68 flights per hour in May, has tentatively raised the limit to 72 flights per hour through the summer of 2026.

The FAA installed a new fiber optic network in July to support the air traffic control system, which had been a contributing factor to previous communication outages.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" Kirby said. As the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation increase staffing and improve technology, “reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin, he said.

Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

United now employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including over 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants. The airline expects to add more than 2,500 Newark employees between now and the end of 2026.

United will also be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to 1 million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

Diamond Green Diesel, or DGD, a U.S. leader in renewable diesel production, imports beef tallow from a supplier fed by Brazilian slaughterhouses fined for illegal deforestation. These include a plant that purchased cattle from a rancher described by Brazilian authorities as the “largest destroyer of the Amazon” ever investigated.

Repórter Brasil obtained documents about DGD’s supplier chain and identified, in addition to this case, connections to at least two other slaughterhouses that bought cattle from ranchers fined for practices associated with large-scale illegal deforestation.

These cases raise a red flag about the potential harmful climate impacts of alternative fuels. Despite biofuels’ image as a ‘green’ fuel, the use of livestock inputs in their production can increase deforestation, warns Tim Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. “The reason land is being deforested is to meet growing demand for food and biofuels,” he says.

Deforestation accounts for around 13 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to United Nations estimates. In Brazil, it is the leading driver of such emissions.

On its website, DGD claims its industrial plant can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to fossil diesel. However, it does not mention any measures to prevent the purchase of tallow sourced from deforested pastures. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to fueling cars and trucks, DGD’s Texas facility produces SAF — short for “sustainable aviation fuel,” a product intended to reduce the climate footprint of the aviation industry. Avfuel Corporation, one of the main independent jet fuel suppliers in the U.S., received the first SAF delivery from DGD in December 2024.

From forest destruction to biofuel production

According to customs documents reviewed by Repórter Brasil, DGD regularly purchases beef tallow from the Fasa group, a Brazilian company specializing in processing slaughterhouse byproducts. DGD and Fasa belong to the same economic group, as the Brazilian company was acquired in 2022 by Texas-based multinational Darling Ingredients, one of DGD’s owners through a joint venture with Valero Energy. Also headquartered in Texas, Valero Energy is one of the largest fuel producers in the U.S.

The Fasa group has subsidiaries in the Amazon called Araguaia and Rio Verde, which source tallow from various slaughterhouses in the region. The supplier’s history, according to official documents obtained by the report, includes Frialto, a slaughterhouse from Mato Grosso identified through GTAs (animal transport guides) purchasing cattle from a rancher arrested by the Brazilian federal police in 2023. He was accused by Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office of clearing an area of forest equivalent to about 12,000 American football fields and is identified by the agency as the largest Amazonian deforester ever investigated.

One month after the arrest, Repórter Brasil revealed that Frialto had bought cattle from the rancher and his relatives. Now, the outlet has obtained an official letter from the government of Mato Grosso, dated October 2023, related to the renewal of Frialto’s operating license. In the document, a Fasa subsidiary is listed as the recipient of residues generated by Frialto. According to customs records, this same Fasa unit sent beef tallow to DGD multiple times between 2023 and 2024.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties. Repórter Brasil contacted the slaughterhouse again to inquire about its dealings with Fasa and any measures taken to avoid sourcing from illegally deforested areas but received no response.

Fasa, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, and DGD also did not respond to requests for comment.

Another illegal deforestation case linked to DGD’s supply chain involves the LKJ slaughterhouse. Cattle movement records accessed by Repórter Brasil show that in July 2023, LKJ purchased animals from a ranch in Brazil’s Cerrado biome — called Apucarana Farm — which had 381 hectares embargoed after environmental authorities confirmed illegal deforestation. The Cerrado is another native biome in Brazil facing rapid destruction and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

A Fasa subsidiary in Pará state regularly received residues from LKJ between 2022 and 2023, according to corporate documents obtained by Repórter Brasil showing truck routes for raw material deliveries. That same subsidiary also supplied beef tallow to DGD from 2023 to 2024, according to customs records.

When contacted, LKJ attributed the cattle purchase from Apucarana Farm to a failure in its internal procedures, stating that it has a policy of not buying from embargoed areas. (See the full response here.) The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales. LKJ did not comment on its business relationship with Fasa.

Like other slaughterhouses, LKJ is a signatory to an agreement with Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office — known by its Portuguese acronym, MPF — that requires adopting anti-deforestation criteria in cattle procurement in the Amazon. In May of this year, the MPF released audit results focused on LKJ’s operations, revealing that roughly 2,700 animals slaughtered by the company in 2022 — about 8 percent of the audited sample — did not meet the agreement’s criteria. It was the worst result among the six audited slaughterhouses in the state of Tocantins, where LKJ is located.

In 2023 and 2024, in addition to sourcing tallow from Fasa, DGD also imported tallow directly from Minerva, Brazil’s second-largest beef company, customs data show.

Last year, a study by the organization Mighty Earth identified the company as one of the clients supplied by the largest deforester in the Brazilian Pantanal, who was fined the highest penalty ever imposed by the Mato Grosso State Department of the Environment. The individual was held responsible by the state’s Civil Police for the destruction of 81,200 hectares of native vegetation — an area larger than the island of Manhattan — through the aerial spraying of pesticides containing chemicals also found in “Agent Orange.” At the time of the publication, which used data gathered by Repórter Brasil, the company reported that it had blocked the rancher from future business.

Minerva’s plant in Araguaína, in the state of Tocantins, is among those listed in customs documents exporting tallow to DGD. A 2021 Repórter Brasil report showed that this facility had purchased cattle from a rancher fined for illegally clearing 198 acres of Amazon rainforest. Another investigation that same year revealed that the plant’s indirect supply chain included a farm where Brazilian authorities rescued workers from conditions analogous to slavery.

Minerva was contacted to comment on its cattle procurement policies and its relationship with DGD, but did not respond.

Brazil is exporting more tallow to the U.S.

In 2022, Brazil exported 63,000 tons of tallow to the U.S. In 2023, that number jumped to 202,000 tons. And in just the first five months of 2025, Brazil had already shipped 111,000 tons, according to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services.

The increase coincides with the acquisition of the Fasa group by Darling Ingredients. Last year, the U.S. was the destination for 90 percent of all Brazilian tallow exports.

Beef tallow is derived from bovine tissue waste and has a relatively low production cost, as it is extracted from less valuable parts of the animal, such as the carcass. Its use is often described as “animal recycling” and is commonly promoted as a solution for disposing of slaughterhouse residues.

Because it is considered a byproduct, tallow is not subject to the same traceability requirements as beef. However, according to Searchinger, tallow is a valuable commodity for the food industry — it is, for example, widely used in animal feed. When diverted to fuel production, he explains, it increases the demand for vegetable oils and other fats to replace it. “This, in turn, increases pressure on land,” he says.

Searchinger argues that the growth of biofuels is only viable because of public subsidies. He believes that instead of supporting the sector, rich countries should fund environmental conservation in the Global South.

“A $100-per-ton CO2 tax on airline tickets could generate a $100 billion annual fund. That money could be used to pay countries like Brazil to conserve their forests and boost livestock productivity in already cleared areas,” Searchinger suggests.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/desmatamento-parque-guaraja-mirim-alessandro-falco-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-16 11:56:40.779769

The milestone caps aviation’s complete recovery from the pandemic collapse, but the path back reveals fundamental shifts in how the industry operates.

Behind the seemingly modest 0.1% increase in total daily emissions lies a more complex story: airlines achieved a 7.4% improvement in fuel efficiency per available seat kilometer (ASK) while accommodating substantially more passengers. The mathematics of this recovery challenge long-held assumptions about the relationship between aviation growth and environmental impact.

The Recovery Paradox

Here’s what makes July 18 significant: airlines delivered 8.2% more ASKs than August 2, 2019 while increasing total emissions by just 0.1%. Flights crept up only 3.7% over six years, yet carriers found ways to accommodate surging demand through a wholesale reimagining of capacity deployment.

The numbers tell the story. Average aircraft size grew by eight seats to 175 passengers per flight. Route distances stretched 3% longer to 1,626 kilometers on average. Flight times? They barely budged—up just 1.3% to 138 minutes despite busier airspace and longer routes.

Efficiency Context

The 7.4% efficiency improvement represents approximately 187,000 tonnes of CO₂ saved daily compared to 2019 operational standards, though absolute emissions still increased 0.1% due to capacity growth exceeding efficiency gains.

When Plans Meet Reality

The efficiency gains become more intriguing when viewed against operational headwinds. Flight-weighted average aircraft age jumped 17% to 11.6 years—exactly the opposite of what efficiency playbooks recommend. Post-COVID supply chain snarls and unexpected engine durability issues with newer aircraft meant airlines couldn’t simply buy their way to better performance.

Instead, they had to extract more from what they had. The result: proof that operational innovation can deliver efficiency gains even when fleet modernization slows. It’s a finding that challenges conventional wisdom about the primacy of new technology in driving environmental progress.

Fleet Reality

Supply chain constraints and engine reliability issues resulted in older aircraft handling more operations than planned, yet airlines still achieved significant efficiency improvements through operational optimization.

Beyond the Flight Plan

EmeraldSky’s analysis goes deeper than standard industry calculations, which often miss 15-25% of actual emissions by relying on theoretical flight plans rather than operational reality. The system tracks 47 variables across more than 100,000 daily flights—everything from actual taxi times and routing changes to weight variations and holding patterns.

This granular approach reveals efficiency improvements in unexpected places. Airlines didn’t just optimize cruise flight—they squeezed time from ground operations, streamlined routing coordination, and fine-tuned their networks. The 7.4% improvement represents the cumulative effect of hundreds of operational refinements, many invisible to passengers but clearly visible in the fuel burn data.

Data Methodology

EmeraldSky’s comprehensive tracking reveals operational efficiency improvements across multiple dimensions, including areas like ground operations and routing optimization that standard industry fuel burn calculations typically exclude.

What 18 July, 25 Already Tells Us

EmeraldSky’s real-time tracking confirmed what the industry suspected: July 18 was just the beginning. Emissions on 18 July 25 exceeded the 2019 record, and seasonal patterns suggest new peaks will become routine during Northern Hemisphere summer travel seasons.

The question now isn’t whether aviation will set more emissions records—it’s whether the efficiency improvement trajectory can accelerate enough to bend the curve. With easier operational gains likely exhausted and sustainable aviation fuel still comprising less than 1% of consumption, the industry faces the mathematical reality that continued growth will require more fundamental changes to maintain environmental progress.

For instance, the GE9X's 10% fuel efficiency gain could save Silk Way an estimated $1.2 million annually per aircraft, assuming current jet fuel prices. These savings are amplified by GE's investment in additive manufacturing and composite materials, which lower engine weight and further enhance performance.

ESG-Driven Investment Thesis

The GE-Silk Way alliance exemplifies how ESG alignment can drive shareholder value. GE Aerospace's $2.7 billion 2024 R&D budget—focused on hybrid electric propulsion and Open Fan architecture—positions it to lead the next phase of aviation decarbonization. For investors, this spending is not merely a cost but a strategic bet on technologies that will dominate the 2030–2050 regulatory landscape.

Silk Way's commitment to SAF and ISO 14001 certification also enhances its appeal to ESG-focused investors. While the airline has not yet disclosed 2024–2025 SAF usage metrics, the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) upcoming SAF accounting methodology (launching in April 2025) will provide a standardized framework for quantifying emissions reductions. This transparency will enable Silk Way to report progress toward net-zero goals, a key factor in attracting green bonds and ESG-linked financing.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Investors and the Planet

GE Aerospace and Silk Way West Airlines have forged a partnership that transcends traditional supplier-customer dynamics. By integrating advanced engine technology with a cargo fleet optimized for scalability and sustainability, they are creating a blueprint for the future of aviation. For investors, this collaboration offers dual benefits: exposure to the high-margin aerospace services sector and alignment with global ESG trends that are reshaping capital allocation. As the IATA's SAF reporting framework and CORSIA compliance deadlines loom, the GE-Silk Way model will likely serve as a benchmark for how strategic innovation and environmental stewardship can coexist—and thrive—in the post-pandemic era.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/aigc/hxcmp/images/compress-aime_generated_1758035026404.jpg.png,N,,2025-09-16 11:57:08.065450

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline’s history.** In addition, United’s Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

“Newark is operating better than ever and United’s future here is bright – that’s a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,” said Kirby. “I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.”

“Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,” said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. “United’s continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region’s world-class transportation infrastructure.”

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR’s maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

“We’re building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,” said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. “This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.”

United Invests More in Newark Destinations

As the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United’s industry-leading international network.

United’s most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR.
“We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.
Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market.
“Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says.","As the aviation industry races toward decarbonization targets, sustainable aviation fuel has emerged as the primary pathway to reducing emissions. However, the fragmented nature of business aviation’s supply chain creates several hurdles in securing consistent access to this critical fuel source.

“Business aviation operates in a fragmented ecosystem,” explains Kennedy Ricci, president of 4AIR. “Unlike commercial carriers that benefit from large, centralized fuel purchasing and dedicated airport infrastructure, business aircraft rely heavily on fixed-base operators and decentralized supply chains.

“This makes consistent SAF access more difficult, particularly at secondary or regional airports.”

The infrastructure challenges are particularly acute for smaller airports that serve business aviation. C.R. Sincock, II, executive vice president of Avfuel Corporation says, “The primary limitations to SAF availability stem from geographic and infrastructure constraints, particularly around access points like blending terminals and truck racks. With only a handful of blending facilities in operation, transporting SAF from these locations to smaller airports presents both economic and logistical challenges.”

The SAF landscape

The supply for sustainable aviation fuel chain remains in its infancy compared to traditional jet fuel infrastructure. “The SAF supply chain is still developing and remains relatively immature in breadth compared to the established production infrastructure for traditional Jet-A,” Sincock explains. “Currently, the primary pathway used to produce SAF is the HEFA-SPK process, whereby SAF is derived from used cooking oils and tallow.”

Production capacity, while growing, still lags significantly behind demand. “SAF production is steadily increasing but supply still lags behind the volumes required to both reach industry goals, like America’s SAF Grand Challenge to produce 3 billion gallons annually by 2030, and the various mandates in the UK and EU,” Sincock says.

This creates a complex web of challenges. “One of the primary challenges is the geographic gap between where SAF is produced, where it’s blended and where it’s ultimately used, making efficient distribution a logistical hurdle,” Sincock explains.

Commercial competition

The situation becomes more complex as major airlines sign substantial multi-year offtake agreements with SAF producers. “Larger hub airports are typically prioritized for SAF deliveries due to their existing airline contracts, robust infrastructure and direct pipeline supply from refiners,” Sincock explains.

“Access to pipeline-fed fuel storage enhances SAF distribution’s efficiency and economic viability.” This prioritization has become particularly evident in regulated markets. “This has become especially evident in the EU where mandates and different country’s regulations favor delivery to high-traffic airports within the producing country’s boundaries,” Sincock notes.

However, Sincock remains optimistic about business aviation’s position. “We don’t anticipate business aviation will be priced out or deprioritized in the USA, as business aviation has been at the forefront of adopting and integrating SAF into the supply chain,” he says.

The numbers support this assertion. “Business aviation continues to punch above its weight, while it accounts for roughly 4% of total jet fuel consumption, it is responsible for more than 10% of all SAF usage,” Sincock notes.

Despite this leadership, concerns about long-term access persist. Ricci says “Business aviation may not always command the same priority as commercial airlines in the SAF market. However, what offsets this is flexibility. Business aircraft can often refuel at airports with SAF availability, and many operators are leveraging book and claim models.”

Regional disparities

Geographic location significantly impacts SAF access, with notable differences between markets. “Europe, particularly in countries like the Netherlands, France, and Sweden, has more consistent SAF availability at major business aviation airports due to both regulatory pushes, for example blending mandates, and infrastructure readiness,”Ricci says. “North America is still largely opportunistic, SAF is available at a few key hubs but not widely.”

The European regulatory environment creates both opportunities and challenges. “In the EU, however, SAF is more challenging to obtain outside of major hubs,” Sincock explains. “This is largely due to legislated mandates that prioritize larger airports and airline carriers, making SAF access and logistics more difficult for smaller airports,” he says.

Some operators are finding innovative ways to address supply chain concerns through local production. Johan Emmoth, CEO and FBO manager at Grafair Flight Management in Sweden, has pioneered an approach that addresses environmental concerns about SAF transportation.

“Historically SAF has had to be transported over long distances, which sometimes leads you to think — how good is that for the environment when the fuel had to travel overseas or by trucks?” Emmoth explains. “What’s very interesting for us now is that Sweden actually has a refinery that can produce SAF locally and it is not too far from our FBO. We got our first locally produced SAF driven to us in a dedicated trailer that’s only used for full blend SAF. And it’s been pulled by a truck that only runs on 100% renewable diesel fuel, so it’s environmentally friendly.”

Storage challenges

The technical aspects of SAF distribution present both opportunities and obstacles. “From a storage perspective, SAF is treated simply as jet fuel. They both conform to ASTM D-1655 specifications,” Sincock explains. “Because of this, in most cases, SAF is intermingled with jet fuel in the airport’s established fuel storage system, and management systems carefully track its inventory.”

However, the distribution infrastructure creates more complex challenges. “To help lower supply costs, larger airports benefit from pipeline access and higher load capacity,” Sincock notes. “In contrast, smaller airports rely on a trucking system to deliver SAF. This may be a less economical option than pipeline transport, but it works within the system’s existing infrastructure.”

The scale of operations at smaller airports creates additional economic pressures. “Additionally, the scale of fuel uplift is smaller, making the business case for physical SAF delivery less compelling for suppliers focused on volume and throughput,” Ricci says.

Book and claim solutions

To address supply chain gaps, fuel suppliers have developed book and claim systems that allow operators to purchase SAF’s environmental benefits without requiring physical delivery at their location.

“Through Avfuel’s book and claim system, customers can purchase the environmental attributes of SAF, the emissions reduction benefit that is linked to actual SAF volumes delivered elsewhere,” Sincock explains. “This allows customers to claim the sustainability value without requiring physical SAF to be available at their specific location.”

The adoption of these programs has accelerated significantly. “We’ve seen a significant uptick, both in volume and in the sophistication of client questions,” Ricci says. “Operators, flight departments, and even fractional jet owners are now integrating SAF credit purchases into broader sustainability strategies. The demand isn’t just compliance-driven, it’s reputational and competitive as well.”

However, some operators prefer the transparency of physical SAF delivery. “I think book and claim will remain the major model. It makes the most sense,” Emmoth explains.

Market demand

The demand profile for SAF in business aviation shows encouraging trends. “Demand for SAF is growing steadily, driven by strong interest from sustainability-focused operators and Fortune 500 companies,” Sincock says. “The highest demand comes from those with defined ESG [Environmental, Social, and Governance] targets and active carbon offset programs.”

FBOs are responding with infrastructure investments. “Particularly at tier one and tier two business aviation hubs,” Ricci says. “FBO operators that have been early movers, have invested in tank modifications, SAF-ready fuel trucks, and staff training.”

Looking ahead, industry experts anticipate continued growth in SAF availability. “By 2030, I envision SAF being routinely available at most major bizav hubs in North America and Europe, with scalable options in Asia and the Middle East,” Ricci forecasts. “Pricing will likely remain at a premium, but we expect more stability and incentives to narrow the gap.”

Industry leaders identify several key areas requiring attention to accelerate SAF adoption. “First and foremost, we need consistent, stable, long-term policy support, such as tax credits and incentives, at all levels of government to encourage the significant investment required for SAF production,” Sincock says.

Awareness of SAF remains equally critical. “Secondly, ongoing education is critical, not just for end-users, FBOs and airports, but also for government agencies to build widespread understanding of SAF’s environmental benefits when clients are deciding to go in the green direction and making sure it’s not just green washing.

“Sweden has a history of flight shaming and environmental consciousness, so I think it’s a good to show SAF is an option but it’s up to the customer to choose whether they’d like to have.”

“Third, we must encourage end users to engage on how their flight departments can play a role in meeting corporate ESG goals through SAF adoption,” Sincock explains.

The path forward for business aviation’s SAF access will likely require a multi-faceted approach. While book and claim systems provide immediate scalability, operators like Grafair show that physical SAF delivery can work when supported by local production and dedicated infrastructure. The industry’s challenge lies not in choosing between these models, but in developing parallel systems that serve different market segments and operational needs.

Success will ultimately depend on continued investment in production capacity, infrastructure development, and education initiatives that help operators understand their options. As Emmoth notes, “You need to produce SAF and pump it into the system. What we’re doing puts SAF on the table for decision makers and big companies.” With business aviation punching above its weight in SAF adoption, the sector’s continued leadership in sustainable fuel integration will be crucial for achieving industry-wide decarbonization targets.",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/82-3756897089-68835a103ee28.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:56:11.528100

Plans to serve 160+ destinations from EWR this fall and winter – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin

United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark

NEWARK, N.J., Sept. 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- United CEO Scott Kirby was in Newark (EWR) today to celebrate the airline's operational turnaround at EWR and discuss the bright future for the carrier's premier East Coast hub.

This summer, United celebrated its best operational summer ever at EWR, putting the airport on par with JFK and LGA for on-time performance. In fact, United flights out of Newark arrived on-time more often this summer than flights operated by airlines out of JFK or LGA.*

These rankings come as more than six million people flew United on-time through Newark this summer, the most in the airline's history.** In addition, United's Connection Saver technology helped more than 28,000 customers make tight connections in Newark this summer.

Looking ahead to this fall and winter, United plans to serve more than 160 domestic and international destinations from EWR – more than any other airline in the New York City area – adding flights to popular cities like Rome, Venice, Porto, Marrakesh and Dublin. Domestically, the airline will add flights to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale and new cities including Palm Springs, California; Columbia, South Carolina; and Chattanooga, Tennessee.

Additionally, United expects to hire more than 2,500 Newark employees between 2025-2026 and will be the first airline to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for use at Newark.

""Newark is operating better than ever and United's future here is bright – that's a credit to the thousands of Newark employees who deliver for our customers and one another every day,"" said Kirby. ""I want to also thank Secretary Duffy, FAA Administrator Bedford, Governor Murphy and all the national, state and local leaders who helped ensure that Newark remains a safe and reliable crown jewel for millions of domestic and international travelers. As the FAA and DOT implement their plan of increased staffing and improved technology, the reliability and on-time performance of Newark will only get better.""

""Millions of passengers each year rely on Newark Airport for their travel needs. Over the past several months, we have worked diligently with our partners at the Port Authority and the FAA to move towards a return to full capacity at Newark Airport, and I am pleased with our progress,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy. ""United's continued investment in Newark Airport will serve as a significant economic driver for our region, creating thousands of new jobs for New Jersey communities. I thank United CEO Scott Kirby for his partnership in supporting our region's world-class transportation infrastructure.""

In April and May, challenges associated with air traffic control staffing, technology outages and runway construction led to a concentrated number of delays and cancelations out of Newark. But since that time, bookings and customer confidence in flying through Newark have bounced back thanks to efforts by federal officials, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and United employees, including:

Runway construction was completed two weeks early on June 2

Beginning in May, the FAA limited Newark flight operations to 68 per hour. This was down from a high of 86, a number that was well above EWR's maximum theoretical capacity even in ideal operating conditions. The FAA has tentatively limited flights out of Newark to 72 per hour through summer 2026.

In July, the FAA installed a new fiber optic network to support the air traffic control system

""We're building a brand new air traffic control system, and we started by addressing the challenges of outdated technology at Newark,"" said FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford. ""This summer, the FAA took immediate action to relieve substantial inconveniences to the traveling public—deploying a temporary satellite backup system, upgrading fiberoptic technology, expanding high-bandwidth telecommunications, increasing controller staffing, and limiting arrivals and departures. Through strong partnerships with the Port Authority and United, we made significant progress this summer.""

United invests more in Newark destinations

As the gateway to the Atlantic, Newark plays a critical role in connecting passengers to United's industry-leading international network.

United's most talked about 2025 destination, Nuuk, Greenland, will return to Newark for summer 2026 following a successful and enthusiastic first season.

This summer, EWR had more international departures (over 20,000) and more departures to Europe (more than 8,200) than any other United hub

This summer, all of United's 32 European destinations were served from EWR

In 2025, United serves 82 international destinations from EWR

EWR serves the most international destinations unique to United (seven) of any hub

By the end of 2025, United will have grown its international network in EWR by 12 destinations since 2018, including the six additions this year

EWR has more widebody departures than any other United hub

United hiring in Newark

United proudly employs more than 14,000 people in the Newark/New York City area, including more than 3,000 pilots at its pilot base and more than 5,700 flight attendants.

United looks to hire another 2,500 employees before the end of 2026.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Comes to Newark

United will be the first airline to bring sustainable aviation fuel to Newark, with plans to purchase up to one million gallons from Neste for use at EWR this year. United purchased more than 13 million gallons of SAF in 2024, more than any other U.S. airline.

The partnership builds on Luxaviation’s June investment interest in Haffner Energy’s SAF-dedicated entity SAF Zero. According to both companies, the agreement supports financing for Haffner Energy’s SAF production facilities across Europe by providing long-term purchase guarantees.

Luxaviation operates one of the world’s largest private aircraft fleets and pursues decarbonization through improved fuel efficiency, increased SAF usage, ground operations electrification and carbon offsets for remaining emissions. The Luxembourg-based company launched its Go-to-Zero Investment Fund in 2023 to foster SAF production development.

“Securing long-term SAF supply is not only an investment in our operations but a commitment to our clients and to the industry’s future,” said Patrick Hansen, chief executive of Luxaviation Group. “Together with Haffner Energy, we are setting the benchmark for how business aviation can accelerate the scale-up of sustainable fuel production across Europe.”

France-based Haffner Energy develops clean fuel solutions using biomass residues including agricultural and municipal waste through proprietary technology. The company has announced SAF projects in France and Iceland with full-scale production expected by 2030 to align with European SAF mandate requirements.

The European mandate requires airlines to blend SAF into jet fuel at 6 percent or higher ratios starting in 2030. Philippe Haffner, co-founder and chief executive of Haffner Energy, noted that securing long-term offtake agreements remains crucial for financing SAF production facilities.

“We are pleased with this offtake partnership with Luxaviation as it will significantly facilitate the financing of our SAF projects in Europe,” Haffner said. “These agreements guarantee SAF purchase at stable prices over periods exceeding five years.”

Both companies participate in Project SkyPower, an international chief executive initiative focused on accelerating SAF development and adoption. According to the companies, pricing assumptions fall within the lower end of current industry benchmarks.

The collaboration addresses policy goals including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan. The offtake agreement expects finalization by September 2026.

The Sunfusion project involves processing into sustainable aviation fuel – kerosene – and green alternatives for vessels. It received EU support and includes partners from Greece, France, Germany, Norway and Serbia.

Istanbul-based Türkiye Petrol Rafinerileri AŞ (Tüpraş) has several decarbonization projects underway, counting on the expansion of green energy markets. One of the endeavors is Sunfusion – advancing biofuel production from purified microalgae and oleaginous yeasts by utilizing state-of-the-art solar technologies.

The project, which runs until the end of 2028, received EUR 3 million through the European Union’s Horizon Europe program. Centre for Research and Technology Hellas (CERTH), known also by its Greek acronym EKETA, is the coordinator.

Ten partners include the Middle East Technical University (METU/ODTÜ), located in Ankara, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH) and Foodscale Hub (FSH), which is in Novi Sad, Serbia. The rest are from France, Germany and Norway.

Solar-to-biocrude efficiency must top 50%

Tüpraş, the largest oil refiner in Turkey, is majority-owned by Koç Holding and its related businesses. It launched Sunfusion to develop the conversion of microalgae and oleaginous yeasts using the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) method. Among the goals is to minimize costs, emissions and waste and achieve a solar-to-biocrude efficiency target of more than 50%.

The company and its partners intend to cultivate high-lipid, low-nitrogen microalgae and yeasts

The initiative involves photobioreactors, open raceway ponds and a solar thermal system supplying energy for the process. The company and its partners intend to cultivate high-lipid, low-nitrogen microalgae and yeasts.

Hydrotreatment units would have fractionation capabilities, for refining the biocrude into high-value fuels such as sustainable aviation fuel – kerosene – and alternative marine fuels.

First SAF supply deal in Turkey already in scope

In June, Tüpraş signed a letter of intent with Turkish Airlines for a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply arrangement. They claimed that carbon emissions would be up to 87% lower than from conventional jet fuel.

“We will begin SAF production next year at our Izmir Refinery by leveraging our existing facilities. We aim to finalize the investment decision for a new unit that will increase our SAF production capacity to 300,000 tons by the end of this year. The use of SAF is becoming a necessity under both international and local regulations for the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” General Manager of Tüpraş Ibrahim Yelmenoğlu stated.

It would be both the first production and supply operations in Turkey. The company revealed at the time that it would make the SAF from bio-based feedstocks.

Tüpraş has seven projects with support from Horizon Europe

Tüpraş said it has completed 17 projects under Horizon 2020 and that seven are ongoing through Horizon Europe. The company updated its strategic transformation plan in April, placing the focus on sustainable refining, SAF, zero-carbon electricity and green hydrogen.

These include a plant that purchased cattle from a rancher described by Brazilian authorities as the “largest destroyer of the Amazon” ever investigated.

Repórter Brasil obtained documents about DGD’s supplier chain and identified cases with connections slaughterhouses that bought cattle from ranchers fined for practices associated with large-scale illegal deforestation (more details below).

These cases raise a red flag about the potential harmful climate impacts of alternative fuels. Despite biofuels’ image as a ‘green’ fuel, the use of livestock inputs in their production can increase deforestation, warns Tim Searchinger, a senior researcher at Princeton University. “The reason land is being deforested is to meet growing demand for food and biofuels,” he says.

Deforestation accounts for around 13% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to UN estimates. In Brazil, it is the leading driver of such emissions.

On its website, DGD claims its industrial plant can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil diesel. However, it does not mention any measures to prevent the purchase of tallow sourced from deforested pastures. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

In addition to fueling cars and trucks, DGD’s Texas facility produces SAF – short for “sustainable aviation fuel” – a product intended to reduce the climate footprint of the aviation industry. Avfuel Corporation, one of the main independent jet fuel suppliers in the U.S., received the first SAF delivery from DGD in December 2024.

From forest destruction to biofuel production

According to customs documents reviewed by Repórter Brasil, DGD regularly purchases beef tallow from the Fasa group, a Brazilian company specializing in processing slaughterhouse by-products. DGD and Fasa belong to the same economic group, as the Brazilian company was acquired in 2022 by Texas-based multinational Darling Ingredients, one of DGD’s owners through a joint venture with Valero Energy. Also headquartered in Texas, Valero Energy is one of the largest fuel producers in the U.S.

The Fasa group has subsidiaries in the Amazon – called Araguaia and Rio Verde – which source tallow from various slaughterhouses in the region. The supplier’s history, according to official documents obtained by the report, includes Frialto, a slaughterhouse from Mato Grosso identified through GTAs (animal transport guides) purchasing cattle from a rancher arrested by the Brazilian Federal Police in 2023. He was accused by the Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office of clearing an area of forest equivalent to about 12,000 American football fields and is identified by the agency as the largest Amazonian deforester ever investigated.

One month after the arrest, Repórter Brasil revealed that Frialto had bought cattle from the rancher and his relatives. Now, the outlet has obtained an official letter from the government of Mato Grosso, dated October 2023, related to the renewal of Frialto’s operating license. In the document, a Fasa subsidiary is listed as the recipient of residues generated by Frialto. According to customs records, this same Fasa unit sent beef tallow to DGD multiple times between 2023 and 2024.

At the time of the arrest, Frialto stated it had suspended business with the rancher’s properties. Repórter Brasil contacted the slaughterhouse again to inquire about its dealings with Fasa and any measures taken to avoid sourcing from illegally deforested areas but received no response.

Fasa, Darling Ingredients, Valero Energy, and DGD also did not respond to requests for comment.

Another illegal deforestation case linked to DGD’s supply chain involves the LKJ slaughterhouse. Cattle movement records accessed by Repórter Brasil show that in July 2023, LKJ purchased animals from a ranch in Brazil’s Cerrado biome — called Apucarana Farm—which had 381 hectares embargoed after environmental authorities confirmed illegal deforestation. The Cerrado is another native biome in Brazil facing rapid destruction and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.

A Fasa subsidiary in Pará state regularly received residues from LKJ between 2022 and 2023, according to corporate documents obtained by Repórter Brasil showing truck routes for raw material deliveries. That same subsidiary also supplied beef tallow to DGD from 2023 to 2024, according to customs records.

When contacted, LKJ attributed the cattle purchase from Apucarana Farm to a failure in its internal procedures, stating that it has a policy of not buying from embargoed areas (see full response here). The company claimed it has since blocked both the farm and another property from the same supplier from future sales. LKJ did not comment on its business relationship with Fasa.

Like other slaughterhouses, LKJ is a signatory to an agreement with Brazil’s Federal Prosecution Office (MPF) that requires adopting anti-deforestation criteria in cattle procurement in the Amazon. In May of this year, MPF released audit results focused on LKJ’s operations, revealing that roughly 2,700 animals slaughtered by the company in 2022 – about 8% of the audited sample – did not meet the agreement’s criteria. It was the worst result among the six audited slaughterhouses in the state of Tocantins, where LKJ is located.

In 2023 and 2024, in addition to sourcing tallow from Fasa, DGD also imported tallow directly from Minerva, Brazil’s second-largest beef company, customs data show.

Last year, a study by the organization Mighty Earth identified the company as a client of deforester in the Brazilian Pantanal, who was fined with the highest penalty ever imposed by the Mato Grosso State Department of the Environment. The individual was held responsible by the state’s Civil Police for the destruction of 81,200 hectares of native vegetation – an area larger than the island of Manhattan – through the aerial spraying of pesticides containing chemicals also found in “Agent Orange.” At the time of publication, which used data gathered by Repórter Brasil, the company reported that it had blocked the rancher from future business.

Minerva’s plant in Araguaína (Tocantins state) is among those listed in customs documents exporting tallow to DGD. A 2021 Repórter Brasil report showed that this facility had purchased cattle from a rancher fined for illegally clearing 80 hectares of Amazon rainforest. Another investigation that same year revealed that the plant’s indirect supply chain included a farm where Brazilian authorities rescued workers from conditions analogous to slavery.

Minerva was contacted to comment on its cattle procurement policies and its relationship with DGD, but did not respond.

Brazil is exporting more tallow to the U.S.

In 2022, Brazil exported 63,000 tons of tallow to the U.S. In 2023, that number jumped to 202,000 tons. And in just the first five months of 2025, Brazil had already shipped 111,000 tons, according to data from the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, Trade, and Services.

The increase coincides with the acquisition of the Fasa group by Darling Ingredients. Last year, the U.S. was the destination for 90% of all Brazilian tallow exports.

Beef tallow is derived from bovine tissue waste and has a relatively low production cost, as it is extracted from less valuable parts of the animal, such as the carcass. Its use is often described as “animal recycling” and is commonly promoted as a solution for disposing of slaughterhouse residues.

Because it is considered a by-product, tallow is not subject to the same traceability requirements as beef. However, according to Searchinger, tallow is a valuable commodity for the food industry – it is, for example, widely used in animal feed. When diverted to fuel production, he explains, it increases the demand for vegetable oils and other fats to replace it. “This, in turn, increases pressure on land,” he says.

Searchinger argues that the growth of biofuels is only viable because of public subsidies. He believes that instead of supporting the sector, rich countries should fund environmental conservation in the Global South.

“A $100-per-ton CO₂ tax on airline tickets could generate a $100 billion annual fund. That money could be used to pay countries like Brazil to conserve their forests and boost livestock productivity in already cleared areas,” Searchinger suggests.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/desmatamento-parque-guaraja-mirim-alessandro-falco-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 09:57:05.334420

New Zealand has launched its first whole-of-sector Aviation Action Plan, with headline measures including permanent access to RNZAF Base Ohakea as an alternate runway for wide-body aircraft and targeted support for vulnerable regional air routes.

The 25-point roadmap, unveiled on 15 September at the Aviation Industry Association Conference in Wellington by Associate Transport Minister James Meager, sets out a programme of deliverables to address regulatory bottlenecks, workforce shortages, fragile regional connectivity and the transition to lower-carbon aviation.

“Aviation is vital to New Zealand’s economic prosperity and our way of life,” Meager said. “This plan is a practical roadmap that tackles the challenges head-on — from strengthening regional connectivity and passenger rights to embracing new technologies and building a skilled workforce.”

A major milestone for New Zealand’s aviation sector

The Action Plan is the first of its kind, developed jointly by industry and government through the Interim Aviation Council following the Air Navigation System Review.

It marks a decisive attempt to provide long-term leadership for an industry that contributes more than 5.6 per cent of GDP and supports thousands of jobs across tourism, trade, logistics and essential services.

Meager stressed that progress is already underway. “We’ve made progress on several fronts, including $30 million in loans from the Regional Infrastructure Fund to support regional routes, and the start of a first-principles review of Civil Aviation Authority funding,” he told delegates.

The Interim Council will now transition into a permanent Aviation Council to provide oversight and refresh the plan every three years.

Civil Aviation Authority reforms to support aviation growth

A central focus is on reforming the regulatory environment. The Civil Aviation Authority and Ministry of Transport will rework rules for emerging technologies such as drones and uncrewed aircraft, while also introducing a two-year rolling programme of rule changes to accelerate decision-making.

Certification wait times are to be shortened through better resourcing, digitised systems and automation of routine processes. The government’s stated ambition is a framework that is robust, internationally credible and agile, maintaining safety standards while supporting innovation.

Industry bodies have highlighted the need for such reforms. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has previously criticised New Zealand’s airport economic regulatory framework as “not fit for purpose,” urging changes to ensure fairer and more efficient outcomes for airlines and passengers.

Aviation workforce shortages and new training pathways

Workforce reform is another urgent priority. Ringa Hora, the workforce development council, will update pilot training by the end of 2025, creating an airline-approved qualification that can be completed more quickly and aligned more closely with industry needs.

A broader package will address retention, recruitment and diversity, with an emphasis on encouraging more Māori and women into aviation careers.

“The aviation workforce is critical to the success of the whole aviation system,” said Meager. “We need to make aviation an attractive and sustainable career path, so that the sector has the skilled people it needs to grow.”

International mutual recognition of licences will also be pursued, allowing skilled personnel to move more easily between jurisdictions.

RNZAF Ohakea runway access and future aviation infrastructure

One of the most eye-catching measures is the decision to make RNZAF Base Ohakea permanently available as an alternate runway for widebody aircraft by December 2026.

The move underscores the need for resilience in the face of disruption at Auckland or Wellington and highlights growing civil–military cooperation.

The plan also directs the mapping of future aviation infrastructure requirements, including capacity for sustainable aviation fuel, electrification of smaller aircraft, and new technologies such as electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles.

Airports and airlines will work with the government to ensure the system can adapt to next-generation needs.

Support for regional air routes and stronger passenger rights

The fragility of regional routes has been acknowledged with targeted support.

New Zealand’s regional airlines have faced mounting pressures in recent years, with rising fuel, maintenance and regulatory costs making thin-margin routes increasingly hard to sustain.

Smaller carriers such as Sounds Air and Air Chathams have struggled to finance new aircraft and maintain connectivity, with Sounds Air announcing the sale of five Pilatus PC-12s and the withdrawal of several routes.

The plan authorises the use of the Regional Infrastructure Fund to help small airlines acquire or lease aircraft, refinance debt on concessionary terms, and invest in IT systems to enable interlining with larger carriers. These measures are intended to secure lifeline connections for communities until market conditions improve.

Passengers are also in focus. By early 2026, the Aviation Council will introduce improvements to make air travel more accessible for disabled people, while the Ministry of Transport will review consumer rights against international benchmarks on disruption, refunds and compensation.

Sustainable aviation fuel and net-zero growth plan

In line with New Zealand’s target of net zero emissions by 2050, the plan outlines steps to support the uptake of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and alternative propulsion.

Work will begin in 2025 with Australia on regional supply chains for SAF, while the government will reaffirm its participation in the international Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Electric aircraft and uncrewed aerial systems are also flagged as opportunities to transform the economics of regional routes and create new markets in agriculture and forestry.

Air New Zealand’s recent decision to drop its 2030 carbon intensity target, citing slow progress on new aircraft deliveries and SAF availability, highlights the importance of these policy interventions in bridging near-term gaps and sustaining momentum toward net zero.

Permanent Aviation Council to drive accountability

Perhaps the most significant feature of the plan is its structure. Every action has a named lead organisation, a delivery timeline and a monitoring mechanism.

The new permanent Aviation Council will report annually to the Minister and refresh the plan every three years, ensuring that it remains a living document rather than a static policy exercise.

“This plan is not a one-off document,” said Meager. “It is a foundation for long-term change, with accountability built in, to make sure our aviation sector continues to connect us, lift prosperity and support communities across New Zealand.”

How New Zealand’s aviation plan compares internationally

New Zealand’s initiative sits alongside similar moves overseas. Australia’s 2024 Aviation White Paper laid out 56 policy initiatives spanning workforce, regional connectivity, regulation, safety and emissions.

The UK has also submitted its State Action Plan to ICAO, with comparable emphases on SAF and emissions tracking.

Indian Diesel Export to EU At 11 Month High Before a Looming Ban on Russian Crude Oil

Indian diesel exports to Europe surged to an eleven month high as EU plans to ban Russian crude oil from third countries. India exported 260,000 per day last month, 63% percent increase from July, reported Independent. European buyers are building reserves while they can to stockpile the oil.

Almost all the cargoes exported were from Reliance Industries, India’s largest private refiner. The EU banned the direct import of Russian oil in February 2023 and from January 2026, it will also ban the import from third countries.

China’s Push for Renewable Energy Can Fuel Global Energy Transition

China’s rapid adoption of green energy and reliance on electricity can result in the decline of the world’s usage of fossil fuels by 2030. Between 2015 and 2023, China’s final energy consumption fell by 1.7% across buildings, infrastructure, and transport and electricity use rose 65%, reported CarbonCopy.

China is investing heavily in renewable energy. In 2024, China invested $625 billion in clean energy, which is 31% of the global investment. This has also led to decline in power and technology prices that is helping many emerging economies shift to clean energy.

Fossil Fuels Subsidies in US for Have More Than Doubled Since 2017

The United States subsidises the fossil fuel industry of $31Billion per year. This figure has more than doubled since 2017 which is likely an understatement due to the difficulty in quantifying the financial gains from some government support, reported The Guardian.

According to the report, these handouts can pose a massive barrier to decarbonisation, which is very crucial to avoid the worst impact of climate change. US President Donald Trump’s signature tax-and-spend bill will further aggravate the issue as it is poised to hand out another $4Billion per year across the next decade.

“One percent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 percent of aviation emissions.
With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize.","Most corporate travel managers are still on their first steps of their sustainability journeys. It is clear that, no matter what the messages are that are emerging from the EU or the White House, that more companies are taking those steps.

Those companies in the early stages of their sustainability journeys will quickly mature thanks to the proliferation of technology and expertise in the market today.

“There is an expectation in the uplift of the quality of sustainability data to finance-level, audited data,” said CTM head of sustainability Lauren Hook. “What this means is the need for accurate and timely data will become increasingly important for businesses at both ends of the sustainability maturity spectrum.”

While we have seen that companies are reacting to regulatory pressure more than anything else in their sustainability strategies, peer pressure is also important.

“We are seeing very significant pressure being applied by some of the largest companies in the world, in particular, Microsoft, AstraZeneca, Salesforce, Schneider Electric and Siemens [are] asking their suppliers to report on their emissions and set up their own forward-looking targets,” said Adam Braun, founder and CEO of Clarasight.

“We actually believe that added business pressure is more powerful than just the regulatory pressure. Often, we're hearing from companies saying we need to do more than just report on last year's emissions. We now need to set credible targets going forward and then have both a system of record and a system of action to be able to credibly achieve that goal.”

Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Aspen believes we will see more carbon budgets being used by corporates. Indeed, Concur is set to facilitate carbon budgets in its booking tool this quarter.

In May, Thrust Carbon’s CEO Kit Apsen told BTN Europe that it will be the first organization to take advantage of the new capability, with “several corporates lined up for the initial rollout, including a mix of Fortune 500s.”

Aspen believes that carbon budgets at the team level will be the most popular. “How can an individual make that decision? If they think their trip is more important than their boss's trip in two months’ time they’re going to book it anyway,” he said. “There are also many places out there where there is only one flight a day. If your carbon budget said you now have to reduce your carbon by 10 per cent then that is useless information—you are going to take that one flight.”

He continued: “When you have budgets at a division level with 10,000 people, it is too impersonal. What does it matter that you are emitting one tonne of CO2 when the division still has thousands of tonnes to emit.” Teams are therefore the sweetspot where a budget is most meaningful and can truly change behavior and thus impact.

FLYING TOWARDS 2050

Decarbonizing aviation in particular will remain crucial to decarbonizing business travel by 2050. The figure below shows a range of different pathways that aviation might achieve net zero by 2050. It shows scenarios outlined by IATA, ICAO, the International Council on Clean Transportation and the Air Transport Action Group.

American Express Global Business Travel’s head of sustainability, Nora Lovell Marchant, said the figures reveal that “the low-hanging fruit is basically gone” but that sustainable aviation fuel, shown in green, is a major part of all these scenarios.

Operations (shown in yellow), such as using greener flight paths, and tech (in blue), like more fuel-efficient planes, make up another significant part of the emission reductions.

Carbon removal and market-based measures (light grey), such as carbon pricing in Europe’s Emissions Trading Scheme, are also important in many of the scenarios. Other scenarios leave residual emissions (in dark grey)—carbon emissions that cannot be removed by other methods—that need to be offset in some other way.

CONTROLLING DEMAND

Many of the scenarios include a purple bar denoting demand impact or reduction—i.e. reducing the demand for business travel.

Will fewer business trips be part of the solution? The BTN Intelligence survey showed that 46 percent of travel managers are promoting the use of virtual meeting tools instead of face-to-face travel, although few if any companies are mandating this.

Katharina Riederer, co-founder of eco.mio, said: “Obviously it's the best solution not to travel but the difficulty in our industry is that this industry exists because of travel, so reducing travel... no one really wants to push that. Also, when I do my booking, I have already decided that I have to travel and I have already got the approval.”

Nora Lovell Marchant said the pandemic showed that meetings could move to Zoom. “Now aviation traffic is growing because people know the value of business trips and putting people in front of people,” she said. “Are there some business trips that can and should be replaced with Zoom? Absolutely, but is there some business travel that will remain imperative forever? Absolutely.”

She continued: “We need to think about how to decarbonize that... because even the most liberal non-profit organizations recognize that other types of solutions besides demand management alone will be needed in order to decarbonize aviation.”

Benjamin Park, head of travel and sustainability at Parexel, expects sustainability in business travel to become more data-driven, with increased transparency and accountability. “Emissions methodologies will evolve, and corporates will need to adopt more granular tracking and reporting,” he said.

Park also believes that employee and customer expectations will increasingly influence corporate travel programs. “For roles requiring travel, the maturity of a company’s sustainable travel strategy may become a differentiator in talent attraction and retention,” he said.

Park added: “While cost management remains important, we are seeing a shift toward ‘purposeful travel’ where the value of each trip is weighed against its environmental impact. This mindset helps us reduce unnecessary travel while preserving essential face-to-face patient and customer engagement.”

As Advito’s senior director of sustainability Julien Etchanchu said, in spite of delays to the full roll-out of CSRD, “at some point, we will have to travel less not just because of the environment but because at some point there will be an energy crisis.”

Could unbridled aviation growth be managed through taxes and fees that are reinvested in the industry’s pursuit of net zero? “One percent of people on Earth are responsible for 50 percent of aviation emissions. People want to travel. At the moment, someone traveling once every 10 years is taxed in the same way as a business traveler traveling 20 times a year.

“The problem is you don’t pay for the pollution you make—that is the ultimate issue. You could imagine a frequent flyer levy where the first trip is free of tax, the second you start to increase it a bit and by trip 10 you are highly taxed and ever more highly in business class. The pressure for levies will grow,” warned Etchanchu.

With only 25 years to go until 2050, the aviation industry—and wider business travel sector—is running out of time to decarbonize. While plans, policies and ideas are rife, now is the time for action.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is reshaping the landscape of air travel and sustainable tourism by offering a viable alternative to conventional jet fuels. Airports and airlines across the globe are actively integrating SAF into their operations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and foster more environmentally responsible travel. Portland International Airport (PDX) and Delta Airlines are leading the charge in the United States, demonstrating a clear commitment to sustainability in aviation. These initiatives have implications beyond the aviation sector, extending into the tourism industry, where the demand for eco-conscious travel options is rapidly increasing.

Portland International Airport and Delta Airlines Leading SAF Adoption

Portland International Airport recently received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel, with Delta Airlines being the first commercial airline to utilize this blend. The fuel is composed of two main components: conventional jet fuel, which constitutes half of the mixture, and the feedstock, which provides the sustainable element. The blending process results in a fuel that can be directly used by aircraft without requiring modifications to engines or airport infrastructure.

The adoption of SAF at PDX aligns with broader efforts to improve local air quality and reduce carbon emissions. By transitioning to blended fuels, flights departing from Portland can contribute to lowering the airport’s environmental impact while supporting the local community. While the cost of SAF remains two to three times higher than conventional jet fuel, Delta Airlines has been actively working with suppliers to manage expenses and increase adoption without compromising operational efficiency.

Challenges and Criticisms of SAF

Despite the benefits, the use of sustainable aviation fuel has faced criticism. Some environmental organizations, such as 350PDX, argue that SAF could be a form of greenwashing rather than a definitive climate solution. Concerns have been raised about the risks associated with storing combustible fuels in sensitive areas, such as earthquake-prone zones along rivers. Additionally, producing SAF at the scale required to meet global aviation demand would necessitate an unprecedented increase in production, potentially leading to environmental impacts from land use changes and agricultural practices.

The debate highlights the importance of balancing innovation in sustainable fuels with rigorous oversight and accountability. Advocates emphasize that SAF should be part of a broader strategy, which includes alternative technologies, carbon offsetting, and innovations in flight efficiency to achieve meaningful reductions in aviation-related emissions.

Global SAF Integration in Airports

The adoption of sustainable aviation fuel is not limited to Portland. Airports worldwide are embracing SAF to reduce the carbon footprint of air travel and promote eco-friendly tourism.

Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), Malaysia: Petronas, Malaysia’s state energy company, supplied domestically blended SAF to Malaysia Airlines through the Malaysia Aviation Group. This initiative supports daily flights to London and contributes to Malaysia’s net-zero emission targets.

Ontario International Airport (ONT), USA: Neste has partnered with Amazon Air to supply SAF to Ontario International Airport. Amazon has become the first company in the region to purchase and utilize SAF, aligning with its commitment to achieve net-zero carbon emissions across global operations by 2040.

John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), USA: JetBlue has established a regular supply of SAF at JFK, reinforcing the airline’s dedication to reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable aviation.

Chicago Midway International Airport (MDW), USA: Southwest Airlines has entered a supply agreement with Valero Energy to provide SAF at MDW. This partnership represents the largest SAF deal in Illinois and supports Southwest Airlines’ sustainability goals.

Sydney Airport (SYD), Australia: Qantas and Sydney Airport have collaborated with Ampol to import 1.7 million liters of SAF derived from organic sources such as biowaste. The fuel will be used for up to 900 Boeing 737 flights between Sydney and Auckland, representing the largest SAF transaction in Australia.

Thiruvananthapuram International Airport (TRV), India: An open access fuel farm and aircraft refueling facility has been launched to enhance operational efficiency and sustainability. By centralizing fuel distribution, multiple oil marketing companies can share infrastructure, reducing emissions associated with redundant handling processes.

Airlines Leading the SAF Movement

Airlines are increasingly investing in sustainable aviation fuel to reduce environmental impact and support green tourism.

Emirates: The airline has successfully conducted test flights using SAF and has operated commercial flights with blended SAF on routes from Dubai to Sydney and London. Collaborations with Neste and Shell Aviation have ensured SAF availability at airports including Dubai, Amsterdam, and Singapore.

United Airlines: United Airlines has launched an investment fund supporting SAF startups and has secured agreements for future production of up to five billion gallons of SAF, surpassing other global airlines in scale.

Hawaiian Airlines: SAF has been incorporated on flights between Osaka and Honolulu under an agreement with Cosmo Oil Marketing Co., contributing to the airline’s strategy of reducing carbon emissions while fostering SAF market growth.

Cebu Pacific: The airline has signed agreements with Shell Aviation and Neste, completing SAF-powered flights from Singapore to Manila and from Narita International Airport to Manila. These efforts reflect a commitment to sustainable operations and regional eco-tourism promotion.

Bangkok Airways: SAF has been introduced on commercial flights, with a 1% blend to conventional jet fuel to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The airline continues to explore sustainable fuel sourcing partnerships.

Västflyg: The Swedish virtual airline has partnered with Trollhättan-Vänersborg Airport to operate flights entirely on SAF blends. Passengers can opt to purchase biofuel for flights, and operational strategies, such as flying at lower altitudes, are employed to further reduce fuel consumption.

Ecojet Airlines: A proposed British regional airline aims to operate a fully electric fleet powered by renewable energy once operations commence, potentially becoming the world’s first fully electric airline.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Tourism

Sustainable aviation fuel plays a crucial role in transforming tourism into a more environmentally responsible sector. Air travel contributes significantly to global carbon emissions, making SAF adoption vital for reducing the ecological footprint of tourism. By offering flights powered by SAF, airlines enable travelers to make more conscious choices, aligning travel experiences with environmental values.

The integration of SAF also presents economic opportunities. Investment in SAF production stimulates local economies, fosters renewable energy markets, and encourages innovation in green technologies. As SAF production scales up, costs are expected to decrease, making sustainable travel more accessible to a broader range of tourists.

Government policies and industry collaboration are critical in supporting SAF adoption. Incentives, blending mandates, and funding for research and development accelerate the availability and use of SAF across international aviation networks. Such collaboration ensures that airlines, airports, and fuel producers can collectively achieve meaningful reductions in emissions while supporting sustainable tourism goals.

Future Outlook

The future of sustainable aviation and eco-friendly tourism is closely tied to the continued development and implementation of SAF. Efforts to improve production technologies, expand infrastructure, and streamline supply chains will determine how effectively SAF can replace conventional fuels. Despite challenges such as high costs and production scalability, ongoing initiatives at airports and airlines globally indicate a growing commitment to greener air travel.

By integrating SAF into operations, airlines and airports are not only reducing carbon emissions but also enhancing the perception of tourism as a sustainable activity. Travelers increasingly consider environmental impact when choosing destinations and transportation options, making SAF a key component of the travel industry’s evolution toward sustainability.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation fuel represents a transformative advancement for the aviation and tourism industries. From Portland International Airport and Delta Airlines to global leaders like Emirates and United Airlines, SAF is driving a shift toward more responsible air travel. While challenges remain, including cost and production scalability, the adoption of SAF is enabling travelers to explore the world with reduced environmental impact. Through continued collaboration, investment, and innovation, SAF is set to become an integral part of sustainable tourism and aviation, ensuring that the benefits of air travel are balanced with the responsibility to preserve the planet.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sustainable-aviation-fuel-making-air-travel-easier-for-tourism-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:15.499889

While speaking to BW Businessworld, he emphasised that fuel producers bear the responsibility to innovate and reduce SAF costs while maintaining environmental sustainability, ensuring adoption is feasible across India, Europe, the US, and the Asia Pacific.

India’s aviation sector is growing rapidly, driven by rising domestic travel and expanding international connectivity. India currently accounts for roughly 2.5 per cent of global ATF demand, exporting nearly half of its production, highlighting the potential for domestic SAF adoption.

With the country poised to become one of the world’s largest aviation markets, concerns over rising carbon emissions are mounting. Aviation’s share in India’s transport emissions is expected to increase significantly. Policymakers and stakeholders are exploring sustainable alternatives like SAF to meet climate targets while keeping air travel affordable for India’s price-sensitive passengers without disrupting the sector’s growth.

According to the Deloitte study, Passenger traffic in India is projected to grow at about 10 per cent CAGR, rising from 220 million in 2023-24 to nearly 390 million by 2030. Freight volumes are expected to increase at a 13 per cent CAGR, from 2.4 million tonnes to 5.1 million tonnes. ATF demand is set to double to 15 to 16 million tonne.

Is SAF Feasible for India?

Achieving net-zero aviation emissions in India depends on integrating SAF with traditional jet fuel. Initial SAF blending mandates focus on international flights, but scaling domestic production is critical. Abundant feedstocks, including agricultural residues, sugarcane, sweet sorghum, and used cooking oil, offer a pathway to a competitive SAF ecosystem. Efficient integration of technology, rural supply chains, and production infrastructure is necessary to make SAF adoption practical, sustainable, and aligned with India’s aviation and climate goals.

India’s SAF blending targets are 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. SAF is expected to contribute 53 to 66 per cent toward India’s net-zero aviation targets by 2050. Key technologies include HEFA, alcohol-to-jet, fischer–tropsch and power-to-liquid. Domestic feedstocks such as agricultural residues, used cooking oil, sugarcane, and sweet sorghum can reduce carbon intensity by up to 84 per cent, making SAF technically feasible and sustainable for the Indian market.

“If you set up your SAF plant in the correct manner, it is very much financially viable,” Olsson said. He added, “The key is to rethink and innovate across the entire SAF value chain, from feedstock collection to final fuel production. At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the cost impact on Indian airlines is minimal. With careful planning, technological adoption, and efficient supply chains, SAF can be produced and supplied in a way that is practical, financially sustainable, and beneficial to all stakeholders.”

Can Airlines Afford SAF?

The high cost of SAF raises concerns for Indian airlines, particularly low-cost carriers. Gradual integration, blending mandates, and innovative pricing strategies are needed to ensure airlines remain financially viable. Oil companies and policymakers must support SAF production, blending, and logistics infrastructure. The goal is to maintain operational efficiency while meeting India’s environmental commitments, ensuring the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel does not disrupt the affordability of air travel for passengers.

SAF costs about two to five times more than regular jet fuel, depending on feedstock. Using agricultural residues costs USD 550 to 650 per tonne, used cooking oil USD 800 to 900 per tonne, and sugarcane USD 300 to 400 per tonne. Notably, domestic SAF demand at 5 per cent blending is expected to reach 0.8 million tonnes by 2030. With a production potential of 8 to 10 MT, India can meet domestic needs and even export. In India, over 3,000 crore Indian rupee has already been committed under central and state schemes to support SAF production.

“At low blending mandates of 1 to 5 per cent, the price impact on airlines is minimal,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “Airlines can manage SAF costs through a blended approach and adjust pricing strategies. Even low-cost carriers can adopt SAF without affecting profitability. European carriers like KLM and Lufthansa are already offering low-carbon flights at a small premium, showing that sustainable aviation can be integrated successfully while keeping operations viable.”

Does SAF Threaten Food Security?

Concerns about land use, crop availability, and nutrition emerge when SAF feedstocks come from agriculture. Effective SAF adoption must avoid disrupting food security while supporting rural development. Linking SAF production to farmer incomes, employment, and sustainable practices ensures socio-economic benefits. The challenge is to implement SAF policies that achieve environmental goals without straining India’s food system, ensuring that sustainable aviation fuel supports communities, airlines, and the nation’s climate commitments.

India’s SAF feedstocks, including crop residues and used cooking oil, can reduce carbon intensity by 72 to 84 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel. Crop Residue Management programs in Haryana and Punjab reduced stubble burning by 45 to 69 per cent, cut one million tonnes of CO2 emissions, saved lives, and increased farmer incomes by USD 14 million. Global SAF hubs, like Singapore Changi Airport, demonstrate integrated supply chains and modular blending, offering lessons for India’s aviation sector.

“Any sustainable SAF business in India must consider all stakeholders,” Jimmy Olsson said. He added, “It is crucial that SAF production supports rural livelihoods, remains affordable, and does not compromise food security or nutritional needs. A well-designed SAF ecosystem can uplift farmers, provide economic opportunities, and still reduce aviation emissions significantly. By addressing price, sustainability, and social impact together, India can develop a robust SAF market that benefits airlines, passengers, and communities alike.”

India’s aviation sector is at a critical juncture, balancing rapid growth with environmental responsibility. With domestic SAF production potential exceeding projected demand, the country can reduce aviation emissions while exploring export opportunities. Gradual blending mandates, supply chain innovation, and strategic pricing can allow airlines to adopt sustainable fuel without affecting profitability. Olsson highlighted, “With proper planning, innovation across the SAF value chain, and a collaborative approach, India has the potential to become a global SAF hub, benefiting airlines, passengers, and rural communities alike.”",https://static.businessworld.in/1605260979_mxTK8R_aviation.jpg,N,,2025-09-16 03:56:26.815464

Portland International Airport received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel earlier this month.

Zenith Energy hopes the Portland terminal will be filled with renewable energy, and the facility already has plenty of room to store sustainable aviation fuel.

JT Hendrix, terminal manager for Zenith Energy, said the fuel has two components.

“You have your conventional jet fuel, which is 50 percent of the blend, and the feedstock, which is the blending component. We blend those two together — that’s how you get your sustainable aviation fuel,” Hendrix said.

Portland International Airport received its first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel earlier this month. Port of Portland Chief Aviation Officer Dan Pippenger said in a statement,

“We’re excited about this step toward bringing sustainable aviation fuel to PDX. It’s a move that can help improve local air quality and cut down on greenhouse gas emissions, which is great news for our communities.”

Delta Airlines was the first commercial airline to use the fuel at PDX. But the cost to keep jets in the air isn’t cheap. Charlotte Lollar of Delta Airlines said the airline is working with different suppliers to manage expenses.

“Today it’s two to three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, so our ambition is to work through the supply chain to bring the cost down as much as possible,” Lollar said.

While flying with sustainable fuel is costly, Lollar said Delta is committed to lowering expenses while moving toward a greener way to take to the sky.

Not everyone is convinced sustainable aviation fuel is a solution. 350PDX, a Portland-based nonprofit focused on climate justice, shared a statement with KGW warning the fuel may be a form of greenwashing.

“The real problem here is that so-called renewable fuels and biofuels are a false climate solution,” the group said.

The statement added that Zenith’s operations already pose significant risks because the terminal stores highly combustible fuels on an earthquake liquefaction zone along the banks of the Willamette River. The organization also raised concerns about risks to local neighborhoods and public oversight.

“By adding ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ to their portfolio, they are supercharging that risk,” 350PDX said. “When you add the word ‘sustainable’ or ‘renewable’ it sounds better, but it’s greenwashing at best. First, this is still a fuel and it still releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Second, the land use changes needed to produce this fuel can lead to increased pollution and a decrease in nature-based carbon sequestration solutions. Third, ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ sounds like a complete solution, but to meet aviation needs it would require an 18,887% increase in production this decade, based on 2022 production levels.”

350PDX urged greater accountability from companies and wealthy individuals who contribute to emissions and called for a climate superfund to fund adaptation and resiliency efforts in Oregon.

“There are a multitude of options for innovation that do not require the sacrifice of North Portland communities or communities in feedstock production areas throughout the U.S. that are already dealing with the air, soil, and water impacts of monocrop agriculture,” the group said.",https://media.kgw.com/assets/KGW/images/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8/20250916T003735/3791fe97-baca-4b88-a149-25590ddd00b8_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-15 23:56:18.904983
