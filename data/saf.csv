This new platform directly connects airlines seeking SAF with producers offering supply, streamlining negotiations and accelerating the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry.

The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical challenges in the SAF market: Efficiency: By providing a centralised, no-fee platform, the Matchmaker simplifies and speeds up the procurement process, reducing costs and administrative burdens for airlines. This efficiency is expected to stimulate growth in the voluntary SAF market.

Secondly, the platform allows SAF producers to post available or planned fuel volumes, while airlines can register their demand. This direct matching mechanism facilitates better alignment of supply and demand, with final trade negotiations conducted offline.

Also, the comprehensive data on SAF offerings—including volume, feedstock, production technology, emissions reductions, and compliance with international standards such as CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive—ensures transparency and informed decision-making.

IATA’s senior vice president, Sustainability and Chief Economist, Marie Owens Thomsen, emphasised the platform’s strategic role in achieving aviation’s net-zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. She stated, “To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

Hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub—a centralised digital space for aviation energy management—the SAF Matchmaker supports both spot purchases and long-term offtake agreements. Initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers, the platform is expected to expand access to other buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, further broadening the market.

This innovation marks a significant step toward decarbonising air travel by facilitating easier access to sustainable fuels, which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. By enhancing market transparency and connectivity, the SAF Matchmaker is poised to accelerate the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources and support global climate goals.

With a Middle East crisis once again roiling global oil markets, a new report shows that American-made ethanol keeps gasoline prices down—saving drivers well over $50 billion each year, or 39 cents per gallon.

“As our nation again prepares to celebrate its freedom on July Fourth, this report demonstrates the enormous value of American-made ethanol in promoting energy independence,” said Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The United States is producing record volumes of crude oil and reducing its dependence on foreign sources. Still, as recent events have shown, the global nature of petroleum markets means that disruptions occurring halfway around the world can impact fuel prices here at home. Blending low-cost ethanol into gasoline is a proven strategy for reducing fuel prices and strengthening the U.S. market’s resilience against global supply chain disruptions.”

In the report, George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, an expert in petroleum refinery process research and technology management, analyzed the economics of substituting ethanol for refinery-derived gasoline, considering the effects on both octane value and energy content. Ethanol is a high-octane, low-cost component of the fuel supply. The report estimates the cost of refinery-derived octane to be 4.5 times higher than that of ethanol-derived octane.

Hoekstra concludes, “The energy equivalent substitution to a level of 10 percent ethanol implies that ethanol is adding a net of 39 cents/gal worth of octane to the U.S. E10 gasoline pool. To say this another way, if ethanol was removed from the U.S. gasoline pool, replacing its current octane contribution with refinery octane would increase refining cost and the wholesale cost of gasoline by 39 cents per gallon or $54 billion/year.”

E10, a blend containing 10 percent ethanol, is the predominant form of finished gasoline sold in the United States. Hoekstra also estimated that the cost savings per gallon of finished gasoline increase as ethanol content increases. The study found that using blends like E15, which are becoming more widely available in the U.S. market, results in even larger savings.

The study, which was commissioned by RFA, did not consider the other ways in which ethanol can contribute to lower gasoline prices, notably the aggregate effect of boosting U.S. fuel supplies by approximately 1 million barrels a day.

Neptun Deep Gas Project: A EUR 4 billion venture in Romania's Black Sea, this project aims to deliver 8 billion cubic meters of gas annually by 2027. By reducing reliance on Russian gas imports, Neptun Deep bolsters energy security while stabilizing cash flows through long-term gas sales agreements.

Geothermal Energy: OMV is pioneering deep geothermal systems in Austria and Germany, targeting climate-neutral heating for 200,000 households by 2027. These projects, supported by favorable regulatory environments, offer predictable revenue streams and align with EU decarbonization mandates.

Renewable Fuels: Investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) refineries—such as the EUR 750 million Petrobrazi plant in Romania—are scaling up to meet 250,000 tons/year of production by 2027. Contracts with airlines and corporate clients underpin demand, shielding profits from crude price swings.

Cash Flow Fortitude and Capital Discipline

OMV's financial strategy ensures that its transformation is both ambitious and sustainable. A key pillar is its focus on maintaining strong cash flow:

Operating Cash Flow Targets: OMV aims to achieve EUR 7.5 billion in annual operating cash flow by 2030, up from EUR 7 billion previously. This is underpinned by Brent oil prices of EUR 80/bbl and gas prices of EUR 25–30/MWh, which the company forecasts will hold through 2030.

CAPEX Allocation: 40–50% of its EUR 3.8 billion annual organic CAPEX is directed toward low-carbon projects, ensuring that sustainability goals do not divert funds from core operations.

Dividend Policy: A 5–10% annual increase in base dividends through 2030, alongside special dividends when leverage stays below 30%, rewards shareholders while preserving financial flexibility.

Operational Agility in a Volatile Landscape

OMV's adaptability shines in its response to market headwinds:

- Diversified Supply Chains: Gas sourcing from Norway, Italy, and the U.S. mitigates geopolitical risks, while polyolefins sales in high-margin specialty chemicals offset broader market overcapacity.

- Efficiency Programs: A EUR 500 million efficiency drive by 2027 aims to counter inflation and operational costs, reinforcing margins.

- Regulatory Readiness: Methane emissions have been slashed by over 70% since 2019, outpacing EU targets, and Scope 1/2 emissions are set to fall 30% by 2030.

Risks and Mitigation

While OMV's strategy is robust, challenges remain:

- Permitting Delays: Geothermal projects in Germany face regulatory hurdles, but OMV is engaging proactively with policymakers.

- Commodity Volatility: A prolonged gas price slump could strain margins, though Neptun Deep's long-term contracts provide a buffer.

Investment Outlook: A Steady Hand in Turbulent Waters

OMV's blend of cash flow discipline, low-carbon diversification, and operational focus makes it a compelling investment for long-term energy investors. With a leverage ratio of just 12% (Q1 2025) and a track record of shareholder returns averaging 10% annually, the stock offers stability amid market chaos.

Recommendation: Buy or hold OMV for investors seeking exposure to Europe's energy transition. The stock's valuation—currently trading at 5.2x 2025E EV/EBITDA—appears reasonable given its growth trajectory. Monitor execution of Neptun Deep and the Q2 2025 results (due July 31) for confirmation of its financial resilience.

In a sector rife with uncertainty, OMV's transformation is no gamble—it's a calculated bet on the future of energy, backed by the strength of its balance sheet and innovation pipeline.",,N,,2025-07-08 07:07:14.035942

Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.","Flexjet, a long-established force in the fractional jet ownership market (since 1995), and also one of the leading providers of jet cards, defines its jet card customers as “UHNW [ultra-high net worth] individuals, families, and companies”. According to Andrew Collins, the CEO of Flexjet, “a significant proportion have self-made wealth, distinguishing them as high-achieving entrepreneurs, investors and business leaders in sectors such as finance, real estate and technology”.

Collins explains that “one key demographic shift we are seeing is clients getting younger, with a growing proportion now falling in the 45-54 age bracket. Our average age for a new client was 58 in 2024, four years younger than it was in 2019”.

It’s easy to see why jet card programmes are gaining traction when you consider the alternatives, some of which require a CFO, a legal team and a meditation app. For example, outright ownership of a jet is the ultimate status symbol — until you’re managing hangar leases, crew contracts, juggling maintenance schedules plus the emotional burden of insuring a flying palazzo. It can cost tens of millions upfront and millions more per year in upkeep, and your jet will sit idle most of the time. It’s a bit like buying a château in Bordeaux just because you like the house wine.

Fractional ownership companies offer a “lite” version of this. About £375,000 typically buys 50 hours a year — but with some companies you’ll still pay monthly fees, compete for availability, and occasionally (with some programmes) share the ride, sometimes with someone else’s labradoodle.

Then there’s jet charter, which gives you on-demand convenience, but the price can yo-yo, especially in and around the glitzier fashion shows and swanky sports fixtures (hourly charter jet rates can oscillate between £3,700 and £11,000 for even the smallest jets during the Monaco Grand Prix).

These options all have their place for the right individual or corporate entity, but jet cards fill an important niche, with their blend of luxury, stable pricing (one of the main pulls) and availability at short notice. One call, or a few taps on an app (which most jet card outfits now provide) and your jet will soon be spooling up its engines on the tarmac while the galley is being topped up with Pierre Hermé macarons.

But before you reach for your Meisterstück to sign up there are a few endearing quirks to watch out for. Some jet cards charge by estimated flight time, others from “wheels up to wheels down”, meaning any scenic detour or weather delay becomes your financial responsibility. Then there are “repositioning fees” (aka ferry fees) — charges for when a private jet must fly empty to or from another airport to pick you up or after dropping you off. Some jet card providers absorb these, others trim them off your tab.

And what about that upfront retainer? With some cards your deposit sits safely in an escrow account, but with others it’s helping to fund the provider’s day-to-day operations. Meanwhile, lower-tier cards can be rigid, with fewer route possibilities, less perks, and aircraft that may lack the wow factor promised in the brochure.

Another aspect to look out for is that some card operators have their own dedicated fleet of aircraft (the best option for a consistent service experience), whereas others don’t own a single plane and rely on a pool of spare capacity sourced from an array of jet charter operators. Verifying what the set-up is should be high on your checklist before you take the plunge.

Finally (and this is something that many people forget to ask) check how much baggage allowance is included — bear in mind that smaller jets have very limited stowage space.

That said, jet card memberships are just the ticket for high-flyers who crave the perks of private aviation without too much palaver. They’re also useful for helping jet-set rookies dip their toes into the world of private aviation without getting out of their depth. According to Flexjet’s Collins, “we see our jet card as the perfect introductory programme for those looking to experience Flexjet, before considering the longer-term commitment of fractional ownership, which is generally for five years or more”. Many of Flexjet’s jet card holders do go on to become fractional owners, having experienced the Flexjet experience via its jet card programme, and as their flying needs and service expectations increase.

Which provider might be right for you? It comes down to the intricacies of quality, service, convenience and of course budget. There are about 45 jet card companies worldwide. Here are four of those with the upper hand.

Flexjet’s jet card — elevated simplicity powered by the Praetor 600

Flexjet’s European jet card is positioned as a stepping stone into private aviation. It’s a highly refined product tailored for individuals who want seamless access to a top-tier fleet, consistent service and a taste of what Flexjet’s fractional ownership model has to offer.

At the heart of Flexjet’s European jet card offering is the Embraer Praetor 600, an aircraft Flexjet knows intimately. “Flexjet was the launch operator,” Collins says. “It hits a sweet spot in terms of its performance, spacious cabin and category-leading range, which allows nonstop flights to New York or Dubai from northern Europe.”

With space for up to nine passengers and a dedicated cabin server, the Praetor 600 is designed for transcontinental travel, with a range of 4,018 nautical miles and endurance of up to eight hours. Cruising at 466 knots (roughly 536mph) it can soar at altitudes up to 13,716m (about 45,000ft) where the air is usually less turbulent than the layer of airspace wherein mainstream airline traffic operates. It also comes with a generous 4.39 cubic metres of baggage capacity — oodles of space for your Louis Vuitton Pyramide Bistens.

Flexjet’s card provides 25 hours of prepaid flying time, with guaranteed availability within 48 hours — or 120 hours during 25 peak travel days, plus 10 blackout days, with fixed hourly pricing set at €14,900 (£12,550 approx).

A huge plus is that cardholders benefit from access to Flexjet’s own fleet, ensuring service standards remain consistently high, and the company’s operation is underpinned by significant long-term investment. This year, it announced a $7 billion deal with Embraer, placing orders for 182 business jets with options for 30 more — an industry-shaping commitment that will help to keep its fleet among the most modern and efficient flying today.

Sustainability is another priority. Flexjet partners with the aviation consultancy 4AIR to deliver meaningful environmental action, including 300 per cent carbon offsetting on every flight. This goes beyond CO₂ to account for contrails and other emissions. Clients can also choose to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and contribute to next-gen flight research.

“This jet card,” Collins says, “is aimed at those who are looking for an exceptional service experience at the very top of private aviation with the simplicity of a jet card format.”

Jettly’s no-fuss formula for private jet travel

Jettly’s jet card programme offers clients flexible, transparent and cost-effective access to a global network of over 23,000 private aircraft, all with fixed hourly rates and no hidden fees.

“Our focus,” explains Justin Crabbe, the CEO of Jettly, ”is on delivering seamless, personalised private jet experiences without the complexities of ownership”.

The company’s “pay-as-you-fly” card starts at $50,000 (about £37,000) for 25 hours, with no minimum usage requirement and no long-term commitment. The service draws high-net-worth individuals, business executives and corporations. But Crabbe observes that “we’re seeing emerging interest from younger, tech-savvy entrepreneurs and a growing number of leisure travellers looking for safe, flexible alternatives to commercial flights”.

Jettly says it’s investing heavily in technology to enhance the customer experience, including AI-powered flight booking, digital membership management, and the integration of blockchain and NFT technology. “Our goal,” Crabbe says, “is to simplify private aviation while providing more transparency and flexibility for our clients.”

Still, sourcing aircraft from a global pool can raise concerns about consistency — something Crabbe is quick to address. “We rigorously vet and partner with top-tier operators globally. Every aircraft meets our safety, maintenance and service standards,” he says. “Our dedicated concierge team works closely with clients and operators to tailor each flight to their preferences.”

Unlike some rivals, Jettly promises “no blackout dates”, Crabbe confirms. “We offer guaranteed availability with as little as ten hours’ notice.”

Sustainability is also on the radar. Jettly provides optional carbon offsetting and is “exploring partnerships with sustainable aviation fuel providers”.

Asked how he thought the private aviation market would evolve over the next 5-10 years, Crabbe says he anticipates continued growth, driven by evolving traveller expectations, technological advancements, and increased focus on sustainability. “Blockchain and digital platforms will likely reshape ownership and access models, while sustainable aviation fuel and hybrid-electric aircraft will become more prevalent.”

NetJets — the discreet card behind 500,000 flights a year

Backed by Berkshire Hathaway, NetJets runs one of the busiest private aviation operations in the world, with over half a million flights annually and a fleet that includes aircraft from Bombardier, Cessna and Embraer. Customers include over 40 of the Fortune 100 companies (over 50 professional golfers choose NetJets year after year).

The company itself has a vast footprint, with a global team of over 9,000 employees with on-site support at its most popular global destinations. Cardholders get access to a 24/7 service team, and at many major hubs its “NetJets Service Representatives” assist with arrivals and departures.

The price of a NetJets Card begins at $200,000 to $300,000 (£148,000 to £221,000) (depending on which aircraft type you sign up for), with “no hidden expenses and ferry fees”. Every NetJets Card (beginning with its offering that unlocks 290 days of annual access) is prepaid in 25-hour increments. Jet card “owners” (NetJets’ name for its card customers) have 24 months to use their flight hours.

Inside the cabin, there’s consistency across the fleet. The interiors lean towards a minimalist, functional style — pale leather seats, dark woods and neutral textiles. Materials are chosen for durability and sustainability, and the company was one of the first to pioneer a sustainability initiative in the private jet sector — “Blue Skies”, which has been running since 2008. All cardholders are automatically enrolled and contribute to carbon offset projects tied to the number of hours they fly.

For those who value privacy, tail numbers (registration numbers visible just underneath the tail of every aircraft) are never publicly linked to clients, and boarding is typically via private lounges — so customers can rest assured they won’t be tracked (and their whereabouts shared on social media) by celeb stalkers.

Additionally, NetJets invests in numerous art, food and wine, music, yachting and premier sports events (including golf, equestrian sports, tennis and motorsports). And from complimentary upgrades to once-in-a-lifetime experiences, customers gain access to exclusive benefits through more than 50 premier partnerships with other luxury brands (the company’s present and past collaborations include such brands as Mercedes-AMG, luxury yacht brokers Northrop & Johnson, and Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts).

VistaJet — the wild card

Then there’s VistaJet. VistaJet defies categorisation, but it is a heavyweight contender. It’s a jet membership programme, yet it sidesteps the “card” badge — and it’s not a charter operator either.

“VistaJet is not a jet card offering. We have a solution for every private aviation client through our VistaJet and XO brands,” insists Thomas Flohr, the founder and chairman of Vista Global Holding. The Swiss billionaire set up the Vista brand in 2004 (a year after he bought his first Learjet) to offer “more than transportation … a way of life, exquisitely tailored to those who fly not just often, but well”.

The Vista group includes aircraft management, leasing and flight operations solutions, making it a one-stop shop for every kind of private aviation client. It owns its entire fleet of 270 aircraft, so every seat, surface and smile in the sky is under their Vista brand — no charter roulette here.

The core proposition, VistaJet, focuses on guaranteed availability and a polished experience, with fine bed linen, cashmere blankets, and Christofle silverware and porcelain on board. Its “cabin hosts” are trained by the British Butler Institute and MedAire (aviation specialists providing life-saving training, medical kits, and expert advice from aviation medical doctors and security experts).

VistaJet’s “50-hour-per-year Program Membership” offers a fixed hourly rate locked in for three years. So whether you’re flying at Christmas, Easter, or during peak summer, the price stays blissfully the same. Hourly rates for different aircraft types vary. For example, the Challenger 350 (an eight-seater aircraft with 7 hours’ flight endurance) starts at about $15,000 (£11,000) per hour, while Global 7500 options (with 14 seats and a 17-hour non-stop flight capability) are about $25,000 (£18,445) per hour.

Every booking is supported by Vista’s global team of 4,000, offering service 24/7 across all time zones. You can also switch between aircraft types, because some days you need an Embraer Phenom 300 (with 6 seats), while at other times you might be travelling with a larger entourage, so one of VistaJet’s Embraer Lineage 1000E jets with 18 seats might be a better play.

VistaJet’s service is augmented by brand sibling XO, which is your on-demand option for private aviation via smartphone, a kind of skyborne “Uber”. In short, VistaJet is white-glove precision, while XO is sleek spontaneity.

At the heart of Vista is a fleet that isn’t bound to any single location — what Flohr calls a “floating fleet concept”. This ensures that, wherever you are in the world, a beautifully appointed aircraft is just 24 hours away. “We guarantee an aircraft available to fly our Members anytime and anywhere,” Flohr adds, “with the highest level of service, and a consistent experience on every flight.”

Even pets and children receive VIP treatment. From the VistaPet service (which includes VistaPet Pochette — a travel bag on board every flight containing “bio-organic animal treats, water-free shampoos, soothing wipes and toys to keep companions entertained throughout the flight”) to “Adventures in the Sky” experiences for younger flyers, every detail is considered. “We want you to feel a sense of familiarity. It should feel easy, almost like home,” Flohr says.

Sustainability, too, isn’t an afterthought. Vista has contracted 4.2 million US gallons of blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and offset over 2.2 million tonnes of CO₂ on behalf of clients. Still, Flohr insists, it’s the blend of innovation and human touch that defines Vista. “It’s all designed to create a smooth, personal, and efficient experience.”

From curated menus by the triple Michelin-starred chef Mauro Colagreco to exclusive itineraries via Private World (Vista’s collection of premium experiences, events and destinations delivered in partnership with an ecosystem of partners — an essential element of the Member experience), Vista offers far more than a seat in the sky. “If our members are at Le Mans, we want to be there too,” Flohr says.",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7bfa04c6-84ba-4f9c-a6d0-bf6f01ab8800.jpg?crop=5584%2C3141%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:41.412353

CORSIA, launched in 2016, is a market-based mechanism aimed at capping and gradually reducing carbon emissions from international flights. Vietnam’s participation begins during the scheme’s final voluntary phase and reflects a significant step toward its broader decarbonization goals. The country aims to cap emissions at 85% of 2019 levels between 2024 and 2035, with a long-term target of achieving net-zero emissions in aviation by 2035.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the government has taken several preparatory steps to meet CORSIA requirements. These include drafting regulations on aviation fuel standards and emissions tracking, implementing Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) mechanisms for international flights, and submitting historical emission data from 2019 to 2024 to ICAO.

While ICAO has commended Vietnam for demonstrating strong readiness among developing countries, industry experts warn of substantial financial implications for domestic carriers. Estimates suggest Vietnamese airlines could spend between USD 5.6 million and USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits, depending on market fluctuations. Over the voluntary phase, total offset costs could reach between USD 13 million and USD 92 million, based on carbon credit prices ranging from USD 6 to USD 40 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent.

Airlines Respond with Sustainability Investments

Vietnam’s major carriers have already begun preparing for the transition. Vietnam Airlines, buoyed by a strong post-pandemic recovery and successful debt restructuring, reported a record net profit of VND 7.95 trillion (approx. USD 304 million) in 2024. The airline has reaffirmed its commitment to reducing emissions through fleet modernization and greater adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

In 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first SAF-blended international flight on the Singapore–Hanoi route, followed by six SAF-powered domestic flights to commemorate World Environment Day.

Low-cost carrier Vietjet Air is also aligning its operations with CORSIA’s goals. In June 2025, the airline finalized a purchase agreement with Airbus for 100 A321neo aircraft. The new jets promise at least 20% improved fuel efficiency and can operate on up to 50% SAF, positioning Vietjet for a more sustainable future.

As Vietnam prepares for full integration into CORSIA, the government continues to explore ways to balance environmental responsibility with economic sustainability, particularly for its aviation industry, which plays a critical role in national connectivity and tourism.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/18-3.png,N,,2025-07-08 01:58:48.982431

In an effort to help airports prepare for the impacts of climate change, ACI APAC & MID presented a paper on “Climate Adaptation Guidance and Tools for Airports.” The paper unveiled a major 18-month initiative that will deliver tools and guidance materials to help airports put adaptation measures in place.

The initiative has already garnered strong momentum, with 60 airport operators representing 224 airports committed to the study. A dedicated Task Force, including members such as Bahrain International Airport, Darwin International Airport, Dubai International Airport, Hong Kong International Airport, Narita International Airport, and Singapore Changi Airport, has been formed to steer the project.

According to a statement issued by CARB on June 27, OAL has now approved the LCFS regulations, allowing the amendments to take effect on July 1.
“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph.","The California Air Resources Board on June 27 announced amendments to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulations will take effect beginning on July 1. The amended regulations were approved by the agency in November 2024, but implementation was delayed due to regulatory clarity issues.

CARB on Nov. 8 approved updates to its LCFS that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045. The updates also include a variety of technical changes to the LCFS program, including those requiring fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; requiring independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; prohibiting palm-derived fuels from receiving credits; placing a cap on the use of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels; and updates that phase out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane as a combustion fuel but extend the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen.

Under California law, the State’s Office of Administrative Law must review rulemakings proposed by state agencies to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act, a state law that governs the rulemaking process. One component of that law deals with clarity, requiring regulations to be easily understood the people directly affected by them.

CARB submitted its final regulatory package on the approved LCFS amendments to OAL on Jan. 3. OAL on Feb. 18 notified CARB of its intention to disapprove the LCFS amendments citing “clarity” issues.

CARB on Feb. 25 received a Decision of Disapproval of Regulatory Action from OAL, which details the reasons for the disapproval. That document indicates that OAL has identified 26 proposed regulatory provisions where additional modifications may be necessary to ensure the regulatory provisions can be “easily understood by those persons directly affected by them.”

Under state law, CARB had 120 days to rewrite and resubmit the amendments to OAL.

According to a statement issued by CARB on June 27, OAL has now approved the LCFS regulations, allowing the amendments to take effect on July 1.

“Implementing the July 1 effective date for the LCFS provides critical certainty to industry, as well as the LCFS credit market,” said CARB Board Chair Liane Randolph. “But often lost in the noise around this program are our primary reasons for approving it: better health for Californians, our economy and the environment, as well as achieving required state and federal air quality standards.”

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.
Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.
To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.
“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said.","A domestic low carbon liquid fuel (LCLF) industry could contribute up to $36 billion to the economy and reduce emissions by 230Mt by 2050 – but only if it acts promptly, according to a new report published by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC).

The report, Refined Ambitions: Exploring Australia’s Low Carbon Liquid Fuel Potential, found that LCLFs are crucial to Australia’s net-zero future, particularly for sectors such as aviation, mining, heavy freight and defence, where electrification is challenging.

It was commissioned by the CEFC and developed by Deloitte, in consultation with industry participants, investors, researchers and government stakeholders.

CEFC CEO, Ian Learmonth, said LCLFs are a present-day necessity for sectors that can’t electrify.

“If we get the settings right, Australia can lead in clean fuels innovation and production – not just supply the feedstocks.”

Learmonth said Australia has all the ingredients to be a clean fuel superpower – abundant feedstocks, world-class research, and growing demand.

“Policy accelerators, including mandates, certification schemes and offsets, are key components to assist the industry reach scale. The first movers will reap the rewards of this global market.”

The report’s key findings include:

$36 billion market opportunity by 2050: A domestic LCLF sector could contribute significantly to Australia’s economic growth and clean energy exports.

230Mt CO₂-e savings: Cumulative abatement over the next 25 years, equivalent to nearly half of Australia’s annual emissions.

Fuel security risk: 80 per cent of Australia’s liquid fuel is imported, costing $50.7 billion in 2023, which the report said exposes the nation to supply chain shocks.

Untapped potential: Australia exports $3.9 billion in LCLF feedstocks such as canola and tallow, but lacks local refining capacity to realise full value, according to the report.

Persistent demand: Even with rapid electrification, large quantities of liquid fuel could still be needed by 2050.

The report said that without domestic LCLF production, Australia remains vulnerable to geopolitical disruptions and misses a significant economic opportunity, particularly for regional areas.

It points to earlier CSIRO modelling that indicates that Australian feedstock could produce billions of litres of LCLFs annually by 2050, utilising existing land and practices without impacting food production.

The CEFC said its report aligns with the Federal Government’s Future Made in Australia agenda, showing how clean fuel production can bolster sovereign capability, create regional jobs and meet climate targets.

CEFC Executive Director, Rupert Maloney, said, “We export the raw materials but miss the opportunity to build the industry here at home. This is about regional development, national resilience, and emissions reduction, all at once.”

Despite the growing momentum and a pipeline of more than two billion litres in proposed projects, the report found that Australia’s LCLF industry faces significant structural, financial, and regulatory challenges.

It found that the cost of production remains higher than that of conventional fuels, while the lack of national mandates has limited investor confidence and demand certainty.

Additionally, the report found that emerging fuel technologies require further R&D and de-risking before they can be commercially deployed at scale. The report identified key hurdles:

Cost gap: LCLFs remain more expensive than fossil fuels without policy support.

Policy potential: By introducing targeted policies, such as mandates, national procurement programs and low carbon fuel certification, Australia can provide the demand certainty and price signals needed to scale a local clean fuel industry.

Investment risk: Next generation fuel technologies need R&D support and commercial de-risking.

To close the gap between potential and reality, the report outlines an actionable framework to help scale Australia’s LCLF industry.

The roadmap focuses on enabling market demand, lowering investment risk, supporting innovation, and coordinating the value chain, drawing on proven models from clean energy and international biofuel markets.

With the correct settings in place, the CEFC said that Australia can unlock a globally competitive and sovereign clean fuels sector. To take advantage of this opportunity, the report details seven key steps:

Improve market access – e.g., trade relationships

De-risk investments – e.g., concessional finance to de-risk private capital

Reduce transaction challenges – e.g., standardised contract terms

Consider credible demand signals – e.g., sustainable aviation fuel and freight fuel blending mandates

More transparent data on demand, supply and feedstocks

Leverage innovation to reduce costs and support for advanced fuel technologies – e.g., hydrogen-based e-fuels

Better coordination and alignment across the value chain – e.g., from feedstock supplier to fuel producer to end user

Maloney said with the right market signals and collaboration, Australia can build a globally competitive clean fuels industry and lead the region in climate-era innovation.

“Clean fuel plants could revitalise manufacturing hubs and create skilled careers in some areas hit hardest by the decline of fossil fuels,” he said. “But we need investment commitments this decade to avoid missing the window.”",https://www.energymagazine.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AdobeStock_1551469663-Large.jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 21:02:42.928038

The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement.
Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly.
Farmers got an additional boost, receiving higher tax credits for the production of sustainable aviation fuel from corn ethanol and soybean oil.","Aviation industry stakeholders are praising the budget and policy bill signed by President Trump on July 4, primarily due to the $12.5 billion it provides for an overhaul of air traffic control (ATC) systems.

However, those same stakeholders are already noting that substantially more funding will be needed in the coming years to complete the ambitious ATC transformation, especially within the four-year timeline that Transportation Department Secretary Sean Duffy has laid out.

Among the advocacy groups quick to praise the bill were Airports Council International -- North America, Airlines for America and the Modern Skies Coalition -- a group of 50-plus stakeholders that formed for the purpose of supporting an ATC overhaul.

""This is a meaningful first step toward replacing outdated technology and aging facilities with the tools needed to keep our skies safe and efficient for decades to come,"" the Modern Skies Coalition said.

The group, which has estimated that completing the ATC overhaul will cost at least $31 billion, also said that it ""remains committed to working with lawmakers, regulators and industry partners to ensure that the system is fully staffed and that this investment translates into real progress, guaranteeing the United States will continue to have the safest aviation system in the world.""

The largest ATC components in the budget bill are $4.75 billion for ATC telecommunications infrastructure and $3 billion for radar systems replacement. Another $1.9 billion would go toward constructing a new air route traffic control center to handle midflight air traffic, above 20,000 feet.

Airlines for America CEO Nick Calio was effusive in his praise of the White House.

""Few people have had the gumption to take on the vast undertaking of modernizing our nation's complex ATC system, but President Trump and Secretary Duffy addressed the dire need quickly and are acting with urgency,"" Calio said.

But he, too, stressed that more money will be needed.

""We look forward to working with the administration as we continue to advocate for additional funding for staffing and technology to make President Trump's vision of a new golden age of air travel a reality.""

Aviation stakeholders have been calling for faster and more effective action in upgrading the ATC system for decades as the multibillion-dollar NextGen program that began in 2007 under-delivered and was implemented haltingly. But their calls gained more traction and vocal support from Trump and Duffy following the January collision of an Army helicopter with an American Airlines regional jet near Washington D.C. ATC failures this spring that led to ATC outages and flight delays at Newark Airport were also a rallying cry.

The budget bill also won praise from airports for the more than $6.1 billion it includes for hiring and for bonuses for Customs and Border Protection personnel.

""Funding 5,000 additional CBP officers will improve the processing experience for passengers and cargo moving through our airports, seaports, and land ports,"" Airports Council International -- North America said.

The bill also has other impacts on aviation. Notably, it extends by two years, until 2029, a tax credit for of up to $1.75 for producers of sustainable aviation fuel.

The credit survived despite the Trump administration's hostility to climate-change initiatives, due in large part to support from farmers.

“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.” How are e-fuels developed?
“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.
“In Europe, e-fuels are primarily used for fuel in aviation, given EU mandates around SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and ESAF.","E-fuels have long been helping Europe decarbonise its rail network – and with Nordic Electrofuel recently signing an MoU for an e-fuel production plant in Saudi Arabia, Australia could soon follow in its tracks.

The plant, due to be built in 2030, is one of several Nordic Electrofuel is developing in the region, with a similar facility in Oman also in the works.

Once complete, the infrastructure will help meet future e-fuel demand from Australia – a market which Chief Executive Officer Gunnar Holen expects to be large.

“E-fuels are great for any country looking to decarbonise their transport networks,” he said.

“Unlike electric and hydrogen-powered trains, which cost millions, e-fuels can be used with existing diesel locomotives and don’t require new infrastructure.

“At the same time, they are a clean and carbon-neutral fuel, with proven efficacy in both rail and aviation.”

How are e-fuels developed?

E-fuels are synthetic fuels based on renewable energy.

“You start with traditional hydrogen production, then mix with captured carbon dioxide to create a gas,” Holen said.

“You then undertake Fischer-Tropsch and come out with fuels, which can be optimised for their various end uses. For example, e-kerosene for aviation.

“We also derive valuable byproduct from the oxygen, which we can sell for industrial purposes.”

While the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process can be carbon-intensive, it has the potential to be carbon-neutral or even carbon-negative, depending on the source of its feedstock and energy inputs.

The carbon intensity is influenced by the source of the carbon and hydrogen used in the process.

The finished product, the e-fuel, is also carbon neutral and void of particulates.

“In rail, particulates, like soot, can be more damaging for the environment than carbon dioxide, so this is a key benefit,” Holen said.

Advantages

As well as being cheaper, e-fuels offer various advantages over clean transport alternatives.

While hydrogen trains are an attractive prospect to operators with larger budgets, Holen warns they are challenging to distribute and carry unique safety risks.

“There is a risk of explosion and, because of that, public caution around them,” he said.

“They also lack the necessary infrastructure. Back in the day, pure hydrogen-powered vehicles were promising in Norway. But the infrastructure hasn’t developed at all, and we only have a handful of filling stations.”

Electrification of the rail network is an equally popular clean transport option, but one which requires a supportive grid.

“If you have the time and the budget, great. Because there will be no emissions from an electrified train network. But for many, quicker, cheaper and more viable solutions are needed.”

Global developments

For these reasons, e-fuels have already become popular in Europe, with Germany representing its largest market, and Finland and Sweden set to become close contenders.

Holen said that as more plants open, e-fuels will become more cost-efficient and widespread around the world.

“We are currently developing several new plants here in Norway, including one we are looking to build equity for, in Herøya , 160 km South of Oslo. We also have plans to make a large fuel plant there.

“We are also extensively engaged in the middle East, working with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu in Saudi, as well as Canada and Sweden.”

While Nordic Electrofuels primarily deals with the European market, Holen believes APAC demand could soon catch up.

“In Europe, e-fuels are primarily used for fuel in aviation, given EU mandates around SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] and ESAF. It’s a strong market for us.

“But with our upcoming developments in Saudi and Oman, we will be able to cater more readily to the likes of Australia.”

Further insight

Sharing more on his expansion plans and weighing up the pros and cons of e-fuels in rail, Gunnar Holen will present at the upcoming Rail Decarbonisation and Resilience Conference, hosted by Informa Connect.

This year’s event will be held on July 22-23, 2025 at the Swissotel Sydney.

Key topics will include climate-adaptive design, asset resilience, emergency response, and cyber resilience, alongside solutions in clean traction power, alternate fuels, and energy-efficient operations.",https://www.railexpress.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gunnar-Holen-2.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 17:12:16.742426

Evaluating the OBBBA’s Energy Provisions Simplicity, Efficiency, and Fiscal Sustainability The IRA uses tax subsidies to encourage the production of clean energy.
It is worth noting that there is a tension between efficiency of clean energy tax credits and the conventional meaning of tax efficiency, as clean energy tax credits are designed to change taxpayers’ behaviors and encourage them to switch to the consumption of clean energy technologies.
The OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise approximately 60 percent of the total revenue if the legislation were to fully repeal all the energy provisions.","Executive Summary

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, includes provisions to overhaul the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); these provisions are estimated to raise approximately $499 billion in net revenue from 2025–2034.

Among these eliminated energy credits are the clean vehicle credits, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits, clean hydrogen production credit, and a phaseout of other credits including the clean electricity production and investment credits, which together are estimated to raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The legislation also expands some energy provisions such as the clean fuel production credit and advanced manufacturing credit, which are estimated to cost about $44 billion over the same period.

Overall, the OBBBA’s energy provisions do not make much progress in conforming the IRA’s energy credits to the good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability, and while some of the provisions greatly enhance the simplicity and efficiency of the energy credits and raise some revenue, others make the credits much more complex and inefficient.

Introduction

The One Big Beautiful Act (OBBBA), signed into law on July 4, 2025, includes extensive energy provisions to overhaul the clean energy credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which are estimated to raise approximately $499 billion in net revenue from 2025–2034.

The legislation will eliminate numerous energy credits including all the clean vehicle credits, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits, and clean hydrogen production credit by the end of 2027, and other credits several years later, with various phaseout schedules. Together, these provisions are estimated to raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034.

The legislation also expands some energy provisions such as clean fuel production credit and advanced manufacturing credit, which are estimated to cost about $44 billion over the same period.

Overall, the OBBBA’s energy provisions do not make much progress in conforming the IRA’s energy credits to the good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability. See a previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper for a detailed analysis of the energy credits and an evaluation of them against the principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

The OBBBA’s energy provisions include simplicity and efficiency enhancing provisions such as those that eliminate the poorly designed clean vehicle credits, standardize credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components, and retain the refundability and transferability features. The legislation also contains complex and inefficient provisions that restrict taxpayers’ full access to the credits, such as expanding the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules and using an arbitrary approach to pick winners and losers across various energy technologies.

This paper provides an overview of the legislation’s changes to the IRA energy provisions and evaluates the energy provisions against three good-tax-policy principles of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability.

Summary of the OBBBA’s Changes to the IRA Energy Provisions

The OBBBA overhauls the IRA energy provisions in the following areas. (See detailed information on expiration dates, exceptions, and special rules in the table in appendix.)

Eliminates some credits: The legislation repeals all the new, used, and commercial clean vehicle credits, alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, residential clean energy and energy efficiency credits as soon as after September 30, 2025, with some of them expiring after June 30, 2026. It also repeals the clean hydrogen production credit after 2027.

Brings expiration dates forward: The legislation brings forward most of the expiration dates for wind and solar in the clean electricity production credit, clean electricity investment credit, and advanced manufacturing production credit to December 31, 2027. It also makes the permanent advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals temporary, starting its phaseout in 2031 and fully eliminated four years later.

Strengthens foreign entity of concern restrictions: The legislation significantly expands the foreign entity of concern (FEOC) provisions by prohibiting taxpayers from getting “material assistance” from a “prohibited foreign entity,” which includes a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-controlled entity.” The FEOC provisions also include specific restrictions regarding a “foreign-influenced entity.”

Removes emissions-related targets: The legislation eliminates the emissions-related conditions that determine the expiration dates for clean electricity production and clean electricity investment credits. Instead, both credits start to phase out in 2034 and are repealed fully by 2036.

Expands the scope of certain credits: The legislation expands some energy credits, including by extending the clean fuel production credit from 2027 to 2029, adding a new production credit for metallurgical coal equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, and adding a new energy community bonus credit of 10 percent to the clean electricity production credit for advanced nuclear facilities.

Makes limited changes to some credits: The legislation retains the energy credits for carbon oxide sequestration and nuclear power production mostly as detailed in the IRA and adds only FEOC restrictions to them.

Retains transferability, refundability, and most bonus credits: The legislation retains transferability and refundability for the credits and other special bonus credit requirements including domestic content rules, prevailing wage bonus, and apprenticeship bonus.

Evaluating the OBBBA’s Energy Provisions

Simplicity, Efficiency, and Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA uses tax subsidies to encourage the production of clean energy. Although the income tax is not the best approach to addressing climate change, energy tax credits should follow the principles of good tax policy. Ideally, tax policies should be simple, efficient, and fiscally sustainable. This allows the federal government to incentivize clean energy development without imposing unnecessary burdens on taxpayers and the economy. A previous American Action Forum (AAF) paper on the IRA energy provisions provides a detailed analysis of the credits and uses a framework of simplicity, efficiency, and fiscal sustainability to evaluate them. The three principles are defined as follows:

A simple tax credit is one that makes it easy for the government to implement clean energy tax incentives and the taxpayers to utilize them, keeping both administrative and compliance costs low.

An efficient tax credit would ensure that eligible taxpayers can utilize clean energy tax credits as much as possible to help drive the economy’s transition to clean energy technologies. It should also limit the extent to which the tax incentives distort producers and consumer behaviors in ways that impose additional costs. It is worth noting that there is a tension between efficiency of clean energy tax credits and the conventional meaning of tax efficiency, as clean energy tax credits are designed to change taxpayers’ behaviors and encourage them to switch to the consumption of clean energy technologies.

A fiscally sustainable tax credit is one that limits budgetary costs and can ultimately be financed through a low level of taxation.

Simplicity

The IRA’s tax credits were designed with excessive complexity. Many of the energy tax credits have multiple requirements that significantly limit eligible taxpayers to a specific group of businesses or individuals, which requires regulators to allocate more resources to screen and verify eligibility and taxpayers to incur a larger burden to comply with the requirements.

Tax credits can be simple to administer and utilize if they have universal provisions. If they are designed to subsidize certain taxpayers or economic activities, however, the complex eligibility requirements could substantially increase administrative and compliance costs.

The OBBBA significantly simplifies the design of the energy provisions by eliminating the poorly designed clean vehicle tax credits. AAF’s analysis finds that the clean vehicle credits’ onerous eligibility requirements, income thresholds, and bonus credit rules make them complicated for regulators to implement and difficult for taxpayers to claim the full credits. Indeed, AAF concluded in its previous analysis that the clean vehicle credits fail against all three principles, as they are complex, inefficient, and costly.

Additionally, the OBBBA surgically improves the simplicity of some energy provisions by standardizing credit rates for different qualified energy technologies or components. For example, for the clean fuel production credit, the legislation reduces the credit rate for sustainable aviation fuel to conform to the rate applicable to other eligible transportation fuels. For the advanced manufacturing production credit, the legislation eliminates the permanent feature of the critical minerals credit and changes it to the same expiration and phaseout schedule as most other eligible components.

The OBBBA adds restrictions and requirements to the energy credits, however, making them more complex to claim than necessary. A striking example is that the legislation expands the IRA’s FEOC restrictions significantly to prohibit eligible taxpayers from being directly or indirectly associated with any specified or defined foreign entity of concern. The new FEOC provisions apply restrictions in several ways. A prohibited foreign entity cannot claim the credit. Eligible taxpayers cannot source their input materials from a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity. Additionally, eligible taxpayers cannot enter into a licensing agreement with a prohibited foreign entity. The legislation also adds a new 10-year recapture special rule to the FEOC restrictions. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, eligible taxpayers are prohibited from transferring payments to a specified foreign entity over a 10-year retroactive period. This rule goes into effect in the tax years beginning two years after the enactment of the OBBBA. The new FEOC restrictions substantially increase the complexity of implementing, interpreting, and utilizing the credits.

The OBBBA retains some of the complex special rules in the IRA, including the domestic content rule and prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements. For example, for the clean electricity investment credit, the OBBBA modified the domestic content rule to make it harder for taxpayers to claim the credit by increasing the percentage of eligible products that must be produced in the United States. This requirement may be challenging to comply with as the United States has been relying on certain imported goods as components for energy products and it is more costly to produce them domestically.

Efficiency

The IRA clean energy credits have a combination of features that make them efficient in some ways and less inefficient in others.

The OBBBA retains the efficiency-enhancing features of refundability and transferability. These provisions allow taxpayers to fully utilize the credits for which they are eligible. For example, a startup carbon capture technology company is not typically profitable in its first few years of business, which means that it does not have any taxable income or tax liability, so it cannot use any standard tax credits to reduce its tax liability. With refundability and transferability, the company can either get a refund (a direct payment) from the government as if it had a tax liability or sell the tax credit to another business for cash. Retaining the transferability feature applies to one of the good-tax-policy principles of efficiency, but the OBBBA adds significant FEOC restrictions to prohibit businesses from transferring credits to a specified foreign entity, which reduces the efficiency of the credits and limits taxpayers’ access to claim the credits.

As discussed above, the legislation greatly improves the efficiency of the energy provisions by repealing the inefficient clean vehicle credits. These credits subsidize consumers who would have bought a clean vehicle anyway, and do not incentivize consumers to use electricity generated with clean energy for their vehicles.

In contrast, OBBBA’s arbitrary approach to different types of energy technologies reduces their efficiency considerably. Overall, the legislation favors baseload energy (capable of running continuously), such as nuclear, geothermal, and hydropower, over other intermittent energy sources, including wind and solar. For example, the clean electricity production and investment credits will expire for wind and solar much sooner than for other types of clean energy. The advanced manufacturing production credit is also repealed for wind energy components several years earlier than for other eligible components.

Additionally, the legislation’s energy provisions do not seem to follow any principles of good tax policy. While the carbon oxide sequestration credit and the nuclear power production credit from the IRA are mostly retained in OBBBA, the clean hydrogen production credit will be eliminated after 2027. The clean fuel production credit is extended by two years, whereas the advanced manufacturing production credit for critical minerals is changed from permanent to temporary.

A perplexing modification in the OBBBA’s energy provisions is that it adds a new production credit for metallurgical coal, equal to 2.5 percent of production costs, under the advanced manufacturing production credit. Metallurgical coal is primarily used as a raw material for manufacturing steel, which is sold at a much higher price than thermal coal used for electricity generation. The United States is a major producer of metallurgical coal globally and most of the U.S. metallurgical coal products are for exports.

To price the externalities of greenhouse gas emissions and encourage transition to clean energy technologies, tax subsidies should ideally be as technology neutral as possible, meaning that they subsidize all clean energy technologies equally if they lead to the same amount of emissions reduction. Overall, there is significant room to improve the efficiency of OBBBA’s energy provisions as they arbitrarily pick winners and losers across different energy technologies.

Fiscal Sustainability

The IRA’s clean energy provisions were initially estimated to cost $400 billion from 2026–2035. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) later estimated that the cost of the provisions is more than double, at $870 billion.

Table 1 shows JCT’s estimate of how much revenue the OBBBA’s energy provisions would raise. The termination and restriction of the energy provisions will raise about $543 billion from 2025–2034. The expansion of some of the energy provisions will cost about $44 billion over the same period. On net, all the OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise a total of $499 billion from 2025–2034.

AAF previously estimated that repealing all the energy provisions in the IRA would raise $852 billion from 2026–2035. The OBBBA’s energy provisions will raise approximately 60 percent of the total revenue if the legislation were to fully repeal all the energy provisions.

This sweeping budget reconciliation legislation, which passed the House in May 2025 and the Senate in July 2025, presents a mixed bag for the SAF industry—extending key tax credits while eliminating federal grant programs.

The SAF Provisions: A Tale of Two Policies

The bill repeals grants for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) programs but extends SAF tax credits for four years, creating a shift from direct federal funding to tax-based incentives. This approach reflects the Trump administration's preference for market-driven solutions over government grants, fundamentally changing how the federal government supports SAF development.

The massive budget reconciliation bill narrowly passed by the U.S. House of Representatives continues tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel production, providing crucial certainty for producers who have been waiting for policy clarity. This extension comes at a critical time, as CVR Energy Inc. announced that it has halted SAF production as it waits on government clarification on whether tax credits will continue.

The Broader Energy Context

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" represents a significant departure from the Biden administration's approach to clean energy. President Donald Trump wants the U.S. to rely on oil, gas, coal and nuclear to meet its energy needs, and the legislation reflects this priority. The budget bill would dampen development of wind and solar power, kill climate funding and boost oil, gas and coal output.

However, sustainable aviation fuel occupies a unique position in this energy landscape. Unlike other renewable energy technologies that face cuts or elimination, SAF maintains federal support through tax credits, likely due to the aviation industry's strategic importance and the lack of viable alternatives for long-haul flights.

Environmental Concerns and Agricultural Interests

The legislation has drawn criticism from environmental groups, particularly regarding its approach to crop-based aviation fuels. The U.S. agriculture lobby has long promoted ethanol for cars. If President Trump's ""Big Beautiful Bill"" becomes law, the industry would be given tax credits for producing crop-based fuel for planes, too, despite evidence it would spur deforestation and increase emissions.

This tension highlights a fundamental challenge in SAF policy: balancing agricultural economic interests with environmental integrity. The bill's approach appears to prioritize domestic production and agricultural support over strict environmental criteria.

Industry Response and Market Impact

The policy shift has created uncertainty in the SAF market. While the extension of tax credits provides essential support for producers, the elimination of grant programs removes a key funding mechanism for research and development activities. This could slow innovation in next-generation SAF technologies that don't rely on crop-based feedstocks.

The Budget also eliminates ""green aviation"" and other climate scam programs as well as failing space propulsion projects, according to the White House, signaling a broader skepticism toward government-funded climate initiatives.

The Montana Success Story

Despite the broader policy changes, the Trump administration has demonstrated support for large-scale SAF projects that align with its economic priorities. The loan will allow it to expand production to 315 million gallons per year, and produce about half of North American SAF, a fuel made from fats from seed oils and tallow that is lower in greenhouse gas emissions than conventional jet fuel.

This approval of a major SAF refinery loan in Montana demonstrates that the administration supports SAF projects that can demonstrate economic viability and use waste-based feedstocks rather than purpose-grown crops.

Looking Ahead: A Market-Driven Approach

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" represents a fundamental shift in how the federal government approaches SAF development. By maintaining tax credits while eliminating grants, the administration is betting that market forces, supported by tax incentives, can drive SAF adoption more effectively than direct government spending.

SAF is the cornerstone of airline industry efforts to achieve carbon net neutrality. The future of SAF is unclear in Trump's next Administration, but the inclusion of extended tax credits in the budget bill suggests that SAF will continue to receive federal support, albeit in a different form.

Strategic Implications for Industry

For aviation industry stakeholders, the message is clear: the federal government remains committed to supporting SAF development, but through market mechanisms rather than direct funding. Airlines and producers must now navigate a landscape where tax policy, rather than grant programs, drives federal support for sustainable aviation fuel.

This shift may actually benefit established producers who can take advantage of tax credits more effectively than newer entrants who might have relied on grant funding for initial development. The result could be a more concentrated industry with fewer but larger players.

The Path Forward

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" has created a new paradigm for SAF development in the United States. While environmental groups may be concerned about the emphasis on crop-based fuels and the elimination of grant programs, the extension of tax credits provides essential market support for the industry.

The ultimate success of this approach will depend on whether tax incentives alone can drive the scale of SAF production needed to meet aviation's decarbonization goals. As the industry adapts to this new policy environment, the next few years will be crucial in determining whether market-driven approaches can deliver the environmental benefits that direct government funding aimed to achieve.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGIjl2C4VGBuA/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/B56ZfnBectGQAQ-/0/1751927615318?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=9C66sGn4Hk1ctXVXYfH1If3f2Vk8BeOQGNtpvEm3wow,N,,2025-07-08 05:58:58.025201

The direct reliance of infrastructure upon fossil hydrocarbons has reduced as renewable electricity gradually enters national grids, but the high energy density of hydrocarbon molecules identified by the Wrights when they chose gasoline power more than a century ago, means hydrocarbon fuel is likely to remain the primary commercial aircraft power source for decades to come.

Particularly for smaller aircraft, there is perhaps a role for battery and hydrogen fuel cell propulsion, the latter consuming hydrogen as a fuel and exhausting water as waste product.

Hydrogen fuel cells already power ground vehicles to a limited extent, and applications for hydrogen as a fuel for electricity generation and even domestic heating have been suggested, not least under the UK government’s Hydrogen Strategy.

The SAF connection – How hydrogen could support sustainable aviation fuel production

In a perfect world every turbine-engined aircraft will burn 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sooner rather than later. There are multiple routes to SAF, all requiring a carbon feedstock and, in many cases, hydrogen as a key ingredient.

Even if controversial grown biomass feedstocks are removed from the equation, the earth is rich in carbon through sources as diverse as sewage and carbon dioxide (CO2) extracted directly from the air.

Meanwhile, hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is most commonly found on Earth combined with oxygen as water and, ironically, in fossil hydrocarbon molecules.

Extracting hydrogen is invariably an energy-intensive process. Storing and moving it also poses significant challenges, which industry understands well.

Which is to say that were hydrogen to be used as a fuel on a macro scale, then existing steel-based infrastructure, pipelines, storage tanks and so on associated with hydrocarbon fuels could not be used, since hydrogen reacts with steel.

Another challenge lies in gaseous hydrogen’s very low volumetric energy density compared to hydrocarbons, likely restricting its fuel use to ground and building applications unless it can successfully be stored and moved in bulk, in liquid form.

UK-based CirculAIRity is clear in its vision to “enable the decarbonisation of the [aviation] sector by producing synthetic SAF derived from the Direct Air Capture of CO2.”

More specifically, Alex Chikhani, the company’s CEO and founder, says: “We put our arms around everything, including the primary power source and real estate. We aren’t scaling up our own technology, in fact, we’re technology, power source and location agnostic. We aim to manage the end-to-end supply chain.”

Chikhani describes SAF production as “extremely power hungry”, noting that the energy return per litre of SAF is 20:1, meaning that 20 “units” of energy are consumed to create every one unit of energy released when SAF is burned.

Hydrogen extraction is the most energy-intensive stage in the SAF production process. “Extracting hydrogen, like the manufacture of power-to-liquid fuels, requires energy, but not necessarily electricity,” Chikhani carefully explains.

“Waste heat from industrial processes can be used instead of electricity. So can heat from the sun – it makes little sense from a physics point of view to use sunlight to generate electricity and then use that to extract hydrogen or drive the chemical process that make fuel when we could use the sun’s heat directly.

“There are several ‘colours’ of hydrogen, of which ‘green’ is the most well known. It uses renewable power to extract hydrogen by electrolysis and very little of it is available.

“Most of the hydrogen on the market is ‘blue’, from natural gas, dependent on a fossil fuel and relatively cheap to produce, but if aviation is to decarbonise, then it must eliminate fossil fuels from the SAF production cycle. ‘Pink’ hydrogen uses electricity from a nuclear power station while ‘red’, which remains in the research stage, uses heat from a reactor to split water molecules.

“We’re looking at nuclear as just one of our potential power sources, including the advantage of ‘red’ hydrogen.”

Regional reaction – Trialling hydrogen application at regional airports

The barriers to widescale hydrogen extraction and employment are therefore great, but not insurmountable.

Proving its application at airports is an important component in aviation’s sustainability imperative and the very best locations for real-world trials are smaller, regional airports, where modified infrastructure may be installed with minimal disruption and stakeholders remain close for easy discussion and expedited progress.

Meanwhile, early steps are already being taken, and they are, inevitably, small.

Education and messaging are important elements in the wider sustainability effort and a single hydrogen-powered truck at a regional hub, for example, is likely far more newsworthy than a similar vehicle at a major primary airport.

A case in point is Exeter Airport in the UK, which recently completed a trial using a hydrogen-powered baggage tug, pushback tug and ground power unit to turn around a TUI Boeing 737 aircraft.

Stephen Wiltshire, Managing Director at Exeter Airport, says: “Regional airports are most likely to be those handling the first generation of smaller hydrogen aircraft, so it makes sense they should be the focus of any testbed activities.”

Similarly, in Canada, Edmonton International Airport is partnering with Diesel Tech Industries (DTI) to explore the integration of the Guardian Hydrogen Diesel System on two of the airport’s heavy-duty runway snow sweepers.

Currently operating on diesel fuel, the runway snow sweepers will be retrofitted using the DTI’s hydrogen diesel system to use hydrogen as a supplementary fuel, thereby significantly reducing carbon emissions without requiring extensive infrastructure modifications.

In the Baltics, under the BSR HyAirport programme, a hydrogen-powered Mulag baggage truck was tested at Riga Airport during March.

The programme includes regional airports in Germany, Poland, Scandinavia and across the Baltic region – and in winter 2025/26 expects to see hydrogen-powered winter machinery on test in Helsinki, Tallinn and Riga.

Julian Klaaßen, the BSR HyAirport Project’s Financial and Communications Manager, is based at Hamburg Airport.

He tells Regional Gateway: “The main goal is to create a decision-making tool and some rough calculations for every user – primarily airport operators – to help integrate hydrogen into different airport locations by answering questions like what costs are estimated for fuel and does local production or delivery make more sense?

“Since everything depends on location and every location is different, a general, variables-based outcome is needed. Generating that is the business case behind the whole project.”

Demonstrating hydrogen applications and safety in real-world operations is integral to the BSR HyAirport effort.

Klaaßen adds: “It is also very important for us to share results and show to a broad public audience that safe operations are possible.”

He is in no doubt that regional airports and airline routes will lead in hydrogen applications, adding: “At Hamburg Airport we are on the case with both infrastructure and hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft, while we have a healthy small aviation sector as well.

“Regional aviation will be the first mover, with larger aircraft following at least a decade later. Regional passenger flights are especially significant in the Baltics and Scandinavia, driving interest in electric – for short range – and hydrogen – gaseous for short range and liquid for medium range – aviation.”

Will hydrogen replace other energy sources?

Today, airports might store Jet A1, SAF and avgas for aircraft, petrol (gasoline), diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) for ground vehicles, and offer electric charging points. In a rose-tinted future, could hydrogen replace some of these energy sources and associated infrastructure?

Klaaßen says: “It could represent a huge opportunity for synergy across services and hydrogen could simplify some elements of airport operations, but other fuels will still be used in parallel.

“Petrol and CNG might vanish, for example, but jet fuel will remain for at least 30 years and most probably longer, hopefully as SAF. Hydrogen will therefore be just another fuel to be delivered and stored.

“In an integrated concept, it might provide opportunities for business synergies and simplification, but the integration and transition will pose challenges, with competition for airport space and additional infrastructure required in the early stages too.”

In common with Klaaßen, Chikhani cautions that hydrogen alone is not the solution to humanity’s future energy requirements – and therefore neither will it entirely power tomorrow’s airports and aircraft.

“Firstly, hydrogen is difficult to handle,” he says. “It can’t be moved or stored like natural gas, for example. Hydrogen needs stainless steel or glass vessels, or maybe some very specific plastics. It just leaks from steel and with its activation energy being so low it is very combustible – static from clothing is a sufficient ignition source.

“Aluminium aircraft and steel infrastructure have been built around and matured on almost a century’s worth of kerosene – Jet A1 – being the primary energy source for aviation.

“The idea that everything can be switched to hydrogen is highly unlikely. We need to look at a macro system, applying appropriate expertise throughout the system.”

By its nature, aviation is among the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. In 2024 it was a relatively small contributor to the world’s total carbon emissions at around three per cent, although its effect on global warming was surely greater through other high-altitude emissions, including water vapour.

The latter is volumetrically more significant than CO2 as a greenhouse gas and has significant climate effects, albeit shorter-lived for each emission, than CO2. More worryingly, however, it enhances the warming effects of the latter.

As other industries successfully decarbonise, aviation’s contribution to global warming will become proportionally greater and it is important to realise that the goal here is to reduce global warming for the benefit of the planet and continued survival of society.

This is not about making aviation greener for accounting purposes, this is about stopping emissions and ultimately reversing the damage already done.

Hydrogen as a fuel and SAF component is critical to that goal.

Chikhani says: “It will take time and depends on the commitment of countries, legislators and populations, nationally, regionally and globally, to enact this level of change.”

Regional airports are the obvious crucibles in which the aviation industry might trial hydrogen and other energy technologies, proving them in limited commercial service before any extension into major hubs.

Chikhani and Klaaßen are optimistic about the likelihood of success, while acknowledging that fundamental questions remain, such as: Where does the hydrogen come from? Who makes it? Who sells it? How is it regulated? What infrastructure is required and who pays for and maintains it?

“We are seeking answers,” Klaaßen says. “In the process, we are speaking to stakeholders whom, as airports or aviation operators, we have never spoken to before, because we can only answer these questions in co-operation with other industries. Without co-operation, we will never achieve our goals.”",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Untitled-design-31.png,N,,2025-07-07 16:13:39.613116

Reducing emissions in aviation and shipping is crucial, and this action plan marks an important step towards energy transition.","Sweden - and the Nordic countries in general - have always been at the forefront of sustainability discussions. Prior to the pandemic Sweden was making international headlines, as the cradle and symbol of the “flygskam” (flight shame) movement.

But in the light of Sweden’s slow aviation recovery since the end of the pandemic restrictions, the new government have taken some important positive decisions. The first was to announce the abolition of the passenger tax, which became a reality last week. The policy has shifted from punishing people for flying, to enabling air connectivity to thrive while focusing on decarbonization measures. The most important element of that is to encourage Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). SAF is the solution that can deliver most CO2 emissions reduction in the short and medium term.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents around 65% of the solution to reaching Fly Net Zero by 2050, and to reach the levels of production needed by then, the ramp-up of SAF needs to begin now.

Policy recommendations have been split into three stages:

·short-term “quick fixes” to enable more SAF production;

·mid-term policy suggestions to ensure proper regulatory framework is in place;

·long-term actions to assess alternative energy sources as well.

In the case of Sweden, a gap analysis was conducted to understand the country’s current SAF position, what remains to be done to meet the FNZ2050 targets, and to identify business opportunities.

In this context, in May, IATA co-hosted a breakfast seminar together with the Swedish Confederation of Transport Enterprises, to present and discuss the gap analysis report. Also in attendance was the Swedish Minister for Infrastructure and Housing, the State Secretary to the Minister for Climate and Environment, as well as leaders from Preem, SAS, and Transportföretagen.

From left to right: Anna Wilson, Head of External Affairs, SAS; Helena Dyrssen, State Secretary at the Ministry of Climate and Enterprise; Andreas Carlson, Minister of Infrastructure and Housing; Magnus Heimburg, President and CEO, Preem; Rafael Schvartzman, Regional Vice President for Europe, IATA; Fredrik Kämpfe, Industry Manager Aviation; Transportföretagen

Bringing together all these stakeholders around the table resulted in a positive outcome. Shortly after the event, Sweden’s Minister of Infrastructure & Housing, Andreas Carlson. announced the Government would take significant steps to promote sustainable, fossil-free, and low-carbon fuels for aviation and shipping. Investigator Mattias Viklund has been tasked with developing an action plan, due by April 30 next year, to increase the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and shipping fuel. The plan will outline concrete measures, coordinate with relevant actors, and focus on domestic production, leveraging Sweden's resources such as forestry residuals. This initiative complements the Swedish Energy Agency's ongoing efforts to support the transition to fossil-free energy in the transport sector.

Reducing emissions in aviation and shipping is crucial, and this action plan marks an important step towards energy transition. We look forward to a continued active collaboration with the Swedish Government and call on other Governments to follow this example joining forces with the industry to work hand in hand. It is only together that we can deliver the net zero aviation of the future.

Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.
1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031.
The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.
1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF.","President Donald Trump on July 4 signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act.” The budget reconciliation package extends and updates the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and revives a tax credit benefiting small biodiesel producers but repeals several other bioenergy-related tax incentives.

The bill, H.R. 1, has undergone numerous changes since it was first introduced in May, including those related to the extension and administration of 45Z.

The original 45Z tax credit, as established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provided a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit started at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit was up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. Under the IRA, the 45Z credit was available for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

The version of H.R. 1 originally passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on May 22 aimed to extend the 45Z credit for four additional years, through the end of 2031. The initial draft bill released by the Senate Finance Committee on June 16 also included a four-year extension. The Senate bill, however, was later amended to include only a two-year extension, through the end of 2029. The legislation signed by Trump enacts that two-year extension. The 45Z credit is now in place through the end of 2029.

The enacted version of H.R. 1 substantially changes the value of the 45Z credit by eliminating the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change essentially caps the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF.

H.R. 1 also limits 45Z eligibility to fuels derived from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada. The Senate had previously proposed to place no geographical limits on feedstock eligibility but would have reduced the value of the credit by 20% for non-U.S. feedstocks. The language on feedstock eligibility was updated prior to Senate passage of the bill.

Other changes to the 45Z credit implemented by H.R. 1 include provisions that specify that the emissions rate for eligible transportation fuel under 45Z may not be less than zero; eliminate indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel; direct the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure; and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities. H.R. 1 retains full transferability of the 45Z credit.

H.R. 1 also includes provisions to support small-scale biodiesel producers by updating and extending the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. That credit, which expired at the end of 2024, provided a 10-cent-per-gallon credit on the first 15 million gallons of agri-biodiesel produced annually by small producers, defined to include facilities with a capacity of less than 60 MMgy. H.R. 1 extends the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit through the end of 2026 and boosts the value to 20 cents per gallon. Language included in the bill specifies that the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit can be stacked with the 45Z credit, allowing eligible producers to simultaneously claim both credits for each gallon of eligible fuel.

The legislation provides additional support for biofuel producers by extending mandatory funding under the USDA’s Bioenergy Program for Advanced Biofuels through fiscal year 2031. That program provides payments to eligible producers to expand the production of advanced biofuels.

H.R. 1 leaves the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact, but repeal various other bioenergy-related tax credits, including the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which supports retail availability of E85, B20, and renewable natural gas (RNG); the clean hydrogen production tax credit; and the energy efficient home improvement credit, which, in part, supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances.

Also related to biofuels, H.R. 1 rescinds unobligated funding allocated to the U.S. EPA by the IRA to support certain functions related to the Renewable Fuel Standard. The impacted funding includes $5 million allocated to the EPA to support the development and establishment of tests and protocols regarding the environment and public health effects of a fuel or fuel additive; perform internal and extramural data collection and analyses to regularly update applicable regulations, guidance, and procedures for determining lifecycle GHG emission of a fuel; and review, analyze and evaluate the impacts of all transportation fuels, including fuel lifecycle implications, on the general public and on low-income and disadvantaged communities and $10 million to the EPA to fund “new grants to industry and other related activities…to support investments in advanced biofuels.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America welcomed the extension of the 45Z and Amall Agri-Biodiesel Producer tax credits. “Clean Fuels thanks Congress for working overtime to provide certainty for biodiesel and renewable diesel producers – especially small companies – so they can resume production and industry growth. Clean Fuels especially thanks Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for securing an enhancement to the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit to help small producers as they make the transition to the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit,"" said Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs. ""While the extension of the §45Z credit with transferability through 2029 provides some immediate stability, our industry continues to urge Treasury to promptly propose and finalize clear, reliable rules for the credit.”

The Iowa Biodiesel Board applauded revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit. “We commend President Trump for recognizing the critical role biodiesel can play in building next-generation energy infrastructure and driving a new industrial revolution rooted in American innovation,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the IBB. “ This extension sends a clear signal of stability to the marketplace and reinforces our nation’s commitment to strengthening domestic energy capacity.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” he added.

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers,” Kimberley continued. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Ethanol producer POET thanked Trump for securing the 45Z extension. “President Trump continues to reassert his support for American farmers and energy independence,” said Joshua Shields, POET’s senior vice president of corporate affairs. “With this extension signed into law, 45Z is now best positioned to transform U.S. agriculture, providing new markets for farmers and furthering biofuel energy dominance. POET thanks both President Trump and our biofuel champions in Congress for their hard-fought efforts to get this provision across the finish line.”

The American Biogas Council applauded the biogas provisions of H.R. 1. “The Act contains several helpful provisions for the biogas sector, acknowledging the enormous potential of recycling decomposable waste – from farms, food systems, and wastewater treatment plants – to produce reliable American-made energy that both generates electricity and fuels the transportation sector,” said Patrick Serfass, executive director of the ABC.

“With the preservation of key incentives, including continued support for clean fuel production and power generation credits, this bill helps provide certainty for developers to plan, invest, and grow,” Serfass continued. “We are particularly encouraged by provisions that ensure American producers using U.S. and North American feedstocks can compete on a level playing field, while also maintaining appropriate values for manure-based biogas.

The Renewable Fuels Association said H.R. 1 will enhance the role of the U.S. ethanol industry in contributing to American energy security and innovation. “From the very beginning of the budget reconciliation process, our goal was to advocate for the inclusion of tax policies that provide certainty, growth opportunities, and market stability for U.S. ethanol producers. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed today accomplishes that objective. We thank the many renewable fuel supporters in Congress and President Trump for ensuring American ethanol producers and farmers had a voice and seat at the table in this process,” said Geoff Cooper, RFA president and CEO. “The extension and modifications to the 45Z clean fuel production credit, reinstatement of the Research and Development immediate expensing provisions, and improvement of the 45Q carbon sequestration and utilization credit will provide a growth-oriented tax policy climate that ethanol producers can count on, improving the role that renewable fuels can play in helping reach our nation’s energy independence goals.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol praised H.R. 1’s 45Z provisions. “We’re grateful to our Congressional champions for their steadfast leadership to support and strengthen the 45Z credit, which is remarkable considering the fact most other IRA-era tax credits were limited or phased-out in the final package.,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “While there were other improvements we had hoped to achieve in the final 45Z language, restoring transferability of the credit, removing indirect land use change (ILUC) penalties, and restricting feedstock eligibility to USMCA countries will strengthen the credit from its original version.”

“In terms of the credit term, we preferred the House language which would have extended 45Z through 2031, and we also urged Congress to specifically allow low-carbon farming practices to be monetized through 45Z with the feedstock calculator and guidelines USDA has released, but nevertheless ACE remains committed to working with federal agencies to implement the credit in ways that reward on-farm conservation practices and accelerate the use of homegrown, low-carbon biofuels,” Jennings continued.

The RNG Coalition indicated the 45Z extension is vital to the sustained growth of renewable natural gas (RNG) in the U.S. “The credit will play a critical role in directing investment toward low-carbon fuels, based on lifecycle emissions performance,” said Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal government affairs at the RNG Coalition. “We look forward to working with the Department of Treasury on the implementation of several key Section 45Z provisions and would strongly encourage the agency to initiate that process soon. Clear, pragmatic, and expedient regulation will be critical to ensure that Section 45Z reflects the Congressional intent to accelerate sustainable development, deployment, and utilization of renewable gas. RNG is a vital tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, bolster energy security, reliability and affordability, and provide key benefits to diverse American communities — from farm communities in South Dakota to Staten Island in New York City where the first RNG project was sited over forty years ago.""

Growth Energy also applauded the 45Z extension. “The president wants to go big on American energy dominance, and this legislation delivers,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “An extension of 45Z will unlock billions of dollars in new investments across rural America supporting strong, stable markets for America’s farmers and positioning American biofuel producers to compete in global fuel markets. We applaud our champions in the House and Senate, who fought hard to ensure that U.S. biofuel producers are positioned to deliver more clean energy, hold down fuel costs, and restore industrial might across the heartland.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Trump_One_Big_Bill_634e504957.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 16:13:47.664266

The A321XLR also offers up to 20 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than the Airbus A321neo aircraft, significantly improving emissions performance and operating efficiency.
This latest agreement effectively doubles the airline’s future A330neo fleet to 40 aircraft.","AirAsia has signed a landmark agreement with Airbus valued at USD12.25 billion for 50 A321XLRs with rights for 20 A321XLRs. With this agreement, the airline takes a major step towards becoming the world’s first low-cost narrow-body network carrier, anchored by its multi-hub strategy. The aircraft are scheduled for delivery commencing 2028 through 2032.

Witnessed by Prime Minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim who was on an official visit to France, the agreement was signed in Paris on 5 July between Tony Fernandes, CEO of Capital A (parent company of AirAsia), and Christian Scherer, CEO of Airbus Commercial Aircraft.

Half price to Europe and the U.S.?

With an additional three hours of flight time and higher fuel efficiency versus the A321neo, Fernandes, who is founded AirAsia 23 years ago, said the new planes enable a low-cost long-range offering to expand AirAsia’s reach as part of a renewed strategy to expand into long-haul markets, including Europe and North America.

The new narrow-body planes can fly up to nine hours, connecting Southeast Asian airports in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur with the Middle East, then hopping on to Europe in the westerly direction, while for the east, from Southeast Asia to Taiwan or Japan, then a network hop to the US.

Fernandes noted that the goal is to provide flights to Europe and the US at half the price, of what is currently available in the market. “The goal here is not to take anyone’s market share, it is to allow people to fly to places they never dreamt of flying to. I think the opportunity is huge, So really, the world is our oyster now,” he said.

“Obviously with a narrowbody fleet, with efficiency, we believe our fares to the rest of the world will be very, very, very competitive, and we will open up whole new markets,” Fernandes said. AirAsia, which operated long haul flights under AirAsia X previously, has not operated flights to Europe since 2012 and to the US since 2020.

It also means, said Fernandes, when asked by Khaosod English how the new planes will alter low-cost air traffic from Thailand, that Phuket and Chiang Mai Airports will see many direct flights between these Thai airports and cities in India and China.

Expansion in the Middle East

The airline’s parent company, Capital A, had earlier announced in May, its plans to significantly expand into Saudi Arabia, marking a pivotal step in the Group’s Middle East growth strategy. The multi-faceted initiative will begin with AirAsia introducing new routes to Riyadh and Dammam, while increasing flight frequencies to Jeddah from Kuala Lumpur.

It said that the new Riyadh route is projected to serve close to one million two-way passengers by 2026 and more than seven million by 2030.

The Group is also studying new connections from Bangkok and Jakarta to Riyadh, as part of its wider ambition to enhance Middle East connectivity across the Asean region.

Long term strategy of improving connectivity and sustainability

The next-generation A321XLRs will operate alongside AirAsia’s all-Airbus fleet of A320 Family and A330 aircraft, supporting its long-term strategy to deliver unmatched connectivity across Asia and beyond, while maintaining a low-cost model through improved route economics, enhanced aircraft utilisation and fleet efficiency.

The new fleet plays a pivotal role in this transformation. AirAsia’s multi-aircraft strategy enables the airline to match capacity with demand, reduce fuel consumption, and support a sustainable, cost-effective growth model in a highly competitive global landscape. The A321XLR also offers up to 20 per cent lower fuel burn per seat than the Airbus A321neo aircraft, significantly improving emissions performance and operating efficiency.

The first A321XLR is expected to enter service between 2027 and 2028, with long-haul operations initially handled by the A330 fleet. The group is also scheduled to take delivery of four A321LRs in 2026 as reported by Aviation Week.

150 new aircraft in the pipeline

Tony Fernandes also has been reported by NST.com that AirAsia Group is looking to order up to 150 new aircraft as part of its 15-year fleet strategy. and will be announcing its decision as early as August.

He confirmed that the airline group is in discussions with at least two aircraft manufacturers about the order, which are Embraer, for E2-family aircraft, and Airbus for its A220 programme. Fernandes also says that AirAsia is in talks with Chinese airframer Comac.

On a 10-year horizon, Fernandes noted that AirAsia plans to expand its fleet to comprise more than 500 purely narrowbody planes from its current 255 narrowbody and widebody aircraft.

Meanwhile, within the next five years, the aviation group plans to raise annual passengers carried to 130 million from 70 million currently, and boost destinations served to 175 from 143.

Malaysia Airlines orders 20 additional A330-900

Malaysia Aviation Group confirmed an order for 20 additional A330-900 aircraft, which was also announced during Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim’s visit to France. This latest agreement effectively doubles the airline’s future A330neo fleet to 40 aircraft.

“Countries around the world and many of our states are demanding ultra-low carbon fuels,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw. “The Big Beautiful Bill helps pave the way for the investments to produce those fuels – and to produce them from North America feedstocks.”

The biodiesel industry has struggled in 2025 from low Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) blending levels and uncertainty around implementation of the original 45Z tax credit, leading several Iowa biodiesel plants to idle. The bill extends the §45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2029 and provides for transferability of the credit, in addition to restorating the small biodiesel producer tax credit for 2025 and 2026.

“The revival of the Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Credit through 2026—and increasing it to 20 cents-per-gallon—is a vital lifeline to small independent producers like those in Iowa. We thank Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) for championing the inclusion of that provision,” said Grant Kimberley, executive director of the Iowa Biodiesel Board (IBB).

“The ability for producers to transfer the credit, the appropriate prioritization of North American feedstocks, and the removal of arbitrary indirect land use change penalties all bode well for Iowa’s biodiesel industry and soybean farmers. For producers who have been idled or running at reduced capacity since the start of the year, this is a breath of relief and welcome signal for a bright future.”

Because many changes to the 45Z tax credit become effective in 2026, IBB urged prompt, clear rules and guidance from the U.S. Treasury implementing the tax credit both for 2025 and beyond.

In an unexpected move, the bill lowered the incentive for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from $1.75 to $1.00 and made technical changes which make it difficult for a SAF producer using ethanol as their feedstock to claim the credit.

CORSIA is the world’s first global market-based measure to manage carbon emissions from a specific sector—international aviation.
The GSLTF proposal, according to IATA, contradicts the original international agreement to treat CORSIA as the sole mechanism, and risks creating a fragmented and inefficient climate policy landscape.
Rather than duplicating efforts, IATA urges states to support CORSIA, particularly by ensuring access to carbon credits essential for airline compliance.
IATA warned that this could ultimately reduce affordability and hinder economic growth—particularly in regions dependent on aviation.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has expressed strong disappointment over the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force’s (GSLTF) proposal to impose levies on air travel as a means of boosting domestic revenues for developing countries and supporting global initiatives such as climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, and other development goals.

According to IATA, an initial review of the GSLTF proposal reveals several serious flaws:

Air Travel Industry Margins Are Slim, Not Excessive

While the GSLTF lacks detailed justification, it references a CE Delft estimate suggesting a premium flyer levy could generate €78 billion (over $90 billion) annually—nearly three times the global airline industry’s projected 2024 profit of $32.4 billion. IATA points out that the industry operates on a structurally thin average profit margin of just 3.4%, about half the global average across all sectors. Any new financial burdens could therefore jeopardize industry viability.

Airlines Are Already Investing Heavily in Sustainability

The airline sector has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050—a transition expected to cost $4.7 trillion between 2024 and 2050. IATA warns that additional taxes could undermine the sector’s ability to fund these sustainability efforts, ultimately weakening its contribution to global GDP (3.9%) and employment (86.5 million jobs), while addressing its 2.5% share of global carbon emissions.

A Global Climate Framework for Aviation Already Exists

IATA criticized the GSLTF for overlooking the existing Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CORSIA is the world’s first global market-based measure to manage carbon emissions from a specific sector—international aviation. The GSLTF proposal, according to IATA, contradicts the original international agreement to treat CORSIA as the sole mechanism, and risks creating a fragmented and inefficient climate policy landscape. Rather than duplicating efforts, IATA urges states to support CORSIA, particularly by ensuring access to carbon credits essential for airline compliance.

No Impact Assessment on Economies or Travelers

IATA also pointed out that the GSLTF has not provided any assessment of how the proposed levies would impact the economies of the target countries or the global air travel market. While the proposal claims to target premium travel, it fails to acknowledge the critical role premium passengers play in supporting route viability. Penalizing this segment could disrupt connectivity and increase costs for all travelers and businesses relying on air cargo. IATA warned that this could ultimately reduce affordability and hinder economic growth—particularly in regions dependent on aviation.

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “Governments are proposing a tax that’s three times the industry’s profit, without considering the real-world consequences. These include impacts on remote communities, tourism, and trade—all of which depend on aviation. Moreover, history shows that such taxes often vanish into general budgets with little, if any, benefit for climate initiatives.”

Walsh also challenged the GSLTF’s claim that these levies would not affect the cost of living. “That’s simply not true. If implemented, these recommendations would raise travel costs across the board, weaken connectivity, and severely limit aviation’s ability to invest in reaching net zero by 2050,” he said.

He emphasized that the aviation industry is not avoiding its climate responsibilities. Airlines are actively investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), operational efficiencies, and cleaner technologies. “What we don’t need,” Walsh added, “is a $90 billion tax that drains resources from these critical efforts. Supporting SAF production is a far more effective way to achieve the GSLTF’s goals without undermining air connectivity and economic growth.”

Public Opinion Backs Aviation, Not More Taxes

IATA also cited global public opinion research conducted by Savanta in 15 countries, which found broad skepticism toward aviation taxation:

73% believe green taxes amount to government greenwashing

79% say there are already too many taxes on flying

78% think taxes are not the way to make aviation more sustainable

74% don’t trust governments to spend tax revenue wisely

88% say any taxes collected should go directly to improving air travel

Only 9% of respondents supported taxation as a way to address aviation’s carbon emissions. Alternatives like SAF investment (25%), clean technology (23%), emissions research (18%), and offsetting (13%) were significantly more popular.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-6.png,N,,2025-07-07 14:16:57.171166

Ltd has officially announced the implementation of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its commercial flights. This initiative, which commenced on July 1, 2025, is a cornerstone of the airline’s ongoing ‘Low Carbon Skies by Bangkok Airways’ campaign.

This widespread adoption follows a successful pilot program initiated in 2024, where Bangkok Airways began utilizing SAF on a test flight operating between Samui and Bangkok. Building on the insights and success of this pilot, the airline is now expanding its SAF usage to commercial routes. The initial phase of this commercial integration will see SAF-blended fuel used on flights departing from Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK) to key international destinations. These include Phnom Penh and Siem Reap in Cambodia, Luang Prabang in Laos, and the Maldives, showcasing Bangkok Airways’ commitment to extending its environmental efforts across its international network.

Initially, Bangkok Airways will incorporate SAF at a blend ratio of 1% with 99% Jet A-1 fuel. Even at this initial blending percentage, the environmental benefits are substantial. This blend is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by an average of approximately 128 kg of CO2 per flight. While seemingly a modest percentage, this incremental reduction across numerous flights will contribute significantly to the airline's overall emission reduction targets and sets a precedent for higher blend rates in the future as SAF production increases and becomes more widely available.

Captain Puttipong Prasarttong-Osoth, President of Bangkok Airways, emphasized the significance of this transition. ""The official use of SAF on commercial flights marks a significant milestone in the airline’s transition toward a more environmentally friendly aviation future,"" stated Captain Prasarttong-Osoth. He further elaborated that this initiative is directly aligned with the overarching goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions, a core principle of sustainability policies within the global aviation sector.

The airline's 'Low Carbon Skies by Bangkok Airways' campaign is a testament to its proactive approach to environmental stewardship. By investing in and adopting sustainable aviation technologies like SAF, Bangkok Airways is not only meeting growing regulatory pressures but also demonstrating leadership in an industry grappling with its environmental impact. This move is expected to inspire other airlines in the region to follow suit, fostering a collective push towards more sustainable aviation practices across Southeast Asia.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:34.688069

The Vietnamese government has committed to join the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global climate initiative aimed at reducing carbon emissions from international flights.

By regulating emissions and using carbon credits, it is expected to attract at least USD 5.6 million in annual investment into its carbon market. However, the move may also impose significant financial burdens on the country’s aviation sector.

Aligning with global standards may raise costs for airlines

Launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016, CORSIA uses market-based measures to help the global aviation industry meet its climate goals. Vietnam plans to join in 2026, final voluntary phase of the scheme, and gradually reduce its aviation emissions. The goal is to cap emissions at 85% of 2019 levels during 2024–2035 and to reach net zero by 2035.

According to the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, the government has already taken essential steps to join CORSIA, including issuing regulations on aviation fuel usage and emission tracking, implementing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for international flights, and submitting historical emission data (2019–2024) to ICAO.

ICAO praised Vietnam’s participation, noting that it demonstrates higher-than-expected readiness among developing countries. Initial estimates suggest Vietnamese airlines may spend an additional USD 5.6 million to USD 37.5 million annually on carbon credits.

Vietnamese authorities have also raised concerns that domestic airlines could face steep costs. During the voluntary phase, the total carbon offset expense is projected at USD 13 million to USD 92 million, depending on the carbon credit market price—which currently ranges between USD 6 and USD 40 per metric ton of CO₂-equivalent.

Vietnam Airlines expands SAF use; Vietjet invests in low-carbon fleet

Thanks to the rebound in international air travel and a successful debt restructuring, Vietnam Airlines posted a record net profit of VND 7.95 trillion (approx. USD 304 million) in 2024. At its shareholder meeting, the airline’s executives reaffirmed plans to modernize the fleet to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. The company is also actively exploring greater use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Vietnam Airlines conducted its first SAF-blended flight in 2024 on a route from Singapore to Hanoi. Later that year, it operated six domestic flights with SAF to mark World Environment Day.

Meanwhile, budget carrier Vietjet Air is preparing to participate in CORSIA and is investing heavily in fuel-efficient aircraft. In late June, the airline placed an order with Airbus for 100 A321neo narrow-body jets, which offer at least a 20% improvement in fuel efficiency. These aircraft can operate with up to 50% SAF content.",https://reccessary.com/data/news/cover/1751868497478828173.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:41.440265

Researchers from around the globe will this week attend the inaugural International Conference on Sustainable Aviation Research (ICSAR).

The three-day conference will shine a light on the collaborative work taking place that aims to develop and commercialise novel sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technologies, which will be pivotal in reducing carbon emissions in the years to come.

Developments in this area have accelerated in recent years, with researchers from Trinity establishing themselves as key players in this space. Last year, for example, the Trinity College Dublin Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Research Facility gained a new home at SMBC Aviation Capital’s new global headquarters at Fitzwilliam 28, in Dublin’s city centre.

Stephen Dooley, Professor in Trinity’s School of Physics, said: “As society moves towards net-zero carbon emissions, the associated transitions bring forth unique challenges that span industry, academia, and government entities at all levels. Making aviation more sustainable in this regard is just a piece of the puzzle but a significant one nonetheless, and we at Trinity are proud to provide international leadership.”

“For example, Trinity is the delivery partner for the ‘pre-screening' service of the EU SAF Clearing House managed by the EU Aviation Safety Authority, meaning our team essentially helps new SAF producers understand and stick to the strict rules of fuel evaluation processes, ensuring next-gen fuels are safe and of high quality. In addition, the Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre hosted by Trinity covers several research areas, looking at how to cut down greenhouse gases from planes and exploring new technologies for cleaner flying.”

“ICSAR 2025 will foster multidisciplinary dialogue on SAF research, development, policy, and implementation. This forum will not only promote vital collaboration across sectors but also ensure that today’s students receive the comprehensive, systems-level education and exposure necessary to continue driving innovation in this critically important field.”",https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/top-stories/featured/icsar-2025-conference/media/tcd/news-images/artturi-jalli-Su1gc1A63xE-unsplash-RS.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 14:17:12.889541

Now, the airport is looking to cement its status as an innovator when it opens its new central terminal in October. The industry's first on-airport, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) refinery is also in the plans.

CEO Christina Cassotis said during an interview at the IATA Annual General Meeting in New Delhi last month that she hopes construction on the refinery will begin next year.

The microgrid enables Pittsburgh Airport to be energy self-sufficient, a status that looked especially significant this spring, when power grid failures shut down London Heathrow and, in a separate incident, caused widespread flight disruptions at airports in Portugal and Spain.

Cassotis said the credibility Pittsburgh has achieved from having the microgrid should help it line up partners and purchase agreements for the SAF facility. She first announced her goal of refining SAF within the airport's 3,000 remaining acres in 2023. But after a deal that was in the works didn't come to fruition last year, the airport has secured an agreement with New Jersey-based clean fuels developer Avina, whose production facility would refine alcohol into SAF using Swedish technology licensed to the Houston-based firm KBR.

The refinery would produce 120 million gallons of SAF annually, Cassotis said, 70 million of which could be used at Pittsburgh Airport, with the remainder to be piped off-site and then shipped via rivers to airports in the Northeast, Midwest and Canada.

""We're going to get to final investment in the next six months,"" Cassotis said. ""Then it's just a question of when do you stick the shovel in the ground.""

Inside the new terminal

In the meantime, the airport hopes to grab attention with the opening of its tech-forward $1.7 billion central terminal this fall.

For example, said airport chief information officer Deepak Nayyar, the airport built its own data platform that will be able to assimilate information from various airport systems to help with cross-departmental decision-making.

Using data and AI, Pittsburgh Airport hopes to deploy predictive technology to facilitate tasks as varied as managing parking capacity, advising flyers on when they should leave their home and proactively replacing airport machinery before it breaks.

For enhanced security, the new terminal will also have segmented operating networks, which Cassotis said is a rarity in the airport industry. So, for example, if the baggage claim network falls victim to a cyberattack, the airport will be able to localize and fix the problem while other airport functions continue operating.

As far as features that everyday airport users will notice, Cassotis pointed to the design's comprehensive focus on accessibility, which accounts not only for those with mobility impairments but for caregivers and the hearing- and vision-impaired.

""Everything from signage height and placement to making sure people who are colorblind can distinguish contrast,"" the CEO said.

Flyers will also notice the terminal's overall aesthetic, which architect Luis Vidal described in a 2022 Travel Weekly interview as being like ""a pavilion surrounded by natural light, and by wood and by terraces.""

Large, accessible outdoor spaces will be one of the terminal's most notable characteristics.

""It really is beautiful,"" Cassotis said. ""It reflects Pittsburgh very nicely. It almost tells you about a community you don't know about, just through the design itself. And candidly, it makes sense. It's been very thoughtful, and I think it's going to change the way people feel when they travel.""",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/TW/uploadedImages/Art/2025/0623/T0623PITRendering_c_HR.jpg?n=2740&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-07-07 13:17:45.359873

The mechanism is part of a broader strategy to ensure a more secure energy supply, diversification, and decarbonisation.

The Hydrogen Mechanism is designed to facilitate the market development of renewable and low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives, including ammonia, methanol, and electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF).

The newly launched mechanism aims to empower market participants by matching and aggregating demand and supply.

It will assist in identifying infrastructure development needs and provide easier access to information on financial solutions, thus supporting the EU’s decarbonisation and energy independence objectives.

European Commissioner for Energy and Housing Dan Jørgensen said: “With the Hydrogen Mechanism launched …, we empower the European industry to seize competitive opportunities while advancing towards greater security of supply and decarbonisation. This is only the beginning of our work under the EU Energy and Raw Materials Platform, which shows that Europe is not just adapting to the future, it is actively shaping it.”

The stakeholders can register on the platform and subscribe to the EU Hydrogen Mechanism, with the first demand and supply matching session scheduled for September 2025.

The Raw Materials Mechanism and the Gas Mechanism are set to be introduced in the forthcoming months.

Hydrogen is increasingly recognised for its role in decarbonising industries where reducing carbon emissions is both urgent and challenging.

The EU’s commitment to climate neutrality by 2050 and its goal to become independent from Russian fossil fuels by the end of 2027 underscore the importance of hydrogen and its derivatives.

The bill, which initially stalled when House leadership encountered resistance from deficit hawks over approving procedural rules, was signed into law by the President on 4 July 2025. The bill includes major changes to clean energy tax credits and vehicle efficiency and emissions standards, which are outlined as follows.

Clean Fuels

Notably, the 45Z Clean Fuels Production Credit, which was set to expire in 2031 per earlier versions of the bill, is now set to end after 31 December 2029. The final bill also applies a restriction on foreign feedstocks. This could limit the growth of clean fuels such as renewable diesel, specifically for coastal facilities that rely on imported feedstocks to produce cleaner fuels. The bill also reduces the amount of crediting eligible for Sustainable Aviation Fuel but confirms that manure-based biogas remains eligible for the credit.

Carbon Sequestration and Enhanced Oil Recovery

The 45Q Tax Credit for Carbon Sequestration was left intact, with the tax credit for enhanced oil recovery being expanded to be on par with the credits received for geologic storage. This could encourage carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) activities being carried out at oil and refining facilities.

Zero-Emission Vehicle and Efficiency Standards

Additional Updates

The bill also modifies the 45V Clean Hydrogen Credit by making facilities that begin construction after 31 December 2028 no longer eligible. While this is seen as an extension given previous iterations suggested making this date 31 December 2025, this is still a lower window compared to the original 2033 date in the Inflation Reduction Act. While this may still benefit clean hydrogen projects, the limited time frame may hinder the commercial adoption of certain projects. The bill also keeps battery and solar tax credit eligibility through 2032 but ends crediting for wind projects in 2027 and phases out mineral credits by 2033. Finally, the bill doubles the biodiesel producer credit and extends it through 2026, strengthening margins for smaller Midwest and Northwest producers serving clean fuel markets.

Impact on Carbon Markets

The dismantling of foundational policy tools that pushed automakers toward fleet-wide electrification and rollbacks of incentives for clean fuel production risk stalling climate progress across the country, moving further away from the 1.5-degree warming target. While some revisions may in fact support near-term growth in clean fuels, the broader structural shifts that this bill introduces jeopardize overall decarbonization. Reduced federal incentives that supported achieving targets and emission reduction goals under Low-Carbon-Fuel Standards and Cap-and-Invest programs may slow the rate of emissions decline, adding bullish pressure to the programs.

This regulatory rollback may force states like California to reassess targets with respect to fuels’ carbon intensity, ZEV adoption, and overall emission forecasts in carbon markets.

Among these, Shougang LanzaTech's postponed Hong Kong IPO has drawn attention—not just for its potential as a carbon capture and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pioneer, but for the uncertainties clouding its path. Investors now face a classic dilemma: Can the company's strategic advantages in the green energy transition offset near-term risks tied to regulatory and legal ambiguities?

The Hong Kong IPO Boom: A Tailwind for ESG Plays

Hong Kong's IPO activity has soared in early 2025, with listings up 40% year-over-year as companies seek to avoid U.S. regulatory scrutiny and tap into Asia's growing pool of ESG-focused capital. . This trend is particularly favorable for firms like Shougang LanzaTech, which straddles the intersection of industrial decarbonization and aviation's urgent need for SAF.

The company's core technology—converting industrial carbon emissions into ethanol and SAF—aligns with Hong Kong's push to position itself as a leader in Asia's green finance ecosystem. Regulatory tailwinds include the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's revised ESG listing rules, which now mandate clearer sustainability disclosures, favoring transparent firms like LanzaTech.

Shougang LanzaTech's Strategic Advantages

Shougang LanzaTech combines the industrial clout of Shougang Group, China's steel giant, with LanzaTech's proprietary gas fermentation technology. Its 30-million-gallon SAF facilities in the UK and EU, leveraging CirculAir™, could position it as a key supplier to airlines aiming to meet 2030 emissions targets. Cost-cutting measures—including a 10-15% workforce reduction and spinning off non-core subsidiaries—signal a strategic pivot from R&D to commercial scale, a move critical for profitability.

The company's partnership with Rothschild & Co. to explore strategic transactions adds further upside potential, though execution risks remain. Its postponement of the Hong Kong IPO, while concerning, could reflect a deliberate strategy to address lingering regulatory questions before accessing Hong Kong's deep capital pools.

Risks and the Legal Gray Zone

Despite its strengths, Shougang LanzaTech faces two critical risks. First, the reasons for its IPO postponement remain opaque. While no specific legal disputes are publicly documented, delays in its U.S. SEC filings—pushed to May 24, 2025—hint at operational and regulatory challenges. Delays in financial reporting often correlate with investor skepticism, as seen in LanzaTech Global Inc.'s stock, which has underperformed the S&P 500 by ~25% over the past year.

Second, the company's reliance on industrial carbon capture raises execution hurdles. Scaling SAF production requires stable feedstock (e.g., carbon from steel plants), regulatory permits, and partnerships with airlines—a complex ecosystem where missteps could derail growth. Competitors like Velocys and Neste are also expanding rapidly, intensifying market pressures.

Valuation: A Balancing Act

The IPO's valuation hinges on two factors: the clarity of its regulatory path and the market's appetite for high-risk, high-reward ESG plays. If the postponement resolves lingering concerns—such as disclosure gaps or partnership terms—the Hong Kong market's current enthusiasm for green tech could support a premium valuation. However, if delays persist, fears of legal entanglements or execution failures may cap investor interest.

Investors should also weigh broader macro trends. Hong Kong's ESG-linked bond issuance hit record highs in Q1 2025, signaling strong demand for aligned equities. Yet, the market's recent volatility, driven by geopolitical jitters and interest rate uncertainty, could amplify risks for unproven IPOs.

Investment Takeaways

Wait for Clarity: The IPO postponement is a red flag, but not an automatic deal-breaker. Investors should demand transparency on the delay's cause and progress toward regulatory compliance before committing.

Focus on Execution: Monitor the launch of SAF facilities in the UK/EU and partnerships with airlines. Successful commercialization could validate LanzaTech's business model.

Consider the Market Cycle: Hong Kong's IPO boom may provide a window to access ESG capital, but bargain hunters might prefer waiting for a post-IPO price correction if the listing proceeds.

Conclusion

Shougang LanzaTech embodies both the promise and perils of the green energy transition. Its technology is undeniably cutting-edge, and Hong Kong's IPO boom offers a strategic platform to scale. Yet, the company's ability to navigate regulatory and operational hurdles will determine whether it becomes a leader or a cautionary tale. For investors, patience—and a close watch on the SEC filing deadline—will be rewarded.

In a market hungry for ESG solutions, the stakes are high. But without resolution to its delays, Shougang LanzaTech's IPO remains a gamble best reserved for those willing to bet on long-term carbon capture upside—and able to stomach near-term uncertainty.",,N,,2025-07-07 12:15:52.514924

Papeles de Energía, N.º 28 (julio 2025)

1. Intervención inicial

El desarrollo de los biocombustibles comienza con la primera crisis del petróleo, con el etanol. Posteriormente se introduce el biodiesel, que tiene el inconveniente de que únicamente se puede mezclar en cantidades limitadas. Pero, en cualquiera de los dos casos, solamente se han podido utilizar gracias a las desgravaciones fiscales, ya que nunca fueron competitivos con los combustibles convencionales.

Con la subida de los precios del petróleo previa a la crisis financiera de 2007-2008, se dispara la demanda de biocombustibles, y aparecen los problemas asociados a su competencia con los productos destinados a la alimentación. Esto lleva a la aparición de los biocombustibles de 2ª generación, esto es, aquellos basados en materias primas no utilizables para alimentación.

El paso siguiente es el desarrollo del HVO (aceite hidrogenado), que se puede mezclar en cualquier cantidad con el diesel. Al principio se elaboró con aceite de palma, pero los problemas de deforestación hacen que se sustituya por residuos o aceite usado (UCO). Los residuos (del aceite de palma) explican que los mayores exportadores actuales de HVO sean China, Malasia e Indonesia, y lo que hace surgir dudas sobre la sostenibilidad de este suministro a medio plazo.

A futuro, hay distintas vías de producción que pueden tener interés:

Una alternativa es la gasificación de la biomasa, un proceso tecnológicamente probado cuyo mayor inconveniente es el coste.

La vía del biometanol también es muy interesante, porque se puede producir gasolinas y olefinas a partir de esta materia prima. El metanol también se podría producir a partir de hidrógeno y CO2.

El biometano también presenta un potencial de interés, aunque limitado. Su coste está cercano a la competitividad, sobre todo si la recogida de los residuos es obligatoria.

El SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) tiene como problema fundamental el coste. Para 2040 se espera que su coste sea 3-4 veces superior al del queroseno.

Para concluir: la perspectiva de unos biocombustibles baratos capaces de alimentar la transición energética es dudosa, salvo que se asuma su mayor coste. Para el sector de la aviación y marítimo, o quizá para algún proceso industrial, pueden tener sentido. Pero, en general, son una solución necesaria, pero parcial. En este sentido, los objetivos europeos ya son ambiciosos, pero los del PNIEC superan esta categoría.

2. DEBATE

A continuación, se abre el debate en el que se ponen de manifiesto las siguientes opiniones:

Acerca de la sostenibilidad de los biocombustibles

Incluso aunque sean biocombustibles de 2ª generación hay una competencia indirecta por el uso de la tierra, que debe ser tenida en cuenta a la hora de valorar su sostenibilidad o las emisiones evitadas. Esto hace difícil pensar que exista un potencial muy elevado.

• A este respecto, es preciso afinar la regulación de las materias primas permitidas para producir HVO renovable.

La regulación actual española es más estricta que la europea en términos de usos de suelo.

Los biocombustibles utilizados en España reducen un 82 % de emisiones.

Acerca de la disponibilidad de materias primas

La restricción fundamental para que los biocombustibles crezcan está en el acceso a las materias primas. Se defiende que la Comisión Europea debería ampliar la lista de materias disponibles.

La correlación temporal para producir los RFNBO y la adicionalidad es muy restrictiva.

Si España es líder en porcino, no se explica la falta de exigencia de los purines. Lo primero es exigir el tratamiento de residuos.

Por otra parte, no se espera que la disponibilidad de residuos crezca mucho si avanzamos en economía circular, eficiencia, etcétera.

No se entiende que la biomasa no se pueda usar para producir los RFNBO.

Se apunta a un informe realizado por Imperial College, UK, en el que se defiende que existe en la UE materia prima más que suficiente para cumplir los objetivos.

Acerca de su competitividad económica

El aumento de costes respecto a los convencionales no es relevante: ese modelo tradicional ya no es la alternativa. Eso habría que explicarlo bien.

Las economías de escala pueden permitir reducir significativamente el precio.

La forma más barata actualmente para producir biocombustibles es coprocesarlos en refinería.

Cada vez hay más acoplamiento entre sectores. Y en un contexto en que hay limitación en la materia prima, cada vez hay más competencia entre sectores por los combustibles. Y esto se puede traducir en escalada de costes. ¿Quién pagará más?

La regulación va a influir mucho en esto: por ejemplo, en cómo se computan las emisiones. Por ejemplo, los residuos ganaderos “valen” mucho más que los agrícolas.

No trasponemos las directivas de residuos, porque eso es competencia de los ayuntamientos. Esto explica que no haya coste de tratamiento de los residuos.

España debería tener una normativa mucho más estricta sobre los residuos para aumentar la disponibilidad y bajar el coste. Hay que darles también una vuelta a los certificados de origen. Y el tema de entorno internacional.

Para que el ahorro privado invierta hace falta que tenga un retorno claro y transparente. Ese es el principal problema de la industria de los bios.

En España el coste de transporte de los bios es mucho mayor que en otros países.

El riesgo tecnológico sigue siendo muy alto, y eso exige alta rentabilidad. Los offtakers dicen que no es un problema de CAPEX, sino de OPEX.

El modelo de negocio del biometano es muy difícil de estandarizar.

Acerca del papel de los biocombustibles en la transición

En España el lobby agrícola no es tan poderoso como en Francia o en EE. UU., lo que explica en parte el poco desarrollo que ha tenido lugar.

Los biocombustibles son imprescindibles para cumplir los muy ambiciosos objetivos de descarbonización del transporte.

En el sector aéreo hace falta al menos un 70 % de SAF para cumplir los objetivos.

El sector marítimo y aéreo son difíciles de electrificar, con la complicación de que son negocios globales.

Los objetivos del PNIEC son poco creíbles. Pero es una ruta viable/imprescindible siempre que la regulación se adapte.

El PNIEC se ha elaborado en un contexto ideológico distinto del que impera ahora en Europa. La captura de CO2, la economía circular, van a hacer que se revisen todas estas cuestiones, hacia un plan más posibilista.

Los planes hay que hacerlos desde la demanda, no para mantener la estructura de la oferta. Hay que pensar en cómo va a evolucionar la demanda.

Esta transición, para poder hacerse muy rápido, necesita mucho dinero. Para bios, H2, los RFNBO. Y ese dinero no lo tienen los países europeos. Y los ciudadanos no están dispuestos a pagar más. Hay que buscar cómo involucrar a los ciudadanos. O somos capaces de lograr que el ciudadano vea un retorno, o esto se queda en papel. Una opción es ofrecer bonos del Estado para los ciudadanos, y que gane dinero con ello.

Sería más interesante enfocarse en los productos finales: cemento verde, acero verde, amoníaco verde. Y no tanto en la producción de bios o H2.

Es muy importante también contar con reglas de comercio global en estos productos verdes, certificación homogénea.

El sector del automóvil está en una crisis seria, en parte por la incertidumbre. Hay necesidad de hacer compatibles los objetivos de descarbonización con los de mantenimiento de la competitividad de la industria europea. Los biocombustibles pueden jugar un papel ahí.",https://www.funcas.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/funcas-32x32-1.png,N,,2025-07-07 09:11:38.873682

A key short-term challenge that stands out in the recent Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025 is the availability and cost of sustainable aviation fuel.

Geopolitical headwinds and a shaky economic outlook make this a critical moment for concerted action to keep net-zero aviation within the collective grasp by 2050.

Aviation is a tough industry to decarbonize, not least because efficiency gains need to keep pace with increasing air traffic demand.

With air traffic projected to double by 2042 from around 12 billion passengers a year, net-zero aviation, currently targeted for 2050, feels a long way off. Recent data from the environmental group Transport & Environment reveals that emissions from European airline flights will be 4% above 2019 levels by the end of December 2025 – further evidence of the challenge to decarbonize.

“Nobody in the industry can wave a magic wand or work very hard and accomplish carbon neutrality or sustainability by themselves. They really need to have everybody in the industry working collaboratively,” Justin Erbacci, director general of Airports Council International World, told Radio Davos.

There are many ways to reduce the climate impact of flying; some can be adopted almost immediately, such as using more and better-quality sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80% on a lifecycle basis.

Others will take more time, such as aircraft powered by batteries, which could materialize within the next decades or hydrogen, which has the potential to power larger, longer-distance flights in the longer term.

Of all the challenges highlighted in the recent Global Aviation Sustainability Outlook 2025 – which collates insights from top aviation executives, there is one in particular that stands out in the short term: the availability and cost of SAF.

“

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp.

”

The SAF bottleneck

It is a chicken-and-egg problem. While there may be demand for SAF from airlines, supply is limited and prices are projected to remain two to three times higher than jet fuel until 2030. However, it will be hard to boost production and reduce production costs without reaching greater scale.

SAF producers need to be confident that demand will continue to grow and need long-term offtake agreements to obtain the necessary funding to build production facilities from financiers.

According to Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of Dubai Airports, “The global jet fuel market is worth around $254 billion per year, with SAF representing just 0.7% of total fuel production.”

If SAF production doubles every two years, he says, it would still take over seven and a half years for 10% of total jet fuel to come from sustainable sources.

“It’s a very big problem. It needs a big solution, and it needs huge investment,” says Griffiths.

“Industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn’t incentivize poor behaviour.” He notes that one solution would be a levy on aviation fuel or ticket prices, such as the scheme recently applied in Singapore, where just under $2 per passenger is channelled towards SAF production.

Although it would result in “justifiable” costs being passed on to the consumer, he says “We could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis.” Recently, the UK government also proposed a levy on fossil jet fuel to fund local SAF production.

High-stakes need for policy alignment

The introduction of new measures and regulations to support SAF by an increasing number of countries strengthens the importance of international standards and policy consistency.

To encourage investment and consistent SAF adoption worldwide, SAF policies benefit from international alignment and any subsidies to incentivise their production must provide long-term clarity to investors. If countries don’t act in unison in these areas, policy effectiveness will suffer.

Ayesha Choudhury, chief commercial officer at Infinium – a market leader in ultra-low carbon synthetic efuels – says “policy certainty” is key: “predictable revenue… that’s enabled by policy certainty… is really important for off-takers to be able to commit to the long- term agreements that are necessary to get the plants built.”

A great risk is that geopolitical headwinds can slow down aviation decarbonization efforts. Increasing protectionism and tariffs are sparking particular concern among aviation executives.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilizing exports of feedstock, the raw material for SAF, as well as fuelling domestic energy security concerns. With supply chains under stress, feedstock prices are rising, further squeezing the margins of active SAF plants and affecting their production outlooks.

In addition to political risks, magnified by last year’s “super elections” that threaten to shift government priorities and lead to policy reversals, there are also economic ones.

Despite lower inflation and strong growth in the aviation sector, with revenues exceeding $1 trillion for the first time this year, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets.

Net zero is within reach

Route closures, rising labour costs, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and could divert the sector’s focus from the net-zero agenda.

This is a critical moment for the aviation industry. Updated state action plans for decarbonization are due to be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation by September, as stakeholders try to walk the fine line between accelerating decarbonization and boosting the sector’s growth in the wake of COVID-19.

Actions taken now will determine the viability of internationally agreed targets, such as reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp. SAF will undoubtedly play a key role in this journey, especially in the short to medium term. But it will not, by itself, be enough.

As other technologies become increasingly available, swift and concerted action – from governments and regulators to airports, airlines and businesses along the wider value chain – will be critical.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_p4ajZPSgg-YrLk_SDFrWyLvjcfZX-JMquK0fhOAU3nU.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 09:12:01.931431

Yet, every progressive policy shift, especially from nations with growing air transport networks, signals momentum toward a greener future. Recently, Turkey unveiled a transformative policy directive focused on Sustainable Aviation Fuel, marking a defining moment for its civil aviation sector. This new regulatory framework serves as more than just an environmental benchmark — it reflects a deeper commitment to aligning domestic capabilities with international sustainability norms.

A Policy Rooted in Strategy and Vision

Turkey’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel directive is not merely a compliance mechanism. It represents a strategic blueprint aligned with the nation’s net zero by 2053 ambition. By embedding sustainability into the regulatory structure of its aviation sector, Turkey is signaling its intention to be a proactive player in climate stewardship — not just a respondent to global pressure.

The directive encompasses wide-reaching requirements, from minimum SAF usage thresholds to domestic fuel sourcing obligations. Such stipulations do not arise in isolation. They are designed to simultaneously boost industrial capability, strengthen energy security, and ensure alignment with standards such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

Domestic Production as a Pillar of Progress

A key feature of the directive is its focus on cultivating local SAF production. By encouraging investment in domestic refining infrastructure, Turkey is not only reducing reliance on imported fossil fuels but also seeding innovation in its energy and technology sectors. This is an often overlooked yet powerful enabler of long-term emissions reduction: homegrown capacity.

The inclusion of players like Tupras and SOCAR Turkey in early-stage SAF development is promising. Their involvement indicates that the policy is not aspirational alone — it is already attracting serious investment and technical momentum. By 2026, commercial-scale production is expected to begin, positioning Turkey as a credible contributor to the global SAF supply chain.

Regulatory Clarity and Market Confidence

The directive outlines that Turkey’s Civil Aviation Directorate will annually publish SAF usage and minimum emission reduction requirements. This commitment to regulatory transparency is critical for market stability and stakeholder preparedness.

Moreover, the requirement for carriers to load at least ninety percent of their fuel in Turkey ensures that domestic SAF production has a guaranteed off-take mechanism. It also establishes a controlled ecosystem where tracking, compliance, and quality assurance are streamlined under national supervision. These dynamics foster confidence among suppliers, investors, and carriers alike.

Inclusive Policy Design and Sectoral Focus

The scope of the directive is thoughtfully designed. It applies to a broad segment of aviation stakeholders — from national and international carriers to airport operators and licensed fuel providers. Importantly, humanitarian, medical, and state-owned aircraft are exempt, balancing sustainability goals with operational realities.

The tonnage-based threshold for applicability ensures the directive targets flights with the most significant fuel consumption and emissions potential. This prioritisation reinforces impact without compromising the flexibility required for niche operators or emergency missions.

A Model of Proactive Transition

Turkey’s SAF directive provides a compelling example of how regulatory leadership can facilitate meaningful transition. By codifying sustainability as a shared responsibility — across government, industry, and infrastructure — the directive lays a path for other emerging economies with expanding aviation networks.

Sustainability professionals often emphasise systems thinking and cross-sector collaboration. This policy exemplifies both. It leverages domestic energy policy, global climate frameworks, and aviation economics into a single regulatory instrument. In doing so, it reflects a maturing understanding of climate action as a long-term developmental strategy.

Conclusion

Turkey’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel directive is more than an environmental milestone. It is a case study in how sustainability can be embedded into national infrastructure planning with foresight, structure, and collaborative intent.

For those in the transport and sustainability sectors, it offers a timely reminder: transition is not just about technology or targets. It is also about crafting frameworks that enable innovation, demand accountability, and drive local value creation.

As new regional and national directives emerge around SAF and green aviation, professionals in sustainability consulting, policy design, and transport operations should look closely at how such models evolve. These are not isolated steps — they are part of a broader climb toward resilient, future-proofed mobility systems.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-71.svg,N,,2025-07-07 08:00:24.735897

This move, finalized in July 2025 during Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to France, signals a bold bet on long-term operational efficiency, regional market leadership, and alignment with Airbus' competitive edge in the widebody aircraft market. For investors, this decision offers a lens into both Malaysia Airlines' growth ambitions and Airbus' prospects in the booming ASEAN aviation sector.

Fleet Efficiency: The Cost-Saving Catalyst

The A330neo's 25% improvement in fuel efficiency over the Boeing 767-300ER and 14% better per-seat efficiency than its predecessor, the A330ceo, are central to Malaysia Airlines' calculus. With fuel costs typically accounting for 20-30% of an airline's operating expenses, these savings could translate into significant margin improvements. The airline's plan to replace its aging A330ceo fleet (average age 15 years) with newer, more efficient aircraft directly addresses a critical pain point in the post-pandemic aviation recovery.

The A330neo's 7,200-nautical-mile range also unlocks flexibility, enabling Malaysia Airlines to serve high-potential Asian and South Pacific routes—from Bali to Melbourne—without sacrificing fuel efficiency. This dual capability positions the airline to capitalize on pent-up demand in tourism-dependent economies like Malaysia's, which saw international arrivals surge by 140% in 2024 compared to 2022.

Regional Dominance: ASEAN's Aviation Rebound

Malaysia Airlines' order is not merely about cost-cutting but also about reclaiming market share in the ASEAN region. The airline's new A330neo fleet, configured with 297 seats (28 in business class and 269 in economy), aligns with the growing premiumization of travel in Southeast Asia. Analysts project the region's aviation market to grow at a 5.8% CAGR through 2030, driven by rising middle-class incomes and infrastructure investments like Malaysia's RM50 billion (US$11.5 billion) airport modernization plan.

By 2031, when all 40 A330neos are in service, Malaysia Airlines will have a fleet capable of efficiently connecting its hub in Kuala Lumpur to emerging hubs in Jakarta, Ho Chi Minh City, and beyond. The aircraft's sustainability features—including compatibility with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today and a target of 100% by 2030—also position it to meet stringent environmental regulations in the EU and Asia, where carbon taxes are increasingly a factor.

Airbus' Competitive Edge: Capturing Modernization Demand

Malaysia Airlines' commitment underscores Airbus' dominance in the widebody aircraft segment. The A330neo's global order book now stands at 384 firm orders, with Malaysia Airlines becoming Asia-Pacific's largest regional operator of the type. This success contrasts with Boeing's struggles in the mid-capacity widebody market, where the 767 and 787 face stiff competition.

Airbus' Flight Hour Services (FHS) partnership with Malaysia Airlines further solidifies its ecosystem play. By offering maintenance and technical support, Airbus reduces operational risks for its customers while locking in long-term service revenue—a model that has proven lucrative for Boeing's Global Services division.

The A330neo's planned upgrade to a 253-tonne Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) by 2028 adds another layer of strategic value, enabling carriers to optimize payloads for both passengers and cargo—a critical factor as airlines diversify revenue streams.

Investment Thesis: Airbus and ASEAN Aviation

For investors, Malaysia Airlines' A330neo expansion presents two compelling opportunities:

1. Airbus (AIR.PA): The order reinforces Airbus' position as the go-to partner for Asian carriers modernizing their fleets. With a backlog of over 1,800 A330 and A350 orders, the company is well-positioned to benefit from ASEAN's aviation boom. Investors should watch for further order momentum from regional carriers like Singapore Airlines or Thai Airways.

2. ASEAN Aviation Sector: Exposure to airports (KLIA, Changi Airport), ground-handling firms, and even SAF producers could pay dividends as traffic rebounds. Malaysia's focus on green aviation aligns with the EU's FuelEU Aviation initiative, creating regulatory tailwinds.

Risks to Consider

Delivery Delays: Airbus' production capacity constraints, particularly for the A350, could strain its ability to meet Malaysia Airlines' 2029–2031 delivery timeline.

Fuel Price Volatility: While the A330neo's efficiency mitigates this risk, a sustained spike in oil prices could still pressure margins.

Geopolitical Risks: Regional instability or trade disputes could dampen travel demand, though ASEAN's economic integration buffers against this to some extent.

Conclusion: A Win-Win for Strategy and Investment

Malaysia Airlines' A330neo expansion is a masterstroke that blends cost discipline, regional growth, and strategic alignment with Airbus' technological strengths. For investors, this is more than a fleet upgrade—it's a catalyst for long-term value creation in both the airline and its key supplier. With ASEAN aviation set to outpace global growth, Airbus' leadership in this space and Malaysia Airlines' renewed competitiveness make them prime picks for portfolios focused on the region's recovery.

Final Note: Investors should monitor Malaysia Airlines' load factor trends and Airbus' order pipeline in Asia-Pacific as key metrics of this strategy's success.",,N,,2025-07-07 09:12:11.481966

The solidarity levy would introduce a parallel carbon pricing system, which IATA says risks undermining CORSIA and could fracture international cooperation on aviation climate policy.
IATA urged governments, including GSLTF member states, to strengthen CORSIA implementation rather than introduce overlapping and inconsistent measures.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has issued a sharp rebuttal to a recent proposal by the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), which recommends imposing new taxes on air travel to support climate change mitigation, pandemic preparedness, and broader developmental challenges in lower-income nations. Describing the plan as ill-conceived, economically damaging, and counterproductive, IATA underscored that such levies would undermine global connectivity, financial sustainability of airlines, and ongoing environmental commitments.

A Disproportionate Financial Burden on Aviation

At the heart of IATA’s criticism is the financial scale of the proposed levy. A study cited by the GSLTF suggests that a premium flyer tax could generate €78 billion (approximately USD 90 billion) annually—a figure IATA notes is nearly three times the airline industry’s projected global profit of USD 32.4 billion for 2024. Given the industry's razor-thin net profit margin of just 3.4%, IATA contends that siphoning such vast sums would be unsustainable and jeopardize the sector’s viability.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh cautioned that governments are mistakenly viewing aviation as a financial “cash cow,” warning that the burden of new taxes would ripple through economies and reduce connectivity, especially to remote and developing regions. “The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” Walsh emphasized.

Aviation’s Trillion-Dollar Commitment to Sustainability

The aviation sector is already confronting a mammoth investment challenge to meet its environmental goals. Airlines worldwide have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, a transition estimated to cost USD 4.7 trillion over the next 25 years. Key strategies include the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), fleet modernization, operational efficiency, and emerging technologies.

Imposing a solidarity levy would not only divert capital away from these investments but also penalize premium passengers, who are critical to maintaining viable route structures. The reduction in premium demand could shrink connectivity options, especially for regions where such revenue cross-subsidizes lower fare classes.

CORSIA: A Global Framework Already in Place

Another major objection from IATA is the GSLTF’s disregard for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), a globally agreed-upon market-based mechanism developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). CORSIA aims to cap international aviation emissions and manage them through offsetting mechanisms.

The solidarity levy would introduce a parallel carbon pricing system, which IATA says risks undermining CORSIA and could fracture international cooperation on aviation climate policy. IATA urged governments, including GSLTF member states, to strengthen CORSIA implementation rather than introduce overlapping and inconsistent measures.

Economic and Consumer Impact Largely Ignored

IATA further criticized the GSLTF for failing to assess the broader economic and social impacts of the proposed levy. There has been no analysis of how such taxes would affect travel affordability, route networks, or the economies of developing nations—the very beneficiaries of the funds.

The association warned that higher airfares caused by excessive taxation would disproportionately affect low-income travelers and hinder the flow of goods and services, especially in island nations and isolated communities that rely heavily on air transport.

Public Skepticism of Air Travel Taxes

IATA backed its position with new international survey data from Savanta, which polled citizens in 15 countries:

79% believe there are already too many taxes on flying

78% reject taxation as a viable path to aviation sustainability

74% distrust governments to manage such tax revenues responsibly

88% believe air travel tax revenues should be used to improve the travel experience

Only 9% support taxation as the preferred solution to carbon emissions

Alternatives with higher public support included Sustainable Aviation Fuel investments (25%), technology enhancements (23%), and emissions reduction research (18%).

A Call for Practical, Sector-Specific Solutions

Willie Walsh concluded by affirming the industry’s commitment to climate action, while emphasizing that punitive taxes are not the answer. “The last thing these efforts need is a USD 90 billion gut punch of a tax,” he stated. Instead, the GSLTF’s objectives would be better served by enabling SAF production and access to carbon credits, allowing airlines to sustainably connect people and businesses across the globe.

As governments deliberate on the GSLTF recommendations, IATA is urging stakeholders to prioritize collaboration, consistency, and investment—not fiscal extractions—to ensure aviation remains a driver of economic prosperity and environmental responsibility.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/25_03_2025_14_13_39_7215916.webp?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:39.792621

In 2025 and 2024, low-cost carrier Flynas in Saudi Arabia has seen unprecedented growth and has become the fastest-growing airline in the Middle East region. From its strategic expansion in its fleet to diversifying its routes and improving operations, Flynas looks set to sustain its upward momentum

Explosive Growth in Passenger Numbers

Flynas has seen its passenger numbers soar in 2024, reaching over 7 million travelers, marking a 47% increase from the previous year. The airline’s success is tied to its expansion strategy, which has focused on increasing domestic and international routes, improving customer service, and maintaining affordability without compromising quality. This surge in passengers has cemented Flynas as one of the leading carriers in the region, with a strong reputation for offering competitive fares and efficient service.

The increased demand for Flynas’ services is not only a reflection of the airline’s competitive pricing but also the result of the growing demand for air travel within Saudi Arabia and across the Middle East. As more people seek cost-effective travel options, Flynas has successfully tapped into this demand by offering flexible, accessible flights to a wide variety of destinations. The airline’s route network has expanded considerably, and its services now span several major international destinations, offering travelers more options than ever before.

Expansion of Flynas’ Fleet and New Aircraft Orders

As part of its strategy to meet the growing demand, Flynas has made significant investments in expanding its fleet. In 2024, the airline added several new aircraft to its operations, bringing its fleet size to 61, which includes Airbus A320 and A330 series aircraft. The airline has also signed agreements for additional planes, including 75 Airbus A320neo aircraft and 15 Airbus A330-900s, as part of a $5.7 billion deal. These new aircraft will allow Flynas to expand its routes and increase its capacity, especially on high-demand international routes.

The expansion of the fleet is expected to continue through 2025, with Flynas’ focus on modernizing its aircraft to include more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly options. The Airbus A320neo and A330-900 aircraft are part of Flynas’ commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing the overall passenger experience. The airline’s strategic investment in new aircraft will provide a more comfortable, efficient, and sustainable option for travelers in the region.

New Destinations and Increased Frequencies

Flynas’ growth is not limited to fleet expansion. The airline has also significantly increased its number of routes, offering new international destinations and increasing frequencies on existing ones. Among the new routes added in 2024 were flights to major cities in Europe and Asia, including Istanbul, Cairo, and Dubai, allowing the airline to tap into new markets and strengthen its regional connectivity.

In addition to expanding its network, Flynas has also introduced more frequent flights on its most popular routes. For example, the airline now operates over 20 daily flights between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, a vital market for both business and leisure travel. Flynas has become one of the primary carriers for flights between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, further solidifying its position as the dominant low-cost carrier in the region.

The addition of more routes and frequencies has helped Flynas capitalize on the growing demand for travel within the Middle East and beyond, with the airline now offering more direct flights to cities in Europe, Asia, and Africa. This expansion strategy has allowed Flynas to increase its market share in the competitive Middle Eastern aviation market, outpacing other regional LCCs.

Sustainability and Environmental Initiatives

Flynas has also made sustainability a key priority in its business strategy. The airline has committed to reducing its carbon emissions and has partnered with international organizations to offset the environmental impact of its flights. In 2024, Flynas offset over 625,000 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to planting 25 million trees. This initiative aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy and reduce the country’s carbon emissions.

The airline’s new fleet of Airbus A320neo and A330-900 aircraft plays a crucial role in its sustainability efforts, as these planes are more fuel-efficient and produce fewer emissions compared to older models. Flynas is also working on implementing other green technologies and practices, including carbon offset programs and investments in sustainable aviation fuel.

Flynas’ IPO and Financial Growth

In 2025, Flynas is preparing for a major financial move: the airline is set to launch its initial public offering (IPO) on the Riyadh Stock Exchange. The IPO, which could raise up to $1.1 billion, marks a significant milestone for the airline and its shareholders. This IPO is expected to help Flynas secure additional capital to fund its continued growth, including further fleet expansion, new routes, and enhanced passenger services.

Flynas’ financial performance in 2024 and the first quarter of 2025 has been robust. In the first quarter of 2025, the airline reported a net profit of SAR 148 million, a 5% increase compared to the same period in the previous year. The airline’s revenue growth is a direct result of its expanding passenger base, new aircraft, and growing market share in the region.

Looking Ahead: Flynas’ Path to Global Recognition

Flynas is on a clear path to becoming one of the leading low-cost carriers not just in the Middle East but globally. The airline’s success in 2024 and 2025 is just the beginning. As Flynas prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary in 2027, it is focused on continuing its expansion into international markets, modernizing its fleet, and offering new and innovative services to its customers.

“These tools are vital not only for safety but also enhance fuel efficiency.” She mentioned ongoing enhancements focusing on artificial intelligence which will lead to deeper analytical capabilities moving forward.
A Complete Approach Towards Environmental Accountability Sustainability efforts at Lufthansa Cargo are supported by an evolving global environmental management system established back in ’07.","Lufthansa Cargo is taking steps to align with Europe’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) initiative, but it has some reservations.As stated by the airline, the existing regulations could potentially harm the competitiveness of European carriers.With a 2025 target for a 2 percent SAF blend looming, Lufthansa is advocating for a more balanced regulatory framework or a carbon border adjustment to ensure fair competition.

Bettina Petzold, who leads Corporate Obligation at Lufthansa cargo, expressed concerns: “Simply mandating blending won’t create a viable SAF market on its own. The EU’s current policies overlook critical supply and pricing challenges: biogenic SAF is scarce and can cost up to five times more then customary kerosene. In fact, in 2023, SAF accounted for only about 0.2 percent of global fuel needs.”

The airline also highlighted competitive imbalances in the aviation sector: “The current rules put EU airlines at a disadvantage compared to those from regions like the Gulf or China,” she pointed out. “We’re calling for regulations that treat all players equally regarding SAF mandates or introduce an equitable Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for non-compliant airlines.”

Innovative Carbon Tracking and Flexible SAF Options

Lufthansa Cargo isn’t just voicing concerns; they are actively implementing SAF solutions tailored for various customer needs.

Petzold shared insights on their offerings: “We provide three services that help customers transparently reduce their carbon footprint through purchasing SAF,” she explained. “Our ‘Sustainable choice’ service is available globally across all routes and capacities—allowing CO2 emissions reductions of up to 80%. This process can be completed easily online and appeals not only to large clients but also small-to-medium-sized forwarders.”

The company also offers bulk purchases of over 100 tons of SAF with specific allocations tied to identified transport routes—ensuring no double counting occurs globally—and special charter deals are available as well.

Petzold emphasized traceability in their operations: “We focus on high-quality biogenic residues like used cooking oils—not palm oil—for our SAF production. Each purchase comes with certification from an external auditor ensuring compliance.”

This commitment has already yielded results; Petzold noted that through these initiatives, approximately 8,500 tonnes of CO2 were saved in just one year.

The exact breakdown of how much SAF was used per route will be clearer by early 2026 as calculations continue.

Data-Driven Strategies and Fleet Modernization

Lufthansa Cargo is increasingly relying on digital tools within its strategy aimed at reducing carbon emissions—especially concerning fuel efficiency.

“Our Fuel efficiency Team employs specialized software that thoroughly analyzes fuel consumption throughout all flight phases,” said Petzold. “These tools are vital not only for safety but also enhance fuel efficiency.” She mentioned ongoing enhancements focusing on artificial intelligence which will lead to deeper analytical capabilities moving forward.

“We’re also working on advanced analytic tools resembling ‘digital twins’ capable of predicting changes in kerosene usage based on various factors such as aircraft modifications,” she added; though this technology remains under growth.

Lufthansa has revamped its fleet significantly since late 2021 by transitioning entirely to Boeing’s modern freighter model—the Boeing 777F—which boasts superior environmental performance among freighters today.Currently operating twelve units with plans for seven additional B777-8 freighters expected by 2030 promises even greater efficiency improvements according to Boeing’s projections.

“Alongside fleet upgrades and increased use of sustainable fuels we’re targeting an additional four percent reduction in emissions by the year 2030,” Petzold noted.

A Complete Approach Towards Environmental Accountability

Sustainability efforts at Lufthansa Cargo are supported by an evolving global environmental management system established back in ’07.

“CO2, along with noise metrics have been tracked as the ’90s laying groundwork towards structured environmental management,” explained Petzold.

La iniciativa está impulsada por un equipo de la provincia del Chubut, que será la sede de la inversión, junto a dos compañías europeas.

La Federación Europea para el Transporte y el Ambiente resaltó el plan chubutense y lo colocó en su mapa global de iniciativas de este tipo.

“El SAF es el derivado del hidrógeno verde con mayor proyección comercial y Chubut ofrece una plataforma natural única para su producción”, explicó Ismael Retuerto, especialista en energía y uno de los impulsores e integrante de la asociación Transición Energética Sustentable (TES).

Una alianza estratégica entre la alemana GreenSinnergy y la francesa Axens contempla el desarrollo de Eco-Refinerías del Sur, cuya propuesta es pionera en el país y la región. La elección de Chubut no es casual: allí existe un excepcional recurso eólico, considerado de los mejores del mundo. En la actualidad, hay varios parques eólicos que construyeron empresas de generación renovable y también petroleras.

El proyecto Eco-Refinerías del Sur se encuentra a la fecha en etapa de factibilidad técnica y económica. El objetivo no sólo es construir una planta de producción de SAF en la Patagonia, sino también desarrollar una cadena de valor regional con fuerte impacto industrial y generación de empleo calificado.

El reconocimiento de la Unión Europea es un hito para el desarrollo de este plan que contribuirá a la aviación argentina, que podría comenzar a integrar SAF de origen nacional en sus operaciones antes del fin de la década.

El SAF o Sustainable Aviation Fuel es la opción más inmediata para reducir las emisiones del sector aéreo, en particular en rutas de media y larga distancia donde las tecnologías eléctricas aún no son viables. Al ser producido a partir de fuentes renovables -como aceites reciclados, residuos o hidrógeno verde- permite reducir entre un 50% y 60% las emisiones en comparación con el combustible fósil tradicional.

Desde 2021, el impulso internacional al SAF ha ganado tracción gracias al compromiso de la IATA (International Air Transport Association) de alcanzar emisiones netas cero en 2050. Otro factor clave para su impulso es la implementación de mandatos de mezcla como el europeo, que exige un 6% de SAF para 2030.

El proyecto chubutense está en línea con las metas ambientales de la industria y los compromisos del país en materia de transición energética.

“Según el mandato ReFuelEU, al menos el 1,2 % de todo el combustible para aviones suministrado a los aeropuertos de la UE debe ser e-queroseno para 2030, cifra que aumentará al 35 % para 2050”, dice el informe de la Federación Europea para el Transporte y el Ambiente.",https://www.rionegro.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/aviacion-europea.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:52.580748

The recommendation from the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF) was to tax premium flyers, defined as those flying in business and first class and those on private jets.

The aim was to “improve domestic revenue mobilisation of developing countries and support international solidarity (in particular with regards to climate change mitigation and adaptation, pandemics and other development challenges).”

IATA has rejected the proposal on several grounds, stating that the aviation industry is extremely competitive, has ‘thin’ net profit margins, and that the estimate of how much could be raised by such a tax is three times the airline industry’s global estimated profit.

The GSLTF announcement quotes a CE Delft estimation that a premium flyer levy could generate €78 billion (over US$90 billion) per year. The airline industry’s global estimated profit, meanwhile, was US$32.4 billion in 2024.

Airlines’ structurally thin net profit margin (estimated at an average of 3.4% industry-wide for 2024 and approximately half the global average for all industries) must also be considered in any policy deliberation.

In addition, IATA points to its own ‘Multi-Trillion Dollar Commitment to Sustainability’. This number comes from an estimate of what it will cost the industry (US$4.7 trillion) to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The industry also points out that it delivers a direct contribution of 3.9% of global GDP and 86.5 million jobs globally. IATA says that “increasing aviation taxes on airlines as proposed will limit the industry’s ability to invest in solutions that deliver long-term emissions reductions”.

The association also mentioned its Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) which was agreed through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

IATA says that overlapping measures, such as the Solidarity Levy, would undermine CORSIA and lead towards a “fragmented, inefficient and inconsistent global policy framework.”

For more details of this scheme see our previous articles here:

What is CORSIA?

CORSIA offsets – how do they work?

Carbon offsets for aviation emissions: arguments for and against

From an economic angle, the criticism from IATA is twofold. Firstly, it points to the economic benefits of tourism and aviation have on “the economies of the very states to which [the GSLTF proposal] aims to funnel the funds, or the broader impact it will have on all travellers”.

It also says that while the proposal targets premium travellers, that segment is of “… critical importance… to making route networks viable. Punishing premium travellers or burdening the sector with excessive taxes would upend route dynamics which enable the connectivity that nearly five billion travellers will rely upon this year.

“The impact of the GSLTF’s proposal would make airlines less efficient and more financially strained. This would mean higher costs for all travellers and for items shipped by air. Such reduced affordability for a sector that is an indispensable economic catalyst ultimately brings the unintended consequence of weaker economic growth”.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, commented:

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow. Yet governments casually suggest a tax on flyers that is three times the airline industry’s annual profit without considering the real-world side effects for an industry that is a lifeline for remote communities, invigorates tourism markets and links local products to global markets.

“Moreover, while the modalities for the GSLTF proposal are not specified, history shows us that these taxes simply go to the general exchequer, with little, if any, of the revenues generated going to climate change adaptation.”

Walsh continued:

“The GSLTF says that their solidarity levies won’t increase the cost of living for ordinary citizens or impact things like household bills. This is untrue. The bottom line is that, if followed, the GSLTF’s recommendations will increase the cost of air travel for all travellers and do more harm than good.

“Extracting tens of billions from aviation will cripple its ability to invest in achieving net zero by 2050, change route dynamics to the extent that connectivity will suffer, and short-change countries on the critical economic support that air transportation provides.”",https://cdn.businesstraveller.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IATA-logo-e1751801339704.jpg,N,,2025-07-07 03:00:56.921189

A conexão do complexo ao Sistema Interligado Nacional (SIN) será realizada por meio da subestação Marmeleiro 2, conforme previsto na Licença Prévia nº 85/2025 e que atende às diretrizes da a Resolução do Conselho Estadual do Meio Ambiente (Consema) nº 433/2020.

Biorrefinaria

No dia 20 de junho, a o órgão licenciador – vinculado à Secretaria de Meio Ambiente e Infraestrutura do Rio Grande do Sul (Sema) – emitiu licença prévia para ampliação da Refinaria de Petróleo Riograndense S/A. O documento é válido até 2030.

A ação faz parte de um projeto inovador e que promete tornar o empreendimento a primeira biorrefinaria do Brasil, com capacidade de produzir combustíveis renováveis como o bioquerosene (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel) e o diesel renovável (RD – Renewable Diesel), a partir de óleos vegetais e gordura animal (sebo).

O projeto prevê uma transição estratégica da refinaria para um modelo mais sustentável, alinhado com as políticas de redução de emissões de carbono. A ampliação ocorrerá no mesmo local onde a refinaria já opera, em Rio Grande (RS), com a instalação de novas unidades de processamento, o que permitirá aumentar a produção mensal para 51.584 m³ de SAF e 51.917 m³ de RD.

“A ampliação para a produção de combustíveis renováveis está alinhada com os objetivos do Governo do Estado de promover a transição para uma economia mais verde, ao mesmo tempo que gera emprego e desenvolvimento. Estamos orgulhosos de fazer parte deste projeto que contribuirá para a redução das emissões de carbono e fortalecerá a indústria local”, ressalta o presidente da Fepam, Renato Chagas.

Está prevista a criação de 459 empregos diretos, refletindo um impacto positivo na economia local. A área total da ampliação é de 240.514,80 m², sendo 25.587,05 m² destinados à área construída e o restante para atividades ao ar livre.

O projeto inclui a instalação de 20 novos tanques para armazenamento de matérias-primas e produtos acabados. Acrescente-se à lista diversas melhorias no sistema de resfriamento, na subestação elétrica e em outros equipamentos essenciais para o funcionamento das novas unidades.

A execução do projeto foi planejada com atenção às normas de segurança e ao impacto ambiental. Na base da produção de combustíveis renováveis estão matérias-primas como óleos vegetais, sebo animal e óleos reutilizados, como o óleo de cozinha usado, garantindo uma abordagem mais sustentável e eficiente.

The Interislander ferries replacement saga reflects New Zealand’s infrastructure problem in a nutshell, writes Timothy Welch, senior lecturer in urban planning at the University of Auckland.

Another week, another Cook Strait ferry breakdown. As the winter maintenance season approaches and the Aratere prepares for its final months of service, New Zealand faces a self-imposed crisis.

The government has spent has spent $507.3m on cancelled iReX ferry plans, the country’s fleet has an average age of 28 years, and the earliest New Zealanders can hope for promised replacements is 2029.

The Marlborough Chamber of Commerce warns unreliable ferries already shake tourist confidence. Several more years of duct-tape solutions won’t help.

The recent pattern of breakdowns and cancellations has become so routine that New Zealand risks normalising what should be viewed as a national crisis: a serious infrastructure failure.

It is also a textbook example of how short-term political cycles, coupled with chronic under-investment, create far more expensive problems than the ones they promise to solve.

Cost blowouts

While ministers claim to have spared taxpayers a $4bn blowout on new ferries, Treasury papers show almost 80% of the cost escalation lay in seismic upgrades for wharves, not in the vessels themselves. Those land-side works will be required no matter what ferries the country eventually orders.

Justifying the original contract cancellation, Finance Minister Nicola Willis quipped that iReX was a Ferrari when a Toyota Corolla would do. But the cost of finding a suitable Corolla is adding up fast.

Annual maintenance costs are projected to nearly double to $65m, just to keep the existing ageing ferries running. Additionally, $300m had to be earmarked to cover fees for breaking the original ferry replacement contract.

By retiring the Aratere this year – New Zealand’s only rail-capable ferry – the government is also severing the interisland rail link for almost five years.

KiwiRail will “road-bridge” rail freight, an expensive workaround that involves loading train cars onto trucks, putting those trucks on ferries, then reversing the process at the other end. This will increase truck traffic, produce more emissions and add more wear to already strained infrastructure.

Forcing more than $14bn worth of annual freight from rail to road could also negatively affect New Zealand’s climate change commitments. Freight moved by rail generates only about 25% of the CO₂ per tonne-kilometre of the same load produced when hauled by truck.

The cancelled hybrid ferries would have also cut emissions by 40%. Instead, New Zealand is locking in higher emissions for another half decade or longer.

Unrealistic timelines

The ferry saga reflects New Zealand’s infrastructure problem in a nutshell. The country tends to underestimate costs, create unfeasible timelines, then shows dismay when projects blow up or limp home at double the price.

Auckland exemplifies the pattern. The city has seen decades of cancelled harbour crossing proposals and a scrapped light rail project, with nothing to show but consultancy fees.

When New Zealand does build – Transmission Gully, for example – the final bill bears little resemblance to initial quotes. The 27 kilometre motorway north of Wellington was nearly 50% over budget and took eight years to build – two years longer than promised.

The systematic underestimation of costs reflects a flawed approach to infrastructure planning. Politicians need quick wins within three-year electoral cycles, while infrastructure projects take decades to deliver.

Projects are approved based on lowball estimates, with the outcome inherited by another administration. This has crossed party lines and created a system that rewards short-term thinking and punishes long-term planning.

Just consider the second crossing for Auckland Harbour. For 35 years, the government has commissioned study after study – from the 1988 tunnel plans to the 2010 business cases – each time backing away when the price tag appeared, or the government changed.

The iReX cancellation marks the first time the government has actually signed contracts and then walked away. As with the second Auckland Harbour crossing, each delay has only made the inevitable solution more expensive.

Other countries have, to a degree, addressed this problem. Infrastructure Australia, for example, provides independent cost assessments and long-term planning that transcends political cycles. New Zealand’s Infrastructure Commission, established in 2019, lacks similar teeth and independence.

Ultimately this isn’t really about ferries. It’s about how New Zealand consistently fails to deliver, on time and at cost, the infrastructure that keeps its economy moving.

(NYSE: ), a leading industrial gases company, has been navigating a complex landscape of strategic shifts, project challenges, and leadership changes. As the company works to refocus its strategy and address recent setbacks, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

Air Products & Chemicals specializes in the production and distribution of industrial gases, serving various industries including technology, energy, and healthcare. The company has maintained a strong market position within the industrial gas sector, benefiting from its defensive business nature in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Recent financial results have been mixed, with the company facing headwinds from project cancellations and market weakness in certain segments. In its fiscal second quarter of 2025, APD missed earnings expectations and subsequently reduced forecasts for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2025. InvestingPro analysis indicates the stock is currently trading above its Fair Value, with a P/E ratio of 41.9x. The company generated revenue of $12 billion in the last twelve months, though experiencing a slight decline of 1.09%.

Strategic Initiatives and Leadership Changes

In a significant development, Air Products & Chemicals announced Eduardo Menezes as its new CEO in early 2025, succeeding Seifi Ghasemi. This leadership transition came in the wake of a proxy contest and aligns with the company’s ""change"" thesis, which investors have been anticipating.

The new management team has outlined a plan to address recent challenges, including:

1. Cost-cutting measures and efficiency improvements

2. Refocusing on core business activities

3. Implementing risk management strategies, such as pursuing joint ventures for large projects

Analysts expect these initiatives to potentially drive high single-digit EPS growth from 2026 to 2029, supported by pricing improvements, operational efficiencies, and new project contributions.

Industry Outlook and Competitive Landscape

The industrial gas sector continues to present opportunities, particularly in the emerging hydrogen market. Air Products & Chemicals is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for blue and green hydrogen projects. Successful execution in this area could significantly boost the company’s credibility and long-term performance.

However, APD faces stiff competition, particularly from companies like Linde (NYSE:NYSE: ), which some analysts prefer within the industrial gas industry. The company’s ability to secure long-term contracts for its hydrogen projects and bring them online efficiently will be crucial for maintaining its competitive edge.

Project Challenges and Cancellations

Air Products & Chemicals has encountered significant hurdles with some of its large-scale projects. In early 2025, the company announced its exit from three major initiatives:

1. World Energy SAF project

2. NY Green H2 project

3. Texas CO project (an unexpected cancellation)

These cancellations are expected to result in cash costs not exceeding $800 million. Additionally, APD has faced delays and cost overruns on other projects, most notably its Alberta facility.

These setbacks have raised concerns among investors and analysts about the company’s project management capabilities and risk profile. The company is now focused on de-risking its capital structure and securing offtakes for its remaining large projects.

Analyst Perspectives and Projections

Analysts’ views on Air Products & Chemicals remain mixed, with ratings ranging from Neutral to Overweight. The consensus acknowledges the company’s strong underlying business model but expresses caution regarding near-term challenges.

Some analysts believe that APD’s refocused strategy under new leadership could drive future growth and improve profitability. The company’s positioning for an early cycle recovery, should market conditions improve, is seen as a potential catalyst for stock performance.

However, concerns persist regarding the company’s ability to execute its large-scale projects efficiently and the impact of recent cancellations on long-term growth prospects. The challenging macroeconomic environment, including the impact of tariffs, also weighs on the company’s outlook.

Bear Case

How might project cancellations impact APD’s long-term growth prospects?

The recent cancellation of three major projects, including the unexpected exit from the Texas CO project, raises concerns about Air Products & Chemicals’ ability to deliver on its long-term growth strategy. These cancellations not only result in immediate financial costs but also potentially limit future revenue streams and market expansion opportunities.

The company’s growth trajectory has been partly predicated on the successful execution of large-scale projects, particularly in emerging areas such as sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen. With these cancellations, APD may face challenges in maintaining its projected growth rates and could lose ground to competitors who are advancing similar initiatives.

Moreover, the cancellations may damage APD’s reputation among potential partners and customers, making it more difficult to secure new contracts and projects in the future. This could lead to a cycle of reduced growth opportunities and diminished market share in key industrial gas segments.

What risks does APD face in de-risking its capital structure?

As Air Products & Chemicals works to de-risk its capital structure in response to recent project challenges, it faces several potential risks:

1. Reduced financial flexibility: By potentially reducing leverage or altering its capital allocation strategy, APD may limit its ability to pursue opportunistic investments or respond quickly to market changes.

2. Lower returns on capital: A more conservative capital structure could lead to lower returns on invested capital, potentially impacting shareholder value in the long term.

3. Opportunity costs: Resources allocated to de-risking efforts might be diverted from growth initiatives or research and development, potentially slowing innovation and market expansion.

4. Market perception: If investors perceive the de-risking efforts as overly cautious or indicative of deeper problems, it could negatively impact the stock price and make future capital raising more challenging.

5. Execution risk: The process of restructuring the capital structure itself carries risks, including potential missteps in timing or strategy that could lead to suboptimal outcomes.

These risks highlight the delicate balance APD must strike between managing its risk profile and maintaining its competitive position in the industrial gas market.

Bull Case

How could APD’s refocused strategy drive future earnings growth?

Air Products & Chemicals’ refocused strategy under new leadership presents several potential avenues for future earnings growth:

1. Core business optimization: By concentrating on its core industrial gas operations, APD can leverage its existing expertise and market position to drive operational efficiencies and capture a larger market share.

2. Cost reduction initiatives: The company’s focus on cost-cutting measures and improved productivity could lead to higher profit margins and increased cash flow, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

3. Strategic project selection: A more disciplined approach to project selection and risk management, including the use of joint ventures, could result in higher success rates for large-scale initiatives and more predictable returns on investment.

4. Pricing power: APD’s strong market position in industrial gases may allow it to implement strategic pricing initiatives, particularly in high-demand segments, leading to improved profitability.

5. Streamlined operations: The new management team’s efforts to streamline operations and reduce complexity could result in faster decision-making and more agile responses to market opportunities.

These factors, combined with the company’s defensive business nature, position APD to potentially achieve its projected high single-digit EPS growth from 2026 to 2029, even as it navigates current challenges.

What potential does APD have for capitalizing on the hydrogen market?

The hydrogen market represents a significant growth opportunity for Air Products & Chemicals, with several factors supporting its potential success:

1. Early mover advantage: APD has already invested in blue and green hydrogen projects, positioning itself as a leader in this emerging market.

2. Existing infrastructure: The company can leverage its current industrial gas infrastructure and expertise to support hydrogen production and distribution more efficiently than new entrants.

3. Growing demand: As governments and industries worldwide focus on decarbonization, demand for hydrogen as a clean energy source is expected to increase substantially.

4. Technological expertise: APD’s experience in gas production and handling gives it a competitive edge in developing and scaling hydrogen technologies.

5. Long-term contracts: Securing long-term offtake agreements for hydrogen projects could provide stable, predictable revenue streams and support future investments.

6. Synergies with existing business: The hydrogen market complements APD’s current industrial gas portfolio, allowing for potential cross-selling and integrated solutions for customers.

By successfully executing its hydrogen strategy, APD could not only drive significant revenue growth but also establish itself as a key player in the global transition to cleaner energy sources, potentially leading to long-term value creation for shareholders.

Türkiye’s civil aviation sector is entering a new phase in 2025, marked by the official launch of a “green era” through a sweeping Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive. This policy is the most ambitious environmental step ever taken by Turkish civil aviation, aiming to cut aviation emissions, boost domestic fuel production, and align with global climate standards. The following analysis explores the purpose and scope of the SAF directive, the methods used to implement and enforce it, key findings from the first months of its rollout, and the broader implications for airlines, fuel suppliers, and the Turkish economy.

Purpose and Scope of the SAF Directive

The main goal of Türkiye’s SAF directive is to reduce carbon emissions from international flights by at least 5% by 2030. This is part of a larger national plan to reach net zero emissions by 2053 and to make Turkish civil aviation a leader in environmental responsibility. The directive applies to all airlines, airport operators, and licensed fuel suppliers involved in international flights from Türkiye, except for humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft.

The policy’s scope is broad, covering:

All international flights involving Türkiye with aircraft over 5,700 kg maximum takeoff weight

Airlines registered in Türkiye and foreign carriers operating from Turkish airports

Jet fuel suppliers and domestic refiners, who must blend and supply SAF to meet national targets

By setting clear rules and deadlines, the directive aims to drive rapid change across the entire aviation supply chain, from fuel production to airline operations.

Methodology: How the SAF Directive Works

The SAF directive uses a combination of annual targets, strict compliance checks, and penalties to ensure progress. The Civil Aviation Directorate is responsible for publishing minimum SAF use and emission reduction targets before the end of the third quarter each year. Airlines and fuel suppliers must then:

Procure and blend SAF to meet the published targets, following international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Load at least 90% of the required SAF for international flights within Türkiye, ensuring domestic production is prioritized.

Submit compliance documentation to the Directorate, showing that SAF use and emissions reductions meet the annual requirements.

Face penalties if they fail to meet targets, with enforcement handled by the Directorate.

This step-by-step process is designed to create accountability and transparency, while also encouraging investment in new SAF production capacity.

Key Findings and Early Results

As of July 2025, the SAF directive is fully in force, with several important developments:

Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu officially launched the “green era” on July 5, 2025, highlighting the policy’s focus on environmental responsibility, domestic investment, and alignment with global standards.

Major Turkish refiners, including Tüpraş and SOCAR Türkiye, are preparing for large-scale SAF production. Tüpraş plans to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF in 2026, with a goal of reaching 400,000 tons at its Izmir refinery if further investments are approved.

DB Tarımsal Enerji, a local biofuel company, is building a new plant with a target of 100,000 tons of annual SAF production.

Türkiye’s jet fuel demand in 2024 was 6.26 million tons, a 4% decrease from the previous year, reflecting both the impact of the pandemic and early shifts toward greener fuels.

Aviation accounts for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, making the adoption of SAF a critical step for climate action.

Data Presentation: Trends and Industry Impact

To better understand the impact of the SAF directive, it’s helpful to look at the numbers and compare Türkiye’s approach with global trends.

SAF Production Targets and Jet Fuel Demand

Tüpraş: 20,000 tons SAF in 2026, up to 400,000 tons pending investment

DB Tarımsal Enerji: 100,000 tons planned annual production

Türkiye’s total jet fuel demand (2024): 6.26 million tons

If both Tüpraş and DB Tarımsal Enerji reach their targets, Türkiye could produce up to 500,000 tons of SAF per year, covering about 8% of its current jet fuel demand. This would put Türkiye ahead of many countries in the region and help meet the 5% emissions reduction goal by 2030.

Comparisons and Patterns

International Alignment: Türkiye’s SAF directive is closely aligned with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which will require international aviation emissions reductions starting in 2027. By acting early, Türkiye positions itself as a leader in the region and ensures its airlines are ready for future global rules.

Domestic Investment: The directive is already driving major investments in refinery upgrades, new biofuel plants, and SAF blending facilities. This creates new jobs and reduces reliance on imported fossil fuels.

Operational Costs: Airlines face higher costs due to SAF procurement and blending requirements, but early compliance may help them avoid future penalties or restrictions under EU and ICAO rules.

Evidence-Based Conclusions

The SAF directive is already reshaping Turkish civil aviation in several ways:

Environmental Impact: The policy is projected to cut aviation-related emissions by 5% by 2030, a significant step toward Türkiye’s 2053 net zero goal.

Economic Growth: Investment in SAF production and related technology is expected to create new jobs and support the growth of the domestic energy sector.

International Competitiveness: By aligning with ICAO and EU standards, Turkish airlines and fuel suppliers can maintain access to key international markets and avoid future trade barriers.

Limitations and Challenges

While the SAF directive is ambitious, there are several challenges to consider:

Production Capacity: Meeting the SAF targets will require rapid scaling of domestic production. Delays in refinery upgrades or biofuel plant construction could slow progress.

Cost: SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel, which may increase ticket prices or reduce airline profits in the short term.

Technology: Ongoing investment in new technologies is needed to improve SAF yields, reduce costs, and ensure compliance with evolving international standards.

Monitoring and Enforcement: The success of the directive depends on effective monitoring and strict enforcement by the Civil Aviation Directorate.

Stakeholder Perspectives

Government: Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu has called the SAF directive a “step toward a policy that is environmentally friendly and climate responsible,” emphasizing its importance for both the environment and national energy security.

Industry: Major refiners like Tüpraş and SOCAR Türkiye see SAF as a growth opportunity and a necessity for future competitiveness. Biofuel producers such as DB Tarımsal Enerji are investing heavily in new production capacity.

Environmental Analysts: Experts welcome the alignment with ICAO and global standards but stress the need for continued investment and innovation to scale SAF production and bring down costs.

Policy Implications and Practical Effects

The SAF directive has wide-ranging effects on different groups:

Airlines: Must adjust operations to meet SAF blending requirements, which may increase costs but also provide a head start on future international rules.

Fuel Suppliers: Need to invest in new sourcing, blending, and certification processes, creating opportunities for growth but also requiring significant capital.

Turkish Economy: The policy is expected to stimulate investment in biofuels and refinery technology, create jobs, and reduce reliance on imported fuels.

Environment: Projected to reduce aviation emissions by 5% by 2030, supporting Türkiye’s long-term climate goals.

Step-by-Step Compliance Process

To help stakeholders understand what’s required, here’s a summary of the compliance process:

Annual Target Publication: The Civil Aviation Directorate publishes minimum SAF use and emission reduction targets before the end of Q3 each year.

Procurement and Blending: Airlines and fuel suppliers procure and blend SAF to meet these targets, ensuring compliance with ICAO standards.

Loading Requirements: Airlines departing from Türkiye must load at least 90% of their SAF needs domestically.

Monitoring and Reporting: Airlines and suppliers submit compliance documentation to the Directorate.

Enforcement: The Directorate imposes penalties for non-compliance.

Background and Historical Context

The SAF directive is part of a larger shift in Turkish policy toward sustainability and energy diversification.

With a focus on housing, transport, and green innovation, the region is emerging as a compelling investment destination. Here's why investors should take note.

Infrastructure Boom: Housing and Transport as Growth Catalysts

The cornerstone of Barrow's revival is its ambitious infrastructure overhaul. Over 12,000 new homes—including 800 units in the Marina Village mixed-use development—will cater to a growing population and attract young professionals. Higher-density housing in the town center aims to reverse depopulation trends, while upgrades to the A590/A595 road network and Furness rail line will boost connectivity for both residents and freight logistics.

BAE Systems, Barrow's anchor employer with over 14,500 jobs, exemplifies the region's strategic importance to UK defense. Its stock's resilience reflects the sector's stability, but the real opportunity lies in the plan's diversification beyond traditional industries.

Green Energy: A Strategic Edge for Investors

Barrow's pivot to clean energy is its most compelling investment angle. The GRAMM consortium's proposed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project—targeting up to 850 new jobs by 2035—aligns with UK net-zero goals. Meanwhile, offshore wind and carbon capture projects will anchor a green economy.

The region's existing maritime expertise positions it to dominate emerging sectors like offshore wind installation and hydrogen production. Investors should monitor companies like Ørsted (ORSTED.C), pioneers in offshore wind, and local firms bidding for Barrow's green contracts.

Job Creation: A Diversified Pipeline

The plan's success hinges on its 360-degree job strategy:

- Defense: 14,500+ existing roles, with submarine programs securing long-term employment.

- Clean Energy: 850+ jobs from SAF alone, plus roles in wind and carbon capture.

- Education: A new University of Cumbria campus (2025) offering engineering and nursing degrees will train a locally rooted workforce.

- Logistics: Improved transport networks will attract warehousing and distribution hubs.

By 2035, Barrow aims to reduce economic inactivity below the national average, with workforce qualifications (RQF 4+) rising significantly.

Public-Private Synergy: A Blueprint for Success

The Team Barrow partnership—uniting government, BAE Systems, and local authorities—ensures coordinated investment. Key collaborations include:

- The £970k Barrow Transformation Fund, developing outline plans for mixed-use town center projects.

- The Brilliant Futures Fund (£5M) and Social Impact Fund (£650k+ distributed), boosting education and community resilience.

These partnerships reduce risk for private investors, as public funding de-risks early-stage projects like the SAF plant or rail upgrades.

Demographic Upside: A Growing Population, Rising Demand

With 12,000 new homes, Barrow's population is set to expand by ~20% over a decade. This growth will fuel demand for retail, healthcare, and leisure—sectors ripe for investment. The town center's planned cultural amenities (e.g., theaters, event spaces) will further attract visitors and talent.

Investment Playbook: How to Capitalize

Real Estate: Back developers building Marina Village or town-center mixed-use projects. Look for firms with strong local ties.

Green Energy: Invest in companies bidding for Barrow's renewable projects or partnering with GRAMM.

Logistics: Target firms benefiting from A590/A595 upgrades or Furness rail efficiency gains.

Education & Skills: Support the University of Cumbria's Innovation Hub or apprenticeship programs aligned with local industry needs.

Final Take: A Decade of Opportunity

Barrow's 10-year plan is not just about infrastructure—it's a strategic rebalancing of the UK economy. By 2035, the region could rival Scotland's renewables hubs or the Thames Estuary's logistics corridors. Early investors in Barrow's housing, green energy, and logistics sectors stand to benefit from a virtuous cycle of job growth, rising property values, and diversified tax revenues.

A380 Operators Airbus delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines in October 2007.
For example, in 2022, Airbus announced that the first A380 powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel had taken to the skies.
The A380 was the third Airbus aircraft to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a 12-month period.
These tests constituted a substantial advancement for Airbus, as all Airbus aircraft had previously been certified for a 50-50 blend of sustainable aviation fuel and kerosene.","This April, Airbus celebrated the 20th anniversary of the A380's maiden flight. This jet has been built 254 times and has broken countless records, including being the only aircraft with over 500 seats and the only full-length double-decker aircraft. This can reach over 800 passengers in an all-economy configuration. Airbus also announced that the plane had flown over 800,000 flights, serving an astounding 300 million passengers.

Read this article to get behind the curtain of the A380. Learn about its expensive development, its largest operators, and how Airbus continues to use the A380 to innovate despite the jetliner no longer being in production.

An Astronomically Expensive Development

The A380 project was launched in 2000. The concept of a super-jumbo was proposed due to the popularity of hub-to-hub flights and the enforcement of slot limitations. The only way to serve more passengers without increasing the number of required flights was to increase the size of the aircraft. However, Airbus engineers had secretly begun to work on an ultra-high-capacity airliner (UHCA) in 1988, and a general outline of the aircraft was announced at the 1990 Farnborough Airshow.

Designers wanted to achieve 15% lower operating costs than the 747-400, while maintaining a substantially higher capacity. After years of consideration of various designs, including one with side-by-side A340 fuselages, Airbus's engineers settled on a double-decker design around 2000. By the end of 2000, Airbus's supervisory board agreed to launch a project worth 9.5 billion euros to build the A3XX, which they designated as the A380. When the first aircraft was completed in January 2002, it is estimated that the cost had swelled to 11-14 billion euros. This cost continued to swell. After the aircraft had been in service for 10 years, estimated development costs had reached 25-30 billion euros.

Part of the reason the development was so expensive was the complexity of the aircraft, which has over 330 miles of electric cabling. Moreover, its components are built all over Europe, including France, Wales, Spain, and Germany.

The A380's Enormous Size

The A380 is loved by aviation enthusiasts around the world for its mind-blowing size, beaten only by cargo jets flown by the Ukrainian manufacturer Antonov.

The table below features specifications for the A380 that reveal why its size is so impressive:

This size is far larger than any of the A380's competitors, such as the 747. The Boeing jumbo jet has a wingspan of 195 ft 8 in (59.6 m), almost 70 ft less than the A380. It also has the ability to get a lot less stuff into the sky. The largest variant (747-8) has a maximum takeoff weight of 975,000–987,000 lb (442.3–447.7 t).

The majority of Boeing 747 variants also can't match the A380's range, making them less appropriate for hub-to-hub operations. The 747-400 and 747-8 both have ranges of over 7,000 nautical miles, but the 747-100, -200B, and -300 have ranges of over 1,000 miles less than the A380.

A380 Operators

Airbus delivered the first A380 to Singapore Airlines in October 2007. Since then, Emirates has become the largest operator, and the jet continues to have an important role in its fleet. Emirates has announced the refurbishment of its A380s, alongside 777s, and the introduction of these services to eight more destinations. Adnan Kazim, Emirates’ Deputy President and Chief Commercial Officer, said:

""The latest rollout of refurbished Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s and new A350s offer more opportunities for customers in over 70 dynamic cities and growing economies to enjoy our latest generation premium onboard experience combined with our award-winning service. The redoubling of our refurbishment programme efforts means that by the end of this year, Emirates will have established itself as one of the preeminent industry leaders offering Premium Economy seats. In the next two years, we will definitively cement our position as the industry leader in Premium Economy deployment.""

The table below reveals the top ten A380 operators by current fleet size according to Airbus data:

As of February 2025, 189 A380s remain in service, while 36 are stored and 21 have been scrapped. The most prolific A380 scrappers are Singapore, which has retired 12, and Emirates, which has retired seven. Five airlines were former A380 operators that have decided to permanently retire the aircraft from their fleets. They are China Southern Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Air France, Hi Fly Malta, and Thai Airways International. The most recent retirees are China Southern Airlines and Malaysia Airlines. Most of these carriers opted to stop flying the jet due to a combination of high fuel costs and the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the industry.

Seating on the A380

The A380's unique features are the astonishing number of seats that are available within its full-length double-deck cabin, and the ability for so many passengers to fly at the height of comfort.

Most airlines use the main deck for their economy seats. These will be arranged in a 3-4-3 configuration for a cabin designed to achieve the highest possible capacity while ensuring comfort standards are met. The upper deck is where airlines can be more creative, as this area of the aircraft is typically reserved for premium passengers, often combining first-class and business-class accommodations. The configuration is usually 1-2-1 for business class, or 2-4-2 for the airlines that have a more expansive economy class cabin.

Proposed Variants

The A380-800 was the only A380 variant produced, which will remain the case as Airbus stopped manufacturing the super jumbo in 2021. However, it may have remained in production for longer had Airbus decided to build its proposed variants. One was the A380F, a cargo aircraft capable of transporting a 150 t (330,000 lb) maximum payload over a 5,600 nmi (10,400 km) range. This is a 7% improvement in payload and a better range than the Boeing 747-8F, but it would have come with higher costs. This payload would have been larger than all aircraft except the Antonov An-225 Mriya.

Airbus also proposed passenger variants. One was the A380 Stretch. Designated either the A380-200 or the A380-900, this aircraft would have a capacity of 656 seats in a standard configuration, or 900 in economy-only. Several airlines, including Emirates, Virgin Atlantic and Air France, expressed an interest in the jet. However, production issues with the A380-800 led to these plans being shelved.

A 2015 Reuters report also revealed that Airbus was in talks with at least six airlines to produce the A380neo. This aircraft would have better engines, wings, and accommodate 50 more passengers. Delivery was planned for 2020 to 2021.

However, by 2016, Tim Clark, Emirates' president, indicated that talks over the A380neo had lapsed. This was confirmed a year later, with Airbus explaining that there was not a sufficient business case for the aircraft. The end of A380 production has not ended Emirates' interest in an A380neo. In June 2023, Flight Global reported that Clark had renewed his plea. He explained how the A380neo would benefit the airline: “It would give us a 25% reduction in fuel burn and emissions on the A380. That’s startlingly good.”

The A380 Continues To Innovate

The age of the Super Jumbo may be coming to an end. Twin-jet aircraft appear to be the future, even for long-haul widebody planes. However, Airbus continues to use the A380 to drive its innovation. For example, in 2022, Airbus announced that the first A380 powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel had taken to the skies.

The aircraft flew from Blagnac Airport in France for a three-hour flight, operating one of its Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines with exclusively sustainable aviation fuel. 27 tonnes were provided by TotalEnergies for the flight, made from Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), free of aromatics and sulfur, and primarily consisting of used cooking oil, as well as other waste fats.

The A380 was the third Airbus aircraft to fly on 100% sustainable aviation fuel in a 12-month period. An A350 was the first in March 2021, followed by an A319neo in October 2021. These tests constituted a substantial advancement for Airbus, as all Airbus aircraft had previously been certified for a 50-50 blend of sustainable aviation fuel and kerosene. Airbus appears to be continuing the use of the A380 for sustainability testing, as the A380 used in this test is the ZEROe Demonstrator - a flying testbed for future technologies instrumental to bringing the world’s first zero-emission aircraft to market by 2035.

This platform aims to bridge the gap between airlines and SAF producers by efficiently matching supply and demand, thus enhancing efficiency, connectivity, and transparency within the aviation sector. The introduction of this platform is crucial at a time when the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon emissions. By simplifying procurement and fostering collaboration, the SAF Matchmaker platform supports the aviation industry’s shift toward greener, more sustainable energy solutions, ultimately contributing to its long-term environmental goals.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, a pioneering solution aimed at streamlining the procurement process for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This platform is designed to serve as a bridge, connecting airlines and SAF producers to facilitate the purchasing process. By matching the supply and demand of SAF, the platform aims to enhance efficiency, connectivity, and visibility in the sector.

Addressing Key Challenges in SAF Procurement

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to tackle three major challenges in the SAF industry:

Efficiency: One of the primary goals of the platform is to simplify and expedite the SAF procurement process. By offering a centralized digital space for both airlines and SAF suppliers to connect, the platform eliminates the need for additional fees and intermediaries. This enables faster negotiations and smoother transactions, which can drive the growth of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing. By making the procurement process more efficient, IATA hopes to foster the broader adoption of SAF within the aviation industry.

Connectivity: The platform provides a transparent and accessible environment for SAF producers and suppliers to post their available or planned SAF volumes. Airlines, on the other hand, can indicate their interest in specific SAF volumes, either those already offered or volumes they seek to procure. When an agreement is made, the platform facilitates the initial connection, after which the parties can negotiate the specifics of the deal, such as price and payment terms, offline. This improved connectivity enhances collaboration between SAF producers and airlines, making it easier for both sides to meet their needs and goals.

Visibility: Transparency is a key feature of the SAF Matchmaker platform. It provides detailed information on the available SAF, including data on feedstock, production technology, emissions reduction benefits, and compliance with international standards like the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED). This comprehensive visibility ensures that airlines can make informed decisions when selecting their SAF suppliers, while producers can demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and compliance with regulatory frameworks.

A Flexible and Inclusive Platform

The SAF Matchmaker platform is designed to be flexible, supporting both spot purchases and long-term offtake agreements. Initially, the platform is exclusively available to airlines and SAF suppliers. However, IATA has plans to expand access to other buyers of SAF, such as non-aviation corporations, in the future. This expansion will help broaden the market for SAF, encouraging wider adoption across various sectors.

The platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space created to support the aviation industry in managing energy-related challenges. The Aviation Energy Hub provides access to a variety of tools and resources that help stakeholders in the aviation sector improve energy efficiency, reduce emissions, and transition to more sustainable energy sources.

Supporting the Sustainable Future of Aviation

The SAF Matchmaker platform plays a crucial role in advancing the sustainability of the aviation industry. By addressing the supply chain inefficiencies and enhancing the visibility of SAF options, the platform can help accelerate the adoption of this vital fuel source. SAF is considered one of the most promising solutions for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and achieving its long-term sustainability goals.

IATA’s initiative comes at a critical time when the aviation sector is facing increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact. SAF offers a significant opportunity to cut emissions, as it can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The platform aims to create a more transparent and efficient market for SAF, allowing airlines to secure the fuel they need to reduce their carbon footprint while simultaneously supporting the growth of sustainable fuel production.

Long-Term Impact on the Aviation Industry

In the coming years, the SAF Matchmaker platform has the potential to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry’s transition to sustainability. By facilitating the exchange of SAF between producers and airlines, the platform will contribute to the development of a global SAF market, fostering competition and encouraging innovation in fuel production technologies.

In addition to improving procurement processes, the platform could also help mitigate some of the challenges faced by airlines in securing a steady supply of SAF. With the market for SAF still in its nascent stages, the platform’s ability to provide both visibility and connectivity between stakeholders will be essential in ensuring that airlines can meet their sustainability targets and comply with environmental regulations.

A Step Toward a Greener Aviation Industry

IATA’s launch of the SAF Matchmaker platform represents a significant step toward a more sustainable and efficient aviation industry. As airlines and SAF producers continue to face the challenges of sourcing and distributing sustainable fuels, platforms like SAF Matchmaker will play an essential role in facilitating the transition to greener alternatives. By helping to streamline procurement processes, improve connectivity between stakeholders, and enhance the visibility of SAF offerings, the platform can drive the growth of the SAF market and support the aviation industry’s broader sustainability goals.

IATA has launched the SAF Matchmaker Platform to streamline the procurement of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, addressing the growing demand for cleaner aviation fuels. This initiative aims to connect airlines and SAF producers efficiently, enhancing sustainability in the industry by simplifying transactions and promoting greener fuel options.

His solution, which reportedly diffuses shockwaves before they reach the ground, makes overland supersonic flight feasible for the first time in history.
By blending aerospace innovation with decentralized finance, Fly-Concorde hopes to unlock new sources of capital while inviting a broader community to participate in the rebirth of supersonic travel.
But this is more than a symbolic gesture — it’s a signal that supersonic flight is no longer a relic of the past.","After more than two decades of silence, the unmistakable roar of the Concorde may soon echo through our skies once again. In a move that has stunned both aviation insiders and nostalgic travelers alike, a U.S.-based company is preparing to relaunch the world’s first supersonic passenger aircraft by 2026 — almost exactly 50 years after its inaugural commercial flight.

This revival, led by Fly-Concorde Limited and backed by sweeping legislative change, positions the United States at the forefront of a renewed global race toward high-speed, sustainable aviation.

And yes — this time, the Concorde plans to fly over land.

A Political Green Light That Changes Everything

The turning point came on June 6, 2025, when President Donald J. Trump signed the so-called “Concorde Bill” at Washington Dulles International Airport. The legislation reverses a 52-year-old ban on supersonic flight over U.S. soil — a restriction that has long hobbled the commercial potential of faster-than-sound travel.

Citing both technological advances and national innovation priorities, the bill marks a radical shift in U.S. aviation policy. The ban, originally enacted due to sonic boom concerns, had made overland supersonic flights commercially unviable, relegating aircraft like the original Concorde to a limited set of transoceanic routes.

With that regulatory ceiling lifted, a new era in civil aviation becomes possible — and Fly-Concorde Limited is already poised to seize it.

A Reimagined Concorde for the Modern Age

Fly-Concorde’s upcoming aircraft won’t simply revive the past; it aims to reimagine it. The next-generation Concorde will retain the iconic delta-wing silhouette, but beneath the familiar design lies a radically upgraded airframe.

Using advanced composite materials, the aircraft will be approximately 50% lighter than the original Concorde. It will be fueled by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), offering a projected 80% reduction in emissions compared to its 20th-century predecessor. And it will cruise at an altitude of 60,000 feet, high above conventional commercial aircraft, reducing air congestion and optimizing speed.

But perhaps the most critical breakthrough is also the most elusive: the sonic boom.

Solving the Sonic Boom Problem

Behind the aircraft’s reauthorization lies a major scientific achievement — one credited to Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, the physicist and polymath leading the Concorde project. With three PhDs from Oxford and decades of research behind him, Dr. Churchill developed and patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology in May 2025. His solution, which reportedly diffuses shockwaves before they reach the ground, makes overland supersonic flight feasible for the first time in history.

Churchill is more than an engineer — he’s also a descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, adding a symbolic continuity to a project first conceived in the post-WWII spirit of peace and technological ambition. According to the company, this is not just an aircraft; it is a statement of legacy, vision, and renewed Western aerospace leadership.

Fly-Concorde’s Vice President, Patricia Bader-Johnston, emphasized that the aircraft will serve as “a global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.” It is, in short, the Concorde for a climate-conscious, tech-savvy world.

The Financial Engine: Concorde Coin

To fund this ambitious return to the skies, Fly-Concorde isn’t relying solely on institutional investment. The company has launched Concorde Coin (CSSC) — a stablecoin backed by the Concorde’s aviation assets and operational rights.

This digital currency, built on blockchain infrastructure, aims to align investors with the company’s long-term mission. By blending aerospace innovation with decentralized finance, Fly-Concorde hopes to unlock new sources of capital while inviting a broader community to participate in the rebirth of supersonic travel.

The market has taken notice. The Concorde brand is already valued at an estimated $50 billion, and the financial ecosystem developing around it suggests that aviation’s next leap forward could be just as much about crypto as it is about combustion.

Looking Back to Leap Forward

Originally developed through a joint venture between British Airways and Air France, the Concorde redefined international air travel when it entered commercial service in 1976. With cruise speeds of Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), it could fly from London to New York in under three and a half hours — cutting transatlantic travel time in half.

But despite its speed and prestige, the aircraft struggled commercially. High fuel costs, limited range, noise regulations, and a fatal crash in 2000 combined to seal its fate. In 2003, both BA and Air France retired their fleets, ending an era that once felt like the beginning of the future.

Now, thanks to regulatory change, sustainability advances, and sonic innovation, that future is being rewritten.

The Cold War’s Forgotten Challenger: The Tupolev Tu-144

No story about the Concorde is complete without mention of its Soviet-era rival, the Tupolev Tu-144. Often dubbed the “Concordski,” the Tu-144 became the world’s first supersonic transport aircraft to break Mach 1 — beating Concorde to that milestone in 1969.

Yet despite its engineering achievements, the Tu-144’s history was plagued by safety issues. A disastrous crash at the 1973 Paris Air Show, followed by another fatal incident in 1978, led to the end of its brief commercial career. Only 55 passenger flights were completed before it was retired by Aeroflot.

In later decades, modified versions of the Tu-144 saw use in experimental programs, including joint research ventures with NASA. But by then, the Concorde had already claimed the mantle of the West’s supersonic icon.

A Historic Relaunch at a Critical Moment

Fly-Concorde’s relaunch plan is timed with precision. The aircraft’s first flight is targeted for 2026, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Concorde’s original commercial debut. But this is more than a symbolic gesture — it’s a signal that supersonic flight is no longer a relic of the past.

It’s becoming part of aviation’s future.

And in an age where speed, sustainability, and smart policy must coexist, the new Concorde may well become a blueprint for 21st-century air travel — one that bridges legacies of innovation with the demands of a changing world.","https://res.cloudinary.com/jerrick/image/upload/c_scale,f_jpg,q_auto/686a428342de80001d3573e7.jpg",N,,2025-07-06 07:02:04.492794

Sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity in every sphere of humanity. Global warming, melting of polar ice shelves, and extreme climate changes are causing civilizational challenges. Uranus Oil is spearheading a quiet revolution as part of its commitment to environmental sustainability-one that transforms kitchen waste into aviation-grade fuel. At the heart of this revolution is transforming kitchen waste (Used Cooking Oil or UCO) into aviation-grade fuel. UCO is a waste product typically discarded by food outlets. However, it is now a pivotal ingredient in the world's transition toward clean aviation fuel.

The Untapped Gold: Used Cooking Oil (UCO) as a Sustainable Feedstock

Used Cooking Oil is generated in vast quantities every day by restaurants, hotels, caterers, street food vendors, and industrial kitchens. Once the frying life of kitchen oil is over, users discard it, often improperly. This clogs drains, contaminating water bodies, or ends up in landfills. However, such a seemingly worthless byproduct holds immense value.

When processed correctly, UCO can be converted into Biodiesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It is a clean-burning, renewable alternative to conventional fossil-based aviation fuels. SAF derived from UCO can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil fuels, emitting large quantities of carbon and other pollutants. More importantly, SAF is a ""drop-in fuel,"". This means it is compatible with existing aircraft engines and fuel infrastructure.

This compatibility eliminates the need for costly overhauls and allows aviation companies to embrace sustainability without disruption.

Uranus Oil's Vision: Fueling the Circular Economy

Uranus Oil is on a mission to ""fuel the world with waste"" across India. The Company is building a future where waste oil is not an environmental hazard but a critical industrial asset powering planes, vehicles, and economies.

At the centre of Uranus Oil's model is a robust, decentralized UCO procurement ecosystem. The Company collects UCO from food and beverage outlets across Southern India, from five-star hotels in Chennai to small eateries in rural Karnataka. Uranus Oil's supply chain leaves no fryer behind.

To ensure seamless and efficient collection, Uranus Oil has deployed territory-based Direct Procurement Officers (DPOs). On-ground professionals forge relationships with local vendors, ensure quality standards, and supervise logistics. This decentralized model allows hyperlocal engagement, quick turnaround times, and a minimal carbon footprint during collection.

Electric Vehicles and Green Logistics

As part of its carbon-conscious philosophy, Uranus Oil has begun transitioning its collection fleet to Electric Vehicles (EVs). This move not only reduces tailpipe emissions but also reinforces the Company's commitment to full-cycle sustainability.

Each kilogram of UCO collected and transported via EV helps avert additional emissions, amplifying the positive impact of SAF and biodiesel down the line. Every step is optimized for low environmental impact and high resource efficiency, from the moment waste is collected.

Scaling the Model: From Southern India to National Dominance

The Company already has a dominant presence in the Southern Indian markets, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Kerala. Uranus Oil is rapidly scaling its footprint to other geographies. Its strategy involves:

Expanding storage and pre-processing hubs in key metro and tier-2 cities.

Onboarding and training a national DPO network with strong local partnerships.

Implementing digital traceability tools for real-time monitoring of oil collection, quality, and transportation.

Forging long-term supply agreements with major biofuel producers, refineries, and aviation companies.

The Company also engages in awareness campaigns and compliance training to help vendors align with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) regulations on UCO disposal.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Future of Clean Skies

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents the most viable near-term solution for the aviation industry grappling with pressure to decarbonize. It doesn't require new engines or infrastructure. It just requires better feedstock (like UCO) and a robust supply chain.

Uranus Oil is becoming a preferred aggregator for FSSAI enrolled biodiesel and biofuel manufacturers, in India by guaranteeing:

Consistent UCO volumes

High-quality, low-contaminant oil

Real-time logistics tracking

This positions Uranus Oil not just as a collector, but as a strategic enabler of India's Biodiesel and SAF ambitions and as a catalyst for international emissions reduction targets.

Pioneering a Circular Economy: From Waste to Wealth

Circular economy is not just a buzzword at Uranus Oil. Rather, it's a lived reality. The Company's core belief is ""waste is not the end-it's the beginning."" Every litre of UCO collected is a step toward:

Cleaner skies via SAF

Greener roads via biodiesel

Lower carbon cities via electric logistics

More responsible food systems via compliant disposal

Uranus Oil doesn't just collect used oil. It regenerates value, creating an economy where waste is recirculated, emissions are reduced, and profitability meets planetary responsibility.

The Road Ahead: Building India's Green Energy Backbone

With climate policies tightening globally and India pledging aggressive net-zero goals, Uranus Oil stands at the crossroads of necessity and opportunity. The Company is actively exploring:

International collaborations with SAF producers and green aviation hubs.

AI-driven demand forecasting for biodiesel blending in transport sectors.

Blockchain-based UCO traceability systems to ensure transparency and compliance.

“It’s just different.” Biography Christina Cassotis has been the CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport since 2015, and is on a mission to redefine the role of an airport.","Enrique Perrella learns how Pittsburgh International Airport’s CEO Christina Cassotis is leading an ambitious comeback.

In recent years, the aviation industry has experienced positive changes as more women move into leadership roles. In North America, however, only a small number of women – just four – lead major airports, bringing unique perspectives and innovative ideas. One such leader is Christina Cassotis, whose journey from being the daughter of a Pan Am pilot to becoming the CEO of Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT) is truly inspiring.

Cassotis grew up in a household connected to aviation, influenced by her father who moved from Pan Am to United Airlines. Living with her family in New England, she experienced the realities of airline life. Despite limited vacations due to her father’s preference for staying grounded when off duty, a family trip to London when she was ten years old sparked her love for travel.

Cassotis’ journey into aviation leadership was anything but conventional. “I was bartending on Beacon Hill in Boston,” she recalls. “It was a spot where state reps and senators would come in for lunch or drinks.” It was there that she was offered a job at the Department of Energy Resources, before being recruited to work as the communications director for a cabinet secretary.

“After six months, I moved to Massport,” the owner and operator of Logan Airport in Boston. “I didn’t even realise that airports had jobs like the one I was offered.”

At the age of 29, without a college degree, Cassotis went back to school while working at Massport and eventually graduated. “As the deputy director of communications, I absolutely loved it. I thought, I can’t believe I get to work at an airport.”

After four and a half years, she was recruited by a consulting company, where she worked and consulted for various airports for 17 years. The unpredictable nature of the industry captivated her.

Looking back on her ascent from bartending for politicians to leading an airport, Cassotis says, “Bartending teaches you people skills – how to read personalities, manage situations and think quickly. Those lessons have served me every day as a CEO.”

When Cassotis joined PIT in 2015, the airport was a shadow of its former self, having lost its bustling status as a travel hub in 2004 after US Airways abandoned it, leaving empty gates and an economic void.

“I expressed my concerns during the interview process in late 2014,” Cassotis says. “I told the headhunter that if the organisation aimed to become a hub again, I wouldn’t consider the position.

“I was very upfront about it,” she continues. The world and the airline industry had changed significantly, leading her to believe that smaller markets such as Pittsburgh simply do not generate enough demand for an airline hub.

“I believed that we could succeed using a different business model,” she explains. “This shift in mindset didn’t imply that anything was wrong. Rather, the landscape had evolved.”

Cassotis asserted that PIT could achieve success as a business. She posed the question: how could PIT redefine itself without relying on a major airline hub?

“Airlines serve markets, not airports,” she states. “Our path to success is to operate as an origin and destination airport.” Under her leadership, PIT has increased its destinations from 36 to 61. “We have every major US airline except Hawaiian,” she says.

British Airways, for instance, has operated a route from London Heathrow to PIT since 2019, and earlier this year increased its six-times-weekly service to daily, with flights running until October 2025.

Icelandair also connects PIT to Europe, and Cassotis envisions expanding to accommodate more West Coast flights. “There’s potential for more destinations in Europe and Canada,” she adds, highlighting opportunities in cargo and logistics, including the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on-site.

To prepare for its ambitious plan, a crucial element of the transformation at PIT is the new terminal, which is set to open this year. Often called the most beautiful airport design in North America, the terminal is intended to capture the essence of the city with locally sourced materials, systems and innovative architecture.

“We took a user-centric approach, focusing on the needs of passengers and staff,” she explains. “A key focus is on addressing issues when things go wrong. We strive to take care of people, regardless of whether it’s our fault or not.

“The space itself is a beautifully designed building filled with light and high ceilings,” she continues. “The interior features tree-like columns and outdoor terraces, which are accessible to everyone, regardless of club membership.”

Meanwhile, inspired by the city’s Fort Pitt Bridge, a new connector bridge will reduce walking distances and offer stunning views of the city.

When asked about her ideal airport, Cassotis imagines terminals featuring more sensory rooms, nursing stations and enhanced services for travellers during disruptions. “I’d like to see airports prioritise people over just efficiency,” she says.

This human-centred approach to leadership sets Cassotis apart, especially given her diagnosis of ADHD at the age of 47. “It felt like someone was unlocking something inside me, like a key turning,” she shares. “Suddenly I realised there wasn’t anything wrong with me.”

Cassotis discovered her ability to make real-time connections and understand complex systems from multiple perspectives. “I didn’t realise I could do things others couldn’t,” she says. “I can recognise people’s strengths and identify what holds them back.”

Medication has also helped. “If a task isn’t fun or urgent, I struggle to start it. The medication enables me to initiate projects that I would otherwise find difficult.”

Her story has resonated with many, and she often receives letters from people inspired by her journey. “A young man once wrote to me after his parents read my story. They told him, ‘You will find your way, just like she did.’ That touched me deeply.”

Cassotis hopes her story encourages people, particularly individuals with ADHD, to embrace their differences and recognise their strengths. “There’s nothing wrong with thinking differently,” she says. “It’s just different.”

Chamou a atenção o fato de que os participantes do evento mencionaram diversas vezes a COP30, a Conferência das Nações Unidas sobre as Mudanças Climáticas de 2025, que será sediada também no Brasil, em Belém do Pará, durante o mês de novembro.

O presidente do Conselho Nacional da Indústria (CNI), Ricardo Alban, que abriu o painel, comentou sobre “surpresas” que a conferência climática trará em novembro.

Nos bastidores, questionado por Opera Mundi sobre quais são essas “surpresas” mencionadas, o presidente da COP30, André Corrêa do Lago, explicou que se tratam de soluções desenvolvidas especificamente “dentro do Brasil” frente aos problemas do meio ambiente compartilhados, em especial, pelas nações do Sul Global.

“O mundo não sabe quantas já foram desenvolvidas aqui e que vamos divulgar em breve”, afirmou o diplomata, sem fornecer mais detalhes. “A COP30 será a ocasião da gente mostrar que o mundo já está pronto para a transição”.

O Fórum Empresarial do BRICS, que antecede a cúpula de chefes de Estado prevista para os próximos dois dias, reuniu lideranças empresariais, autoridades governamentais e especialistas dos países que integram o bloco, focando em temas essenciais para o desenvolvimento econômico sustentável.

Em sua exposição, Alban destacou que o BRICS precisa de “soluções compartilhadas para problemas contemporâneos”, ao apontar que a entrada de novos integrantes, com suas respectivas complementaridades econômicas, capacita o aumento no volume de negócios, parcerias e investimentos no bloco sob a perspectiva “Sul-Sul”, termo usado pelo vice-presidente Geraldo Alckmin momentos depois.

“Nesse tempo interfiador marcado por conflitos geopolíticos, emergências climáticas e novidades tecnológicas, o Brasil ocupa uma posição singular na diplomacia econômica e na governança global. Em 2024, liderando o G20. Neste ano, prevemos o BRICS e, em novembro, seremos a sede da 30ª Conferência Nacional das Nações Unidas sobre Mudança do Clima”, pontuou.

Fome, energia e clima

Por sua vez, o vice-presidente brasileiro Geraldo Alckmin mencionou os “três grandes debates planetários”, ao afirmar que o governo Lula tem demonstrado empenho nessas questões. São elas: segurança alimentar, segurança energética e combate às mudanças climáticas.

A autoridade enfatizou que o Brasil é líder global na exportação de alimentos, acrescentando que “o presidente Lula acabou de lançar um Plano Safra recorde”. Segundo o vice-presidente, o país sul-americano “ainda pode ter mais de 10% de aumento da Safra da agropecuária neste ano”.

Em relação à segurança energética, detalhou que o governo brasileiro detém 85% da energia elétrica limpa e renovável, além de sustentar um compromisso com a energia limpa.

“O presidente Lula acabou de assinar o aumento do etanol de 27% para 30%. E do biodiesel, de 14% para 15%. O Brasil tem tudo para ser um dos grandes na produção de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), ajudando na questão da descarbonização”, explicou.

Sobre as mudanças climáticas, Alckmin apontou que a gestão brasileira conseguiu inverter a curva do desmatamento, e que a meta é zerar o desmatamento ilegal, recuperando “a maior floresta tropical do mundo, que sediará a COP30”.

Lula confirma ida à Malásia

Ao lado do primeiro-ministro da Malásia, Anwar bin Ibrahim, o presidente brasileiro Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva confirmou que realizará uma viagem ao país asiático para participar da 47ª Cúpula da Asean (Associação de Nações do Sudeste Asiático), em outubro próximo.

“Já quero dizer que os empresários brasileiros precisam se preparar para viajar para a Malásia”, disse o mandatário “Quem quer vender, vai. Quem quer comprar, vai. Se ficar esperando a coisa, não acontece. Por isso eu queria, de coração, agradecer a presença aqui do primeiro-ministro da Malásia”.

Em seu discurso, Lula também mencionou a COP30 e reforçou o comprometimento brasileiro com a promoção de uma “transição ecológica justa e inclusiva”.

“O Brasil prevê redução entre 59% e 67% das emissões de gás. Nosso país já está entre os maiores investidores de energia renovável no planeta.

Microsoft has shut down its office in Pakistan after 25 years, marking the end of a significant chapter in the country’s tech landscape.

It is to be noted that Microsoft has not released a formal public statement or press release specifically announcing the closure of its Pakistan office. However, the decision has been widely confirmed through statements by Jawwad Rehman, Microsoft Pakistan’s founding country manager, who shared the news on LinkedIn and called it a “sobering signal” about the business climate.

Why Did Microsoft Exit Pakistan?

Microsoft cited a combination of global restructuring and a strategic shift to a cloud-based, partner-led model as the primary reasons for the closure. But the story runs deeper:

Global Factors

Microsoft is undergoing massive layoffs—over 9,100 jobs cut globally—as part of its cost optimization strategy.

The company is consolidating operations and shifting to regional hubs like Ireland for licensing and commercial contracts.

Local Challenges

Economic instability: Currency depreciation, high inflation, and a shrinking tech investment climate.

Regulatory hurdles: Inconsistent policies, import restrictions, and taxation on IT and telecom sectors.

Political uncertainty: Frequent regime changes and lack of long-term digital policy planning.

What Microsoft Leaves Behind

Despite the closure, Microsoft’s products and services will continue in Pakistan via:

Certified local partners

Cloud platforms and regional offices (e.g., Ireland)

However, the loss of direct presence means:

Fewer local training programs and digital skilling initiatives

Reduced corporate engagement and innovation partnerships

A symbolic blow to Pakistan’s aspirations of becoming a regional tech hub

Reactions

Former President Arif Alvi called it a “troubling sign” and revealed that Microsoft had once considered Pakistan for expansion but chose Vietnam instead due to instability.

Jawwad Rehman, Microsoft Pakistan’s founding country manager, said: “Even global giants like Microsoft find it unsustainable to stay.”

What’s Next for Pakistan?

Stabilize macroeconomic policies

Reform regulatory frameworks

Improve ease of doing business

Foster a consistent digital strategy",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgEwpyabl5wKWArIBGvPYQZQ63ps_g739-K2yl4Cgy0YncE85lzSm8N50kiaNdxS6bg8AA4yQ4xUrU99bKKVDe2lSIfBPY3h47eRzwBtZE25Fxojyx2FtXqO9ymhIcD_CEkoXI0okoR8S-W__-PTB4CjUzfi6aOu7bCg9snijb4ZXXf7QzMDLTEDRNy2kk/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1000082527.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 18:00:13.814056

This move marks a turning point for China’s aviation industry, particularly for its domestically developed narrow-body jet, the COMAC C919—China’s ambitious answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.
This allowed the resumption of engine shipments for both the C919 and the smaller C929 regional jet, which uses the CF34 engine.
As the global aviation landscape shifts, both economic pragmatism and geopolitical strategy appear to be guiding U.S.-China cooperation in this vital sector.
How critical is this move for the future of COMAC’s C919 program and China’s push for aviation independence?","In a significant development, the United States has resumed the supply of aircraft engines to China’s state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (COMAC). This move marks a turning point for China’s aviation industry, particularly for its domestically developed narrow-body jet, the COMAC C919—China’s ambitious answer to the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737.

Although the C919 is a Chinese-made aircraft, it incorporates several critical Western components, including engines. The jet relies on LEAP-1C engines jointly developed by GE Aerospace and Safran. These components are essential for meeting international safety standards and gaining access to global airspace, which in turn supports the aircraft’s commercial viability and appeal to both domestic and international airlines.

China has been steadily working towards self-reliance in aircraft manufacturing, with the aim of reducing dependency on Western technology. Narrow-body and wide-body aircraft development has become a cornerstone of this strategy, especially as domestic airlines continue placing large-scale orders.

After years of research and investment, China officially launched the C919, signaling its readiness to compete on the global stage. The aircraft has already secured over 1,200 orders—primarily from Chinese carriers—and is now attracting international interest due to its affordability, quicker availability, and operational convenience compared to its Western rivals.

However, the journey has not been without obstacles. During the Trump administration, the U.S. imposed export restrictions that halted the supply of LEAP-1C engines, significantly slowing COMAC’s production. This disruption was part of broader U.S.-China trade tensions and had a direct impact on the pace of China’s civil aviation ambitions.

A key turning point came when China agreed to ease restrictions on its export of rare-earth materials—critical elements used in high-tech manufacturing, including aerospace, semiconductors, and electric vehicles.

In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce lifted the suspension of export licenses for GE Aerospace, announced on July 4, 2025. This allowed the resumption of engine shipments for both the C919 and the smaller C929 regional jet, which uses the CF34 engine.

This exchange highlights the complex interdependence between the U.S. and China. On one hand, China needs high-performance components to meet aviation standards; on the other, the U.S. relies on China’s rare-earth supply chains, which are vital to multiple strategic industries.

China, meanwhile, is aggressively developing its own jet engines to break free from foreign reliance. But until these become viable alternatives, Western technology remains critical for the success of aircraft like the C919.

Operationally, the C919 is proving itself. Since its entry into service, it has logged over 15 million flight hours and flown more than 15 billion miles—without major reported quality or safety issues. Several Chinese airlines are now actively using the aircraft, and its growing track record is boosting global confidence in COMAC’s capabilities.

A recent milestone further strengthened this momentum: COMAC’s C929 regional jet began its first international operations from Mongolia. This expansion into foreign airspace not only showcases the aircraft’s performance but also marks a symbolic victory for China’s aviation industry as it gains trust from international markets.

Restoring engine exports benefits both sides. It supports COMAC’s production goals for the C919 and C929 while allowing the U.S. to maintain influence in the global aerospace market through strategic technological exports. As the global aviation landscape shifts, both economic pragmatism and geopolitical strategy appear to be guiding U.S.-China cooperation in this vital sector.

“Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs.
The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.
Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.
While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply.","A new report highlights the significant role American-made ethanol plays in keeping gasoline prices down, saving U.S. drivers more than $50 billion annually, an average of 39 cents per gallon, according to the release by Renewable Fuels Association (RFA).

“As the nation prepares to celebrate Independence Day, this report underscores the powerful impact of domestic ethanol production on our energy security,” said Geoff Cooper, President and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association (RFA). “Even with record levels of U.S. crude oil production, recent global events continue to demonstrate that international oil markets can still influence domestic fuel costs. Ethanol, as a low-cost and reliable gasoline blendstock, provides a critical buffer against those price shocks.”

The study, authored by George Hoekstra of Hoekstra Trading LLC, a veteran in petroleum refining and technology, examines the financial and technical advantages of using ethanol in the U.S. fuel mix. The report compares ethanol with refinery-derived components used to boost gasoline octane levels and finds ethanol to be a far more cost-effective option.

According to Hoekstra’s findings, ethanol provides high-octane value at a fraction of the cost—approximately 4.5 times less than that of refinery-sourced octane. His analysis concludes that the presence of ethanol in the U.S. E10 fuel blend—10% ethanol by volume—lowers the wholesale cost of gasoline by about 39 cents per gallon. Without ethanol, replacing its octane contribution with refinery alternatives would raise costs by $54 billion per year.

The study also indicates that higher ethanol blends like E15, now increasingly available at retail stations, offer even greater savings per gallon of gasoline. E10 remains the standard fuel blend in the U.S., but the report suggests that expanding the use of higher-ethanol blends could lead to deeper cost reductions for consumers.

While the report focuses on octane-related cost impacts, it does not factor in the broader economic benefits of ethanol—particularly its contribution to U.S. fuel supply. Ethanol adds roughly 1 million barrels per day to the fuel market, which also helps stabilize prices by increasing overall supply.

The findings reaffirm ethanol’s role not only in lowering costs at the pump but also in reinforcing American energy independence and reducing vulnerability to global oil disruptions.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ethanol.png,N,,2025-07-06 07:02:11.403494

These initiatives are part of Petrobras’ 2025-2029 Business Plan (PN 2025-2029) and are currently in the bidding phase for service contracts.

Boosting Fuel Production and Refining Capacity

The integration will significantly expand fuel production, including an increase of 76,000 barrels per day (bpd) of S-10 diesel—56,000 bpd from improved fuel quality and 20,000 bpd from additional capacity. The project also includes an increase of 20,000 bpd in jet fuel capacity and 12,000 bpd in Group II lubricating oil output.

A dedicated Bio Jet Fuel plant will be built at the Boaventura Complex, with a capacity of 19,000 bpd to produce renewable fuels, including Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Two gas-fired power plants will also be constructed at the complex to participate in Brazil’s capacity reserve auctions. Engineering for the power units is already approved, and they will benefit from synergies with existing infrastructure at the Itaboraí Natural Gas Processing Unit (UPGN).

At Reduc, Petrobras is also evaluating a used lubricating oil re-refining project with a capacity of 30,000 m³/month (6,300 bpd). With the Boaventura Complex set to handle Group II oil production, Reduc may transition some units to apply circular economy principles—turning waste oils into high-value refined products. A co-processing test has already received ANP authorization, with trials expected to begin later this year.

Decarbonization and Efficiency at Reduc

In a major step toward decarbonization, Reduc has completed its first successful test producing jet fuel with renewable content through co-processing, using up to 1.2% corn oil. The ANP has authorized the process, and commercial production is set to begin in the coming months, with a projected capacity of 50,000 m³/month (10,000 bpd).

Reduc already produces Diesel R5, containing 5% renewable content, and has received approval to begin testing for Diesel R7, which will include 7% renewable content. These developments are part of Petrobras’ broader push toward cleaner energy and a just energy transition.

Additionally, Petrobras plans to build a new thermal power plant at Reduc to replace outdated steam and energy generation systems. With an investment of R$860 million, the project aims to improve operational reliability and align the refinery with global efficiency standards.

To maintain plant integrity and safety, Petrobras has also earmarked up to R$2.4 billion for scheduled maintenance shutdowns at Reduc between 2025 and 2029. Major maintenance activities are planned for 2026, particularly in the delayed coking and hydrotreatment units.

Petrochemical Development

In the petrochemical segment, Petrobras is studying the feasibility of producing acetic acid and monoethylene glycol (MEG) at the Boaventura Complex. Acetic acid is a key input for industries producing paints, PET, and various chemicals. Currently, Brazil imports 100% of its acetic acid needs and partially relies on imports for MEG.

In addition to Petrobras’ plans, its affiliate Braskem is exploring an expansion of its polyethylene plant, potentially increasing production by 230,000 tons annually. The R$4 billion project would utilize natural gas processed through the Route 3 infrastructure at the Boaventura Complex and is pending internal approvals.

These combined investments underscore Petrobras’ commitment to modernizing its operations, increasing domestic fuel supply, expanding the production of renewable fuels, and supporting Brazil’s energy transition goals.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-07-05 15:02:30.130563

Speaking to Anadolu on Friday, Uraloglu said a “green era” has begun with the launch of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) directive by Turkey’s Civil Aviation Directorate.

“This is not only a step forward for the environment but also a significant move for our industry and energy security,” he said.

The policy aligns with Turkey’s 2053 goal of achieving net zero emissions. Under the directive, the use, supply, and monitoring of aviation fuel must follow global standards, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) CORSIA program.

Uraloglu said the directive encourages investment in domestic fuel refining, aiming to reduce reliance on imports and promote high-tech production.

The SAF directive applies to all national and international air carriers operating flights from Turkey, airport operators, workplaces not handling hazardous materials, and individuals licensed by the country’s Energy Market Regulatory Authority. It covers flights using aircraft with a maximum take-off weight of more than 5,700 kilograms (12,566 pounds). Humanitarian, medical, firefighting, and state-owned aircraft are exempt.

“The Civil Aviation Directorate will publish the required SAF usage and minimum emission reduction per liter each year before the third quarter ends,” Uraloglu explained. “Fuel suppliers must meet this standard, and airlines will be required to use the specified amount.”

He added that carriers must load at least 90% of their required fuel from Turkey under this directive.

Uraloglu emphasized that SAF must meet current ICAO standards and noted that key Turkish energy firms are playing an active role. Refinery operator Tupras is preparing to start commercial SAF production by 2026.

He’s the director of a maritime advisory services consultancy, UMAS, and professor at University College London. This is a lightly edited transcript of the second half of our conversation. This first half is here.

Michael Barnard [MB]: Welcome back to Redefining Energy–Tech. This episode is powered by TFIE Strategy, guiding investors toward climate-smart bets that will win in the real world and in the market. I’m your host, Michael Barnard, and returning for the second half of our conversation is Tristan Smith, director of UMAS, a maritime advisory services consultancy. He’s also a professor with the University College London Energy Institute and a maritime decarbonization expert. That’s what this nerdcast is all about, triggered by some excellent movement by the International Maritime Organization.

Part of the dynamic I’m seeing in this industry is that everyone is still confused about what the answer is. I’ve got my opinion, and some people share that opinion. You have a different perspective, based upon your published work. LNG was a dominant narrative, and now the bloom is off that rose. Methanol was a dominant narrative, and the bloom’s off that rose as well. Hydrogen was another narrative, and now the bloom is off that rose because hydrogen isn’t going to be cheap—and synthetic fuels made from hydrogen won’t be cheap either. Meanwhile, the nuclear industry is rearing its head again, claiming they’ve got a solution.

I recently read a survey—maybe it was from the IMO—where a large group of shipping industry participants were polled, and the responses were all over the map. It was, “Maybe this, maybe that—I don’t know.” Consensus just isn’t present yet because there have been so many abortive attempts. It’s fascinating to watch.

Tristan Smith [TS]: There have been abortive attempts, so trust has been lost that anyone can be authoritative on the subject. But also, I think a lot of people understand that what becomes dominant will depend partly on what the sector chooses now. There’s an element where the sector can shape its own pathway from here. If we challenge one of those statements you made and only build methanol dual-fuel ships, then nobody is going to build out ammonia or other fuel production bases. Everyone will assume there’s guaranteed offtake because those ships will need methanol once regulations exceed the greenhouse gas intensity limits already set. The market will respond directly to the specification of the ships.

So what happens next in the fleet will influence what we build as production capacity, creating interacting cycles—production capacity responding or moving in another direction because someone starts betting on a different fuel pathway, which gradually gains traction. Many people seem resigned to waiting and seeing how the fleet evolves and how the energy production side evolves. There’s a common narrative: “We’d love to decarbonize, but we just can’t see the fuels being available, and without knowing which fuels will be available, we can’t decide what molecule we should build our ships around.”

Therefore, some adopt a “bury our heads in the sand” approach, hoping biodiesel will be abundant enough to solve the problem. That’s an easy stance to take given the absence of evidence in fuel infrastructure development. Our research group is trying to monitor those trends closely, both on the supply side—the fuel provision—and by tracking investments and production maturity across fuel options. We’re also looking at the vessels being ordered. Certainly, until the recent IMO outcome, the dominant choice was LNG, representing over 50% of dual-fuel vessels.

So while we can have a theoretical discussion concluding LNG clearly isn’t the answer, that’s not what’s actually happening in the sector. We must factor that reality into our analysis. We make sure our models aren’t naïve and instead recognize the realpolitik influencing behavior and decisions constrained by what’s available or by observing what competitors are doing.

[MB]: There is no dominant answer yet. Maersk is trying to create one by purchasing all its dual-fuel ships with methanol, but it’s going to be interesting to see how that evolves.

We have about half an hour left, and I’d like to return to the recent IMO decision, because it’s intriguing. Let’s start with: What year is it baselined on?

[TS]: It’s baselined on 2008, which I can explain based on the fact that 2008 is the first year for which there was a consistent inventory from the third IMO greenhouse gas study. The organization has conducted four greenhouse gas studies so far, and the third study, published in 2014, examined the period from 2008 to 2012. Thus, the earliest date with reliable inventory data from the third IMO study is 2008. Previous studies went further back but employed substantially different methods, making it difficult to reliably connect earlier emissions estimates to later studies—for example, going back to 1990 or another baseline year.

So, 2008 is considered by the IMO to be the first year with a trustworthy estimate of actual international shipping emissions.

[MB]: The date is interesting in part because I compare and contrast it with Europe, which uses 1990 as its baseline for all greenhouse gas targets. The European baseline is convenient because it’s around the time the IPCC was formed and the first COP was held. The timing is meaningful, and it’s actually a baseline from before a massive amount of the growth in trade, GDP, and shipping we’ve seen over recent decades. But if you don’t have good data for the shipping industry from back then, I can understand why you’d pick a different year.

I also compare and contrast with the United States, which prefers 2007 as its baseline for electricity generation emissions. The U.S. story looks good from 2007 till now, but terrible from 1990 to 2007.

One thing I note, despite the practical reasons for choosing 2008 as the IMO baseline, is that it was prior to the economic crash, prior to widespread slow steaming, back when fuel oil was cheap and container ships were essentially sprinting across the Pacific. From your perspective, do you see the 2008 baseline as unfortunately high compared to the slower steaming practices and greater route efficiencies we observe today? I’m trying to determine if the average ship on an average journey today is already compliant relative to the 2008 baseline.

[TS]: So, compliant with what exactly? Compliant with the IMO’s revised strategy and trajectory, or compliant with something else?

[MB]: Let me paraphrase my question to make it clearer. If we take a typical 20,000 TEU container ship sailing from Shanghai to Los Angeles in 2008 and compare it to the same journey today, would the ship today already have significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions simply due to operational changes like slow steaming?

[TS]: It’s an interesting point that those ships didn’t actually exist in 2008. The largest container ships back then were probably around 9,000 TEU, and it’s extraordinary how they’ve grown in scale since. That’s a fascinating part of the puzzle. But broadly speaking, yes, the absolute emissions from individual vessels have come down significantly since 2008.

As you say, 2008 was indeed a high point—ships were moving fast, fuel was cheap, and energy efficiency in vessel design was relatively low. Those inefficiencies started to be corrected by market forces following the financial crisis, which led to a significant reduction in absolute emissions from around 2008 to about 2012 or 2013. During this period, fuel consumption dropped by as much as 40% or 50% on some vessels, largely due to substantial reductions in speed and correcting poor design choices from the early 2000s.

So yes, 2008 is a flattering baseline year. However, the basic logic the IMO used to set its 2030 and 2040 objectives helps correct for that because it takes a cumulative emissions approach. This aligns shipping’s climate response with the IPCC’s general recommendation: approximately halving emissions by 2030, and reaching net-zero by 2050. That’s from the IPCC AR5—I believe it’s AR5. I’m not always great at recalling these fine details, but around 2019 or 2020, the IPCC clearly stated that to avoid dangerous climate change, these targets were essential.

Translating cumulative emissions into IMO targets gave us the absolute reductions in the revised strategy. While we argued for slightly higher ambitions—around a 36% absolute reduction by 2030 and about a 90% reduction by 2040—the agreed-upon strategy targets of 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040 are actually fairly close to those IPCC recommendations. That’s politics in action, but the point remains that the final numbers don’t appear to continue any trend of apologizing for past emissions.

2008 was essentially a line in the sand, and the process since then has been scientifically informed in reaching the current targets.

[MB]: Good, because I didn’t have the detail on that. Sometimes these baseline choices can seem arbitrary, picking an easy target to hit—but clearly, that’s not what’s happening here, unlike the United States and its 2007 baseline. The U.S. might have its own rationale similar to what you’ve described, but let’s get back to specifics.

I previously mentioned a large, modern container ship traveling from China to the United States. Do you have a concrete example of a route where you could illustrate the financial implications and likely costs associated with exceeding the IMO limits?

[TS]: I should have done my preparation. I don’t—I can’t do the numbers off the top of my head. The way we’ve been approaching it is in terms of relative competitiveness between fuel options, including simply continuing to use oil and paying the non-compliance fee. Initially, those costs are relatively low. But over the course of the 2030s, they rise substantially. By the 2040s, you’re looking at significant premiums just to stay operational while remaining out of compliance. Broadly speaking, fuel costs could quadruple if you just keep paying the fines.

[MB]: And that is significant. There’s an interesting thing here—I just want to nerd out a bit about the growth of container ships. I read The Box twice because it’s just so fascinating. Have you ever read The Box? Pretty much everybody in the industry has, but people outside the industry often say, “What’s that—a book about boxes?”

The move from ships of around 9,000 TEU to today’s 24,000 TEU vessels is interesting simply because greenhouse gas emissions per ton of freight delivered have decreased substantially. Scaling up these ships, lengthening their hulls, and improving efficiency as the hull moves through the water have collectively reduced emissions per container significantly. It would really be a good-news story if we hadn’t built so many ships to keep up with skyrocketing global shipping demand.

[TS]: I’d also argue that you need to be very careful about assumptions regarding how full these ships actually are. While economies of scale certainly work from a physics perspective, logistics often mean you can carry fewer containers and still make a profit. With smaller vessels, you need to be full all the time. But when companies started building these extremely large container ships, they found they could afford not to have them completely full, so their overall utilization dropped.

When you factor in the actual lower number of containers carried, the theoretical CO₂ savings these ships should have delivered—if they’d been full—didn’t necessarily materialize. We analyzed this using IMO data in the late 2010s, and it seemed clear at that time that the claims of significant CO₂ savings from giant container ships were overstated due to their lower operational utilization.

This underutilization partly arises from the competitive strategies of major shipping lines, which use large tonnage to establish monopoly-like dominance on key routes. They’re incentivized to push competitors off routes, sometimes colluding through shipping conferences to provide high-quality services on mainline routes like China-to-Europe. These huge ships allow companies to market significantly lower prices for freight, driving competitors out of business.

That’s why the shipping sector has experienced such dramatic consolidation. If you compare today with the early days described in The Box, you’ll see we’ve moved from a large number of shipping companies in the ’80s and ’90s to the small handful dominating global liner trade today.

The industry dynamics are complex, and economies of scale aren’t always beneficial from a CO₂ perspective. Another good example is bulk ore carriers. Historically, some ships specialized in carrying oil one way and iron ore on the return leg, creating a logistical efficiency. Instead of running empty half the time, these ships could operate triangular routes, significantly reducing empty miles. However, such vessels were gradually driven out by competitors offering lower freight costs through simpler back-and-forth operations. Those simpler operations enjoyed logistical advantages but actually generated higher overall CO₂ emissions than ships maximizing cargo utilization.

So, bigger isn’t always better from an emissions standpoint.

[MB]: Interesting—that’s a great nuance for me to mull over. The example numbers I put together, based on what I could understand of the regulation as someone who didn’t help develop it, indicated that additional costs might be a couple million dollars per journey. That seemed significant to me, but I’m not sure I got those numbers exactly right. I was hoping you’d have more precise figures.

However, your guideline—about four times the fuel cost—is an excellent rule of thumb. It’s substantial enough that we’re not talking about a 20% increase, but something like 300% or 400% higher.

So 43% in 2035. Is there a 2030 figure?

[TS]: There is—and I think it’s on the order of 8 or 9%. Sorry, I don’t have the exact number in front of me. It depends whether we’re talking about the base GHG intensity reduction trajectory, which is lower, or the direct compliance trajectory, which is higher. So it’s around 8% in 2030 for the base trajectory reduction, but then it goes up by another 13% to reach direct compliance. So, that’s nearly 21% in total.

[MB]: Those are interesting numbers because ship hulls typically last 25 to 30 years. There are exceptions, like the “ghost tankers” currently transporting Russian oil, and some older vessels that eventually get scrapped and recycled, but generally speaking, most ships remain operational for about three decades. That means most ships sailing five years from now are already on the water today.

This raises a key question: How will these existing ships achieve efficiency gains of 8 to 21% compared to the 2008 baseline, given they’re already built and operational?

We’re back to the balancing act around 2008 as a baseline. Back then, ships were steaming faster and designs were less efficient, so there are already savings embedded just by operational changes like slow steaming. But if ships today aren’t already meeting the upcoming regulations, how exactly will they achieve compliance in the relatively short span of five years?

[TS]: On energy efficiency, you don’t actually get credit from operational changes like speed reduction. Changing your speed doesn’t count towards the GFI, because the regulation specifically targets the greenhouse gas intensity of the fuel you have onboard. In other words, what’s regulated isn’t overall greenhouse gas emissions per unit of transport supply—which would include operational efficiencies—but purely the carbon intensity of the energy itself.

That means your compliance options are limited to measures related directly to onboard energy sources. Although guidelines aren’t fully finalized yet, wind assistance would likely count. So if you installed sails on your existing five-year-old ship, you’d receive some credit toward compliance. Similarly, energy you use when docked in port—connecting your vessel to shore-based electricity—would also count.

However, this varies considerably by vessel type. Many ships won’t significantly lower emissions through shore power because they’re only alongside for short periods, limiting electricity substitution to small single-digit percentages. Cruise ships might be exceptions since they spend more time docked and could displace more of their onboard energy demand with electrification.

But for most ships, if wind assistance and shore power aren’t sufficient to meet the required 8% reduction—which is just the baseline compliance, with a $100 charge applied to emissions in the next band—they’ll have to consider biofuels. There are already significant examples of companies trialing biofuels and securing biofuel supplies specifically to achieve the required emission-intensity reductions.

[MB]: If you’re bunkering in Singapore or Rotterdam, you can buy B30 right now. I’m not sure how many other ports currently offer biofuel blends—those two immediately spring to mind, but that might just reflect my availability bias.

[TS]: Those are also the ports that publish data on this. Most references indeed point to Singapore and Rotterdam because they sell some of the largest volumes, making information readily accessible. But biofuel availability is broader—there are multiple ports providing these fuels today.

However, it’s worth remembering we’re still pre-regulation. Ships won’t need these fuels to comply until 2025, though some operators are already adopting them to align with existing EU regulations. The EU already has its own standards, so we’re seeing early adoption there.

Globally, I would expect the IMO decision to accelerate the evolution of supply chains for B30 and similar biofuel blends, much like we saw previously with low-sulfur fuels. Biofuels represent the obvious “drop-in” compliance solution for existing vessels. As long as prices stay competitive—without demand outstripping supply and pushing prices higher or other sectors driving up costs—biofuels will be the simplest solution for existing ships that need to meet the upcoming IMO regulations.

[MB]: That’s interesting, because the market demand dynamics will certainly shift significantly. Right now, we produce around 70 million tons of biodiesel annually, mostly wasted in ground transportation. And ground transportation is electrifying rapidly—India reached about 97% heavy rail electrification by the end of last year; China is around 75–80%. Europe’s passenger rail network is already 65–70% electrified and continues to electrify, supplemented by battery-electric solutions for bridging gaps.

So, as ground transport electrifies, that existing biodiesel demand will diminish. This raises the question of whether that 70 million tons will transition towards sustainable aviation fuels or be consumed largely by shipping. It sets up an interesting market shakeout as organizations place their bets.

But there’s another intriguing question here. Suppose that many ship operators simply can’t achieve full compliance. From what you’re telling me, operators will likely opt to pay the initial $100-per-ton fine rather than the higher $380 fine. They’ll choose to blend fuels and pay penalties on emissions above the base compliance level. Given this, what do your models project as the total annual revenue from these fines, and how will that revenue ultimately be used?

[TS]: So in the parameters that we have for the first three years, we think assuming the behaviors of some biofuel use and some methane use and some methanol use, given the existing fleet, that will generate on the order of 11 to 12 billion US dollars per annum. So a total pot of the order of 33 to 36 billion by the end of that first three-year phase. And that first three-year phase is the first period for which we actually have the parameters very clearly set. What the parameters will be in 2031 is still uncertain because there are various review clauses that will kick in and those values might change. So therefore the revenues might increase—or potentially not. And the use of the revenues is still to be finalized.

But there is some language that we can see and we can sense from the political dynamic from the negotiations in April, that there’s a strong desire for a large share of that to be used for subsidizing what the IMO calls ZNZS, or zero or near-zero emission fuels. And then there’s also revenue use for wider purposes, for which there’s quite vague language, but which many countries suggest should support energy infrastructure investments in countries, particularly low-income countries, and also assist countries with their various other energy transition needs, which will include skills retraining of seafarers, maybe some uses to improve logistics so that the effect of the cost increase due to using more expensive fuels is reduced as much as possible.

You know, these various other things that one could use the money for, which will now have to go through a political discussion to finalize. So it’s not clear exactly what the ratios are. There was some proposal during the meeting that it should be split where the majority of the money should go to those national projects, which would still leave on the order of 40%, so a good chunk of maybe 5 billion per annum, to energy subsidy for the ZNZ substitute fuel use. But others have proposed that the subsidy should be greater—maybe use 70%, so closer to 8 billion per annum going to fuel rewards for these ZNZ fuels. And I guess the final thing to say here is that we haven’t yet agreed the definition of ZNZ.

At the moment we have a threshold on the greenhouse gas intensity that sets the minimum requirement for a ZNZ, and that’s 19 grams of CO₂ per megajoule. That puts most of the first-generation biofuels out of the definition, but includes advanced biofuels, and also includes e-fuels, as long as they’re made in a way which minimizes upstream emissions—so using renewable electricity. It probably discounts a lot of the blue fuels that come from CCS and natural gas, steam methane reformation and CCS on land, but it’s not definitive. Maybe, maybe some of that. But that’s just the minimum. And we’ll now have another political discussion to say: do we want everything that is within the minimum to be rewarded, or only a subset? A subset that is genuinely scalable and therefore will be the one we will need in large volumes by the time we get to 2040.

[MB]: It’s going to be interesting to see how this plays out. One of the observations I’ve been making and wondering about since the late 2010s is why everyone assumes synthetic fuels will be remotely affordable for anyone.

I did the techno-economic analyses on direct air capture and synthetic fuels, looked into chemical processes, and compared them against alternative solutions. The numbers simply didn’t make sense. Every time I’ve assessed the cost of green hydrogen production—across four continents, covering 15 or 20 different projects myself—the economics never added up to a truly cheap option.

For instance, I conducted a study on European energy colonialism in North Africa, specifically Morocco, Algeria, and Egypt, where European policies were pushing to manufacture green hydrogen locally for export, rather than prioritizing domestic decarbonization. My conclusion, which I’ve published, was that hydrogen can indeed be green—but it can’t be cheap. By extension, synthetic fuels can’t be cheap either. The IEA’s recent fuel assessments echoed this, finding synthetic fuels costing about four to six times as much as conventional fossil fuels.

This makes synthetic fuels extremely difficult economically, which is why I lean toward biofuels—they’ll likely cost around two to three times more than traditional fuels, rather than four to six times.

Meanwhile, the global biofuels market itself is set for transformation as electrification takes away biofuel’s current primary markets. This could leave the right kinds of molecules available—but airlines will be competing for exactly the same molecules.

All of the conversations I’ve had around this issue ultimately boil down to economics.

[TS]: Absolutely. There’s nothing in shipping that adds any premium, which is exactly why we’ve been using heavy fuel oil—a waste product—because shipping always gravitates toward the lowest-cost fuel source available. We need to identify what the equivalent low-cost waste product might be in the global economy of the future. We’ve tried to do exactly that ourselves.

Our problem is that we struggle to see bioenergy being supplied at the volumes needed—not just by shipping, but also by the numerous other sectors competing for it. We’ve analyzed the cost of substitution across these sectors. Take aviation as an example: if airlines can’t sufficiently decarbonize with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), they’ll need synthetic kerosene. Comparing the costs of synthetic kerosene versus synthetic ammonia indicates you’re more likely to see bio-derived SAF flowing into aviation, with E-fuels moving into shipping. This is because it’s much more efficient—per green electron—to produce synthetic ammonia for ships than synthetic kerosene for airplanes.

But that analysis still only focuses on shipping and aviation. In reality, sustainable biomass feedstocks—those which avoid unintended consequences like land-use changes—will be in demand from many sectors, even after accounting for the extensive electrification underway. This isn’t just our finding; others have reached similar conclusions.

This debate is precisely where the conversation sits right now. We need to revisit all assumptions about potential biomass consumers—whether that’s a growing global population, the plastics industry, or sectors not easily electrified—and then reassess how much residual biomass demand remains, and if that residual demand matches the sustainable bioenergy supply. We’ve done this before, but it should be revisited continuously. That reassessment will tell us clearly whether there’s enough sustainable bioenergy to avoid reliance on more expensive synthetic E-fuels, or whether E-fuels will inevitably have a significant role.

Based on current conditions, we think the incentives set by the IMO—using some of that projected $5 billion to $8 billion revenue—would be enough to make a viable business case for using E-ammonia in shipping this decade, even at today’s high hydrogen costs. That means, regardless of whether E-ammonia proves to be the optimal long-term solution, we’ll likely see at least some early adoption. Maybe not massive volumes initially, but certainly meaningful experimentation.

We already see ship owners ordering dual-fuel ammonia vessels because they’re convinced by these economics and skeptical about sufficient bioenergy availability in maritime markets. They’re willing to take the risk, experiment, and see how reality plays out—not just theoretical spreadsheet analyses from teams like ours. We need real-world data on costs, unexpected factors we’ve overlooked, or potential cost-reduction opportunities we’ve underestimated.

Over the next three to five years, we’ll gain valuable experience to help revisit and clarify these critical questions: What exactly will replace those 250 million tons of oil currently required each year to fuel the global shipping sector and serve global trade?

[MB]: Well, we disagree about that number because 55% of tonnage is in structural decline. So my projection for tonnage is lower than the adjusted tonnage that the IMO uses, which is fine. But it’s not like you’re using the maximal tonnage either. The Maersk Institute—when I talk to them, the Maersk McKinney Møller Institute for Maritime Shipping Decarbonization or whatever that collection of syllables is, it’s just too long a name—they reference 450 to 550 million tons. So there are all sorts of projected numbers, and there’s a big range. I’m at the bottom end of the range, just as I am with hydrogen.

But I’ll make two statements before we close. The first is that we throw away 2.5 billion tons of calories manufactured for human consumption every year. A full third of food is wasted. A lot of that waste happens at choke points or points of heavy processing, where it can be captured. Every ton of dried biomass turns into 0.4 tons of biofuels. So there’s a massive amount of biomass waste, currently turning into methane—a major greenhouse gas problem—that we are underutilizing. That waste stream is a large feedstock opportunity for biofuels, particularly for shipping and aviation, which still need them for long-haul transportation.

I’ve done the work on all the sources of biomass feedstock and the conversion technologies—professionally, for an energy firm that asked me what the energies of the future would be, and personally, because I’m a nerd who can’t help it. So I think the answers are there.

The second thing I’ll say is I did the math on ammonia. If you take a ton of e-ammonia and use it to fertilize biomass, the result—because of modern agricultural upskilling—is 64 tons of biofuels. If you just burn that ton of ammonia, you get exactly that: one ton of ammonia energy. But if you use it to grow biomass and make biofuels, you get 64 tons of output. So I think the math is going to become pretty obvious over time.

I think there’s a lot of emotion in the EU’s discussion around biofuels, but eventually economic rationality will prevail. That said, these are just differences of opinion. You guys make spreadsheets, I make spreadsheets. What’s going to matter is what people actually buy.

And here’s the good news: the IMO is now representative of an industry that’s getting serious about fixing climate change. And that’s a really good news story.

[TS]: Exactly. A good place to wrap up is acknowledging that, until now, it’s been very difficult to establish a clear business case for substantial investments—whether in high-quality bioenergy production that truly valorizes waste products rather than simply growing crops for bioethanol, which obviously isn’t scalable, or in synthetic hydrogen-derived fuel pathways.

The critical point is that the IMO regulations will create the business case that drives investment and innovation. We’ll gain valuable insights into both biofuels and hydrogen-derived alternatives, understanding their relative merits and trade-offs based on real-world experiences, not just theoretical debates.

This learning period over the next few years will be immensely beneficial, not just to shipping as it plans its future, but also to all sectors seeking solutions for hard-to-electrify applications.

[MB]: I always like to leave an open-ended opportunity at the end of our discussions. We’ve covered a lot of ground, but if there’s anything important we’ve missed or anything you’d like to add, this is your chance.

You have an audience of founders, CEOs, investors—all with a nerdish predisposition. Whether you want to share a key takeaway, offer advice, or even just pitch UMAS, how would you like to close this? What would you like to say with an open-ended opportunity to address this audience?

[TS]: I guess our takeaway is this: we had hoped for more clarity from the IMO outcome. We’d hoped for a steeper reduction curve, more aligned with climate science. It was difficult to celebrate fully, because the targets still aren’t entirely consistent with what we know is needed to avoid some of the most extreme climate outcomes.

Nevertheless, the shipping industry now faces dramatic and inevitable change. By 2040, we know the majority of energy used in shipping will no longer be fossil-based. The regulation now mandates a 65% greenhouse gas intensity reduction—this is binding, backed by significant penalties, enforced by an organization with a strong track record of ensuring compliance.

So, in the next 15 years, shipping will undergo profound shifts. While there remains uncertainty about exactly which fuel molecules will ultimately prove cost-optimal, the industry can now seriously strategize. Shipping requires long-term decisions—ships typically operate for around 30 years, and infrastructure such as terminals can last 40 years or more. Assets built today will soon exist in a world where fossil fuels are no longer dominant.

This presents enormous opportunities but also significant risks. The risk lies primarily in taking a “wait-and-see” approach, the traditional behavior in shipping. The opportunity comes from proactively doing the math—carefully analyzing which fuel pathways offer competitive advantages and how to build viable business cases around them. Those who move early can effectively de-risk their strategies, positioning themselves well for the coming transition.

Historically, it’s been easy to dismiss the credibility of IMO actions—but that’s changing now. I can’t think of another sector that has successfully advanced a regulatory strategy at such a global scale. There are examples where national policy has driven localized transitions, but shipping is unique in creating a global transition opportunity.

I hope this also triggers significant opportunities in lower-income countries, ensuring the energy transition isn’t solely led by North America, Europe, and China—regions with substantial public investment—but genuinely becomes a globally inclusive process. Energy transitions must encompass a wide variety of countries to succeed in practice.

[MB]: I’ll just say the IMO’s movement is a lot better than what the ICAO is doing.

[TS]: In relative terms, it certainly is.

In 2024, the biodiesel industry added about $1 to the price of each bushel of soybeans and brought in around $598 million in extra value for Iowa farmers.","Ankeny, Iowa: The Iowa Soybean Association (ISA) has welcomed the U.S. House’s approval of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” a wide-ranging new law that promises strong support for soybean farmers. The bill, expected to be signed into law on Friday afternoon, includes changes to taxes, better support programs for farmers, and new incentives for biofuels, reports Iowa’s News Now.

ISA President Brent Swart, a soybean farmer from Spencer, called the bill a major win for Iowa’s 37,000 soybean farmers and thanked the Trump administration and Iowa’s members of Congress for their work on key farming issues.

One important part of the bill extends support for clean fuel made from crops like soybeans until 2029. It also removes rules that made it harder to use farmland for these fuels and limits the fuel sources to those grown in the U.S., Mexico, or Canada.

Another change increases support for small biodiesel producers by raising the benefit to 20 cents per gallon. This will help local plants that make fuel from soybeans and create more opportunities for Iowa farmers.

The bill also provides long-term tax relief for farmers. It raises the amount of money a person can pass on without paying estate taxes to $15 million and keeps an important farm tax break in place. It also raises the base price for soybeans used in government programs to $10 per bushel starting in 2025, with increases tied to inflation beginning in 2031.

“For farmers passing family farms to sons and daughters, the estate tax reform helps secure our generational legacy,” Swart said. He also praised ISA members who spoke to lawmakers in support of the bill.

In 2024, the biodiesel industry added about $1 to the price of each bushel of soybeans and brought in around $598 million in extra value for Iowa farmers.

The bill also improves programs that protect farmers from crop losses, adds help for new farmers, and doubles the funding for government programs that promote U.S. farm products around the world. These changes aim to create more global demand for Iowa’s crops.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biodiesel-5.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 13:16:06.112974

In der Pilatus PC-12 greife ich erneut brav zur Wasserflasche, die in einer Ausbuchtung neben meinem Platz zu finden ist.","Wie ein Glas Champagner über den Wolken schmeckt? Ja, das würde ich auch gerne wissen. Denn um es vorwegzunehmen: Champagner gab es bei dem Flug, den ich für das „Luxemburger Wort“ gemeinsam mit anderen Journalisten und Journalistinnen aus dem Großherzogtum absolvierte, nicht. Das Erlebnis war sogar weniger glamourös als erhofft. Doch zunächst einmal zum „Warum“.

Warum eigentlich Privatjet? Grund für den kleinen Ausflug war eine Einladung des in Luxemburg ansässigen Unternehmens Jetfly. Man feiert in diesem Jahr seinen 25. Geburtstag und will der Presse vorführen, wie denn so ein Privatjet von innen aussieht, wie er sich anfühlt und wie sich das Fliegen gestaltet. Und man möchte natürlich ganz nebenbei erwähnen, wie stark das international tätige Unternehmen gewachsen ist. Von nicht einmal zehn Mitarbeitern in Anfangszeiten auf mittlerweile 500 Männer und Frauen, darunter 250 Pilotinnen und Piloten.

Erlebnis versus Flugscham

Diese einmalige Gelegenheit, Taylor Swift und Co. nachzueifern, sorgte für heftige Diskussionen in der Redaktion. Natürlich, das Ganze klingt recht glamourös und warum nicht den Leserinnen und Lesern einen Einblick in die Welt der Schönen und Reichen gewähren. Auf der anderen Seite stehen aber die Auswirkungen des Privatjet-Verkehrs: die hohen CO₂-Emissionen, die ständig Thema sind. Flugscham scheinen viele der Jetsetter nämlich nicht zu kennen.

Und schließlich sagten wir doch zu, trotz aller Zweifel. Die Neugier siegte mit hauchdünnem Vorsprung. Die Möglichkeit, dem Mysterium auf den Grund zu gehen, spielte ebenfalls eine tragende Rolle bei der Entscheidungsfindung.

Der Abflug für die Privatjetpassagiere, zu denen ich nun auch gehöre, erfolgt standardgemäß im Business Aviation Center des Flughafen Findel an einem sonnigen Dienstag. Noch ist kein Champagner in Sicht, dagegen aber die Sicherheitskontrolle, die schnell durchschritten ist (schließlich sind später nur wenige Passagiere und noch weniger Gepäck an Bord). Und dann heißt es warten, auf den Pilot oder die Pilotin, der oder die uns zum Flugzeug führt.

Kaum ist der Gedanke vollendet, stößt Pilotin Amélie zu der siebenköpfigen Reisegruppe. 21 Prozent der Piloten bei Jetfly sind Frauen, in der gesamten Flugbranche sind es dagegen weit unter zehn Prozent. Sie führt uns nach draußen. Und dann steht sie auch schon vor mir: die Pilatus PC-12. Laut Herstellerangaben sind mit dem einmotorigen Propellerflugzeug Reichweiten je nach Passagierzahl von bis zu 2.800 Kilometern möglich, die Maximalgeschwindigkeit beträgt 537 Kilometer pro Stunde.

Jetfly, vor 25 Jahren in einem kleinen Appartment im Bahnhofsviertel aus der Taufe gehoben und mittlerweile im neuen Skypark Business Center am Findel ansässig, verfügt über 52 dieser Flugzeuge, die etwa auch in Australien vom Flying Doctor Service genutzt werden und sich laut Herstellerangaben besonders gut für kürzere Strecken eignen.

Ergänzt wird die Flotte durch 15 Pilatus PC-24, die aufgrund höherer Reichweite (bis zu 3.600 Kilometer) etwa auch Flüge bis in den Süden Spaniens oder in den Norden Afrikas ermöglichen, und drei kleinere Cirrus SF50 (bis zu 2.000 Kilometer), bei denen nur ein Pilot mit an Bord sein muss und ein Fallschirmsystem verbaut ist. Je nach Maschinengröße können so vier bis neun Personen von A nach B gebracht werden.

Eine Haltung wie eine Ährenleserin

Die Pilatus PC-12, die vor mir in der Sonne glänzt, ist in dezentem Grau gehalten, das Band, das sich um die Einstiegstür legt, ist bordeauxrot. „Das Design stammt von Philippe Starck“, erklärt Leslie Jacob, eine Vertreterin von Jetfly, und verweist schon vor dem Einstieg auf das Interieur, das ebenfalls vom französischen Stardesigner gestaltet wurde.

Mit einem „Da bin ich aber gespannt“ bewältige ich die wenigen Stufen der kleinen Treppe … und beuge den Oberkörper nach unten. Gebückt, fast so wie die Ährenleserinnen aus dem gleichnamigen Gemälde von Jean-François Millet, bewege ich mich durch das Innere des Flugzeugs und setze mich auf einen der beiden vorderen Plätze mit Blickrichtung Heck. Die zwei Männer aus der Gruppe werden gebeten, aufgrund der gewünschten optimalen Gewichtsverteilung dort zu sitzen.

Die fünf Damen verteilen sich auf die sechs nach vorne gerichteten Plätze. Pilotin Amélie gibt uns eine kurze Sicherheitseinweisung, zeigt uns die drei Notausgänge, die winzige Toilette, die wir aber bestenfalls nicht nutzen sollen, sowie die Schwimmwesten und weist uns auf die Getränke (Softdrinks) und Snacks hin, bei denen wir uns selbst bedienen müssen. Der Flug ist kurz, der Service fällt daher aus.

Und dann geht es auch schon los, Amélie und ihr Kollege Antoine starten die Maschine und rollen auf die Startbahn. Ziel ist die Stadt Epernay in der Champagne, es geht also zumindest mal in Richtung Edelbrause. Der angesteuerte Flughafen Aérodrome d‘Epernay/Plivot ist laut Jetfly eines von insgesamt 3.000 Zielen in Europa, das angeflogen werden kann. Dazu kommen noch weitere Ziele in Nordamerika: Dort arbeitet das Unternehmen mit einem lokalen Anbieter namens PlaneSense Inc. zusammen.

Stationiert sind die Flugzeuge überall und nirgends: Sie befinden sich dort, wo die Menschen hinfliegen und werden erst bei Bedarf vom nächstgelegenen Flughafen angefordert, so werden überflüssige Leerbewegungen, sogenannte Empty-leg-Flüge, vermieden. Gleiches versucht man auch dadurch zu vermeiden, dass solche Anforderungsflüge den Kunden speziell angeboten werden.

Wer Mitglied im Club der Privatjet-Nutzer werden will, kann entweder einen Jet chartern oder im Falle von Jetfly Anteilsinhaber eines Flugzeugs werden und damit viel einfacher auf ein solches zugreifen. Wie groß dieser Anteil ist, wird anhand des geschätzten Einsatzbedarfs gemessen und ist auch abhängig vom gewählten Flugzeugtyp. Der Einstieg erfolgt bei 200.000 US-Dollar (Cirrus SF50), was einem Zwanzigstel der Gesamtsumme entspricht. Die entsprechende Maschine wird erst ausgeliefert, wenn alle Anteile erworben wurden.

Dazu kommen weitere Kosten: monatliche Servicegebühren, der Preis für die tatsächlich geflogenen Stunden (rund 4.000 Euro pro Stunde) und zudem Flughafengebühren. Der Vertrag über die Nutzung läuft über fünf Jahre und kann auf bis zu zehn Jahre verlängert werden. Auch besteht die Möglichkeit, einen Anteil zu verkaufen. Leerflüge werden nicht berechnet, ebenso nicht die Positionierung. Eine Maschine – also die, an der man einen Anteil erworben hat – steht den Teilnehmern des Jetfly-Programms, derzeit sind es etwa 550, innerhalb von 24 Stunden zur Verfügung.

Nur ein wenig Luxus

Für unsere Reisegruppe heißt es aber zunächst einmal fliegen, rund 30 Minuten, um genau zu sein. Wir befinden uns in einer niedrigen Höhe, der Druckausgleich in den Ohren klappt problemlos, der Flug verläuft nahezu ohne Turbulenzen. So bleibt ein wenig Zeit, um die Felder und Wälder durch das Fenster unter die Lupe zu nehmen.

Oder aber auch: um das Dekor ein wenig genauer zu betrachten. Die Ledersitze sind bequem, aber nicht übermäßig groß. Da der Nebenmann von mir durch den schmalen Gang getrennt ist, kommt kein Engegefühl auf. Auch für die Beine ist ausreichend Platz, zumindest für eine kurze Reise, die kaum länger dauert als eine Tramfahrt vom Bahnhof der Hauptstadt bis zum Flughafen Findel. Der Geräuschpegel ist hoch, aber auszuhalten. Gespräche mit dem Nebenmann sind möglich, eine Gruppendiskussion eher nicht.

Philippe Starck konnte sich, anders als erhofft, im Inneren, ähnlich wie bei der Außenlackierung, nur bedingt austoben. Die gut betuchte Kundschaft erwartet ein Interieur, das das Auge nicht ablenkt: Das Ergebnis des Designprozesses kommt in einer Farbfamilie irgendwo zwischen Greige und Beige daher. Für den nötigen Business-Komfort sorgen ausklappbare Tische und Ladeanschlüsse fürs Smartphone.

Mit der Gulfstream G700, die sich Jeff Bezos jüngst für etwa 72 Millionen Euro angeschafft hat, haben die Flugzeugtypen von Jetfly wenig gemein. Sie sind keine Privatjets mit überbordendem Luxus, sie wirken eher wie Lufttaxis, die vor allem Geschäftsleuten das Leben erleichtern und sie schnell, problemlos und vor allem zeitlich flexibel ans Ziel bringen. Ein Drittel der Flugbewegungen bei Jetfly entfalle auf Geschäftsreisen, ein Drittel auf Privatreisen und ein Drittel auf solche Reisen, die beides verbinden, erklärt Leslie Jacob.

Sanfte Rasenlandung

Die Pilatus PC-12 bringt unsere Reisegruppe leider nicht bis an die Küste oder zu einer der spektakulären Landebahnen im Alpenraum. Und doch ist das Aufsetzen auf der Piste des Aérodrome d‘Epernay/Plivat ein besonderes Erlebnis. Denn: Die Landebahn ist nicht asphaltiert.

Unglaublich sanft setzen wir auf der Grasfläche zwischen Feldern auf. Alle bleiben brav auf ihren Plätzen sitzen und genießen das Ausrollen. „Man kann sogar auf Sandpisten landen“, ergänzt Jetfly-Mitarbeiterin Leslie. Und nach wenigen Sekunden auf der Parkposition steigt Pilotin Amélie aus dem Cockpit, öffnet die Passagiertür und entlässt uns nach draußen.

Kunden aus Luxemburg steuern laut Jetfly besonders häufig Paris (Le Bourget), Genf, Brüssel, Angers und Rom (Viterbe) an. Auf den Plätzen folgen Fanborough bei London, Amsterdam, Saanen in der Schweiz und Perugia. Insgesamt wachse die Nachfrage stark, so das Unternehmen: Die Zahl der Flugbewegungen von Jetfly stieg allein im Großherzogtum von 300 im Jahr 2019 auf 400 im Jahr 2024.

Später, bei einer längeren Pause am Boden, wird sich natürlich ausgiebig über die Erfahrungen an Bord unterhalten. Und dann kommt auch ein Thema zur Sprache, das schon seit längerem durch die Medien geistert: die Belastung der Umwelt durch Privatflüge.

Verschiedene Organisationen, wie etwa Greenpeace, weisen auf den Boom von Privatjetflügen hin und damit auch auf den wachsenden CO₂-Ausstoß. Laut einer Studie stiegen die Abgasemissionen in diesem Bereich zwischen 2019 und 2023 um 46 Prozent. Und der Markt wächst weiter, damit auch die Belastung der Umwelt: geschätzt etwa um 14,3 Prozent pro Jahr, vor allem im Kernmarkt der privaten Fliegerei, den USA.

Auf dem Papier betrachtet haben die CO₂-Emissionen der privaten Luftfahrt nur einen geringen Anteil an den Gesamtemissionen der Branche, etwa 1,8 Prozent. Auf der anderen Seite steht aber der geringe Prozentsatz der Bevölkerung, der Privatjets nutzt. Klimaexperten schlagen daher Alarm.

Bedingt nachhaltig

Jetfly, versichern Leslie Jacob und ihr belgischer Kollege Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore, sei sich dieser Problematik bewusst. Beide verweisen auf den geringen Anteil an den Gesamtemissionen und zeitgleich auf die Bemühungen des Unternehmens, im Sinne der Nachhaltigkeit zu handeln, wie etwa durch die Vermeidung von Empty-leg-Flügen oder die Möglichkeit, einer Mitfahrzentrale gleich, sich einen Privatjetflug mit anderen zu teilen.

Seit Februar 2025 besteht für Jetfly-Anteilseigner zudem die Möglichkeit, statt auf Kerosin auf SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), also einen nachhaltigen Flugkraftstoff, zu setzen. Dieser besteht aus nachwachsenden Rohstoffen, ist jedoch teurer in der Herstellung. Der Passagier beziehungsweise die Passagierin übernimmt den Aufpreis. Der CO₂-Fußabdruck werde laut Unternehmen dadurch um bis zu 40 Prozent reduziert.

Ob das auch häufig angefragt werde? „Ja, es läuft“, sagt Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore mit einem Lachen. Die Kinder der Anteilseigner hätten ein anderes Verständnis von Umwelt- beziehungsweise Klimaschutz und würden daher ihre Eltern dazu drängen, den Aufpreis zu zahlen.

Die CO₂-Emissionen seien laut Jetfly bei den Pilatus-Maschinen niedriger als bei vergleichbaren Flugzeugen anderer Hersteller. Das zeigen auch verschiedene Studien. Doch man sollte auch nicht vergessen: Eine PC-12 verbraucht rund 200 Liter Kerosin pro Stunde, eine PC-24 sogar 600 Liter.

Mit diesen Informationen im Kopf geht es dann auch schon wieder zurück zum kleinen Flugplatz mit Rasenpiste. Und knapp 30 Minuten später, nach einem vom Wind ein wenig verwehten Flug, der einer Passagierin gar den Magen auf den Kopf stellt, setzt die Propellermaschine schließlich zur Landung in Luxemburg an.

Den von mir herbeigesehnten Champagner gab es übrigens am Boden, vor dem Mittagessen. In der Pilatus PC-12 greife ich erneut brav zur Wasserflasche, die in einer Ausbuchtung neben meinem Platz zu finden ist. Vielleicht ist das auch die vernünftigere Getränkewahl, denn schließlich schmeckt mir der Crémant, der in den Luxair-Maschinen serviert wird, in luftiger Höhe nie so gut wie am Boden.

Und die Flugscham? Die hält sich bei mir und meinen Mitreisenden leider in Grenzen. Um meine Umweltbilanz wieder auf ein vertretbares Niveau zu bringen, setze ich jetzt verstärkt auf den Schienenverkehr, um etwa morgens in die Redaktion zu kommen oder auch um in diesem Sommer meine Urlaubsziele zu erreichen. Einen Privatjet werde ich zudem so schnell nicht mehr von innen sehen. Das Erbe einer bisher unbekannten Großtante oder ein Lottogewinn trennt mich weiterhin vom Jetsetleben in luftiger Höhe.",https://img.wort.lu/public/luxemburg/cx87zp-pc12-nuages-2024-1.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/PC12-Nuages-2024%201.jpg,N,,2025-07-05 15:02:49.288781

The airline group confirmed a firm order for 20 additional A330-900 aircraft during an official event in France, marking a clear signal of its long-term commitment to fleet renewal, sustainability, and customer comfort. This latest agreement effectively doubles the airline’s future A330neo fleet to 40 aircraft, ensuring it can deliver on growth ambitions while meeting evolving passenger expectations.

Expanding Malaysia Airlines’ Widebody Capacity

Malaysia Airlines, the flagship carrier of Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), has already begun operating its first A330neo jets on popular routes linking Kuala Lumpur to destinations such as Melbourne, Auckland, and Bali. These early deliveries have been praised for their modern, premium cabins and enhanced operational performance.

With this new order, the airline is investing in a consistent and standardized widebody fleet that will allow it to offer seamless experiences across its network. MAG’s leadership describes this move as essential for future growth, enabling the carrier to serve high-demand regional and long-haul routes with greater efficiency and reliability.

By doubling its A330neo commitment, Malaysia Airlines is also responding to strong passenger demand for comfort, connectivity, and sustainability. The aircraft’s modern features, fuel efficiency, and advanced passenger amenities make it an ideal fit for the airline’s evolving strategy.

Delivering Premium Passenger Experiences

The A330neo is designed with Airbus’s award-winning Airspace cabin, which offers passengers a distinctive experience characterized by more space, advanced lighting, and modern design. Travelers benefit from enlarged overhead bins, customizable mood lighting, and the latest in-flight entertainment systems.

This premium configuration aligns perfectly with Malaysia Airlines’ focus on delivering a world-class travel experience. The airline has committed to an all-new premium cabin layout for the A330neo, ensuring that passengers across all classes enjoy enhanced comfort and amenities. Business travelers and leisure passengers alike will see tangible improvements on routes served by the new fleet.

Such investments demonstrate Malaysia Airlines’ determination to compete effectively with other premium carriers in the region. By offering a modern, comfortable, and technologically advanced cabin, the airline aims to attract discerning travelers and reinforce its brand as a leading choice for travel to and from Southeast Asia.

Fuel Efficiency and Sustainability Goals

Malaysia Aviation Group doubles Airbus A330neo orders with sustainability as a key driver. The A330neo is powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, delivering substantial improvements in fuel efficiency and emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft.

According to Airbus, the A330neo is capable of flying up to 13,300 kilometers non-stop while burning significantly less fuel per seat. This operational efficiency allows airlines to reduce their carbon footprint without sacrificing performance or passenger comfort.

In line with global aviation targets, the A330neo can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with a target of 100% SAF capability by 2030. For Malaysia Airlines, this aligns with broader sustainability goals to reduce environmental impact and support industry-wide decarbonization efforts.

MAG’s Managing Director, Datuk Captain Izham Ismail, emphasized that this fleet renewal is part of a long-term vision of building a future-ready fleet that supports sustainable growth, delivers consistent value to passengers, and strengthens competitiveness in key markets.

Strengthening Strategic Ties with Airbus

The latest order was signed during an official visit to France by Malaysia’s Prime Minister, highlighting the importance of strong diplomatic and commercial ties between Malaysia and France. It also underscores the trust and confidence that Malaysia Aviation Group places in Airbus as a long-term strategic partner.

Airbus executives described the repeat order as a testament to the A330neo’s performance, versatility, and popularity among premium airlines worldwide. This endorsement strengthens Airbus’s position in the competitive widebody market, while supporting Malaysia Airlines’ efforts to modernize its fleet and deliver improved passenger experiences.

By securing this deal, Airbus cements its role as a key supplier to Malaysia Airlines, providing not only the aircraft themselves but also ongoing support, training, and maintenance services that are critical for safe and reliable operations.

Supporting Growth in Asia-Pacific Aviation

Asia-Pacific remains one of the most dynamic and competitive regions in global aviation. With strong demand for both regional and long-haul travel, airlines are investing heavily in new aircraft to serve growing passenger numbers and shifting market needs.

For Malaysia Airlines, this expanded A330neo fleet will enable more non-stop routes, better frequency on high-demand services, and more efficient deployment of aircraft across its network. Travelers can expect improved connectivity between Kuala Lumpur and major destinations in Australia, New Zealand, North Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

Such expansion is essential for Malaysia Airlines to maintain its relevance and competitiveness in a market where other regional carriers are also modernizing their fleets and expanding their networks. By offering passengers a superior travel experience while managing operational costs, Malaysia Airlines aims to grow market share and enhance its reputation as a leading Asian carrier.

Aircraft Features That Impress

Powered by the latest Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines, the A330neo offers a range of up to 7,200 nautical miles (13,300 km) non-stop. The aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics, fuel-efficient engines, and state-of-the-art cabin design combine to deliver both operational advantages and passenger satisfaction.

Key features include:

Enlarged overhead bins for more carry-on storage

Advanced lighting systems with customizable settings

Improved cabin layout for greater comfort and privacy

Latest in-flight entertainment and connectivity options

These enhancements make the A330neo especially attractive to airlines looking to offer a premium product while managing costs and environmental impact. For Malaysia Airlines, these features will help differentiate its service and meet the high expectations of today’s travelers.

Airbus’s Global Success with the A330neo

At the end of May 2025, Airbus’s A330 Family had secured over 1,800 firm orders from more than 130 customers worldwide. The A330neo itself has proven popular among premium carriers seeking a versatile, cost-efficient solution for both regional and long-haul markets.

Airbus continues to innovate with the A330neo, improving fuel efficiency, reducing emissions, and enhancing passenger comfort. As airlines transition to more sustainable operations, models like the A330neo play a vital role in bridging the gap toward full SAF adoption and eventually zero-emission technologies.

Malaysia Aviation Group’s repeat order validates Airbus’s strategy of continuous improvement and close collaboration with airline partners to meet evolving market demands. This partnership supports not only the airlines’ growth but also broader industry goals around safety, sustainability, and passenger experience.

This latest commitment signals Malaysia Aviation Group’s readiness to invest in its future and deliver consistent, high-quality service to passengers around the world. By doubling its A330neo order, the group is making a clear statement about its ambition to be a leading player in the region.

For travelers, this means more comfortable flights, more direct routes, and the confidence that their chosen airline is investing in modern, efficient, and environmentally responsible aircraft.
