“NMIA can be compared with Heathrow Airport in London, which covers 1,227 hectares and has five terminals.
Once fully operational, NMIA will handle 90 million passengers annually, transforming Mahamumbai into a major aviation hub,” said Vijay Singhal, Vice Chairman and Managing Director (VC & MD) of CIDCO.
Subsequently, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) will conduct detailed inspections to ensure compliance with national aviation safety standards.
“Being centrally positioned, the airport will provide international connectivity to Pune, PMR, Nashik, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).","Belapur: Drawing parallels with London’s Heathrow Airport, the upcoming Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is expected to transform Mahamumbai into a major global aviation center, with state-of-the-art infrastructure and seamless passenger connectivity.

To be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8, NMIA spans 1,160 hectares and will feature four terminals—one of which is complete and scheduled to begin operations in December.

“NMIA can be compared with Heathrow Airport in London, which covers 1,227 hectares and has five terminals. Once fully operational, NMIA will handle 90 million passengers annually, transforming Mahamumbai into a major aviation hub,” said Vijay Singhal, Vice Chairman and Managing Director (VC & MD) of CIDCO.

PM Modi is expected to arrive at NMIA at 2:40 p.m., inspect the terminal building, and address a public gathering. After the inauguration, the airport will be handed over to the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) for 45 days of security checks. Subsequently, the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) will conduct detailed inspections to ensure compliance with national aviation safety standards. Following these procedures, both domestic and international flight operations will commence by December.

“This airport’s commissioning involves extensive security and regulatory checks. The October 8 ceremony marks the formal inauguration, but flight operations—domestic and international—will start by December,” explained Singhal.

Highlighting NMIA’s superior accessibility, Singhal added, “This is the country’s first international airport offering multi-modal connectivity—with road access from both eastern and western sides, a proposed metro corridor, and an upcoming water taxi service.”

Strategically located, NMIA will also strengthen connectivity to Pune, Nashik, and the Pune Metropolitan Region (PMR). “Being centrally positioned, the airport will provide international connectivity to Pune, PMR, Nashik, and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). It is not just an airport but a transformative infrastructure project that will accelerate regional growth,” he emphasized.

The new-age Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA), once fully completed, will feature an underground Automated People Mover (APM) — a mini underground train system designed to transport passengers seamlessly between Terminals 1 and 4, regardless of their check-in terminal. The airport will also include dedicated facilities for storing sustainable aviation fuel, making it both environmentally friendly and a model of sustainable airport infrastructure.

Hey fellow impactful ninja ?

You may have noticed that Impactful Ninja is all about providing helpful information to make a positive impact on the world and society. And that we love to link back to where we found all the information for each of our posts.

Most of these links are informational-based for you to check out their primary sources with one click.

But some of these links are so-called ""affiliate links"" to products that we recommend.

Why do we add these product links?

First and foremost, because we believe that they add value to you. For example, when we wrote a post about the environmental impact of long showers, we came across an EPA recommendation to use WaterSense showerheads. So we linked to where you can find them. Or, for many of our posts, we also link to our favorite books on that topic so that you can get a much more holistic overview than one single blog post could provide.

And when there is an affiliate program for these products, we sign up for it. For example, as Amazon Associates, we earn from qualifying purchases.

What do these affiliate links mean for you?

First, and most importantly, we still only recommend products that we believe add value for you.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission - but at no additional costs to you.

And when you buy something through a link that is not an affiliate link, we won’t receive any commission but we’ll still be happy to have helped you.

What do these affiliate links mean for us?

When we find products that we believe add value to you and the seller has an affiliate program, we sign up for it.

When you buy something through one of our affiliate links, we may earn a small commission (at no extra costs to you).

And at this point in time, all money is reinvested in sharing the most helpful content with you. This includes all operating costs for running this site and the content creation itself.

What does this mean for me personally?

You may have noticed by the way Impactful Ninja is operated that money is not the driving factor behind it. It is a passion project of mine and I love to share helpful information with you to make a positive impact on the world and society. However, it's a project in that I invest a lot of time and also quite some money.

Eventually, my dream is to one day turn this passion project into my full-time job and provide even more helpful information. But that's still a long time to go.

O encontro marcou a primeira visita de um presidente da Petrobras ao Mapa em 165 anos e teve como objetivo a articulação estratégica entre os setores agropecuário e energético no Brasil.

O ministro Fávaro ressaltou a importância do evento, destacando que a reunião “aproxima de forma concreta o agro e o setor de energia” no Brasil, evidenciando a relevância do agronegócio como motor estratégico da economia nacional. Fávaro também pontuou que o agronegócio terá um papel importante para a Petrobras nos próximos anos, colaborando mutuamente para o crescimento dos dois setores.

Durante a reunião, a Petrobras apresentou três frentes de atuação no agronegócio: originação de matérias-primas, polos de venda e comercialização direta com grandes consumidores. A presidente Magda Chambriard reforçou a visão estratégica da Petrobras, afirmando que “o futuro do Brasil é um futuro em que o agronegócio e o setor petrolífero caminham juntos”, enfatizando que ambos são pilares da economia brasileira.

Expansão e energias renováveis

A Petrobras tem buscado ampliar sua presença nas regiões do Centro-Oeste e MATOPIBA (Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí e Bahia), reconhecidas pela forte vocação agrícola. De acordo com o Mapa, a demanda por diesel nessas áreas mais que dobrou nos últimos anos devido ao crescimento do agronegócio. Durante o encontro, a estatal também destacou o potencial de expansão da infraestrutura logística, com foco no transporte dutoviário e ferroviário, além de alternativas para o escoamento da produção e o aumento da oferta de biocombustíveis como etanol de milho e biodiesel.

Em uma linha similar, Chambriard e Fávaro discutiram o aumento da produção desses combustíveis e o desenvolvimento de alternativas avançadas, como o Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) e o Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Esses biocombustíveis utilizam matérias-primas renováveis, incluindo óleos vegetais, gorduras animais e resíduos agrícolas, alinhando-se com a tendência mundial de energias limpas e renováveis.

Parcerias e colaborações estratégicas

Além da integração de energia renovável, o encontro também abordou as parcerias estabelecidas entre o Mapa, a Petrobras e a Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (Embrapa). Essas parcerias têm como objetivo ampliar a oferta de produtos e fornecer assistência técnica aos consumidores finais, por meio de cooperativas. Em colaboração com o Centro de Pesquisas Leopoldo Américo Miguez de Mello (Cenpes), as instituições estão desenvolvendo fertilizantes de alta eficiência, utilizando matérias-primas alternativas.

Magda Chambriard destacou o compromisso da Petrobras com essas iniciativas, afirmando: “Não estamos aqui para destruir nenhuma política pública. Pelo contrário, entendemos que esses investimentos foram necessários para valorizar o que temos de melhor: o petróleo e o agro”. A parceria entre o Mapa e a Petrobras no MATOPIBA teve início em março, após reuniões técnicas e visitas à região para fortalecer a presença da estatal no território e estabelecer articulações com associações e produtores rurais.

Industry leaders have just revealed during the Africa Energy Week (AEW) event in Cape Town, South Africa, running under the theme of ‘Invest in African Energies 2025.’

Emmanuelle Garinet, is the Vice President of Exploration Africa at TotalEnergies, who points out that Africa’s frontier basins hold significant volumes.

Garinet reveals that Namibia is an example of how seismic and subsurface data can de-risk projects.

“When we decided to drill the Venus well, it was frontier, but we had a probability of success of more than 50 percent because of the seismic data and direct hydrocarbon indicators,” says Garinet.

In the Republic of Congo, TotalEnergies’ exploration permitting process is moving at a markedly faster pace.

“We got our permit in less than six months and are preparing for drilling by the end of the year,” She said.

By contrast, South Africa’s permitting system has faced delays due to legal challenges, a problem she described as “unacceptable” given limited budgets for global exploration.

The Chief Executive at Chevron, Gavin Lewis, emphasized the critical role of comprehensive subsurface datasets in Africa.

“Before you can do any AI-driven workflows, you need a dataset that illuminates what the subsurface looks like,” he said.

“What Africa has lost is the ability to sponsor multi-client subsurface datasets. The only basin that allows for large, regional high-quality datasets is the Gulf of America, which has allowed that basin to reinvent itself multiple times.”

The Vice President of Exploration for BP, Bryan Ritchie, highlighted survey work in Egypt’s Nile Delta, where the company completed the first deepwater ocean-bottom node seismic survey over the Atoll field and noted that the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company plans to expand multi-client data coverage across a larger area of the delta.

‘We’re seeing new opportunities for these images,” he said.

Beyond exploration, Woodside Energy’s Vice President of Exploration, Terry Gebhardt, said geoscience and subsurface data are also key to carbon capture and storage projects, as well as “maximizing efficacy and recovery” in existing fields.

The panel discussion, sponsored by EnerGeo Alliance, also underlined the broader scale of investment in Africa’s oil and gas sector.

Nikki Martin, the Chief Executive Officer of EnerGeo Alliance, said African oil and gas capital expenditure is expected to rise to USD 54 billion by 2030, following a USD 6 billion surge in exploration spending in 2024.",https://tanzaniatimes.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/total-energy-chevron-in-africa-oil-exploration.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 13:56:49.855542

An estimated $100 billion in annual economic product and one million American employees are supported by regional aviation, making it a significant economic driver.
For people living in smaller towns, regional air travel provides quick access to urban amenities such as advanced healthcare and disaster relief.
A number of carriers have large fleets of turboprop aircraft.
Deutsche Aircraft D328eco The D328 combines solid speed with turboprop efficiency, making it ideal for rugged regional routes.","In the United States, the most common way that small airports stay connected with major hubs is through service with light jets. Many of those regional jets are made by Bombardier, Mitsubishi or, Embraer. Turboprop aircraft have not been the platform of choice for decades in the US, Europe, or Asia. Recently, that trend has shown signs of a shift as the rising need for environmentally sustainable and lower-cost aircraft may make turboprops the best choice in the coming years.

The DeHavilland Dash 8, ATR 42,, and the Deutsche Aircraft D328 are among the best examples of the resurging appeal that turboprop passenger haulers are seeing in the regional aviation market. The Bombardier Dash 8-400 is on the larger end, seating 80-90, and over a thousand examples have been produced for operators all over the world. Building on the legacy of the Dornier 328, the brand new D328eco seats a modest 40, but it has already proven its capability with the US Air Force, and the commercial production line is ramping up.

The likes of Embraer’s E-Jets and the Bombardier/Mitsubishi CRJ jet series may hold the dominant market share today, but as the oldest airframes begin to retire and the economics of jet operations get more difficult, an opening arises. Now we will dive into the key factors behind the new wave of turboprop hype that is driving demand for state-of-the-art models like the Dash 8 and D328.

The Prop Case

An airplane may be moved quite effectively with a propeller at the moderate speeds used for short regional flights (200 to 300 miles). It enables the engines to use a notably lower amount of fuel than the tiny jet engines seen on an Embraer 175 or CRJ-900. Since fuel is an airline's largest single-trip expense, the difference is key on the balance sheet.

Most of a regional flight is spent taxiing, climbing, and descending; the cruise portion, where the jet can stretch its legs, may last only fifteen minutes. A jet is likely to be only five or ten minutes ahead of propeller aircraft when they both arrive at the gate, which is negligible to offset the increased fuel consumption and ownership expenses.

Turboprops are also lighter and can operate from shorter runways. That gives airlines access to smaller airports with lower landing fees and lets them open routes that jets can’t serve economically. The initial cost of purchasing or renting a turboprop is also lower. Long-term maintenance costs can also be mitigated thanks to the ease and affordability of maintaining their engines and airframes. In a business notorious for razor-thin profit margins that can sink an airline, those numbers all add up to keep the bottom line in the black.

Keeping America Flying

In the US, regional flights are essential for linking rural and isolated communities to large cities and the national aviation network. Hundreds of small community airports depend on regional service. With smaller, more suitable aircraft, those carriers are essential in controlling traffic at large hubs, which reduces congestion. By expanding the reach of the national transportation system, these carriers provide accessibility for more localities. In addition to bridging remote regions, regional aviation enhances the nation's overall aviation infrastructure.

Larger airlines can expand their networks while keeping connections to low-traffic routes thanks to programs like American Eagle, Delta Connect, and United Express. An estimated $100 billion in annual economic product and one million American employees are supported by regional aviation, making it a significant economic driver. Regional aviation connects passengers to important hubs, promoting local travel, business, and tourism.

For people living in smaller towns, regional air travel provides quick access to urban amenities such as advanced healthcare and disaster relief. Regardless of the reason, regional flights drastically cut down on travel time and are often quicker and more practical than driving for short- to medium-distance travel.

Turboprops Around The World

Canada is characterized by large, sparsely inhabited regions with many isolated settlements that rely on air transportation. The Dash 8-400 is especially well-suited for connecting these smaller hubs to larger ones. For their regional networks, airlines like Porter Airlines and WestJet Encore make extensive use of the Dash 8-400. Canada is home to some of the world's busiest turboprop airports.

Turboprops are essential for improving connectivity in Southeast Asia and Oceania, regions with a large number of islands and frequently inadequate infrastructure. Indonesia, which has more than 17,000 islands, relies on turboprops extensively for flights between its islands, while the Philippines has a similar infrastructure.

The wide and varied topography of Africa, which includes several ""hot and high"" airports that favor turboprops, further highlights the usefulness of turboprops. A number of carriers have large fleets of turboprop aircraft. Ethiopian Airlines is one of the major operators of the Dash 8 in its domestic network, for example. Meanwhile, Brazil's extensive land territory and mature aviation network make turboprops an ideal choice for domestic flights, especially on shorter routes under 1,000 kilometers.

Australia and New Zealand use turboprops, much like in Canada or the US, to connect smaller fields with major hubs. The terrain of the two nations varies widely depending on the destination, which makes high reliability and performance under harsh conditions important. It can be tropical, “hot and high” or Alpine, depending on the itinerary.

In Europe, Norwegian Airlines uses a fleet of turboprops to navigate the difficult terrain of Norway, and Olympic Air uses turboprops for island-hopping flights in Greece. In the British Isles, turboprops are also used by airlines such as Aurigny in the Channel Islands and Loganair in Scotland. Operators in Malta and Spain's Canary Islands provide more evidence of the aircraft's applicability for short-distance flights across Europe.

Deutsche Aircraft D328eco

The D328 combines solid speed with turboprop efficiency, making it ideal for rugged regional routes. Airlines are able to serve airports in remote cities, mountains, and islands that are inaccessible to larger jets thanks to its innovative design. It has the quietest cabin in its class with pressurization and enlarged overhead bins. While fuel consumption and maintenance expenses remain modest, cruise speeds of about 300 miles per hour make it the fastest turboprop on the market.

It is powered by the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127XT engine and features the latest Garmin G5000 avionics in the cockpit. High reliability and low-maintenance cycles, with reduced costs per cycle, mean the plane has the lowest trip cost to operate in its class. Thomas Ahn, Chief Engineer of the D328eco at Deutsche Aircraft, remarked in a company statement earlier this May, saying:

“This is our moment to re-establish ourselves as a modern aircraft manufacturer with full system integration capabilities right here in Germany. We use advanced 3D modelling, seamless data sharing with suppliers, and state-of-the-art communication tools to enhance our development efficiency.”

The D328 is not only poised to be one of the most environmentally sustainable and affordable aircraft to fly, but its features and construction quality make it a “jack of all trades” that can support virtually any mission in the commercial, cargo, or specialized aviation markets. The plane will be competing to replace outgoing legacy models like the ATR 42 and Saab 340, matching the efficiency, capacity, and ruggedness of both in one package.

Deutsche Aircraft established its plant just outside Munich, in the historic home of Dornier, Oberpfaffenhofen. The first test aircraft is being assembled by a team of 550 staff with backgrounds from 40 different nations to create a plane that can fly on 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF-PtL). The 20-seat configuration is expected to have an impressive range of 1,772 nautical miles while the 40-seater will have a solid 621 nautical miles.

The Air Force’s Wolfhound

The main role of the C-146A Wolfhound is to support Theater Special Operations Commands by offering the US Special Operations Command the ability to deploy small teams and cargo in a flexible and rapid manner. Air Force Special Operations Command aircrews carry out airlift missions to semi-prepared airfields worldwide, which demands a rugged and reliable aircraft.

The C-146 has served in combatant commands on four continents, delivering troops and cargo on long-term deployments supporting continuous operations overseas. The aircraft has also been tailored to support medevac missions with defibrillators, cardiac monitoring equipment as well as hot and cold galley equipment. It is the first air ambulance aircraft with the capability to support Casevac and Medevac missions.

The D328 has succeeded in fulfilling the Air Force Special Operations Command’s (AFSOC) expectations since it entered service in 2011 as the Wolfhound. The airplane was even made to support intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and features an inflight operable door (IFOD) for free-fall parachute jumps. Deutsche Aircraft wants to transform that military track record into a launching pad for its commercial airframe to serve small communities all over the world just as well as it served the special forces.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/how-regional-turboprop-aircraft-are-making-a-comeback.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-04 12:56:21.370640

The commercial flight operations from Navi Mumbai Airport are expected to begin in December. The airport received its aerodrome licence from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on September 30.

The project is being developed in multiple phases by Navi Mumbai International Airport Ltd, with the Adani Group holding a 74 percent stake and the remaining 26 percent owned by the Maharashtra government’s City and Industrial Development Corporation (CIDCO).

“The second airport of Maha Mumbai — Navi Mumbai International Airport — is going to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on October 8,” CIDCO Vice Chairman and Managing Director Vijay Singhal told PTI after a media briefing.

According to Singhal, the Prime Minister will land at the new airport at around 2:40 pm and will spend nearly two hours at the facility. “The Prime Minister will first visit the terminal building, and then take a round of the terminal building, and then he will be addressing the audience,” he said.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has assigned the code ‘NMI’ to Navi Mumbai International Airport. Domestic carriers, including Air India Group, IndiGo, and Akasa Air have already announced plans to shift part of their flight operations to the new facility.

Spread across 1,160 hectares, the airport will have four terminals with a total passenger capacity of 90 million per annum and a cargo capacity of 3.25 million metric tonnes once fully completed, making it one of Asia’s largest aviation hubs.

“To begin with, we have completed terminal one, with a capacity of 20 million passengers per annum, 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo capacity and one runway,” Singhal said.

Currently, Mumbai International Airport handles around 55 million passengers annually. Once NMIA becomes fully operational, both airports together will manage nearly 150 million passengers per year.

“So, once this airport is fully completed, then these two airports together will cater to the almost 150 million passengers per annum, making the two airports a big aviation hub globally,” Singhal said.

He added that while Rs 19,647 crore has been spent on Phase 1, the total cost of completing all four terminals is expected to reach Rs 1 lakh crore.

Navi Mumbai International Airport will also be the first aerodrome in India to be connected by expressways, highways, metro lines, suburban rail, and even water taxi services.

“This is also a green airport as it has the storage facility for sustainable aviation fuel,” Singhal noted. He added that the facility will feature an Automated Passenger People’s Mover system to internally connect all four terminals.

According to recent updates from Hessenschau, ongoing weather disturbances, traffic congestion, and regional infrastructure works have collectively disrupted air travel, particularly affecting Lufthansa’s primary hub at Frankfurt Airport.

Lufthansa Battles Delays Amid Weather and Infrastructure Strain

Lufthansa flights experienced multiple delays over the past few days due to dense fog, technical maintenance on Frankfurt’s runways, and heavy passenger congestion. Frankfurt Airport, one of Europe’s busiest aviation hubs, continues to face operational strain as Lufthansa navigates increased travel demand following a record-breaking summer season.

Passengers reported waiting for hours for both departures and arrivals, with some domestic and short-haul European flights rescheduled to later slots. Lufthansa confirmed that it is “working closely with airport authorities to ensure smoother operations and minimize passenger inconvenience.”

While these temporary disruptions are not uncommon during seasonal transitions, Lufthansa’s operations have been particularly stretched by a surge in travel volume and parallel infrastructure issues on the ground, such as partial U-Bahn closures in Frankfurt and a recent A66 highway accident near Wiesbaden that delayed passengers en route to the airport.

Lufthansa Maintains Strong Recovery Post-Pandemic

Despite the turbulence, Lufthansa’s broader recovery story remains strong. The airline’s financial performance in the last quarter of 2025 showed a marked improvement, with revenues exceeding expectations thanks to higher premium cabin occupancy and growing corporate travel demand.

Industry analysts note that Lufthansa’s profitability in 2025 signals a solid rebound from the post-pandemic slump. However, operational reliability remains an ongoing challenge as the airline strives to balance expansion and service consistency.

CEO Carsten Spohr has emphasized Lufthansa’s continued commitment to innovation, sustainability, and digital transformation. The airline’s focus on modernizing its fleet and investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrates its long-term vision for responsible growth. “Our mission is to lead Europe in sustainable aviation while ensuring passengers experience world-class reliability,” Spohr said during a recent industry briefing.

Lufthansa Expands Long-Haul Network and Green Initiatives

Lufthansa’s strategic roadmap includes expanding its long-haul network to major business destinations in North America and Asia. The airline has also introduced next-generation aircraft designed to reduce carbon emissions and improve fuel efficiency.

In alignment with its sustainability goals, Lufthansa aims to cut its net carbon emissions by 50 percent by 2030. The company is investing in partnerships for sustainable aviation fuel production and exploring innovative carbon offset programs to reduce environmental impact.

Moreover, Lufthansa continues to enhance customer experience through digital check-in systems, improved in-flight connectivity, and revamped lounges across major airports. These advancements are intended to reinforce Lufthansa’s position as a premium global carrier and restore customer confidence amid recent delays.

Local Disruptions Add to Lufthansa’s Hurdles

Regional transport challenges in Hesse have compounded Lufthansa’s operational load. With partial suspension of U-Bahn lines U6 and U7 in Frankfurt for track maintenance, and ongoing road repairs on major routes leading to Frankfurt Airport, many passengers have struggled to reach terminals on time.

The A66 highway closure near Wiesbaden, following a multi-vehicle accident earlier this week, resulted in widespread traffic jams that caused dozens of travelers to miss their Lufthansa flights. The airline responded by accommodating affected passengers on later flights and offering flexible rebooking options.

Lufthansa’s Resilience Reflects Broader Aviation Recovery

Lufthansa’s continued growth amidst such logistical hurdles reflects the resilience of Europe’s aviation industry. The airline’s ability to maintain high load factors despite sporadic disruptions underscores the enduring demand for air travel in both leisure and business segments.

Experts predict that Lufthansa will continue to expand its fleet and route network throughout 2026, supported by growing international partnerships and a focus on operational efficiency. However, analysts caution that frequent disruptions—whether due to weather, maintenance, or infrastructure—could test passenger patience and brand loyalty.

Aviation analyst Markus Neumann commented, “Lufthansa’s recovery trajectory is impressive, but operational consistency must now be its top priority. Travelers are more discerning than ever, and reliability will define success in 2026.”

The Road Ahead for Lufthansa

Looking forward, Lufthansa’s management remains optimistic about achieving sustainable growth. The airline plans to invest in digital operations and AI-driven flight scheduling to mitigate delays and enhance passenger experience. Additionally, Lufthansa is strengthening its training programs for ground and air staff to ensure service excellence.

Despite temporary turbulence in operations, Lufthansa’s core fundamentals remain robust. With an expanding network, a strong sustainability agenda, and renewed passenger confidence, the airline is well-positioned to navigate current challenges and maintain its leadership in global aviation.

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) recently received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery, paving the way for domestic production.

The SAF blend will be developed using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) method, relying on feedstock such as used cooking oil and agricultural residue like rice straw (parali).

Delhi was selected for the pilot as IOC’s Panipat refinery already supplies aviation turbine fuel (ATF) to the airport via a dedicated pipeline.

“That is the beauty of SAF. You don’t have to change the infrastructure to implement it. It’s like fossil fuel,” said the Deputy Director of the Environment Branch, Air Transport Bureau, at the UN body International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), as quoted by The Hindu BusinessLine.

Hupe noted that India’s existing fuel distribution pipeline is a major asset, reducing the need for costly new infrastructure.

“The infrastructure they already have to produce and distribute fuel to the airport can also be used for SAF, and that’s a big plus for this technology,” she told businessline.

SAF is central to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a global effort to reduce aviation emissions. The scheme is being implemented in three phases, with voluntary participation from 2021 to 2026.

India has opted out of the voluntary phase but will begin offsetting obligations for international carriers under CORSIA from 2027. The scheme applies to international flights between two countries.

To meet these future obligations, the Indian government plans to introduce SAF blending targets in aviation fuel. These start with a 1% SAF blend in ATF in 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, and 5% by 2030.

The Gazette asked all candidates: What strategies would you pursue to strengthen collaboration with neighbouring municipalities and regional partners, and how would these efforts improve services or economic development in Sturgeon County?

Each mayoral candidate in Sturgeon County had 350 words to answer the question.

Patrick Tighe: I believe we have services within the county area that could become regional with minimal changes in service to the residents, but provide better value.

For example, the Roseridge Landfill Site for solid household waste (garbage) provides this service for the entire county region, as well as other areas.

Fire and Protective Services is another area that could be regionalized with little service disruption. By reducing existing boundaries and establishing a connected community fire response instead of isolated fire stations, we would have improved services and potentially lowered insurance premiums. Strategic locations for equipment and trained personnel would provide a much-improved collaborative approach to emergencies that would benefit residents both in response time as well as cost effectiveness.

Utilities is another area that could be regionalized for improved services. Again, reducing standalone services and establishing a regional approach would provide better equipment, tools and skill levels that would bring efficiencies and cost effectiveness to all residents in time of need.

Economic development using models like Strathcona, Lac La Biche, and West Hants’ Regional Municipality, N.S., would improve Sturgeon County. Having the right location for the right developments, providing a streamlined and welcoming approach for new and existing businesses in Sturgeon County would benefit all and bring prosperity for the future.

Alanna Hnatiw: I will continue the successful strategies developed over the past eight years. We have increased awareness and momentum around the Villeneuve Airport Area. Much of this can be attributed to the relationships developed with neighbouring stakeholders through the creation of the Villeneuve Landing Network. We have partnered with towns and cities, post-secondary and academic institutions, First Nations, Métis nations, business associations and the provincial government to assess the economic development opportunities and inform the Area Structure Plan that was approved in 2024. This initiative has increased investment interest and supported the Sturgeon Public School Division’s successful application for an Aviation Collegiate at the Villeneuve Airport. This partnership between the school and the Edmonton Airport Authority was a direct result of our successful strategy of advocacy and relationship building. There are immense opportunities at the Villeneuve Airport for pilot training, aviation mechanics, machine repair and overhaul, autonomous aircraft development, sustainable aviation fuel, aerospace defence and advanced materials manufacturing.

I initiated the update of the Sturgeon Regional Partnership where Sturgeon county and the mayors of the five towns within our borders meet regularly and have our administrations foster organizational efficiency and effectiveness without the creation of unnecessary bureaucracy. The guiding principles of our partnership is to support local autonomy while emphasizing that local goals can often best be achieved through regional cooperation and partnerships. We commit to explore opportunities to improve the delivery of service through cooperative efforts and promote regional prosperity and economic development through partnerships and collaboration.

Sturgeon County has worked collaboratively with the Alberta Industrial Heartland Association and the provincial government on the creation of the first Designated Industrial Zone in Alberta. Through this designation and collaboration, we have received grant dollars towards Phase One of the Industrial Heartland Process Water Initiative.

KLM and KLM Cityhopper are testing a suite of innovative measures to reduce the environmental impact of their flights as part of the 2025 edition of The Aviation Challenge (TAC), the annual SkyTeam initiative promoting sustainable aviation.

From AI-driven water calculations to filtered seawater, the airline is exploring solutions that can be scaled into daily operations to reduce the impact on the environment.

Cutting emissions through innovation

Among the trials, KLM is using an AI model to predict the exact amount of water required onboard, helping to cut weight and emissions.

Pilots are testing flight optimisation tools designed to minimise fuel consumption, while business class passengers are encouraged to pre-select meals to reduce food waste.

Filtered seawater bottles are being introduced to replace standard bottled water, and passengers contributing to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) receive priority boarding.

Digital boarding passes, which have already cut paper usage by 84%, continue to be promoted.

The focus this year is broader than in previous trials, covering multiple flights rather than a single showcase route.

From 4 to 10 October, selected services include Amsterdam to Rome on the new Airbus A321neo, Amsterdam to Nairobi on an undisclosed aircraft type, and Amsterdam to Kraków on KLM Cityhopper’s Embraer E195-E2.

Reducing aviation’s environmental footprint

Alongside the passenger-facing initiatives, the airline is testing lighter catering equipment, smarter cargo loading strategies, and electric pushback vehicles.

The challenge, inspired by the historic 1934 London-to-Melbourne air race, now seeks to reduce aviation’s environmental footprint while sharing best practices across SkyTeam carriers.

“KLM acknowledges its environmental and climate impact and recognises the limits of what the planet can sustain. Action is required to operate within these limits,” the airline said.

KLM is also linking its sustainability work with social impact through Wings of Support, the volunteer-run foundation supporting local projects at KLM destinations.

In Nairobi, for example, the Big Five Center teaches children trades and vocational skills to improve long-term prospects in underserved communities.

KLM announced the programme on the same day that it unveiled its first Airbus A350 simulator in the Netherlands, marking a significant step in preparing for the arrival of the A350 aircraft, which will join the fleet at the end of 2026.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/KLM-Airbus-A321neo-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:31.804193

And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built.
Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade.
If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.
Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.","Nearly a century ago, George Norris, a great United States senator, made the case for electrifying rural America.

“These young men and young women, America’s farmers of the future, observing all the wonders of the modern age of electricity, will not be content with the homes of earlier America,” Norris wrote in his autobiography. “Unless those homes in the countrysides are lighted electrically and equipped with the devices electricity provides — for comfort, convenience and efficiency — they will not be content. They will have been trained in the colleges and universities of this country for the most efficient agricultural methods, and electricity will be a part of their lives.”

He understood that without modern infrastructure, Nebraska couldn’t keep its young people, modernize agriculture or grow its economy. Electricity was the thread connecting it all.

Today, the challenge is similar but bigger. Nebraska’s economic future is tied to powering the next generation of industries, many of which are rooted in agriculture. Gov. Jim Pillen’s “Silicon Valley of the bioeconomy” vision calls for transforming our crops into sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, bioplastics, fertilizer, enzymes and other high-value products. These facilities will create new markets for farmers, jobs in rural communities and a larger state tax base.

But they will also demand vast amounts of electricity. Without new generation, transmission and grid capacity, we can’t fully realize that vision. And without deep community support for energy projects — including renewable energy facilities — the generation we need may never be built. This tension is as urgent as the conflicts in our communities over building sufficient housing to address our housing shortages and rising costs.

Nebraska’s energy demand is projected to grow nearly 20% over the next decade. In the last few years, demand projections have been revised upward annually. That’s from bioeconomy projects, information technology, advanced manufacturing and more. Our public power providers are planning and investing for growth. But local resistance to building energy projects can slow or stop development that is vital to meeting the state’s generation needs.

Here’s where the dots connect:

• Communities want rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization.

• The bioeconomy, which creates domestic markets for domestic producers, needs abundant energy to operate, as do the advanced manufacturing facilities that anchor employment bases.

• Building renewable projects, transmission lines, natural gas turbines and the nuclear tech of tomorrow unlock demand and create the rural jobs, tax revenue and revitalization described above.

If the last dot is missing, the picture breaks apart. If we turn away wind, solar or other generation projects that want to locate here, we may inadvertently turn away the bioeconomy and manufacturing investments they help power.

The benefits of welcoming energy development are real and visible across Nebraska.

Nebraska’s nameplate capacity tax on renewables generates millions of dollars each year for schools, roads and other public services. Large projects diversify the local tax base, reduce reliance on property taxes and create a stable revenue stream communities can control.

Construction and operational jobs inject new spending into the local economy, and, in many cases, towns with a local option sales tax see millions in new revenue from major projects. Look at northeast Nebraska, where inviting generation has led to a flywheel of growth and revitalization in cities like Norfolk.

The Nebraska Chamber works alongside our public utilities, private developers, local leaders and the agricultural community. We believe in an “all-of-the-above” energy approach — not just because it’s good policy, but because it’s the only realistic way to connect the dots between Nebraska’s growth ambitions and the infrastructure needed to support them.

George Norris fought to bring electricity to every corner of Nebraska, because he knew it would change the trajectory of rural life. In our time, the fight is to ensure we have enough generation to keep our state competitive, our communities strong and opportunities here at home.

We grow it here. We can process it here. But only if we power it here. It won’t be easy. These emotional discussions invoke our sense of place, conservation and unfortunately in some instances, partisanship. I believe we can work together, connect the dots and make Nebraska’s next century as bright as the last.

Ltd., announced on October 1 that they have signed an agreement to explore a worldwide partnership, reports Biodiesel magazine.

Their goal is to solve a major problem in the industry: the difficult and inefficient process of getting sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, from producers to airplanes. Currently, mixing SAF with traditional fuel usually happens only at large production sites, which isn’t very flexible. Most fuel terminals and airports don’t have the right equipment or approvals for this mixing process.

Together, the companies plan to create a complete solution. They will combine XCF’s knowledge in building SAF production systems with FlyORO’s unique, portable blending technology, called AlphaLite. This system is designed to be set up either at airports or before fuel reaches them. The collaboration aims to make it easier and more cost-effective for airports and airlines to start using SAF.

The need for solutions like this is growing quickly. By 2030, the worldwide market for SAF is predicted to be worth more than $25 billion, with demand expected to be over 5.5 billion gallons. New and flexible mixing technologies will be essential to connect fuel producers with airports and airlines globally.

This potential partnership fits with XCF’s plan to expand internationally using a modular and efficient approach. Teaming up with FlyORO would help XCF offer a more complete service, managing everything from producing the fuel to blending and delivering it around the world.

Mihir Dange, the head of XCF Global, stated, “This partnership could change how the aviation industry approaches SAF. Blending is a crucial part of the process that affects how quickly SAF can be adopted. By combining FlyORO’s technology with our global strategy, we are building a way to speed up its use, lower costs, and create new opportunities for everyone involved.”

Damian Mc Loughlin, a leader at FlyORO, added, “Our goal has always been to remove the obstacles to using SAF. Our portable AlphaLite system makes blending more adaptable and affordable. By working with XCF, we can bring this solution to airports and airlines worldwide, enabling faster and smarter deployment of clean fuel.”

This agreement shows the companies’ shared commitment to making clean aviation fuel more widely used. The final partnership depends on further reviews and the signing of formal contracts.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:47.848057

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel.
Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.
“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel.
It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027.","New Delhi: India will soon start a test program to supply a new type of eco-friendly airplane fuel at the Indira Gandhi International Airport in Delhi, reports The Hindu businessline.

This sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is a cleaner alternative to regular jet fuel. It is made from renewable sources or waste materials. The Indian Oil Corporation has recently been approved to make this fuel at its refinery in Panipat.

The fuel will be created using materials like used cooking oil and farm waste such as rice straw. Delhi was selected for this test because the Panipat refinery already supplies regular airplane fuel to the airport through a direct pipeline.

A major benefit of this new fuel is that it can be used with existing airport equipment and fuel systems.

“The great thing about this fuel is that you don’t need to change any of the current equipment to start using it. It works just like regular fuel,” said Jane Hupe, a deputy director at the International Civil Aviation Organization, a UN body.

She highlighted that India’s existing pipeline network is a significant advantage because it means no expensive new transportation systems are required.

“The system they already have to make and deliver fuel to the airport can also be used for this new eco-friendly fuel. That’s a major benefit,” Hupe added.

Globally, this kind of fuel is important for a UN plan to reduce pollution from international flights. This plan is being introduced in stages, and countries can choose to join voluntarily until 2026.

India has decided not to take part in these early voluntary phases. However, starting in 2027, Indian airlines operating international flights will need to follow the plan’s rules.

To prepare, the Indian government has set initial goals. It plans to mix 1% of this eco-friendly fuel with regular airplane fuel in 2027. This would increase to 2% in 2028 and reach 5% by 2030.

The government is also creating a full policy to encourage the production and use of this sustainable fuel.

Last month, India’s Civil Aviation Minister, K. Ram Mohan Naidu, stated that India has a natural edge in this area.

“Our location helps us become an exporter, and we also have huge amounts of raw materials available,” the Minister said.

Currently, India has more than 750 million tonnes of biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of extra farm waste that can be used to produce this green fuel.

“India has the potential to become a world leader in making this fuel,” the Minister said. He added that India is expected to produce more of this fuel than it needs, allowing it to become a major supplier to other countries.

India already exports half of the regular airplane fuel it produces.

“It makes sense for us to focus on this, given our dedication to a cleaner environment,” he said.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SAF-01.jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:56:55.657360

The university co-organized the event alongside the Ministry of Energy Transition, IRESEN, Green H2 Cluster, and MASEN. UM6P participated through its subsidiary Green Energy Park (GEP) and its affiliated venture builder INNOVX, which operates HydroJeel, a green hydrogen and ammonia production company.

The university’s involvement in the summit reflects its end-to-end role in Morocco’s hydrogen ecosystem. UM6P runs physical platforms, including the Green H2A facility at Jorf Lasfar, a joint UM6P-IRESEN-OCP platform with 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity producing 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

It also operates a micro-pilot system at the Green Energy Park in Benguerir, Morocco’s first installed green hydrogen production system.

The summit focused on bankability, offtake contracts, certification, and export readiness. Key sessions included a high-level plenary on securing offtake with H2Global and MASEN, and panels on decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and road transport.

Morocco has earmarked up to one million hectares of public land for green hydrogen projects, with five investors pre-selected in March 2025 for six projects worth approximately $31.9 billion.

Research and development drive Morocco’s energy transition

Hicham Lalaoui Moutarajji, Pedagogical Manager at UM6P’s Laboratory of Inorganic Materials for Sustainable Energy Technologies (LIMSET), told Morocco World News (MWN) that the university operates along two main axes: research and innovative projects addressing Morocco’s energy sovereignty.

“We work on innovative projects, carrying out R&D to find sustainable energy solutions that address Morocco’s energy sovereignty and ensure a flexible and efficient energy transition for both Morocco and Africa,” Lalaoui Moutarajji explained.

The laboratory translates research into practical applications. Its work covers green hydrogen, batteries for energy storage, and various industrial applications. These research outcomes feed directly into teaching programs designed for both junior professionals seeking upskilling and senior executives requiring specialized training.

“The essential goal is to guarantee this transfer of knowledge and expertise to future Moroccan generations, enabling them to meet both national and global challenges in this domain,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

UM6P’s research infrastructure includes partnerships with Argonne National Laboratory for collaboration on green energy technology and grids.

The university has signed agreements to run electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy on its campus. A recent memorandum with OCP SBU Mining and EDF aims to use green hydrogen for “green drying” and mobility trials at UM6P’s Mining ARC in Benguerir.

Co-founded by UM6P and IRESEN, the Green Energy Park serves as a testing ground for photovoltaics, storage systems, smart grids, and hydrogen applications. Research groups at UM6P have published work on alkaline hydrogen production systems and novel materials for electrochemical devices.

Published studies examine control of solar variability, thermal integration, and efficiency mapping in kilowatt-scale systems. UM6P’s ACER and LIMSET teams focus on materials and devices for hydrogen production and reversible electrochemical systems.

Executive training prepares workforce for hydrogen economy

The university offers an executive master’s degree in green hydrogen that has reached its third cohort. The twelve-month program covers the entire hydrogen value chain through intensive one-week sessions for each module. Participants engage in practical workshops, case studies, and sessions with international experts.

“This executive master’s runs over twelve months, structured around intensive one-week sessions for each module,” Lalaoui Moutarajji noted. The curriculum addresses fundamentals, emerging technologies, including SWAC, alkaline, PEM, and AEM electrolysis, along with energy storage challenges.

The program includes modules on safety, health, and security. “Integrating a safety module is essential – a key ingredient for the success of the program and for the concrete realization of hydrogen projects,” Lalaoui Moutarajji stated.

Project structuring and technical aspects of developing hydrogen facilities form another core component. The program draws participants from Morocco’s major industrial entities, including OCP, GESA, INNOVX, UM6P, and the Public Laboratory for Testing and Studies. The current cohort includes international professionals from Mauritania and Tunisia.

“Individuals recognized the value of enrolling in this unique executive master’s – the only one of its kind in Morocco and the Arab world – and who see its potential to contribute to success across the African continent,” Lalaoui Moutarajji said.

Training timelines align with Morocco’s industrial ambitions. An engineer requires five years of training to operate new hydrogen facilities. Programs at UM6P, Green Energy Park, and national academic partners prepare the workforce for units expected to become operational between 2027 and 2032.

The university’s approach combines theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience at pilot facilities. Students gain exposure to real-world challenges in hydrogen production, storage, and application across different industrial sectors.

Industrial decarbonization links CO₂ and hydrogen strategies

Abdelghafour Zaabout, Associate Professor at UM6P’s Applied Chemistry and Engineering Research (ACER) Center of Excellence, specializing in decarbonization technologies, described his work on hard-to-abate industries. He told MWN that the university prepares technologies respecting Morocco’s specific industrial context.

“At UM6P, we do several things basically that are linked to preparing first through training and education, but second as well through R&D development so that we can prepare the technologies that can lead the decarbonization,” Zaabout explained.

The connection between carbon capture and hydrogen production forms a central element of the strategy. Zaabout outlined how captured CO₂ from specific industries can combine with hydrogen to create green molecules.

“The CO₂ that has been captured from specific industries to decarbonize can be combined with the hydrogen to make green molecules,” he said.

This approach positions CO₂ as an enabler rather than merely a waste product. “The CO₂ is an enabler of the hydrogen economy,” Zaabout noted. The university works extensively on identifying which technologies suit Morocco’s hard-to-decarbonize industries.

UM6P trains chemical engineers and process engineers to understand fundamental mechanisms underlying these technologies. The educational philosophy emphasizes economic viability alongside technical feasibility.

“We create the mindset that they can understand that no technological development for solving specific challenges can be made unless those technologies create an economic value for society and impact for society itself,” Zaabout stated.

The university’s decarbonization work connects directly to OCP’s green investment program and ENGIE-OCP frameworks for renewables and green ammonia feasibility. UM6P and HydroJeel provide research, pilots, and talent development supporting these broader industrial initiatives.

Renewable energy competitiveness determines hydrogen viability

Mohamed Bousseta, CEO of Green Energy Park, stressed renewable energy’s role in hydrogen economics. Speaking to MWN, he explained that competitiveness drives the entire ecosystem’s success.

“Renewable energy accounts for 70% of competitiveness in green hydrogen production. In other words, to produce one kilogram of competitive green hydrogen, 70% of the cost comes from the LCOE – the levelized cost of energy,” Bousseta said.

Green Energy Park serves as a research, innovation, and training center for renewable energies, particularly photovoltaics, thermal and electrochemical storage, energy efficiency, smart grids, and modeling. The facility operates as a UM6P and IRESEN subsidiary.

Meanwhile, the Green H2A platform under construction at Jorf Lasfar will test new technologies at scale. The facility features 4 megawatts of electrolysis capacity split between 2 megawatts PEM and 2 megawatts alkaline systems. It will produce 4 tons of green ammonia daily.

“The platform will have emulators designed to test profiles specific to southern Morocco, where the majority of industrial projects will be implemented,” Bousseta explained. These emulators allow testing under conditions matching actual deployment sites.

Bousseta pointed out that demonstrators prove critical for ecosystem development. “Because if we want to successfully develop this ecosystem, competitiveness is absolutely key. Competitiveness means achieving a competitive price, and that requires innovation across all domains,” he said.

Innovation must span renewable energy generation, hydrogen production technologies, and applications. The process includes electrolysis for splitting water molecules, nitrogen production, and ammonia synthesis combining hydrogen and nitrogen.

From pilots to industrial scale through venture building

UM6P’s approach extends beyond traditional academic boundaries into venture creation and industrial scale-up. INNOVX, the university’s affiliated venture builder, established HydroJeel specifically to execute green hydrogen and ammonia projects for OCP and export markets.

Operated by HydroJeel, the Jorf Hydrogen Platform targets 100,000 tons per year of green ammonia in its first phase. The project received a €30 million grant from Germany’s PtX Development Fund, administered by KfW and KGAL, to advance the demonstrator.

Morocco’s “Morocco Offer” policy framework, launched in March 2024, provides up to one million hectares of public land for hydrogen projects. The first 300,000 hectares entered active development. In March 2025, the steering committee pre-selected five investors for six projects valued at 319 billion dirhams across three southern regions.

Projects span green ammonia, e-fuels, and green steel production. TotalEnergies studies a 200,000-ton-per-year green ammonia export project near Guelmim-Oued Noun. OCP and ENGIE signed a multi-billion-euro memorandum covering renewables, green molecules, and desalination.

Tarfaya represents a scaling pathway with renewable ammonia production targeting approximately one million tons per year by 2027, expanding to three million tons by 2032. The project obtained renewable fuels of non-biological origin pre-certification, positioning it for European Union market access.

UM6P’s Green H2A facility partners with Proton Ventures of the Netherlands for turnkey pilot installation. The dual electrolyzer configuration with renewable load emulation creates a world-reference pilot setup. The system allows testing under variable solar and wind profiles matching southern Morocco conditions.

Process-use cases focus on mining applications where OCP operations provide immediate demand. Green hydrogen can replace fossil fuels for drying processes and mobile equipment. These anchor applications address the critical challenge of securing customers before production begins.

Strategic partnerships accelerate technology transfer and scale

International partnerships strengthen UM6P’s capabilities across the hydrogen value chain. The university signed a memorandum with 247Solar to study green hydrogen and ammonia production pathways linked to solar thermal and power platforms.

Partnerships with equipment manufacturers bring cutting-edge technology to Moroccan soil. Electrolyzer pilots with Chariot and Oort Energy allow testing of different system architectures under local conditions. The OCP SBU Mining partnership with EDF demonstrates process integration in industrial settings.

The Argonne National Laboratory collaboration provides access to high-performance computing, advanced materials research, and systems integration expertise. This connection accelerates the translation from laboratory research to operational plants.

Morocco’s geographic position supports export-oriented projects. Ports including Jorf Lasfar, Dakhla, and facilities near Guelmim offer Atlantic access to European and global markets. Summit discussions on port readiness and export corridors included Port of Rotterdam participation, signaling concrete logistics planning.

Since its establishment in 2024, Germany’s climate and energy alliance with Morocco positions the kingdom as a key supplier for European hydrogen demand. This framework provides policy backing for long-term offtake agreements and project financing.

“The government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity,” Bernama reported him saying.
“Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to standards such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System (SKN), which improve transparency and accountability.” Dr Ahmad Parveez said these efforts are critical to counteract negative campaigns in key export markets and assure buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious demands.
On improving yields, he proposed a 100 per cent reinvestment allowance (RA) for oil palm replanting to accelerate the replacement of ageing trees.
Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency.” Prime Minister and Finance Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim is expected to table Budget 2026 in Parliament on 10 October.","THE Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB) has urged the government to introduce targeted fiscal and policy incentives in Budget 2026 to strengthen the palm oil industry’s competitiveness, improve productivity, and advance its sustainability credentials.

MPOB director-general Datuk Dr Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir said support for trade promotion, branding, and replanting was essential to maintain Malaysia’s global standing amid tightening international sustainability standards and evolving consumer preferences.

“The government should intensify trade promotion and branding initiatives to position Malaysian palm oil as a sustainable, climate-smart commodity,” Bernama reported him saying. “Stronger branding reinforces Malaysia’s commitment to standards such as the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification and the National Traceability System (SKN), which improve transparency and accountability.”

Dr Ahmad Parveez said these efforts are critical to counteract negative campaigns in key export markets and assure buyers that Malaysian palm oil meets climate-conscious demands.

He also called for greater fiscal support to accelerate the growth of downstream sectors, including oleochemicals, specialty fats, bioenergy, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which he described as key to ensuring long-term resilience.

“We urge more strategic support for logistics efficiency, including incentives for greener and lower-cost export solutions,” he added, noting that such efforts would address both current cost pressures and long-term positioning in global markets.

On improving yields, he proposed a 100 per cent reinvestment allowance (RA) for oil palm replanting to accelerate the replacement of ageing trees. “This initiative is expected to increase the oil palm replanting rate from 2.5 per cent, or 101,809 hectares, to 5.1 per cent, or 210,000 hectares annually.”

He called for RM280 million in dedicated funding under Budget 2026 to support replanting programmes for independent smallholders. “Recognising the urgent need to rejuvenate ageing plantations, the government remains committed to supporting independent smallholders,” he said.

A further RM100 million soft loan scheme was proposed to support small and medium-sized estates in undertaking replanting without undue financial strain. “In the medium to long term, this initiative will boost national crude palm oil (CPO) production through higher-yielding varieties and improved farm management.”

Dr Ahmad Parveez also recommended imposing a three per cent export duty on refined, bleached and deodorised (RBD) palm stearin to ensure sufficient domestic supply for the oleochemical sector, alongside a 10–20 per cent duty on the export of waste oils, such as used cooking oil (UCO) and palm oil mill effluent (POME oil), to promote local utilisation.

“These measures would support local production, encourage compliance with sustainability certification schemes such as MSPO and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), and help transition the sector towards a circular, greener economy.”

He said Budget 2026 presents a timely opportunity to help the sector overcome external challenges, from trade restrictions to labour shortages, while strengthening its long-term productivity and market resilience.

“The focus should be on strengthening sustainability compliance through universal MSPO adoption and robust traceability systems,” he added. “Compliance with global environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards is vital to safeguard Malaysia’s position in international markets. Incentives for mechanisation, digitalisation and precision agriculture would further help reduce reliance on manual labour and improve operational efficiency.”

Alongside automotive and other industries, it has positioned Mexico as a global manufacturing powerhouse. But the era of industries operating in silos is ending. Driven by megatrends such as decarbonization, electrification, artificial intelligence, and supply chain resilience, the boundaries between sectors are dissolving.

In fact, this convergence is not only a global phenomenon, but it also represents one of Mexico’s greatest opportunities. By embracing cross-industry synergies, the country can move from being an assembler of global supply chains to becoming a true designer of innovation. The challenge is no longer whether these industries will intersect, but how Mexico can leverage their overlap to shape the future of mobility.

Aerospace and Automotive: Shared roads to Electrification and Autonomy

Few countries combine a robust aerospace presence with an equally strong automotive base. Mexico does both. Some regions in our country have become hubs for advanced aerospace engineering and manufacturing, while other regions anchor the automotive supply chain.

The parallels are striking. The automotive industry’s leap into electric vehicles and batteries offers valuable lessons for aerospace: Hybrid-Electric aircraft, eVTOLs, and Advanced Urban Air Mobility will depend on many of the same technologies. Lightweight materials and composites pioneered in car design are equally critical for next-generation aircraft. Similarly, autonomous driving systems share DNA with AI-driven flight safety and air traffic control.

If Mexico aligns its supply chains and innovation agendas, it could lead in developing the integrated mobility solutions of the future, in other words, where wings meet the wheels.

Aerospace and Energy: Powering the future of Sustainable Flight

The energy transition is rewriting the rules of the aerospace industry. Decarbonization requires breakthroughs in sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen propulsion, and new infrastructure. Here, Mexico’s energy landscape offers untapped potential.

Solar projects in the state of Sonora, and wind corridors in the state of Oaxaca could power the production of green hydrogen in Mexico, which will be as important for aviation as it will be for other transportation modes.

Mexico’s agricultural and petrochemical base could support SAF production, turning the country into a potential hub for clean aviation fuels. Airports themselves could evolve into microgrids that supply renewable energy to aircraft and surrounding cities.

Partnerships between the government, global energy firms, and Mexico’s airlines and MRO networks could unlock synergies that accelerate sustainable aviation across the Latin America region.

Aerospace and Digital: AI, Data, and Industry 4.0

The digital revolution is blurring the boundaries between aerospace and other industries. Predictive maintenance, and AI-enabled systems are already transforming how fleets are operated and maintained.

Mexico’s IT hubs like Guadalajara, Monterrey and Mexico City provide a talent base that can bridge aerospace with other adjacent industries. Cybersecurity lessons from financial services can protect aircraft systems, Big Data and Analytics can optimize flight operations as much as they improve medical diagnostics.

This digital layer represents a great opportunity for Mexico to position itself not just as a manufacturing powerhouse, but as a designer of integrated, AI-driven mobility systems.

The Role of Industry Clusters: Living Labs for Synergies and Experimentation

Mexico’s industry clusters would be at the heart of this transformation.

To unlock synergies, these clusters must evolve from isolated centers of excellence into interconnected living labs where industries converge.

Clusters also play a vital role in workforce development. By aligning their educational programs, technical institutes, and research centers, they can build cross-sector talent pipelines that prepare engineers and technicians to work at the intersection of aerospace, automotive, and energy. In this way, clusters can act as catalysts for Mexico’s evolution from assembler to innovator.

Caveats and Conditions: Turning vision into reality

The opportunities above are real, but so are the challenges. For our country to transform potential into real leadership, several conditions must be addressed:

Energy policy alignment: Investors in renewables, SAF, and hydrogen need long-term clarity. Establishing clear incentives and stable regulatory frameworks will be key to unlocking the full potential of Mexico’s diverse energy resources.

Infrastructure modernization: Today’s refineries, electricity grids, and logistics networks are not prepared for large-scale SAF production or hydrogen distribution. Airports aspiring to become renewable microgrids also face significant challenges. A national plan for modernization is needed to align physical infrastructure with the innovation agenda.

R&D and IP protection: Mexico needs to increase investment in applied research, ensuring strong intellectual property frameworks, so that innovations developed locally generate local value. Protecting and commercializing locally developed IP, while aligning programs such as the National System of Researchers (SNI) with industrial priorities is critical.

Cross-industry governance: Isolated pilot projects are not enough. Mexico requires permanent mechanisms for collaboration among clusters, government agencies, academia, and industry. These governance platforms would ensure synergies move from isolated efforts to coordinated national strategies.

Talent development: Universities and technical institutes are producing strong engineers, but curricula remain industry specific. To lead in converging fields like electrified propulsion, AI-enabled mobility, and hydrogen systems, Mexico needs accelerated programs that cut across multiple industries.

Without these critical enablers, the vision of Mexico as a cross-industry innovation hub will remain aspirational. With them, it becomes a realistic path to competitiveness.

The industries of the future will not succeed in isolation. Industries like Aerospace, Automotive, and Digital are converging into a single innovation frontier, and Mexico is well positioned in all of them.

What Mexico needs now is the discipline to align policies, modernize infrastructure, accelerate talent, and institutionalize cross-industry collaboration. If these conditions are met, Mexico will not just assemble the technologies of tomorrow—it will design them, integrate them, and export them to the world.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/pictures/2025-03/GE-Infrastructure-Queretaro-IMG-2021-Alberto-Robles-1-apd-MBN.jpg?h=aa4588f2&itok=HTLWHtIx,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:24.344417

US-based startup Otto Aerospace is behind the Jetsons-like plane, called the Phantom 3500. It features a teardrop-shaped fuselage that significantly reduces fuel consumption and increases range, as well as screens in place of traditional windows.

Its first flight is scheduled for 2027, with delivery expected in 2030.

There is one caveat: this is an all-new, clean-sheet aircraft type that has yet to be built and certified. The question of whether it delivers on time remains uncertain, as new concepts often take longer than initially planned.

Still, Flexjet CEO Michael Silvestro told Business Insider that while development hurdles are possible, the company is fully committed to innovation and is seeking manufacturers willing to move the needle in ways the industry has not yet seen.

""Otto impressed us. The technology is incredibly efficient and very capable in terms of size, speed range, comfort, fuel flow, and sustainability, so why not?"" he said. ""Why not think about continuing to push the envelope on the latest technological advances in aviation?""

The move comes as the private aviation industry continues to boom post-pandemic, with more and more people — particularly young professionals in their 40s — flocking to the luxuries of business aviation.

Yes, there are no windows

Besides the cockpit, the new nine-seater Phantom 3500 will be windowless. Instead, large screens will blanket the passenger cabin walls and ceiling.

Silvestro said these ""smart windows"" are designed to do several things, such as imitating what's going on outside or creating your own virtual images. He added that the goal is that clients could put anything they want on the screen — including movies or videos.

Getting rid of the windows helps smooth out the fuselage, reducing drag and fuel burn. Silvestro said Otto will have to figure out the logistics of seeing outside the aircraft during emergency events, like an engine fire.

""Now we have cameras everywhere on the airplanes, on the larger ones in particular, so there would have to be a pretty robust video ability to see what's going on outside,"" he said.

Despite potential deterrents like claustrophobia, Silvestro said he expects the revolutionary design to attract clients in the long term.

However, he said Flexjet's younger and more technically advanced customers, who are more open to change, would be the early adopters.

""It's just like anything else, like Waymo is going everywhere,"" he said as an example of other futuristic innovations. ""I think as you get a little bit more comfortable with technology, that unnerves people, and it will become more of the norm.""

The futuristic tech comes as more young people fly private

Flexjet's bet on Otto comes as Silvestro pointed to an increase in young people flying private. This demographic is particularly more inclined to welcome futuristic tech like the Phantom 3500.

""The demographic is trending so much younger than it used to be,"" he said. ""We're capturing a good 10 years' worth of flyers; people in their 40s who can afford this are all in with regard to flying privately, and fractional ownership is the most desirable part.""

Once in service, the Phantom 3500 will become part of Flexjet's popular and ever-growing ""fractional ownership"" program.

This allows high-net-worth clients to enjoy the luxury and privacy of a private jet without owning one outright. Instead, they share one by purchasing flight hours.

It's essentially a timeshare for private flying and has become an increasingly attractive way to travel as billionaires like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, and Taylor Swift continue to battle jet trackers.

Data from Aviation Week's aircraft tracking tool indicates that the program is being used more than ever, with fractional ownership increasing by 10% between June and August compared to the same period in 2024, and by 70% compared to the same period in 2019.

What else does Flexjet get for $19.5 million

The Phantom 3500 is being developed as a super-midsized jet, competing with similar-sized planes such as the Bombardier Challenger 350 or the Embraer Praetor 600.

These jets typically have a cabin length of 23 to 28 feet and can seat eight to 10 passengers, depending on the configuration.

However, with a list price of $19.5 million, the Phantom 3500 is less expensive. The Bombardier and Embraer — both of which Flexjet already flies — cost about $27 million and $24 million new, respectively.

Otto's cost savings come from the plane's ""laminar-flow"" technology, which reduces drag by maintaining smoother airflow across the aircraft's carbon fiber composite surface. Otto said this would result in a 60% lower fuel burn than a comparable jet.

And smaller fuel tanks allow for smaller wings and engines, which also helps save on production and maintenance costs, per Otto.

Furthermore, the Phantom 3500 is designed to cruise at altitudes of up to 51,000 feet. This would allow it to fly above weather and turbulence, further reduce fuel consumption, and offer increased route flexibility. US airlines, by contrast, cruise at altitudes of up to 42,000 feet.

Overall, Otto said the jet would reduce operating costs by 50% and offer an expected range of 3,500 nautical miles (about 4,000 miles). That could connect Los Angeles and Hawaii or New York and London.

Otto already tested the laminar technology on a full-scale, piloted demonstrator jet called the Celera 500 for three years, starting in 2017. The company said the data collected proved the concept and projected savings.",https://i.insider.com/68ded8ac1c1f80efbec4d0a7?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-10-04 10:57:28.423068

The Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award was established to promote global best practices in aviation.","The prestigious Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award was presented at the 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal.

The “Green Corridors” project, developed by specialists from “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE, was named the top three global sustainable aviation initiatives, behind only Germany and the United States. 52 countries, 84 projects, and 194 participants took part in the competition.

The “Green Corridors” Initiative is the world's first economic incentive scheme for air carriers to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on international cargo flights.

The project includes:

∙ Reducing air navigation charges for airlines operating SAF flights;

∙ Using the Book & Claim mechanism to transparent fuel confirmation;

∙ Scientific modeling the impact of contrails and CO₂ emissions;

∙ Launching pilot routes in 2026 and subsequent scaling.

The authors of the project are specialists from “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE: Mr. Nursultan Tompiyev, Mr. Madi Asylkhanov, Mr. Asset Akhmetbayev and Mr. Abay Akkulov.

“The international recognition of the “Green Corridors” project is a result of the strategic focus of “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE on innovation and sustainable development. We strive to transform the airspace of the Republic of Kazakhstan into a “green aviation bridge” between Europe and Asia, where ecology and economics operate within a unified model,” noted in “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE.

Benefits for the country and industry:

∙ Еcology: CO₂ emissions reduced by 70–80% on SAF flights;

∙ Economy: Increased attractiveness of the airspace of the Republic of Kazakhstan for international transit air carriers;

∙ Image: Positioning the Republic of Kazakhstan and “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE as leaders in the implementation of innovative mechanisms in global aviation.

The Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award was established to promote global best practices in aviation. It covers directions of innovation, sustainable development, and digital transformation. The awards ceremony took place on September 27, 2025 as part of the official Gala Dinner of the ICAO Assembly.

The specialists of “Kazaeronavigatsia” RSE have already been remarked at the international level — different years, their projects have won and received prizes at prestigious competitions, including the ATCA (Air Traffic Control Association) Awards in the United States.

BTN estimates that Boston Consulting Group's 2024 U.S.-booked air spend on business travel was $153 million.

In 2024, BCG reported 332 metric kilotons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions for business travel. The company's business travel accounts for most of its total emissions each year, and in 2024 it surpassed its 2025 Scope 3 target with a 58 percent reduction in business travel emissions per full-time employee versus 2018 levels. It also now ""carefully assesses when and how we travel, prioritizing client value while minimizing our climate impact,"" according to the company's latest sustainability report.

The company also has changed the way it organizes internal meetings and events, focusing on lower-emission formats and locations. For instance, it uses a CO2 optimizer tool to help choose meeting locations that incur the least total emissions for those attending.

In addition, during the past two years, BCG has introduced carbon budgets for travel, which are managed by leaders across regions and business units. Starting in 2025, the company will allocate the total costs associated with its climate commitments—such as purchasing carbon credits and sustainable aviation fuel—to carbon budget owners as a charge based on their performance against BCG's science-based target.

BCG also has committed to replacing at least 5 percent of its indirect jet-fuel consumption with SAF. In 2024, the company signed a five-year contract with World Energy that will reduce its emissions by 100,000 metric tons of CO2.

Consolidated Global TMC: Amex GBT

BTN estimates consulting firm McKinsey & Co. reached $228 million in U.S.-originating air spend, up considerably from 2024. The New York-based concern focused part of its travel management energy in 2024 on creating new artificial intelligence-driven processes for travelers, integrating large language model-based booking interface Skylink into existing Slack-based workflows. BTN named McKinsey director of travel and events technology Jamie Stewart as Travel Manager of the Year for his work on the project, which required buy-in from long-time travel management company partner American Express Global Business Travel to collaborate with a startup to achieve success.

Skylink users have seen their average booking times reduced to under two minutes from around 12 minutes previously. This includes an intuitive process for booking recurring trips in one AI-driven conversation rather than as separate itineraries in a booking tool. The firm still uses human agents at Amex GBT, and Concur serves as its legacy booking tool, but according to a company case study, more than 20 percent of bookings are now made through the Skylink AI interface, with 95 percent of users giving the tools a positive rating for experience and 85 percent becoming repeat users.

McKinsey is using the new interface to drive compliant bookings as well, whether that’s a nudge to book the roundtrip international fare or possibly to take a train instead of a flight, if the option is available—that latter nudge will be rolling out in a new Skylink implementation in the U.K. in the coming weeks. Right now, the tool is balanced to provide convenient, in-policy itineraries tailored to the individual traveler, and 85 percent of users are choosing among the first three options presented.

McKinsey additionally has been intent on lowering its carbon emissions from business travel. In addition to supporting remote and hybrid working models, strategic local staffing, web-based and localized recruiting and learning events, and initiatives that encourage colleagues to use rail travel and electric ground transportation when possible, the firm introduced a carbon fee for air bookings in 2023. The firm expanded those fees to accommodations in 2024 and mentioned in its annual sustainability report that the firm would be raising the fee over time.

With these measures in place, McKinsey achieved in 2024 a 50 percent reduction in air and ground travel-related emissions (this includes reductions as a result of purchasing sustainable aviation fuel and offsets).

The carbon fee, which is $50 per ton of CO2 equivalent emissions, funds offset purchases and SAF as part of an overall reduction strategy. The firm achieved 50 percent emissions reduction per full-time employee in 2024, beyond its 35 percent per FTE target.

McKinsey is looking to improve its offset purchasing strategies in the coming years—moving to 100 percent carbon removal projects by 2030.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTN/uploadedImages/2015_Site_Maintenance/BTN_Link_PreviewLogo.png?n=3260&tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-10-03 20:58:10.246378

Consolidated U.S. TMC: BCD (2025 move to Kayak BTX)

Big changes were underway for consulting giant Deloitte's travel program in 2024. An extensive travel agency request for proposal conducted for the U.S. program resulted by the beginning of 2025 in moving the U.S. firm to Kayak BTX, a TMC and booking tool collaboration between blockchain-based travel tech startup Blockskye and Kayak's enterprise grade booking platform.

The move took a massive piece of Deloitte's business away from BCD Travel, which had served the consulting firm globally for more than two decades and moved the U.S. firm off GetThere as a booking tool, though 2024 air spend went through the prior TMC and booking tool. BCD continues to serve the broader Deloitte account in more than two dozen other geographies.

The consulting giant maintained its No. 2 spot on this year's Corporate Travel 100 list, despite its U.S.-originating air travel volume dropping slightly from $300 million in 2023 to $295 million in 2024. The company projects, however, that it will have a considerable rebound in U.S. air volume next year—up to $325 million.

Because Kayak BTX brings new technology models and supplier payment mechanisms into play, it's conceivable other changes could be on the way for Deloitte's U.S. travel program. In the meantime, the firm made no updates to travel policy in 2024.

Oxxo

Oxxo, the Mexican convenience store chain with more than 24,000 locations across Latin America, underscored sustainability as a driver of business growth. “We are convinced that sustainability makes us a stronger and better business,” said Abraham Garza Álvarez, Oxxo’s sustainability manager.

Garza explained that modern Oxxo stores consume 40% less energy than those built 15 years ago, despite using nearly twice the equipment. The chain has implemented 29 energy-efficiency measures, including optimized lighting and refrigeration. More than 90% of its purchases come from local suppliers, who also benefit from training programs to enhance environmental, social, and economic practices. Oxxo recycles 30% of store waste and 80% of service center material, working with more than 50 partners.

The company is also testing sustainable mobility with 170 electric vehicles and pilot programs for electric trucks. By 2030, Oxxo aims to reduce emissions by 45%, source 85% of its energy from renewables, and lower supplier carbon footprints.

JAC Motors

Chinese automaker JAC Motors, which operates a plant in Ciudad Sahagún, Hidalgo, is expanding its electric and hybrid vehicle portfolio in Mexico. Its offerings range from family cars to last-mile delivery units, with technicians trained in high-voltage systems.

Vania Terrones, JAC’s EV manager, announced that the company will add a new production line dedicated to electric and hybrid vehicles, increasing capacity by 12,000 units per year. The facility will partially run on solar energy and create more than 500 green jobs. JAC also plans to promote adoption through “green rates,” offering more accessible financing for EV buyers.

Aeroméxico

Aeroméxico reaffirmed its target of net-zero emissions by 2050, supported by fleet renewal and efficiency measures. “Our aircraft are 20% more efficient than they were a few years ago,” said Karen Farías, director of sustainability and ESG.

The airline is training pilots to optimize fuel usage in every phase of flight and reducing auxiliary engine reliance on the ground. It is also developing a roadmap for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Mexico, with Farías stressing the need for collaboration across government, industry partners, and consumers.

KIO IT Services

Tech firm KIO IT Services highlighted artificial intelligence as a tool for reducing emissions and boosting competitiveness. “Some logistics clients are already using hybrid or electric vehicles with AI-powered route optimization,” said José Da Silva, director of digital experience. He cited cases where delivery distances dropped from 100 to 20 kilometers, cutting energy use.

Da Silva referenced McKinsey research showing that one-third of companies worldwide have adopted AI into their business model. He added that KIO is expanding pilot projects while ensuring its data centers rely on renewable sources like solar, hydro, and geothermal energy.

Mars

Mars reaffirmed its goal of achieving zero environmental impact by 2050 under its Sustainable in a Generation program, launched in 2017. “Our commitment is a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and full neutrality by 2050,” said Francisco Ríos, corporate affairs director, Mars Pet Nutrition Mexico.

The company’s initiatives span regenerative agriculture, circular packaging, water efficiency, and reforestation. Water management is a key priority, with both internal efficiency projects and external collaborations with specialists and NGOs.

According to EIA, biofuel production and consumption in the U.S. has generally increased each year since the early 1980s.
“There’s plenty of corn in the U.S.,” Fatka explains.
“When oil is really expensive, it’s easier to promote biofuels as an economic alternative to high oil prices,” Fatka observes.
She also notes a shift in SAF production could have an impact on the food sector and food prices, and conversations about this tradeoff are ongoing within the industry.","In a Sept. 17 edition of the North American Ag Spotlight podcast, hosted by Chrissy Wozniack, CoBank Farm Supply and Biofuels Lead Economist Jacqui Fatka offers her perspective on the shifting landscape of biofuels.

Titled “How Biofuels are Changing Opportunities for U.S. Producers,” the episode features a conversation on the current state of the biofuel industry and explores the potential impacts increased demand for sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) may have on feedstock markets and, consequently, U.S. farmers.

Background on biofuels

Biofuels are renewable energy sources derived from biomass materials called feedstocks, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Biomass materials include crop waste, forest residue, microalgae and food waste.

The most common types of biofuels used today are ethanol and biodiesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.

Ethanol production involves the fermentation of feedstocks like corn, sorghum, barley, sugar cane and sugarbeets, while biodiesel is produced by combining alcohol with vegetable oil, animal fat or recycled cooking grease.

According to EIA, biofuel production and consumption in the U.S. has generally increased each year since the early 1980s. As demand for biofuels continues to rise and research and development progresses, producers have the opportunity to take advantage of the changing landscape, but they must also be equipped to navigate challenges.

“With pressure growing around renewable energy and the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels, producers and agribusinesses are facing new challenges and opportunities in feedstocks, investments and policy,” Wozniack begins.

She then introduces Fatka, who offers comments informed by “two decades of experience in ag policy, biofuels, trade and farm management.”

Highlights from Fatka’s comments include details on biofuel research and development, as well as how the demand for SAF might influence corn and soy production in the U.S.

She also gives advice on how producers can stay educated and protected in the face of shifting markets.

Sustainable aviation fuels

World Energy defines SAF as jet fuels made from materials like used cooking oils and agricultural waste.

In the podcast, Fatka notes most SAFs in the U.S. are produced through the hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses hydrogen to turn agricultural products like soybeans and canola oil – as well as waste oils and animal fats like beef tallow – into fuel.

Fatka further mentions hope for employing an “alcohol-to-jet” production process in greater quantities, which would use feedstocks similar to those found in ethanol production to make SAFs and, therefore, create benefits for farmers.

However, Fatka notes development is still ongoing and the process is expensive.

“There’s plenty of corn in the U.S.,” Fatka explains. “Being able to get feedstocks is not a problem, but the cost of alcohol-to-jet production for sustainable aviation fuel is much more expensive.”

“This is why we haven’t seen a lot of plants be able to scale commercially yet,” Fatka continues. “The important part is being able to make investments to drive costs down and make alcohol-to-jet production more cost competitive.”

Additionally, Fatka says lower global oil prices have led to challenges in sourcing investment in biofuel research and development and notes the U.S. is currently “a drop in the bucket” in terms of worldwide SAF use and domestic production.

“When oil is really expensive, it’s easier to promote biofuels as an economic alternative to high oil prices,” Fatka observes. “Oil prices are really low right now, so it’s hard to spin the need to invest in research and development.”

In terms of the big picture, Fatka says the future of domestic SAF production will depend on economic factors including tax incentives.

“SAF is not something you can turn on production of overnight,” Fatka says. “Unfortunately, we’re still years out. Without some of the policy levers to encourage things from the different tax incentives, we’re just not really going to see this truly take off.”

Furthermore, Fatka acknowledges some states including Minnesota and Illinois are trying to encourage SAF development to use at a local level, even without federal support.

“We’re still really early in this industry, and I think we have a lot to learn,” Fatka continues. “Some things we think we know now are going to change, but this also makes it really exciting. There are new things happening and new partnerships coming together.”

Staying informed

In the face of a shifting landscape, Fatka emphasizes keeping an ongoing dialogue with different players throughout the supply chain is important to remaining educated and prepared.

When asked about the potential for SAF adoption to change demand for traditional feedstocks like corn and soy, Fatka predicts a potential increase in demand for soybean oil, as well as any feedstock able to be run efficiently with a low carbon input score.

Fatka emphasizes there are many nuances to the biofuel market and research is constantly ongoing. She also notes a shift in SAF production could have an impact on the food sector and food prices, and conversations about this tradeoff are ongoing within the industry.

“This is one of those issues that is moving and changing a lot,” Fatka says. “There is a lot of hype and hope when it comes to SAF, but we have to be able to have a good, grounded understanding of what’s needed today.”

Overall, Fatka recommends farmers stay engaged with commodity groups and capture data on personal farming practices to remain educated and economically sustainable.

“If we keep pushing off investment, it’s going to keep pushing off return,” Fatka says. “We can’t capture any value if we’re not researching it now, figuring out what works and what doesn’t and maybe using different policy levers to help advocate for what’s needed.”

That may seem like science fiction, but the Pentagon’s naval research lab thinks shipboard fuel synthesis could be possible and is providing research and development funds to explore operationalising the technology.

If proven effective, the seawater-to-fuel conversion process could streamline naval logistics and unlock significant new tactical and strategic possibilities for Washington.

Consider a scenario in the not-so-distant future where one of the US Navy’s aircraft carriers is hiding deep in the vast expanse that is the western Pacific Ocean.

The flattop ship and its escorts have been forced far out to sea by the threat of long-range Chinese missiles, backed by orbital and airborne reconnaissance assets, which began hunting the carrier strike group after Beijing ordered a maritime quarantine of Taiwan.

Ships and aircraft for the People’s Liberation Army, bristling with anti-ship missiles, now ring the besieged island.

Although the US carrier is still generating sorties to probe the Chinese defences while Washington mulls a response, the strike group has been forced more than 1,000nm (1,852km) to remain safe from China’s vast arsenal of “carrier killer” weapons – including YJ-12 air-launched anti-ship missiles and shore-based anti-ship ballistic missiles, including the DF-21D and DF-26.

That latter category carriers a range beyond 2,000nm.

As a result of the stand-off, the carrier’s embarked air wing is forced to fly long-range sorties, with each aircraft refuelling multiple times per flight. Onboard stores of JP-5 jet fuel are being depleted, but the one-star admiral in command of the strike group is reluctant to rendezvous with one of the navy replenishment ships steaming across the Pacific – presumably under watch from Chinese reconnaissance satellites.

Instead, the strike group commander orders the captain of the carrier to fire up an experimental onboard generator, one that can produce fuel from the surrounding ocean water.

The navy thinks the concept holds enough promise that it is funding development of a maritime fuel production system that could be deployed aboard combat ships.

In August, the service issued a $9.4 million contract to a Texas-based company experimenting with a process that pulls carbon dioxide and hydrogen from seawater to synthesise jet fuel.

That firm, called Sea Dragon Energy, says that ocean water contains carbon dioxide in concentrations roughly 140 times that of air. Water is comprised of two parts hydrogen and one part oxygen.

Under an initiative called Project Genesis, Sea Dragon is developing a system that could pull those raw material from seawater and convert them into a fuel equivalent to JP-5 – a process roughly analogous to the refining of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from agriculture products.

“The ability to do this in an efficient manner is precisely what Project Genesis is aiming to do,” Sea Dragon notes.

The company notes that the US Naval Research Laboratory has already patented technology that allows extraction of carbon dioxide from seawater and simultaneously produce hydrogen.

The goal now is to integrate that extraction process with a SAF production plant that is appropriately sized and efficient enough for shipboard operation.

“Preliminary studies of naval operational scenarios and naval architectural design suggest that a seaborne version of the process could sustain a carrier strike group’s operations indefinitely,” Sea Dragon notes.

“This ability is a huge advantage for the navy in a potential conflict situation,” the company adds.

Efficiency will be key to making the process viable in any real-world context. A 2014 report in Smithsonian Magazine noted the technology available at the time would require nearly 9 million cb m (318 million cb ft) of water to make 378,541 litres (100,000 USgal) of fuel – assuming 100% efficiency in the extraction and refining process.

Even outside an active conflict, Sea Dragon says the technology could reduce fuel and operating costs for the navy, while providing the service more flexibility and a reliable fuel supply.

The Pentagon famously converted its aircraft carrier fleet to nuclear propulsion when it commissioned the USS Enterprise – the world’s first nuclear-powered carrier – in 1965.

Nuclear reactors are standard on all of the currently-serving Nimitz-class carriers, which entered service in the 1970s, and the new Ford-class flattops – the first of which is now actiely generating sorties on the global frontlines.

While those floating airfields must still take on consumables, each carrier effectively has unlimited range and ample onboard power generation for functions like generation of fresh water via desalination.

An onboard jet fuel production capability could unlock a similar future for air wing operations, bound only by availability of spare parts and physical requirements of human crews.

Sea Dragon’s latest contract follows an even larger $19 million award from the navy in 2024 to design and build a seawater-to-jet fuel demonstrator unit.

Work on phase two of the project, which is funded by contract from August, will take place in San Diego over a two-year period, concluding in 2027.

Montréal, 3 October 2025 — The International Civil Aviation Organization Assembly has accelerated aviation’s transition to a more sustainable and decarbonized future by achieving broader global cooperation, strengthening the international framework, and laying the groundwork for increased investment.

The decisions made by the Assembly directly support the implementation of ICAO’s Strategic Plan for 2050. This long-term plan aims to achieve net zero carbon emissions from international air transport, building on a Resolution adopted by States at the 2022 Assembly session.

Key outcomes of the Assembly include:

Commitment to cleaner energy, with States endorsing the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other cleaner energy sources. This includes endorsement of the Framework’s collective target of 5% CO₂ reduction by 2030 and the policy, regulation, support, and financing pathway it provides for achieving it.

Accelerated investment, with the Assembly calling for the full operationalization of the ICAO Finvest Hub. This Hub will connect decarbonization projects with public and private investors. It aims to address financing challenges, particularly in developing countries, by facilitating greater access to climate finance.

Strengthened commitment to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), the world’s only global market-based measure for international aviation. The Assembly reaffirmed the scheme’s environmental integrity and committed to increasing support to States through the ACT-CORSIA programme. CORSIA is on track and continues to progress with enhanced participation and expanded coverage.

Sustainability beyond carbon, with the Assembly advancing work on issues including aircraft noise, local air quality, single-use plastics, and non-CO₂ climate effects.

Enhanced resilience and accelerated adaptation, with States acknowledging the urgent need for stronger scientific input, strengthened international cooperation, and updated guidance on climate risk assessment and infrastructure resilience to adapt aviation infrastructure and operations to climate-related impacts. States also recognized the role of aviation in disaster response, such as forest firefighting operations.

The decisions taken by the Assembly will provide crucial momentum to real and measurable progress led by ICAO on environmental sustainability. This progress is demonstrated by increasing numbers of States submitting Action Plans on CO2 Emissions Reduction Activities (154, up from 133 in 2022), increasing voluntary participation in CORSIA (now 130 States), and a growing number of sustainable aviation fuel plants worldwide.

The broader participation and stronger commitments of these Resolutions also send a resounding signal to governments, industry, and investors alike: the global aviation community is united and determined to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, 70% rely on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF.
We’re not going to get to net zero by 2050.” More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns.
He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, adding he did “not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production”.
IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030.","One hundred years ago, the Italian aviator Francesco de Pinedo was attempting the unprecedented feat of crossing the Indian subcontinent in a flying boat. He later splashed down on the Tiber in Rome to national acclaim, having flown via Asia to Australia and back over seven months, taking off and landing in water 80 times.

Aviation has been marked by stop-start journeys on hitherto uncharted courses to unlikely, if not unreachable, destinations. Today’s collective act of faith – amid much scepticism – is in following an uncertain path to sustainability, through green fuels that are yet to be widely produced.

Most in the aviation industry, even if only through self-interest, are on board with the theory. Of the identified emissions cuts needed for carbon neutrality, 70% rely on sustainable aviation fuels, or SAF. “Without it,” says Tim Alderslade, of Airlines UK, “we cannot get anywhere near net zero by 2050.”

This year, the first steps were imposed by mandate in the EU and the UK, requiring 2% of jet fuel to be sustainable – by 2030, that reaches 6% in the EU and 10% in Britain.

However, airlines have questioned whether supplies will be available and at what price. A fissure is developing between those that have secured sources of SAF and invested in technologies, and others with a ferocious eye on the bottom line.

Michael O’Leary, the chief executive of Ryanair, dismisses SAF as nonsense. He says: “It is all gradually dying a death, which is what it deserves to do. We have just about met our 2% mandate. There is no possibility of meeting 6% by 2030; 10%, not a hope in hell. We’re not going to get to net zero by 2050.”

More measured voices among SAF’s champions also have concerns. Willie Walsh, director general of the worldwide airline trade body Iata, had pushed for fuel tanks to contain 5% SAF by 2030. He admitted last week to disappointment in progress, adding he did “not believe that target can be achieved given where we are in terms of SAF production”.

At least, he said, the case for SAF had been proved: “We now need to turn what we know is technically possible into something that’s commercially possible and commercially viable for the industry.”

The UK is trying to create the framework with a revenue certainty mechanism. A bill currently going through parliament will guarantee a price for SAF, to encourage investment in production. The Department for Transport in July allocated £63m to 17 companies looking to make SAF in Britain. A spokesperson said there were “encouraging early signs towards meeting the mandate”. But only Phillips 66 in Humberside is making SAF at scale, with the five plants promised under Boris Johnson’s “jet zero” strategy yet to appear.

Carrots and sticks are needed, with big oil companies having ever less incentive to go green when invited to drill for easy profit. Shell’s decision to stop construction of a Rotterdam biofuel plant, expected to be one of Europe’s biggest converters of waste to jet fuel, will make SAF rarer and dearer. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s “big beautiful bill” slashes US incentives for SAF production introduced by Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act – although, in a concession to American crop farmers, some subsidies on homegrown SAF feedstocks will continue for two more years.

Philip New, a former BP alternative energy executive and government adviser on SAF, says: “I’m very pessimistic about SAF in the US. There’s no mandate or regulations or reason to use it.”

Beyond the US, geopolitics could weigh on supplies in various ways, he says. Tariffs could divert more Chinese cooking oil for SAF in Europe; meanwhile, Asian countries introducing their own mandates and quotas may not want to export.

New still believes SAF will come but warns: “It is going to be a lumpy transition.”

Current UK and EU mandates can be met entirely with HEFA (hydrotreated esters and fatty acid) based SAF, made from sources such as recycled cooking oil – though its provenance has been questioned. The bigger hurdles come as governments demand second generation (2G) SAF, made of feedstocks such as household rubbish.

Alderslade says production of 2G is “the great unknown”. Missing the mandate, he says, will bring financial penalties “which inevitably will be passed through to passengers”.

New says: “In theory this is a really great way of getting rid of our waste.” The challenge is getting the right level of support to back up the very high-risk first generations of these technologies.” Even with government backing, the 2G targets for 2030 are unlikely to be met, he adds.

Despite the risks, investors see the long-term value. One global asset manager, who declined to be named, said the US was an outlier in abandoning net zero, with mandates coming to Asia as well as Europe. “For oil majors, SAF is lower priority, it’s hard – some people are giving up. But airlines can’t abandon it. It’s going to be bumpy – but is it all coming down? No.”

Differing views among airlines, he suggests, may reflect the ease of access and price paid for SAF at the airports they use: “There’s no shortage in the hubs.”

The British Airways owner, IAG, says it has a “long-term commitment”, with some justification – it announced plans in 2011 for a pioneering waste-to-fuel plant in Essex, although it admitted defeat by 2017. IAG says there will be enough SAF to meet EU and UK mandates until 2030. But a spokesperson added: “Second and third generation SAFs do require more investment and development [and] support … Mandates are one lever to stimulate demand but investment in production is key.”

Green shoots are still appearing: a Belfast company, Catagen, last month launched patented modular technology which it said could produce SAF at quantities needed in the vicinity of smaller airports, a development endorsed by Ryanair.

For BA’s home airport, the debate has particular urgency: if the sustainable aviation roadmap crumbles, Heathrow’s third runway becomes ever more politically difficult.

Matt Gorman, director of carbon strategy at Heathrow, insists: “SAF is not hypothetical. Heathrow is already leading globally in SAF use, 17% of the world’s SAF in 2024 was used here. This is real progress, not a future promise.”

Some environmental campaigners, while remaining firmly against Heathrow expansion, have shifted on SAF, accepting it as a potential route to future decarbonisation – even if many fear it acts as a fig leaf to deflect environmental concerns today.

Planes will continue to emit CO2 as usual at the tailpipe – and in the broader context, will still be depleting resources. Matt Finch, in a report for the Aviation Environment Federation, said: “The blunt truth is that there is not a single SAF feedstock that can’t be used in another sector where it would bring a desirable environmental outcome. And in some cases, that outcome is already what a large proportion of the waste is used for. “

That caveat applies even for the gold standard fuel, third generation, or e-SAF, created via CO2 capture and renewable electricity. It has been synthesised in small quantities, and tested in a Swiss “solar fuel” flight this July. But e-SAF requires green hydrogen, supplies of which, Walsh says, are “very limited, and also extremely expensive”. Investors in e-SAF right now, according to the City insider, “will probably lose their money”.

Where the technology goes is unclear, history suggests. De Pinedo was to die eight years after his seaplane feats, in a conventional plane taking off from a runway in New York in 1933. Flying boats were superseded by the advent of jet aircraft during the second world war.

“Predicting the future will always involve some uncertainty,” Gorman says. “But what we’re doing is not guesswork. It’s based on evidence, expert consensus, and a clear roadmap.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea63461783d4286a0a31a916d56250068a4e3921/779_0_3960_3168/master/3960.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0293a3133755ce87f183190855417dc5",N,,2025-10-03 11:57:39.622226

We implement real security, and they close the deals they previously couldn’t.”","Amsterdam-based cybersecurity company Oneleet has secured $33 million in Series A funding. The round was led by Dawn Capital, with backing from high-profile investors, including Frank Slootman (former CEO of Snowflake and ServiceNow), Arash Ferdowsi (co-founder of Dropbox), Y Combinator, and several experienced CISOs.

The new capital injection will accelerate its expansion by hiring more security engineers, advancing its technology capabilities, and scaling proven go-to-market strategies. A particular focus will be placed on enhancing the platform with intelligent automation across different areas of cybersecurity.

With this funding, Oneleet is also doubling down on its belief that compliance alone is not sufficient.

Closing the gap between paper compliance and real security

For many companies, earning SOC 2 or ISO 27001 certifications has become a checkbox exercise to secure contracts. Too often, this results in staged penetration tests, staged exercises, and screenshots that satisfy auditors but fail to build genuine protection. The outcome is a certificate on paper, but systems remain vulnerable.

Oneleet was founded by Bryan Onel and his wife Ora Onel and college friend Erik Vogelzang in 2022. With backgrounds in penetration testing against corporations and government agencies, saw a pattern wherein organisations with valid certifications were still breached quickly. This revealed a broken system where compliance outweighed real security.

Oneleet’s solution is to merge the two into one approach, ensuring that robust defences naturally meet compliance requirements rather than the other way around.

A unified platform

The company’s platform eliminates the need for multiple vendors by bringing together essential services into a single system. It integrates penetration testing, code scanning, cloud posture management, attack surface monitoring, mobile device management, and employee security training under one roof.

Instead of organisations piecing together fragmented tools, Oneleet delivers end-to-end coverage in one place. This integrated design speeds up compliance processes, helps companies exceed audit standards, and reduces risks that come from relying on third-party systems. By owning and managing its full security stack, the company provides consistent results and takes complete responsibility for keeping systems protected.

The platform also guarantees compliance outcomes by embedding rigorous security practices into day-to-day operations. Compliance becomes the outcome of good security rather than a separate process built around checklists.

Bryan Onel, CEO of Oneleet, said, “From our first call with Dawn, we knew we’d found the right partner. They understood the space deeply and immediately grasped what we’re building: compliance as the wedge, security as the substance. Their conviction, professionalism, and enthusiasm were evident from day one—Henry Mason was on a plane from London to San Francisco within 24 hours to meet in person.”

He added: “We use AI extensively—but responsibly. AI works in the background for threat modeling and risk assessments, but clients never see hallucinations because we verify everything first with human expertise, where technology falls short. The proof is in outcomes: We regularly win customers from major competitors after those companies lost deals due to inadequate security. We implement real security, and they close the deals they previously couldn’t.”",https://techfundingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Oneleet-founders.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 11:57:43.908541

By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons.
The non-binding MOU reflects a shared vision to accelerate SAF adoption and position both companies as leaders in clean aviation infrastructure.","XCF Global Inc., a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel, and FlyORO Technologies Pte. Ltd., a global leader in digital modular blending solutions for SAF, on Oct. 1 announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU).

Under the MOU, XCF and FlyORO will explore the creation of a global partnership to help solve one of aviation's biggest bottlenecks: SAF supply chain and blending inefficiencies. As most blending occurs upstream at production facilities, there are limitations to flexibility and scalability. Midstream and downstream infrastructure such as terminals or airports often lack the equipment and certification processes needed for blending. Together, XCF and FlyORO intend to co-develop an end-to-end solution to enable the ready uplift of SAF. By combining XCF's expertise in SAF production infrastructure with FlyORO's patented modular blending technology - AlphaLite - designed for flexible deployment either on-airport or pre-airport, the collaboration aims to support cost-effective, compliant, and scalable SAF integration into the global aviation fuel system.

The urgency to deploy scalable SAF infrastructure has never been greater. By 2030, the global SAF market is projected to exceed $25 billion, with worldwide demand expected to surpass 5.5 billion gallons. As this demand accelerates, next-generation blending solutions such as FlyORO's AlphaLite system, an innovative, flexible, and low-CAPEX technology, will be critical to bridging production with airports and fleets worldwide.

This potential partnership aligns directly with XCF's international expansion strategy announced in June 2025, under which the company is pursuing a capital-efficient, modular approach to global SAF deployment through regionally tailored partnerships. The potential collaboration with FlyORO would be expected to strengthen XCF's ability to deliver end-to-end SAF solutions, from production through blending and distribution, across the world.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, commented, ""This partnership has the potential to rewire how the aviation industry thinks about SAF deployment. Blending isn't just a technical step, it's a critical piece of the infrastructure puzzle that determines how fast SAF can scale. By combining FlyORO's cutting-edge blending technology with XCF's global strategy, we're creating a pathway to accelerate adoption, reduce costs, and unlock new growth opportunities for investors and stakeholders alike.""

Damian Mc Loughlin, chief commercial officer of FlyORO, commented, ""FlyORO was founded with the mission to eliminate barriers to SAF adoption. Our modular AlphaLite system makes blending more flexible, scalable, and affordable. Working with XCF, we can expand this vision globally, bringing smarter logistics and faster SAF deployment to airports and airlines around the world.""

Advanced Biofuels Canada (ABFC) on Sept. 22 released the 10th annual Navius Research Biofuels in Canada report, the national report on Canada’s renewable and low-carbon fuel markets. Recognized as one of the most effective ways to reduce transportation greenhouse gas emissions, biofuels have reached record use in Canada.

The report provides a clear, data-driven picture of consumption, emissions reductions, policy impacts, and market trends at the federal and provincial levels. “Biofuels turn Canadian crops into economic growth, supporting farm families and rural economies, strengthening national energy security by diversifying Canada’s fuel supply, all while reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” said Fred Ghatala, President of Advanced Biofuels Canada.

“The federal Clean Fuel Regulations, along with complementary provincial policies in all provinces (except Atlantic Canada), have been central to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from gasoline and diesel use. This year’s results show policy leadership is translating into real-world impacts on economic growth, consumer choice, and affordability,” said Ghatala.

The report finds that renewable fuel content reached a record high in 2024, with ethanol nearing the key 10% blend level and biofuels in diesel tripling the federal target, reaching nearly 7% in renewable content.

Other important 2025 findings include:

In 2024, biomass-based diesel (BBD)’s consumption rose 9% to almost 1.5 billion liters per year, while ethanol increased 6% to 4.2 billion liters per year.

The average carbon intensity (CI) of biomass-based diesel fuels is 86% less than fossil diesel, and the CI of ethanol is 57% less than gasoline.

Since 2010, the use of biofuels in Canada has reduced wholesale fuel costs by $1.25 billion.

In 2024, Canada achieved a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of 13.3 million metric tons of CO₂, more than double the impact recorded in 2020.

In British Columbia, biomass-based diesel content was over 31% by volume in 2024 – the highest in Canada.

In 2024, ethanol blending resulted in savings of 7.4 cents per liter in gasoline and biodiesel and renewable diesel added costs of 2.5 cents per liter in diesel.

Biofuel blended in gasoline (e.g. ethanol) reduced wholesale costs by $1.7 billion in 2024. Since 2010, ethanol has reduced wholesale gasoline costs by over $13.2 billion.

Biofuels blended with diesel fuel (renewable diesel and biodiesel) increased diesel wholesale costs by around $870 million in 2024. Since 2010, biofuel in diesel has increased wholesale diesel costs by $8.2 billion. When taken together, renewable fuel blending in gasoline and diesel fuels has resulted in wholesale cost savings for Canadians.

Emission abatement benefits for ethanol improved sharply, with a ‘negative’ net cost of $151 per metric ton (compared to $116 per metric ton in 2023), while costs for diesel-based biofuels remained unchanged ($257).

Electricity consumption by light-duty vehicles rose 58% in 2024, following 41% growth in 2023, while EVs and PHEVs made up one in six of new light-duty vehicles.

New in the 2025 report methodology: trade-flow data (CIMT) profiles domestic and import fuel use. Fuel volumes and CFR market data are used to estimate net annual credit supply, track the credit bank or deficit, and forecast the balance through 2025.

“Canadian producers faced a particularly challenging year due to U.S. government subsidies, which continue to influence the flow of renewable fuels across the border. Imports from the U.S. are the largest component of Canada’s renewable fuel trade, with imported volumes six to seven times greater than exports. More than 95% of Canada’s renewable fuel imports and 80% of exports are with the U.S., underscoring the importance of a stable and supportive domestic policy environment.

“Strong policy is essential to keep Canadian production viable, particularly since most jobs related to biofuel are found in remote and rural regions. Both federal and provincial governments have made important commitments in 2025, including the launch of the federal Biofuels Incentive Program, which provides a per-litre subsidy for Canadian producers for up to 300 million litres per year. Provinces also took steps to support the sector: British Columbia increased its renewable fuel blend rate for diesel, and both B.C. and Ontario introduced “made-in-Canada” requirements for minimum blend rates. These measures strengthen demand for domestic production and help ensure that Canadian facilities remain competitive.

“Canada’s fuel policies are working as designed. The federal Clean Fuel Regulations drove an 11% increase in low-carbon fuel use in 2024. In British Columbia, where the government recognizes the Low Carbon Fuel Standard as the most effective method of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the province, biofuel use rose by 27%. Importantly, BC’s fuel regulations helped drive major capital investments in new biomass-based diesel production capacity that came online in 2024 and 2025 in Vancouver, Prince George, and Edmonton,” Ghatala added. “The report shows Canada has the opportunity to be a global leader in sustainable fuels. Growth in the sector will add resilience to our economy through diversification of supply chains and new trading relationships. We will be working directly with our federal and provincial governments to protect and grow Canada’s biofuels sector.”

IATA said it had always given its support to the use of sustainable feedstocks for SAF.

“We’re disappointed at the progress that has been made in relation to the production of SAF … the problem … is one of supply and not one of demand.”

IATA has urged governments to provide direct incentives to producers, harmonise global standards and reaffirm the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) as the only international framework for carbon offsetting.

The global market for SAF is small - about US$2.9bn in 2025 compared to the US$239bn global market for conventional aviation fuel, Reuters wrote on 16 September, citing analysis firm SkyQuest Technology Group.

However, additional SAF demand could result in the expansion of cattle herds and directly or indirectly drive deforestation and forest degradation, the news agency wrote, finding in an investigation that US firm Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) had been purchasing tallow from cattle raised on illegally cleared lands in the Amazon rainforest to produce renewable diesel and SAF.

DGD is a joint venture between renderer Darling Ingredients and petroleum refiner Valero Energy and operates a renewable diesel and SAF refinery in Port Arthur, Texas.

Its imports from Brazil had been certified as sustainable by the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC), a third-party certification body that approved Diamond's plant for CORSIA, Reuters wrote.

To be eligible, biomass used for fuel cannot come from land deforested after 2008 or protected areas, but the ISCC told Reuters it did not investigate Diamond's supply chain because it considered tallow a ""byproduct"" of the beef industry under CORSIA.

The seminar, hosted on September 22 and 23 by the BAF as part of the Australian Defence Force’s Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2025 activities, covered the challenges of climate change and opportunities for militaries to invest in sustainable aviation fuel.

Air Vice Marshal Tariqul’s opening remarks were amplified by presentations during the seminar that revealed how Bangladesh, which contributes just 0.04 per cent of historical global carbon emissions, will disproportionately bear the impacts of rising temperatures as rising seawater could force millions from their coastal homes and into already crowded cities or neighbouring countries.

This would be not only be an humanitarian issue, but also a security and conflict challenge, placing militaries in the middle, tasked with maintaining stability and order.

Squadron Leader Israt Arza Fahima told the seminar how air forces were reckoning with the threats posed by climate change, saying air operations must evolve “not just to defend borders, but to protect our planet and our people”.

Apart from taking part in humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, militaries – whose own carbon footprint an independent study from the Conflict and Environment Observatory estimates could account for about 5.5 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions – were flagged as having a role to play in reducing their impact through measures such as transitioning to more sustainable fuels.

Royal Australian Navy officer Commander Steven Cole, of the Defence Energy Transition Office, led a discussion on sustainable aviation fuels, which can be sourced from crops and other organic materials. This presented opportunities for both Bangladesh and Australia to enhance self-sufficiency.

'I think we can learn a great deal from how they have achieved that level of action and care.'

This was important, given the vulnerabilities of relying on foreign fuel sources, particularly during conflict when supply routes can be disrupted.

He said the shift to sustainable fuels offered the chance to produce energy locally, delivering energy security and independence in times of conflict as a key benefit.

Another area of collaboration raised at the seminar was the certification of platforms for sustainable fuel use, a process that has taken Australia about 15 years, with all Army rotary-wing and Air Force fixed-wing aircraft now certified.

Commander Cole said Australia’s experience meant it could share knowledge to make the certification process easier for others.

Opportunity in the Middle East If aviation hydrogen struggles globally, the Middle East could accelerate it.
Producing hydrogen fuels locally and exporting globally could make the Middle East the refueling hub for the hydrogen aviation era.","Yet, while industries such as those of refining and ammonia have locked in long-term offtake contracts, aviation remains largely grounded, and binding hydrogen demand from airlines represents less than 1% of global volumes today.

Short-term solutions, e-fuels and e-SAF

Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Batteries may work for short-haul flights, but energy density requirements make them impractical for long-haul.

Hydrogen offers a near-term solution in the form of e-fuels or e-SAF, produced by combining clean hydrogen with captured CO₂.

These synthetic fuels create a drop-in kerosene replacement compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure, making them the fastest route for hydrogen to enter aviation.

While both e-fuels and hydrogen are costly today, e-fuels allow airlines to begin reducing emissions immediately while leveraging existing supply chains and aircraft designs.

Long-term pathway, hydrogen-powered aircraft

The second, longer-term pathway is hydrogen-powered aircraft, including fuel cells for smaller planes or liquid hydrogen combustion turbines for medium-haul flights.

Using hydrogen directly in fuel cells or combustion avoids the 30–40% energy loss inherent in e-fuel production, delivering more flight miles per unit of renewable electricity.

Unlike bio-based SAF, which is feedstock-limited, or e-fuels, which recycle CO₂, hydrogen from renewables emits only water vapor. Falling electrolyser prices, abundant renewable power in regions such as the Middle East, and scale could make hydrogen cheaper than e-fuels by the 2030s.

Aircraft technology is advancing in parallel, with regional fuel-cell planes expected within the decade and medium-haul hydrogen turbines on the horizon. Hydrogen also increases energy security, reducing reliance on imported fuels and hedging against stricter carbon pricing.

In short, while SAF helps near-term and e-fuels provide compatibility, hydrogen is the scalable, clean, strategic fuel for the next generation of aviation. Aviation already accounts for 2–3% of global CO₂ emissions, a share that could grow as other sectors decarbonize.

IATA has pledged net-zero by 2050, and regulators in Europe, the US, and Asia are tightening emissions rules. Without hydrogen, these targets look increasingly out of reach.

Why aviation is lagging

AirBus CEO tells us, “we’re absolutely convinced that hydrogen is an energy for the future of aviation,”, yet, despite its potential, aviation hydrogen is far behind.

The Global Hydrogen Compass 2025 shows 70% of binding hydrogen offtake today is in refining and ammonia, aviation hardly registers.

Four major barriers persist:

Economics. Hydrogen-derived jet fuels remain three to five times costlier than fossil kerosene. Airlines operate on thin margins and cannot easily absorb costs.

Policy uncertainty. Mandates like the EU’s RED for RFNBOs create demand pull, but enforcement is uneven, making airlines hesitant to sign long-term contracts.

Infrastructure gaps. Hydrogen fueling systems, pipelines, and certification processes are nascent, unlike ammonia or refining which leverage existing supply chains.

Competing priorities. Airlines focus on bio-based SAF, cheaper and certified up to 50% blends, while hydrogen risks being sidelined until SAF scaling limits are reached.

As the report notes, many aviation hydrogen projects have “less momentum,” and only those with creative business models or policy support are currently able to advance.

Industry responses & case studies

Signs of progress exist. Project Roadrunner, a US commercial-scale e-fuels project, produces eSAF, eDiesel, and eNaphtha from renewable hydrogen and CO₂, securing long-term offtake from American Airlines and IAG.

Other projects, Stegra renewable steel in Sweden, NGHC green hydrogen in Saudi Arabia, and Yara green ammonia terminal in Germany, show how scale, regulatory clarity, and partnerships move projects from concept to reality.

Hydrogen CEOs consistently identify certainty of offtake as key. For aviation, this means long-term contracts, government-backed mechanisms like contracts-for-difference, and clearer regulatory roadmaps.

Opportunity in the Middle East

If aviation hydrogen struggles globally, the Middle East could accelerate it.

The region has committed 0.5 mtpa of clean hydrogen, split between renewable and low-carbon, with mega-projects like NGHC.

Ultra-low-cost solar and wind, established export infrastructure, and access to financing position the region to produce hydrogen-derived fuels for export.

The Gulf airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Etihad, Saudia, face European mandates requiring increasing SAF and e-fuels, creating a captive demand base.

Producing hydrogen fuels locally and exporting globally could make the Middle East the refueling hub for the hydrogen aviation era.

Hydrogen is a strategic choice. Airlines, policymakers, and investors who commit now will shape the next era of flight, while those who wait risk being left behind.

I grew up surrounded by kitchens, hawker stalls, restaurants, and food factories that produced oil waste every single day.
For the first time, lipid-based pathways, including those derived from used cooking oil, were officially recognized as viable for aviation.
And within HEFA, used cooking oil stood out as the most sustainable, most socially acceptable, and most credible source.","How Used Cooking Oil Became the Bedrock of SAF Feedstock

At first glance, used cooking oil is about as uninspiring a material as one can imagine. It is greasy, sticky, and malodorous. It comes in dented tins left out in the heat behind roadside stalls, in sloshing plastic drums beside hotel kitchens, or in small bottles kept under household sinks. For decades, it was treated as a nuisance, something to be discarded rather than valued. Some poured it down drains, causing blockages and pollution. Others sold it to informal operators who found low-value and unhealthy uses for it in animal feed or soap making. Almost no one, however, ever thought of it as a strategic commodity. And certainly not as something that could help decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate industries in the world: aviation.

The story of how used cooking oil made its way from trash bins to jet engines is one of persistence, vision, and stubborn belief. It is also the story of how Malaysia, through the work of FatHopes Energy, stood at the center of building the world’s first truly scalable used cooking oil supply chain. To understand how this unlikely waste stream became the bedrock of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, one must go back to the late 2000s, a time when the very idea was treated as laughable.

In 2007, when I first began speaking about the potential of used cooking oil as a biofuel feedstock, the reaction was almost universally dismissive. Policymakers smiled politely but quickly moved on to more serious topics like palm oil or rapeseed. Energy executives shook their heads and asked why anyone would bother with such a messy, inconsistent waste stream when clean, uniform crop oils were plentiful. Even within the emerging biofuels community, which prided itself on innovation, used cooking oil was considered marginal at best. The refrain was familiar: it was too dirty, too variable in quality, impossible to collect at scale, and unlikely ever to pass certification. Those who were generous called it an interesting curiosity. Those less charitable called it a distraction.

But I saw something different. I grew up surrounded by kitchens, hawker stalls, restaurants, and food factories that produced oil waste every single day. I saw that this material, ignored by everyone else, was everywhere and in enormous quantities. What others considered a liability, I saw as an untapped resource. Every bowl of fried noodles, every piece of fried chicken, every snack prepared on the streets generated a residue that could be captured, cleaned, and transformed into energy. If only a system existed to do so at scale, then this so-called waste could become a feedstock as significant as any crop oil.

The problem was not availability, but aggregation. There was no infrastructure to collect used cooking oil consistently. The market was dominated by informal traders operating in cash, with no concern for traceability, sustainability, or quality. Certification bodies were skeptical. Policymakers ignored it. Yet the kitchens kept producing it, day in and day out. I became convinced that the barrier was not the feedstock itself, but the absence of a structured supply chain. And so began the journey of building that system from the ground up.

The early years were brutal. Convincing vendors to give up their oil was difficult. Many saw no reason to part with it. Some disposed of it cheaply, others feared the hassle of collection, and almost none trusted that there would be a consistent buyer. On the other side, trying to persuade refiners or policymakers to take the material seriously was an even greater uphill battle. They asked why anyone would want to fuel vehicles, let alone aircraft, with fryer grease. The more polite audiences smiled at the idea; the harsher ones laughed openly. I was told repeatedly that aviation would never run on waste oils, that no regulator would approve it, and that even if it were technically possible, the economics would never make sense.

But every day I looked around me and saw proof that the skeptics were wrong. Waste oil was everywhere. The only thing missing was a system to channel it. And so I began to lay the foundations for what would later become FatHopes Energy’s defining achievement: the first large-scale, transparent, and traceable used cooking oil supply chain in Southeast Asia.

We started small, visiting eateries one by one, explaining the concept, offering to pay for the oil that would otherwise be discarded. It was slow and painstaking. Many were unconvinced. Some thought we were crazy. But a few agreed, and with each new vendor, the supply chain began to take shape. We invested in small collection trucks, later mini-tankers, designed to navigate narrow streets and pick up oil in small but regular volumes. We established depots where oil could be aggregated, filtered, tested, and stored safely before being exported. Week by week, month by month, the system grew. What began as an idea ridiculed by many began to take the shape of a functioning supply chain.

At the same time, I knew that building physical infrastructure was not enough. Perception had to change. Certification bodies had to be convinced. Policymakers had to be engaged. And so we began to travel relentlessly, taking the case for used cooking oil to every forum that would listen. From small workshops to major global conferences, I presented again and again on why wastes and residues, particularly UCO, represented the true sustainable pathway for biofuels. I argued that unlike crop oils, they did not displace food. Unlike fossil fuels, they did not add new carbon to the atmosphere. And unlike unregulated informal markets, a structured and certified system could provide trust and transparency. At first, the response was skeptical. But repetition matters. Presence matters. And gradually, the narrative began to shift.

By 2011, the first cracks in the wall of resistance began to appear. ASTM International, which sets the standards for aviation fuels, approved hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids — HEFA-SPK — as a blending component for jet fuel. This was the breakthrough. For the first time, lipid-based pathways, including those derived from used cooking oil, were officially recognized as viable for aviation. Around the same time, airlines began conducting their first demonstration flights on bio-jet blends. Some of these included UCO-derived fuels. What had seemed laughable only a few years before was now becoming a technical reality. The skepticism did not disappear overnight, but the door was open.

Even so, scaling remained daunting. Most of the global industry continued to rely on virgin vegetable oils as feedstocks. UCO volumes were small, fragmented, and uncertain. Certification remained complicated. Policymakers were slow to adapt. But the momentum had begun. And for FatHopes Energy, the mission was clear: prove that UCO could be aggregated at scale, prove that it could be certified, and prove that it could become a dependable cornerstone of biofuels.

In those years, conferences became our second home. From Amsterdam to London, from Singapore to Washington, I found myself on stages where the message was simple but urgent: wastes and residues must come first. The industry could not continue to lean on virgin oils if it wanted to claim sustainability with integrity. Again and again, I told rooms filled with skeptical faces that the fryer oil in their kitchens was the future of jet fuel. Slowly, the laughter faded. Slowly, the questions became less dismissive and more curious. How much volume could actually be collected? What would the cost structure look like? Could it really be scaled beyond niche markets?

To answer these questions, we had to show proof. We began publishing weekly buying prices, creating transparency in a market that had previously thrived on opacity. We expanded our fleet, optimized collection routes, and invested in depots that could handle growing volumes. Vendors who once distrusted us began to see that this was not a fly-by-night scheme but a genuine business model. They began to call us rather than wait for us to show up. Trust was forming, one vendor at a time, one liter at a time.

For refiners and policymakers, the credibility came from certification. We worked closely with ISCC to ensure that every drop could be traced, verified, and audited. We brought auditors to the depots, showed them the trucks, introduced them to the vendors. We proved that this was not theoretical but real. And gradually, UCO began to appear on official lists of recognized feedstocks. The once unthinkable was becoming accepted.

By 2013 and 2014, volumes were rising. European biodiesel plants were beginning to integrate UCO more consistently. The term “waste-based biodiesel” began appearing in regulatory documents. Airlines began exploring longer-term contracts for waste-based SAF. It was still early days, but the tide was turning. What had once been dismissed was now being considered. And in every forum, FatHopes Energy was there — not just as a participant but as the face of UCO.

As the supply chain matured, the importance of credibility only grew. Buyers in Europe and later in North America wanted assurances that the oil they were purchasing was truly waste and not disguised virgin palm or soy. The risk of fraud loomed large, and regulators were tightening their oversight. We recognized early on that if used cooking oil was to become a cornerstone feedstock, it could not rest on verbal promises or paper trails. It required traceability. This realization led us down a path that would become one of FatHopes Energy’s defining contributions to the industry: the development of a digital traceability system years before the world demanded it.

By 2016, we were investing heavily in digital infrastructure that would give us real-time visibility across the collection network. It was a bold move. Technology at the time was still catching up, and most operators were content with spreadsheets, receipts, and manual checks. But I was convinced that data integrity would become the single most important differentiator in the feedstock business. If you could prove origin, if you could show chain-of-custody, if you could quantify carbon savings, then you could build trust not only with refiners but also with regulators and airlines. Without it, growth would always be capped by suspicion.

We created a suite of applications that tied together vendors, drivers, rangers, and consumers in one ecosystem. Vendors could schedule collections, track payments, and monitor their performance through a mobile app. Drivers had an app that optimized their routes, accounted for truck capacity, and logged every collection in real time. Rangers, individuals who offered their homes or shops as collection points, could open and close their “stations” at optimal times suggested by AI to maximize income. Even consumers could participate, finding their nearest ranger and dropping off household UCO. Behind it all sat a back-end dashboard powered by algorithms that predicted waste generation, optimized collection schedules, and provided carbon accounting.

This was more than technology. It was a philosophy: transparency by design. Every liter collected had a digital footprint. Every handoff was recorded. Every vendor and driver could be rated, creating a feedback loop of accountability. Certification bodies embraced it because it made their job easier. Buyers loved it because it de-risked their purchases. And vendors, many of whom were small businesses or households, trusted it because it gave them clarity and fairness.

The industry did not yet realize it, but we had leapt ahead of the curve. Only years later, when “blockchain traceability” and “AI-powered supply chains” became buzzwords, did people begin to understand that we had been operating that way for years. What others described as future aspirations was, for us, already daily practice. This foresight gave us an enormous credibility advantage, and it strengthened our position as the global face of UCO.

At conferences in Europe and Asia, I began to notice a shift. The questions were no longer about whether UCO could be collected but about how much could be scaled, what costs looked like, and how quickly it could be integrated into aviation supply chains. Airlines that once dismissed the concept were now actively pursuing offtake agreements. Regulators who once ignored it were now writing it into their renewable energy directives. The narrative had flipped, and used cooking oil was suddenly in high demand.

But demand brought new challenges. As volumes increased, so did competition. Traders who had once dismissed UCO began to enter the market, some playing fair, others less so. The risk of adulteration — mixing virgin palm with UCO — increased as prices rose. This was precisely why our investment in digital traceability mattered. While others struggled to prove authenticity, we could show data, audits, and history. This gave us resilience and kept buyers loyal.

It also meant that we had to expand rapidly. By the late 2010s, our collection network stretched across Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and into other parts of Southeast Asia. Each country had its own dynamics, but the fundamentals were the same: waste oil was abundant, but it needed structure, trust, and certification. By building this across borders, we positioned Southeast Asia as a global hub for UCO exports, supplying refiners in Europe and North America with volumes they desperately needed to meet mandates.

The irony was striking. A feedstock once dismissed as too dirty and small-scale was now being shipped across oceans to power aircraft in some of the most advanced economies in the world. The same oil that once clogged drains in Kuala Lumpur or spoiled in drums behind hawker stalls was now certified, traceable, and refined into jet fuel for airlines in Frankfurt, San Francisco, and Singapore. What had changed was not the material itself but the systems around it — systems that we had built, often against the tide of skepticism.

As the world entered the 2020s, the urgency of aviation decarbonization became undeniable. The industry’s 2050 net-zero pledge, announced in 2021, made clear that sustainable aviation fuel would account for 65 percent of the sector’s required carbon reductions. The math was brutal: hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF would be required annually by mid-century. No single feedstock could deliver that volume, but in the near term, only HEFA — the pathway based on oils and fats — could scale fast enough to meet demand. And within HEFA, used cooking oil stood out as the most sustainable, most socially acceptable, and most credible source.

This realization drove demand through the roof. Airlines scrambled to sign long-term contracts. Governments introduced mandates. Investors poured money into refinery projects. Yet behind the headlines, the reality remained the same: without credible, large-scale collection of wastes like UCO, the system could not deliver. Once again, the work we had done years earlier positioned us at the center of the solution.

By this time, FatHopes Energy was no longer just a collector. We had become an ecosystem: a logistics company, a technology company, a certification partner, and a trusted voice on global platforms. At events like the World Economic Forum, Argus Biofuels, and countless policy summits, I spoke not as someone trying to convince the world that UCO mattered but as someone showing proof that it already did. We had lived through the skepticism, we had built the systems, and now we were scaling them.

The role of UCO in SAF was now indisputable. Volumes were measured in millions of tonnes annually. UCO-based HEFA SAF was being used on commercial flights around the world. Policymakers explicitly prioritized wastes and residues in their regulations, making UCO not only desirable but essential. In Europe, RED II mandated double-counting for UCO, effectively giving it a higher value. In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act created incentives that made waste-based SAF financially attractive. In Asia, countries like Singapore positioned themselves as refining hubs precisely because of their access to regional UCO flows.

Still, challenges persisted. Collection remained fragmented in many parts of the world. Fraud risks continued to haunt the industry. And the volumes, while impressive compared to a decade earlier, were still tiny compared to the total demand for jet fuel. UCO was never going to be the sole solution. But it was the best available bridge — the feedstock that could anchor SAF supply in the 2020s while other technologies matured. Without it, aviation’s net-zero targets would already be out of reach.

Looking back, the transformation is almost surreal. In 2007, I was told repeatedly that fryer grease would never fuel a plane. In 2025, the same material is considered indispensable to aviation’s future. The shift is not only technological but cultural. It reflects a broader rethinking of value: that what was once waste can be wealth, that sustainability is not about perfection but about pragmatism, and that sometimes the dirtiest feedstock can be the cleanest solution.

At conferences around the world, our presence became more than symbolic. It was a signal that used cooking oil had a voice, and that this voice came from Southeast Asia — a region that had long been overlooked in the global energy transition narrative. I stood on stages in Amsterdam, London, New York, and Beijing, often surrounded by representatives of the oil majors, government ministries, and large agricultural lobbies. Many of them still preferred to talk about rapeseed, soy, or palm. They had long histories, entrenched infrastructure, and powerful political backers. Yet our story was different. We were not offering a theory or an ambition. We were showing reality: real volumes, real trucks, real vendors, and real data.

It was not uncommon to be the lone voice advocating UCO in those early sessions. I remember vividly the looks I received when I would say that street hawkers in Kuala Lumpur were, in their own way, fuelling the future of aviation. Some chuckled, some shook their heads, but increasingly, some leaned forward and asked, “Tell us more.” Slowly, the skepticism began to transform into curiosity, and curiosity into belief. By being present, by telling our story over and over, we became the face of UCO.

Representation mattered because the world needed proof. On the ground in Malaysia, we were proving it by collecting thousands of liters every day. On the global stage, we were proving it by shifting narratives and persuading policymakers to enshrine UCO into law. At industry roundtables, when the debate turned to the sustainability of crop oils, I would remind them that waste streams like UCO had no food-versus-fuel controversy. When critics questioned scalability, I would point to our expanding network across Malaysia, Indonesia, and beyond. When certification bodies hesitated, I would walk them through our data, our audits, and our digital records. Piece by piece, we dismantled the objections that once seemed insurmountable.

But credibility in sustainability is fragile, and the higher the stakes, the higher the scrutiny. By the mid-2010s, as UCO volumes and prices increased, so too did the risks of fraud and manipulation. Stories began to surface of virgin oils being passed off as waste, of documents being forged, of middlemen cutting corners. These incidents threatened not only the reputations of individual companies but the credibility of UCO as a feedstock category. For us, this was a defining moment. If the integrity of the supply chain was compromised, all the work of the past decade could unravel.

This is why in 2016 we made the strategic leap into digital traceability. At the time, most of the industry was content with paperwork — receipts, delivery notes, audit visits once or twice a year. But we understood that the future would demand real-time verification. It would demand proof that could not be faked. And it would demand data that could withstand scrutiny from regulators, investors, and airlines alike.

We began building what would later be recognized as one of the most advanced digital ecosystems in the waste-to-biofuels industry. It was not just software; it was a philosophy of radical transparency. The vendor app gave small eateries and factories the ability to schedule pickups, track payments, and monitor their environmental impact. The driver app provided optimized routes, real-time volume logging, and performance tracking. Rangers, the community collectors who played such a crucial role in expanding access, were empowered with tools to decide when to open their collection points and how to maximize their returns. Even households, often overlooked in waste systems, were included through consumer-facing interfaces that allowed them to find the nearest drop-off points.

On the back end, we layered artificial intelligence to make the system smarter over time. It predicted which vendors would have oil ready and when, optimizing truck utilization and reducing wasted trips. It forecasted volumes across regions, enabling us to plan depot capacity and export flows more efficiently. And it calculated carbon savings with granularity, providing every stakeholder with a tangible measure of their contribution to decarbonization.

This digital ecosystem did more than make operations efficient. It made the supply chain trustworthy. Every collection created a digital footprint, geotagged and timestamped. Every liter could be traced back to its source. Every transaction was logged, and every stakeholder could be rated. This level of accountability transformed vendor relationships. For the first time, small restaurants and households could see their role in the global sustainability movement. They were no longer just disposing of waste; they were participants in the decarbonization of aviation.

For certification bodies, the platform was a gift. Auditors no longer had to rely on static paperwork. They could see live data, cross-check records, and verify claims with confidence. For refiners and airlines, it was a guarantee that the fuel they were buying was genuinely waste-based, not tainted by fraud. For regulators, it was proof that policy incentives were being directed at the right feedstocks. And for us, it was a shield — a way to defend the integrity of UCO even as the market grew more complex and competitive.

Looking back, this move was visionary. Today, in 2025, digital traceability has become an industry-wide buzzword. Everyone talks about blockchain, AI, and real-time verification. But we were practicing it nearly a decade earlier. That head start not only protected our credibility but positioned us as the standard-bearer for integrity in the UCO supply chain. When others speak of aspirations, we speak of experience. And that difference matters.

By the early 2020s, UCO had fully arrived on the global stage. Airlines that once ignored it were now signing long-term offtake agreements with refiners reliant on UCO. Policymakers in Europe, the UK, and the US had enshrined it in mandates and incentives. Analysts projected millions of tonnes of demand annually. The EU’s RED II directive gave UCO double-counting benefits, reflecting its sustainability advantages. The US Inflation Reduction Act created tax credits that made waste-based SAF commercially attractive. Singapore, leveraging its refining infrastructure, positioned itself as an Asian hub for SAF, reliant heavily on UCO imports. Everywhere one looked, UCO had gone from curiosity to cornerstone.

The carbon math was compelling. Lifecycle analyses showed that UCO-based HEFA SAF could deliver greenhouse gas savings of up to 80 percent compared to fossil jet fuel. Few other pathways could match that performance. Unlike crop oils, UCO carried no risk of indirect land-use change, one of the most contentious issues in biofuels. Unlike more experimental pathways, it was already proven at commercial scale. It was not just a good option; it was, in many ways, the best option available in the critical decade of the 2020s.

This did not mean the challenges disappeared. Fraud risks remained, particularly in regions without robust traceability. Collection was still fragmented in many countries, with vast volumes slipping through the cracks. Logistics costs were significant, and competition for feedstock was intense. And even at scale, UCO could only ever supply a fraction of global jet demand. But it was a vital fraction. It was the bridge that aviation desperately needed while other technologies matured. Without UCO, the industry’s 2030 targets would already be out of reach.

For us at FatHopes Energy, this was both validation and responsibility. We had spent more than a decade being told it was impossible, only to prove that it was not only possible but indispensable. We had fought battles for recognition, only to see policymakers now writing our arguments into law. We had built systems from scratch, only to see others scrambling to replicate them. And yet, the journey was far from over. Because while UCO had secured its place, the scale of the challenge ahead was immense. Aviation’s decarbonization would require not just millions but hundreds of millions of tonnes of SAF. UCO alone could not deliver that. But it could provide the foundation upon which the rest would be built.

When airlines began to move from trial flights to long-term commitments, the role of UCO shifted from symbolic to strategic. In the early 2010s, demonstration flights had been powerful but limited. Airlines such as KLM, Lufthansa, and United operated routes with small blends of bio-jet to show technical feasibility. These flights made headlines, but they were not yet commercially significant. By the late 2010s and early 2020s, however, the conversation changed. SAF was no longer a novelty — it was being integrated into decarbonization strategies, and UCO was at the center of these plans.

Consider the case of KLM. As one of the early movers in sustainable aviation, the Dutch carrier committed to incorporating SAF into its regular operations. In 2011, it operated its first commercial flight using a UCO-based blend. At the time, it was a milestone celebrated worldwide, but skeptics dismissed it as a stunt. Yet a decade later, KLM was investing in long-term SAF offtake agreements, much of which relied on HEFA fuels made from UCO. What had been symbolic had become structural.

In the United States, United Airlines took a similar path. It became the first airline to operate a commercial flight using a 100 percent SAF engine on one side, with fossil jet on the other for comparison. The SAF used was HEFA-based, produced in part from UCO. United then went on to sign multibillion-dollar offtake agreements with producers like World Energy and Neste. Each of these contracts hinged on the availability of reliable waste-based feedstocks — with UCO chief among them.

Singapore Airlines, positioned in a region where UCO availability was rich, became another case study. With its government committing to SAF as part of the nation’s green aviation strategy, Singapore Airlines secured SAF supplies from Neste’s Singapore refinery, one of the largest SAF production sites in the world. That refinery, which began operations in 2010 and later expanded specifically for SAF, relies heavily on imported UCO and residues from across Asia — including Malaysia. Here, geography mattered: Malaysia’s proximity and its established UCO collection systems made it a natural partner.

On the refining side, Neste’s story illustrates UCO’s centrality. Starting as a company focused on renewable diesel, Neste expanded into aviation by leveraging its expertise in HEFA pathways. By the 2020s, it had become the world’s largest producer of SAF, with UCO as a cornerstone feedstock. Its Singapore facility was strategically chosen not only for port access but for proximity to Southeast Asia’s vast waste oil flows. In California, World Energy’s Paramount facility followed a similar trajectory, converting refineries once used for fossil fuels into hubs for UCO-based SAF. These facilities demonstrated that scaling SAF was not a dream but a reality — provided feedstock supply chains were credible and reliable.

All of this underscored the irony of UCO’s journey. A material once dismissed as unsuitable, unscalable, and even laughable was now underwriting contracts worth billions of dollars, influencing government policy, and fueling the planes of some of the world’s largest carriers. For those of us who had fought the early battles, it was vindication — but also a reminder of the responsibility we carried.

Scaling UCO for SAF was never going to be without its challenges. Even at peak efficiency, the global pool of used cooking oil is limited by human behavior. The amount of UCO available is a function of how much food is fried, processed, and cooked in oil. Analysts estimate that globally, UCO availability could reach perhaps 30 million tonnes per year. That is a significant number, but it is small compared to total aviation demand, which exceeds 300 million tonnes of jet fuel annually. This means that while UCO can anchor SAF supply in the 2020s, it cannot be the sole solution for 2050. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch, and eventually power-to-liquids — must mature and scale.

Yet this limitation does not diminish UCO’s importance. Quite the opposite. Because the 2020s are the critical decade for SAF adoption, UCO is the feedstock that buys the world time. It provides the credibility, the carbon savings, and the volumes necessary to bridge aviation into the future. Without UCO, the 2030 blending mandates in Europe and the United States would be unattainable. Without UCO, airline decarbonization strategies would be hollow. Without UCO, SAF would remain a promise rather than a practice.

For Malaysia, this presented a profound opportunity. Unlike many countries, Malaysia was blessed with abundant access to UCO and other residues. Its dense urban centers — Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Johor Bahru — generated massive quantities of waste oil daily. Its food and beverage industry, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, contributed consistently to the supply. Its geographic location on the Straits of Malacca made it an ideal hub for aggregation and export. And critically, its industrial workforce, trained in the oleochemical and palm industries, already possessed the skills needed to handle lipid feedstocks at scale.

This combination of resources, infrastructure, and talent meant that Malaysia could be more than just a supplier of raw UCO. It could become a refining hub — turning waste oil into finished SAF for domestic airlines and for export across the region and beyond. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang exemplified this vision. Situated at one of the busiest transshipment hubs in the world, such a facility could leverage not only Malaysia’s domestic feedstock but also UCO flows from neighboring countries. It could serve as the anchor for a regional SAF ecosystem, positioning Malaysia as the leader of Southeast Asia’s contribution to aviation decarbonization.

Of course, leadership required more than infrastructure. It required credibility. This was where FatHopes Energy’s early investments in traceability paid dividends. By proving that UCO could be collected, certified, and digitally tracked at scale, we gave Malaysia an edge over competitors. When global refiners or airlines considered sourcing feedstock, they looked not only at volume but at integrity. They wanted assurance that the oil was real, that it was sustainable, and that it would withstand regulatory audits. By offering that assurance, Malaysia could distinguish itself in a crowded and competitive market.

The case for Malaysia’s leadership became even stronger with its upcoming chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025. As the region’s chair, Malaysia would have the platform to drive policy harmonization on SAF, encouraging neighboring countries to align on certification, traceability, and trade rules. This could unlock regional feedstock flows, reduce duplication, and build confidence among international buyers. Rather than competing in silos, ASEAN nations could present a unified front, with Malaysia at the helm. The potential impact was enormous. A coordinated ASEAN SAF strategy, anchored in Malaysia’s Port Klang refinery, could transform the region into a global hub, rivaling Europe and the United States.

For all of this to succeed, however, action was required. Policies needed to incentivize collection and refining. Investments needed to be mobilized for infrastructure. Airlines needed to sign binding offtake agreements that gave financiers confidence. And the public needed to be engaged, understanding that even the oil left over from household cooking could play a role in fueling planes sustainably. FatHopes Energy had already built much of the foundation — the collection networks, the traceability systems, the credibility. But scaling to the level aviation demanded required collective effort.

When I reflect on the journey from 2007 to 2025, I am struck by how much has changed and yet how much remains the same. The skepticism has faded, replaced by enthusiasm. The infrastructure has matured, with global refineries now running on UCO. The policy environment has shifted, with mandates and incentives in place. And yet, the work is still about convincing, building, and scaling. We no longer need to prove that UCO works. We now need to prove that it can meet the world’s urgent demand.

The future of used cooking oil in the SAF supply chain will not be without tension. On one hand, UCO has achieved what few could have imagined even a decade ago: it has become the cornerstone of aviation’s decarbonization strategy in the 2020s. On the other hand, its inherent limitations remind us that it cannot carry the weight of the industry alone. The global availability of UCO, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is capped. By 2030, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF production to rise to around 30 million tonnes annually. UCO, at best, could account for one-third of that. By 2050, when aviation requires hundreds of millions of tonnes, UCO’s contribution will be proportionally smaller.

But the measure of UCO’s importance is not its ultimate volume share. It is the role it plays as a foundation. Without UCO, the SAF industry would lack the bridge feedstock it needs in this critical decade. Other pathways — alcohol-to-jet, Fischer–Tropsch from municipal waste, and eventually power-to-liquids from renewable hydrogen and captured carbon — will take years, even decades, to mature at scale. UCO is here now. It is available, it is certified, it is proven. That makes it indispensable.

The 2030s will likely be the decade when alternative pathways begin to come online in earnest. Already, pilot projects for e-fuels are producing small volumes, and FT plants using agricultural residues are being tested. But scaling them to tens of millions of tonnes will take enormous investment and political will. In the meantime, UCO will remain the backbone of SAF supply. Its role may evolve — perhaps supplying 20–25 percent of global SAF in 2030, and 10–15 percent by 2040 — but it will always be the feedstock that made the transition possible.

This reality is both comforting and challenging. Comforting, because it validates the work of those who spent decades building the UCO supply chain. Challenging, because it underscores the responsibility we bear to maximize its impact today. Every liter collected matters. Every vendor onboarded matters. Every household that participates matters. The success of aviation’s decarbonization in the 2020s hinges on whether UCO systems are robust, credible, and scalable. That is why FatHopes Energy continues to push relentlessly for expansion, innovation, and collaboration.

Malaysia’s role in this future is clear. With its combination of feedstock availability, geographic advantage, and industrial expertise, it is positioned to be more than just a participant. It can be the leader. The development of a SAF refinery in Port Klang is not just a business venture; it is a national project, one that symbolizes Malaysia’s ambition to stand at the forefront of the energy transition. Positioned at one of the busiest maritime crossroads in the world, the refinery will have access not only to domestic UCO but to flows from across Southeast Asia. With digital traceability ensuring integrity, and with global airlines hungry for supply, Port Klang can become the beating heart of SAF in Asia.

ASEAN leadership further amplifies this opportunity. In 2025, as chair of ASEAN, Malaysia has the chance to drive regional harmonization of SAF policies. Imagine a Southeast Asia where feedstock definitions are aligned, certification systems are interoperable, and trade barriers are minimized. Imagine a bloc that presents itself to the world not as fragmented markets but as a unified hub for waste-based SAF. The impact would be transformative. It would give global airlines confidence. It would attract investment. And it would ensure that Southeast Asia’s vast potential for waste-based feedstocks is fully realized.

For Malaysia, the strategic calculus is also compelling. While the nation has invested heavily in data centers, palm oil, and other industries, SAF provides a hedge — a sector with global demand, geopolitical relevance, and long-term growth. Unlike physical infrastructure projects that may lose competitiveness, SAF is tied directly to the world’s decarbonization agenda. Aviation will not stop flying; it will only seek cleaner fuels. By embedding itself in that future, Malaysia ensures resilience, relevance, and prosperity.

None of this is theoretical. The work has already begun. FatHopes Energy’s traceability systems are operational. Vendors across the region are already participating. Depots are in place, mini-tankers are running, exports are flowing. Certification bodies recognize the integrity of the system. Airlines are signing contracts. Refiners are expanding capacity. The foundation is solid. What is required now is acceleration — more investment, more policy support, more stakeholder engagement.

When I reflect on 2007, the contrast is striking. Back then, I stood in rooms where people laughed at the idea that fryer grease could fuel planes. Today, the same people — or their successors — speak of UCO as indispensable. The laughter is gone, replaced by urgency. The dismissal has turned into demand. What changed was not the feedstock itself but the belief around it. Belief that it could be collected, that it could be certified, that it could be trusted. That belief was not given; it was built. It was built through years of persistence, through data, through presence, and through proving it again and again.

The story of UCO is not just about waste oil. It is about reimagining value. It is about taking something discarded and making it essential. It is about challenging entrenched assumptions and proving that alternatives are possible. It is about the stubborn conviction that sustainability is not only necessary but achievable — if we are willing to do the work.

Looking forward, I see UCO continuing to play this role — not as the sole solution, but as the anchor. It will remain the feedstock that underwrites credibility, that sustains momentum, that bridges us into a future of diverse SAF pathways. Malaysia will remain central to this story, not only as a supplier but as a leader. And FatHopes Energy will remain committed to the mission we began nearly two decades ago: to prove that waste is not waste, that transparency is power, and that persistence can turn the unthinkable into the indispensable.

As aviation races toward 2050, the stakes could not be higher. Climate change is no longer a distant threat; it is a lived reality. Aviation’s social license to operate depends on decarbonization. Passengers, policymakers, and investors are watching closely. In this context, SAF is not a choice but a necessity. And within SAF, used cooking oil is not an afterthought but a foundation.

To all stakeholders — governments, airlines, refiners, vendors, and consumers — the call is clear: act now. Collect every liter. Certify every drop. Invest in every depot, every refinery, every piece of digital infrastructure. Do not wait for the perfect solution. Do not wait for tomorrow’s technologies to mature. Use what we have today, and scale it. Because every liter of UCO-based SAF used this decade is a liter of fossil fuel avoided, a ton of CO₂ not emitted, a step closer to the net-zero future we owe our children.

The journey from 2007 to 2025 is proof that change is possible. The journey from 2025 to 2050 will determine whether it is enough.

Denver International Airport is not simply updating facilities; it is reimagining the role of airports in a sustainable, interconnected world.","Denver International Airport (DEN) is one of the most ambitious airports in the world today. Located on the high plains of Colorado, surrounded by the Rocky Mountains, Denver is not only the largest airport site in North America but also the second largest by landmass globally. Its size gives it unique opportunities, and equally unique challenges, as it seeks to redefine what a 21st century airport should look like.

With passenger numbers surging, infrastructure ageing and environmental responsibilities intensifying, Denver’s leadership has set out an ambitious vision: to become the greenest airport in the world, while managing growth. Leading this effort include Phil Washington, Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Oldham, Senior Director of Asset Management, who together are shaping Denver towards a sustainable, technologically advanced future.

Declaring a green ambition

When Phil Washington assumed the role of CEO nearly four years ago, he made a decisive statement of intent: Denver Airport would become the world’s most sustainable airport.

“One of the first things I declared was that we wanted to be the greenest airport in the world,” Washington explained. “So, we immediately took action. Expanding our solar array, plugging 54 abandoned oil wells on airport property, and pushing forward partnerships with airlines on sustainable aviation fuel.”

These early interventions have already yielded visible results. The capped wells removed a legacy environmental hazard from the site, while the expanded solar infrastructure significantly boosted renewable capacity. Washington is quick to acknowledge, however, that sustainability at Denver is an ongoing process rather than a finished goal.

“We are well on our way, but there’s a lot more to do,” he admitted. “Every new project, every new system we implement, is viewed through a sustainability lens.”

Cutting carbon, saving energy

One of the most impactful measures has been Denver’s performance energy contract. An initiative designed to drive efficiency across the airport’s growing facilities. This includes simple but effective technologies, such as automated lighting systems that switch off when rooms are unoccupied, and broader upgrades to heating, ventilation and energy systems.

“These improvements will save us millions of dollars over the next decade,” Washington said. “But they also reduce reliance on fossil fuels, cutting emissions in line with our goal of reducing greenhouse gases by 80% by 2050.”

The push towards sustainability is multifaceted. Denver is actively transitioning its vehicle fleet to electric models, exploring advanced generator technologies that meet stricter environmental standards and pursuing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) collaborations with carriers. Together, these initiatives represent a comprehensive strategy to future-proof airport operations against both economic and climate pressures.

Land as a strategic advantage

A defining feature of Denver Airport is its size. With more land than any other airport in the world except one in Saudi Arabia (King Salaman International Airport), Denver is uniquely positioned to explore large-scale sustainability projects.

“Because we have so much land, we can set an example for the entire world in terms of sustainability,” Washington noted. “It gives us the flexibility to trial renewable energy, rethink infrastructure layouts, and invite private-sector innovators to use our airport as a proving ground.”

This open approach is formalised through the Centre for Equity and Excellence in Aviation (CEEA). A new initiative with three pillars: career development, research and innovation, and business development.

The CEEA has three core missions, all designed to expand aviation’s role in both the local and global economy:

Career pathways: creating structured opportunities for young people from surrounding communities to enter aviation professions, whether as pilots, aircraft mechanics, or engineers.

Research and innovation: studying aviation ‘megatrends’ such as climate change, demographic shifts and technological disruption, while welcoming private companies to bring forward new sustainability ideas.

Business development training: supporting historically underutilised businesses through a nine-week academy, equipping them with the knowledge to compete in the aviation supply chain.

“We’ve already started the curriculum,” Washington explained. “And we’re building a dedicated brick-and-mortar facility that will be complete by the end of 2025. This is about preparing the workforce and the industry for the future.”

CEEA also extends Denver’s ambitions internationally. As part of efforts to establish direct flights to Africa, Washington envisions the centre as a vehicle for knowledge exchange: “If we launch routes to Ethiopia, Ghana, or Senegal, we don’t just connect people, we share infrastructure expertise and training that can help develop aviation in those countries too.”

Asset management: planning for the next 30 years

This is where Brian Oldham’s asset management expertise comes in. Since joining Denver two years ago, Oldham has implemented a risk-based asset management programme with a 30-year timeline.

“The programme lets us prioritise replacements based on business risk,” Oldham explained. “We can predict when assets will fail, how much it will cost, and which year we’ll need to replace them.”

A critical tool in this strategy is Denver’s Operational Readiness and Transition (ORAT) programme, ensuring every new system or facility is seamlessly integrated into operations from day one. Staff training, operational manuals and asset data are all secured before handover, avoiding delays and gaps in knowledge.

This forward-looking philosophy is changing the way airports approach infrastructure. As Oldham emphasised: “Asset management isn’t just a maintenance tool, it’s a way of thinking. It’s about life-cycle planning and predictive capability.”

Both Washington and Oldham believe technology will transform airport operations. Denver is investing in IoT sensors to collect real-time data from across the airport, feeding into AI systems that can predict failures before they happen.

“We want to know when an asset is going to break down, not chase after it once it has,” Washington stated. “By combining conditional assessments with AI, we can create a predictive environment that keeps our infrastructure reliable.”

Oldham added that AI and machine learning will be vital for handling the complexity of Denver’s mix of ageing and newly built assets: “We can build models that say, ‘The last three times this pump failed, these four events occurred in the two weeks beforehand.’ That insight changes everything.”

Exploring nuclear power: a radical energy solution

Perhaps the boldest idea on the table is Denver’s exploration of small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) to meet future power needs. The airport currently consumes about 50 megawatts of power, but projections suggest it will need 400 megawatts by 2045.

“There’s not an easy way to achieve that growth with traditional sources,” Oldham explained. “SMRs could allow us to meet our own demand, provide heating for facilities, and even sell surplus power back to the grid.”

The concept is still in its infancy in the US, with studies ongoing, but international examples are emerging. If realised, Denver could become the first airport in the world powered by nuclear energy, making it both 100% green and fully energy self-sufficient.

As of August 2025, the airport has Request for Proposals (RFP) to study the feasibility of building a small modular (nuclear) reactor (SMR) on the airport’s campus.

Washington sees it as consistent with the airport’s role as a pioneer: “We have the land and the ambition to trial bold solutions. Nuclear could be part of a future that makes aviation both cleaner and more resilient.”

The challenges ahead

Despite progress, challenges remain. Oldham pointed out that many airports are only beginning to grasp the true value of asset management. “Some think a maintenance management system equals asset management. It doesn’t. It’s just a tool. Asset management is a philosophy.”

Meanwhile, Washington emphasised that growth pressures will continue to test DEN’s capacity: “We’re one of the few airports simultaneously expanding and refurbishing at scale while passenger numbers keep rising. That’s not easy.”

Both agree that communication, between internal stakeholders, contractors, regulators, and the public, will be critical in maintaining transparency and trust throughout Denver’s transformation.

Denver International Airport is not simply updating facilities; it is reimagining the role of airports in a sustainable, interconnected world. From solar power and electric fleets to predictive AI systems and even the possibility of nuclear power, DEN is setting new benchmarks in innovation and environmental stewardship.

As Washington reflected: “We have the land, the ambition and the partnerships to make Denver the greenest airport in the world. With innovation and collaboration, we’ll get there.”

Oldham echoed the sentiment from an infrastructure perspective: “If we get life-cycle management right from day one, we’re not just saving costs, we’re building resilience for the next 30 years and beyond.”

Together, their vision presents not only a roadmap for Denver, but a potential blueprint for airports worldwide facing the dual challenges of ageing infrastructure and rising demand.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/DIA-peaks.gif,N,,2025-10-03 11:59:17.907042

Notably, Delhi was chosen as the pilot site as Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery supplies aviation turbine fuel to a dedicated depot meant for the airport through a pipeline.
Overall, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).
“India has the capacity to become a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister asserted, adding that SAF production in India is projected to exceed domestic demand, thereby positioning the country as a major exporter.
Currently, India’s refining capacity enables it to export 50 per cent of its aviation turbine fuel (ATF) production.","India is set to launch a pilot project to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) available at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport.

In technical terms, SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived jet fuel that meets sustainability criteria.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery.

The SAF blend will be produced by using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathway, with feedstock such as used cooking oil or even rice straw (parali).

Notably, Delhi was chosen as the pilot site as Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery supplies aviation turbine fuel to a dedicated depot meant for the airport through a pipeline.

“That is the beauty of SAF. You don’t have to change the infrastructure to implement it. It’s like fossil fuel,” said Jane Hupe, Deputy Director, Environment Branch, Air Transport Bureau, UN body International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Huge advantage

Hupe pointed out that the existing pipeline gives India a huge advantage, as it avoids the need for costly new transport and distribution systems.

“So, the infrastructure that they already have to produce and distribute the fuel to the airport can also be used for SAF, and that’s a big plus for this technology,” Hupe told businessline.

Overall, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This scheme is being implemented in three phases, with participation voluntary between 2021 and 2026.

India has chosen not to participate in the voluntary phases. However, offsetting requirements under CORSIA for Indian carriers will begin in 2027.

The scheme applies to international flights originating from one country and landing in another.

Indicative targets

Accordingly, the Centre plans to implement the scheme with indicative targets of a one per cent SAF blend in ATF starting in 2027, increasing to two per cent in 2028, and eventually reaching five per cent by 2030.

In addition, India is in the process of framing a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and utilisation of SAF.

Last month, speaking to businessline, Union Civil Aviation Minister K. Ram Mohan Naidu emphasised that India holds a natural advantage in this segment.

“The first advantage is our geography, which allows us to become an exporter, and the second is the massive availability of feedstock,” Naidu said.

At present, India has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue that can be used to produce SAF.

“India has the capacity to become a global leader in SAF production,” the Minister asserted, adding that SAF production in India is projected to exceed domestic demand, thereby positioning the country as a major exporter.

Currently, India’s refining capacity enables it to export 50 per cent of its aviation turbine fuel (ATF) production.

“So it is natural for us to pursue this subject, given our commitment to sustainability,” he said.

She emphasises how CO₂-derived solutions can succeed where past alternatives failed by combining scalability with functionality and cost-efficiency. On the aviation front, she highlights LanzaTech’s unique positioning across multiple Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) pathways, backed by regulatory momentum in the U.S., EU, India, and China. She underscores the role of policy levers—from carbon pricing to long-term offtake agreements—in accelerating carbon-based SAF to commercial parity with fossil jet fuel. Looking ahead, Dr Jennifer Holmgren envisions a 2035 where airlines fly on CO₂-derived fuels and supermarket shelves carry carbon-based palm oil substitutes, marking a decisive shift toward a circular carbon economy.

LanzaTech has long been synonymous with carbon-to-fuels. With this palm oil alternative, you’re now reshaping supply chains beyond energy. How did this pivot emerge, and what does it signal about LanzaTech’s evolution ?

The pivot from a focus strictly on carbon-to-fuels to reshaping broader supply chains emerged as LanzaTech identified the critical need and opportunity for sustainable alternatives in global markets dependent on high-impact raw materials like palm oil. We have previously worked on chemicals such as ethylene that play a key role in the textiles space. This strategic shift signals LanzaTech’s evolution from a company focused solely on carbon recycling for energy purposes to a broader provider of sustainable solutions across various industries. It reflects a response to the need for systemic changes in supply networks that extend beyond energy.

Palm oil is arguably one of the world’s most entrenched commodities. Why do you believe this innovation could succeed where decades of alternatives have struggled ?

The unique aspect of this innovation lies in its ability to meet the functional needs of industries currently dependent on palm oil, coupled with a sustainable production method. Decades of alternatives have struggled due to scalability, cost-efficiency, or failing to meet functional requirements. LanzaTech’s technology leverages carbon waste as a feedstock, which is abundantly available, from waste CO2 to agricultural and forestry residues, thereby potentially undercutting the economic and environmental costs of palm oil production while maintaining the needed chemical properties.

The SAF market is projected to hit $250+ billion by 2050. Where does LanzaTech’s platform fit into that growth compared to legacy SAF technologies ?

LanzaTech is exceptionally positioned to capitalise on the burgeoning $250+ billion SAF market by 2050, thanks to our ability to engage with all key SAF production pathways, including Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), and Power-to-Liquid (PtL). Unlike legacy SAF technologies that often depend on specific feedstocks or face scalability limits, our versatile platform utilizes industrial off-gases and waste carbon, converting them into ethanol—a flexible and scalable intermediary for SAF production. This approach aligns perfectly with evolving global regulations that prioritize waste and residue-based fuels. By integrating into diverse markets and adapting to varied regulatory and raw material landscapes, we’re not just participating in the SAF market growth; we are actively driving it forward and setting new standards for sustainable aviation fuels.

Airlines are desperate for scalable, affordable SAF. What are the economics of CO₂-derived HEFA oils versus conventional feedstocks like palm, or soy ?

The economics of CO₂-derived HEFA oils could prove advantageous compared to conventional feedstocks due to lower raw material costs (captured carbon versus agricultural products) and potentially lower processing costs. These factors, combined with increasing regulatory support for low-carbon alternatives, could make CO₂-derived oils a scalable, affordable option for the aviation sector.

With the U.S. and EU offering billions in SAF subsidies and blending mandates, what policy levers are still missing to bring carbon-based SAF to parity with fossil jet fuel ?

Price Stabilisation Mechanisms: Establishing floor prices or minimum subsidy guarantees can stabilize the market and attract sustained investments.

Enhanced Tax Credits and Incentives: Increasing the value or duration of tax credits for carbon-based SAF could accelerate adoption and infrastructure investments.

Carbon Pricing: Implementing a robust carbon pricing system for fossil fuels can make SAF more economically viable by reflecting the true cost of carbon emissions.

Streamlined Regulatory Approvals: Simplifying the approval process for new SAF facilities can reduce the time and cost of market entry.

Public-Private Partnerships: Encouraging collaborative efforts between the public sector, private industry, and academia can share risks and facilitate technological exchange.

Long-term Offtake Agreements: Government-led long-term agreements can provide SAF producers with market stability and financial predictability.

Global Alignment on SAF Standards: Harmonizing international SAF standards can reduce compliance costs and facilitate global trade.

These policy adjustments can create a more favorable environment for carbon-based SAF, helping bridge the gap to fossil jet fuels and supporting the aviation sector’s transition to sustainable practices.

Europe is tightening deforestation-linked import bans; the U.S. is ramping up SAF credits. How do regulatory tailwinds in different geographies shape your commercialization roadmap ?

The EU’s mandate of a 2 per cent blend of SAF escalating to 6 per cent by 2030 creates a sizable, stable demand for SAF, particularly beneficial for LanzaTech’s recycled carbon fuels. Furthermore, the specific sub-mandate for e-SAF (PtL) channels LanzaTech into a niche but growing segment of the SAF market, especially as green hydrogen availability increases, allowing us to extend our offerings in the EU market.

The UK’s increasing SAF mandates, expected to reach 10 per cent by 2030, combined with a specific cap on HEFA-feedstock SAF and a premium placed on advanced SAF solutions like ours, tailor a unique advantage for LanzaTech.

India’s evolving SAF mandate, which anticipates a rise to 5 per cent by 2030, opens a new and burgeoning market for LanzaTech’s fuels derived from industrial off-gases and waste biomass. Our products qualify under the National Biofuels Policy, positioning us to be a key player in helping India achieve its SAF targets while supporting our expansion strategy in a highly populous and growing aviation market. By increasing the production of biofuels from waste carbon including agricultural residues, India can reduce its dependency on oil imports and promote energy sufficiency. This aligns with the Government of India’s targets under the National Biofuel Policy, aiming to increase the blend of biofuels in the energy mix.

Each region’s specific policy approach guides our focus and commercial exertions, enabling us to adapt and prioritize product lines and collaborations that align with regional SAF demand projections and policy incentives. This targeted approach enhances our ability to capitalize on emerging opportunities for growth and impact in the global SAF market.

How close are we to a carbon circular economy ?

With innovations like the palm oil substitute, we’re moving closer to a carbon circular economy by displacing ecologically harmful commodities. Transforming wastes into valuable products aligns with rethinking carbon as a resource, and promoting utilization of recycled carbon. There are several ways India’s unique agriculture sector can benefit from embracing these innovative technologies.

India generates a substantial amount of agricultural residues, like straw from rice and wheat, which often get burnt, contributing to severe air pollution issues, especially in Northern India. LanzaTech’s technology can convert these residues into valuable products such as ethanol, which can then be used to produce SAF or other biochemicals. This not only helps in reducing air pollution but also adds an economic value to what is otherwise considered waste.

By setting up bio-refineries that leverage local agricultural residues, there can be significant job creation in rural areas and the use of ethanol and other byproducts from bio-refineries can incentivize sustainable agricultural practices.

Will fossil and deforestation-linked commodities still dominate by 2035 ?

By 2035, I envision a world where airlines predominantly use CO₂-derived fuels and supermarket shelves are lined with sustainable, CO₂-based palm oil substitutes (and recycled carbon replaces virgin fossil carbon throughout!). This scenario is not just feasible; it’s within our grasp with continuous technological advancements and favorable regulatory environments.

We are pioneering a shift towards a circular carbon economy, turning carbon waste into a valuable resource. Our commitment to innovation and collaboration is paving the way for global transformations in both the aviation sector and consumer markets. Achieving this vision will depend on the scale of deployment, strong global partnerships, and maintaining an economic advantage over traditional commodities. Together, we are setting a legacy of sustainability, ensuring ecological responsibility and economic prosperity coexist, spearheading a sustainable era for generations to come.",https://agrospectrumindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sustainable_aviation_fuel_wallpaper.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 11:59:31.088700

Abstract

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a drop-in alternative to conventional jet fuels, designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while requiring minimal infrastructure changes and certification under the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D7566 standard. This study assesses recently identified high-energy-density (HED) strained polycycloalkanes as SAF candidates. Strain energy (Ese) was calculated using density functional theory (DFT), while operational properties such as boiling point (BP) and flash point (FP) were predicted using support vector regression (SVR) models. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance (R2 > 0.96) with mean absolute errors of 6.92 K for BP and 9.58 K for FP, with robustness sensitivity analysis. It is found that approximately 65% of these studied polycycloalkanes fall within the Jet A fuel property boundaries. The polycycloalkanes (C9–C15) with strain energies below approximately 60 kcal/mol achieve an balance between energy density and ignition safety, aligning with the specifications of Jet A. The majority of structures were dominated by five-membered rings, with a few three- or four-membered rings enhancing favorable trade-offs among BP, FP, and HED. This early pre-screening indicates that moderately strained polycycloalkanes are safe, energy-dense candidates for next-generation sustainable jet fuels and provide a framework for designing high-performance SAFs.

1. Introduction

The rapid growth of the aviation industry is expected to drive a significant increase in global aviation fuel demand, which is projected to more than double by 2050 [1], intensifying both demand and environmental concerns. As a result, it is crucial to develop SAF to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and to mitigate the impact of GHG emissions. These developments are becoming particularly essential as the aviation industry seeks all viable pathways, including electrification techniques and hydrogen propulsion, as other alternatives to achieve sustainability [2,3,4]. Among the available options, SAF offers a more practical solution, providing an intermediate reduction in carbon emissions of up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel [5].

SAF must meet the stringent safety and performance standards set by the ASTM D7566 [3,6]. Currently, seven ASTM-approved pathways for the production of SAF [7] include Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) and FT-SPK with aromatics (FT-SPK/A), bio-based routes such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA-SPK) and catalytic hydrothermolysis jet fuel (HC-HEFA-SPK), hydroprocessed fermented sugars to synthetic iso-paraffins (HFS-SIP), alcohol-to-jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene (ATJ-SPK), and fuels derived from the hydrothermal conversion of fatty acids (CHJ) [3,8]. Each of these pathways represents the leading technologies for SAF production, each with distinct feedstocks and processing methods, while all adhering to the rigorous performance and safety standards required for aviation use [2,3,4,9,10]. Blending SAFs with conventional jet fuels—up to 50% by volume—can preserve critical properties such as HED and favorable O-ring swelling, both of which are essential for optimal engine performance [3,9,10,11]. However, incomplete combustion of these blends can result in substantial soot and particulate emissions, highlighting a trade-off between achieving performance standards and minimizing environmental impact [2,9].

To address these challenges, strained polycycloalkanes have emerged as promising HED SAF candidates [2,3,12]. Their unique molecular structures and synthetic accessibility contribute to enhanced energy performance, with the potential to increase both volumetric specific energy and energy density [2]. These properties are critical in aviation due to the limited fuel capacity of Jets, where a higher energy content directly translates to greater payload capacity and extended flight range [2,4]. In particular, alkanes (paraffins) are saturated hydrocarbons consisting of carbon–carbon (C–C) and carbon-hydrogen (C–H) single bonds, which confer greater chemical bond energy compared to unsaturated hydrocarbons. Alkanes burn more cleanly than alkenes, producing less soot and particulate emissions [13]. This results in lower engine deposits and reduced maintenance requirements for aviation engines, enhancing overall efficiency and performance [14].

The inherent stability of alkanes supports energy storage and combustion safety. In addition to increasing energy density [2,3,11,12,15,16,17,18], structural strain within polycyclic alkanes can also alter fuel properties that are critical for efficiency and operational safety. For example, JP-10—exo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene (C10H16), an HED synthetic strained polycycloalkane fuel primarily used in military applications—exhibits superior combustion characteristics and operational performance compared to conventional Jet A aviation fuel in commercial use [2,3,18]. Optimizing strained hydrocarbons for aviation applications requires a careful design to balance energy output with operational safety. However, despite their potential to be HED fuels, the safety profiles of these polycycloalkane candidates remain underexplored. To ensure their viability as SAF, these compounds must also satisfy ASTM D7566/D4054 certification standards [6,19], which set rigorous thresholds for key physicochemical and operational properties, including specific energy (SE ≥ 42.80 MJ/kg), density (0.76–0.84 g/mL at 288.15 K), freezing point (FrP ≤ 226.15), (FP ≥ 311.15 K), and (BP ~ 433.15–573.15 K) [12]. In practice, consistently meeting the stringent FrP, FP, and density requirements, along with compatibility tests such as O-ring swell, remains particularly challenging for many candidates.

In one of our previous studies, we identified several HED-strained hydrocarbons as promising candidates for aviation fuel applications [2]. In this work, we employed DFT calculations [20] to analyze the molecular structures and Ese of a selected group of polycycloalkane SAF candidates. We then employed machine learning (ML) techniques [21,22] and the group contribution (GC) method [23,24] to predict key fuel properties. Subsequently, we evaluated quantitative structure–property relationships (QSPR), specifically the BP and FP. This computational evaluation supports early-stage pre-screening of SAF candidates and assesses their safety for aviation applications, in accordance with ASTM D7566 [6] and D4045 standards [19]. This comprehensive assessment aims to accelerate SAF development through the optimization of synthetic pathways.

2. Computational and Predictive Methods

2.1. Target Polycycloalkanes and Strain Energy Calculation

Twenty selected strained HED polycycloalkanes, identified as potential SAF candidates through ML [2], are evaluated further for aviation fuel properties. These candidates are listed as entries 1–20 in Table S2 of the Supplementary Materials (SM), with their corresponding structures shown in Figure 1.

Ese in hydrocarbons refers to the extra energy stored in a molecule due to distortions in its bond angles, bond lengths, or torsional angles from their ideal, low-energy conformations. The total Ese of a compound is typically the result of several contributing factors [25], including bond strain, angle strain (also called Baeyer strain), torsional strain, and steric strain (or van der Waals/Prelog strain). Bond strain occurs when chemical bonds are stretched or compressed beyond their optimal lengths. This type of strain is energetically costly and uncommon in stable organic molecules. Molecules generally adopt conformations that minimize bond strain, as the high energy cost associated with it is unfavorable. Angle strain (also called Baeyer strain) is caused by deviations from ideal bond angles (e.g., 109.5° in sp3-hybridized carbon) [26]. While angle strain contributes to the overall energy of a molecule, it is generally less severe than torsional or steric strain. Torsional strain, also known as eclipsing or Pitzer strain, results from eclipsed interactions between adjacent bonds, where atoms or groups are aligned in a way that leads to increased electron repulsion. Torsional strain often contributes significantly to the overall strain energy of a molecule. Steric strain (or van der Waals/Prelog strain) occurs when atoms are forced close together, leading to repulsion between electron clouds [26]. A specific type of steric strain, known as transannular strain, is common in medium-sized rings, where non-bonded atoms across the ring interact unfavorably.

Cyclic hydrocarbons adopt conformations that minimize the total Ese by balancing various types of strain [25]. Since bond strain is particularly destabilizing, molecules typically avoid it by tolerating more manageable forms of strain, namely torsional, steric, and angle strain. Cyclic compounds are classified as small rings with (three- or four-membered), common rings with (five- to seven-membered), medium rings with (eight- to eleven-membered), and large rings with (twelve- or more-membered). Rings of similar sizes tend to have comparable characteristics. Most of the cyclic hydrocarbon fuel candidates exhibit small rings (three- or four-membered), and common rings (five- to seven-membered), which are often grouped into classical rings [25]. Small rings exhibit rigidity and significant strain due to substantial deviations from ideal tetrahedral bond angles, resulting in pronounced angle strain, as well as considerable torsional strain from eclipsed interactions. In contrast, common rings maintain bond angles close to the tetrahedral ideal, with their substituents oriented exclusively outward from the ring structure [25].

Ring strain energy (RSE) refers to the increase in energy or destabilization that occurs when an open-chain (acyclic) molecule forms a ring structure [27]. The Ese of polycycloalkanes can be estimated using two different methods. That is, the ring superposition (RS) method [28,29] and the isodesmic reaction (IR) approach [30]. In the RS method, the Ese of a polycycloalkane is calculated as the sum of the strain energies (Ering(i)) of the individual rings [28,29].

Ese = ∑ni Ering(i)

(1)

where ni indicates the number of various members of the ring of type i, and Ering(i) represents the Ese of the ith ring. The Ese of an individual ring (Ering(i)) is given in Table S1 in the SM. For example, Compound 19 (camphane) appears with two five-membered rings as detailed in Table S2 in the SM. Therefore, the Ese of compound 19 (camphane) is given by

Ese (camphane) = 2 × (6.19) = 12.38 kcal/mol

The IR method [30] to estimate the Ese of a polycycloalkane is determined as

Ese = ΔHf(Cn+mH2(n+2m+1)) − ΔHf(CnH2(n−m + 1)) − m ΔHf(ethane)

(2)

where ΔHf denotes the standard enthalpies of the compounds involved in the isodesmic reaction. Here, n corresponds to the number of carbon atoms in the polycycloalkane, while m represents the number of ethane units introduced to balance the isodesmic reaction. This IR method compares the target molecule (polycycloalkane) to a set of reference compounds with similar bonding environments [27]. For example,

camphane + 2 ethane → tetradecane

(3)

So that Ese (camphane) = ΔHf(tetradecane) − (ΔHf(camphane) + 2 ΔHf(ethane)) = 12.72 kcal/mol.

Details regarding the IR method used are given in Tables S3 and S4 of the SM. For large-strain polycyclic molecules, direct high-accuracy quantum chemical calculations become computationally prohibitive due to the steep scaling with system size [31]. To overcome this limitation, isodesmic reactions exploit systematic error cancelation by comparing molecules to reference compounds with similar bond types, providing a practical and reliable means to compute strain energies. Although the IR method is often described as “bond-conserving,” polycyclic strain energy calculations may involve equations that are formally unbalanced in hydrogen count. This approach assumes that only the differences between similar bonding environments—rather than the absolute energies—are relevant, allowing errors to cancel out between comparable fragments. By carefully matching carbon environments (sp3, strained, bridgehead, etc.), most basis set and correlation errors are minimized, making the IR method a rapid and practical estimation tool.

The enthalpies in Equation (2), used to calculate Ese, were computed using DFT; therefore, the overall approach is referred to as the DFT-based IR method (DFT-IR). These calculations were performed at the B3PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory, following the geometry optimization. The B3PW91 DFT functional was selected based on its demonstrated reliability and consistency in predicting thermochemical properties across diverse hydrocarbon systems. A recent benchmark study by Dutra and Custodio [32], which evaluated 24 DFT functionals, identified B3PW91 as one of the most robust performers under varied computational conditions. Additionally, the literature reports show that B3PW91 yields enthalpy predictions with a mean absolute error of approximately 2 kcal/mol [33], making it suitable for evaluating strain energies in hydrocarbon fuels. The aug-cc-pVTZ basis set complements this choice by offering triple-zeta quality with diffuse functions, which is essential for accurately describing strained and delocalized electronic environments. As a result, B3PW91/aug-cc-pVTZ offers a well-balanced approach that strikes a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly for systems involving ring strain and non-classical bonding. The absence of imaginary frequencies in the optimized structures indicates that these structures correspond to true energy minima, indicating they are stable [15,16,18]. All DFT calculations are performed using the Gaussian 16 program [34].

2.2. Machine Learning for Fuel Property Prediction

ML models were developed to evaluate two key thermophysical properties essential for the fuel candidates: BP and FP. The BP is defined as the temperature at which a pure liquid transitions to the gas phase under 1 atm pressure, while FP is the lowest temperature at which a liquid emits sufficient vapor to ignite in the presence of a flame or spark [35]. Although BP and FP are experimentally measurable, predictive modeling offers significant value by enabling rapid screening of strained polycyclic molecules, where evaluation of the ASTM standard can be costly and time-consuming. Establishing these structure–property relationships, therefore, supports early-stage SAF design by prioritizing candidates with favorable volatility and safety profiles. Rücker and Rücker [36] refined structure–BP correlations for saturated hydrocarbons using high-quality data and topological indices, noting errors in earlier cycloalkane values. However, their study did not examine strained polycycloalkanes, which will be addressed in the present work. The property dataset consisted of 85 cycloalkanes for BP and 80 cycloalkanes for FP, where the latter included a combination of experimental and computational values. Data were collected exclusively for cycloalkane structures from peer-reviewed literature [11,37] and authoritative chemical databases, including the CRC Handbook [38], the NIST Chemistry WebBook [39], and the Chemical Properties Handbook [40].

Molecular descriptors were generated from Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) representations of the compounds using RDKit [41] and Mordred [42], resulting in more than 900 initial descriptors. A systematic preprocessing workflow was applied to ensure descriptor quality and reduce redundancy following the same steps as in recent work in fuel [43]. First, non-numeric and constant (low-variance) descriptors were removed. Next, descriptors exhibiting strong pairwise correlations (Pearson’s |r| > 0.90) were excluded to avoid multicollinearity. Moreover, feature relevance was assessed using Spearman correlation [44] and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) [43]. The final 10 most informative descriptors for each property (Table S6, SM) were identified and standardized using Z-score normalization [45].

Model development was carried out using SVR, which had been previously benchmarked in our earlier work [2] and consistently outperformed alternatives such as Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) for related fuel property predictions. The preference for SVR is also supported by recent reviews that identify it as one of the most widely applied algorithms in QSPR modeling of fuel ignition properties [46]. Its ability to model both linear and nonlinear relationships, while maintaining good generalization on small datasets, makes it particularly suitable for this application. Datasets were partitioned into 80:10:10 splits for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Hyperparameters (regularization constant C, epsilon tolerance ε, and kernel type) were optimized through GridSearchCV [47]. The linear kernel consistently emerged as the most effective choice for both BP and FP prediction, as detailed in optimized parameters (Table S7, SM). Final models were retrained on the combined training and validation sets using the optimal hyperparameters, and predictive performance was assessed on the independent test sets.

Model validation was performed using three repeated 5-fold cross-validations in training data [48], while model sensitivity was assessed through bootstrap analysis [49]. To determine the applicability of the model to a new molecule, the classical Joback and Reid GC models [23,24] were also implemented and evaluated for the candidate molecules (Table S10, SM). All modeling and visualization were performed in Python 3 (Jupyter) [22,50], utilizing a standard data science stack: Pandas (1.5.3) and NumPy (1.24.4) for data handling, scikit-learn (1.3.2) for feature selection, model training, and validation, SciPy (1.10.1) for statistical analysis, and Matplotlib (3.7.1) and Seaborn (0.12.2) [50] for visualization.

3. Results and Discussion

3.1. Strain Energy in the Polycycloalkanes

Ese plays a crucial role in determining the stability and energy output of polycycloalkanes, which are an important structural characteristic in many HED fuels. The Ese of these target polycycloalkanes is estimated using the RS and the DFT-based IR method (DFT-IR), as expressed in Equations (1) and (2). Table 1 compares the RS and DFT-IR results with the available reference Ese for compounds 7 (quadricyclane) and 10 (prismane), as reliable data for the studied compounds are limited.

The RS method estimates the total Ese of a molecule using a simple additive approximation; hereby, the overall strain is considered as the sum of the strain energies of its individual ring components (e.g., cyclopropane, cyclobutane) [29,53]. While this approach represents a proper first-order estimate, it overlooks several essential factors that influence strain distribution in polycycloalkanes and therefore often fails to provide accurate predictions. First, the RS method assumes that the strain contributions from each ring are independent. However, in fused and bridged ring systems, the rings are structurally interconnected, and interactions between them can redistribute Ese—often leading to strain relaxation. These inter-ring interactions are inherently neglected in the RS framework. Second, the RS method assumes rigid molecular geometries and does not account for electronic delocalization or steric effects, both of which can alleviate strain. In reality, these factors can significantly reduce the total Ese but are not captured in the additive RS model. Third, the RS method lacks the capacity to accommodate geometric flexibility. It treats the rings as fixed units, whereas real molecules can adopt more favorable conformations through bond angle and torsional relaxation. This geometric adaptability is crucial for determining the true minimum-energy structure, especially in complex polycyclic systems.

In contrast, DFT calculations inherently account for these effects. DFT enables complete molecular geometry optimizations, allowing the system to relax into its lowest-energy conformation while accounting for both electronic structure and steric interactions. This quantum mechanical approach is essential in multi-ring systems, where Ese does not scale linearly with the number of rings due to strain delocalization across the molecular framework.

The advantage of the DFT-IR method over RS becomes clear when comparing calculated Ese to experimental or high-level computational benchmarks. For example, the DFT-IR calculated Ese for compound 7 (quadricyclane, C7H8, tetracyclo [3.2.0.02,7.04,6]heptane) deviates from the experimental value by only 0.14%, while for compound 10 (prismane, C6;H6, tetracyclo[2.2.0.02,6.03,5]hexane), the deviation is just 1.02% as detailed in Table 1. In contrast, the RS method exhibits significantly large and inconsistent deviations: 18.78% for 7 (quadricyclane) and 4.77% for 10 (prismane). These discrepancies emphasize the limitations of the RS method and highlight the accuracy and reliability of quantum mechanical approaches such as DFT-IR. Furthermore, comparisons with prior studies also reveal substantial mismatches between RS-derived and experimentally determined strain energies, reinforcing the need for more sophisticated methods in Ese evaluation [28,29].

For HED fuel applications, it is ideal that the polycycloalkanes have moderate to high positive Ese. High Ese indicates the molecule stores extra potential energy in its bonds due to ring strain. If the Ese is too high, issues such as synthesis, stability, and safety may outweigh the benefit [54]. Upon combustion, this strain is released in addition to the standard chemical enthalpy, boosting the net heat of combustion per unit mass or volume. As a result, the optimal range of Ese for HED fuels can be assumed between 10 and 60 kcal/mol, which is within the vicinity of compound 6 (exo-THDCPD) and 7 (quadricyclane). Compound 6 (exo-THDCPD) is already used as a military fuel, JP-10, while 7 (quadricyclane) is extensively investigated as a top candidate for HED fuel [55]. Figure 1 presents the molecular structures of the twenty studied compounds and compares Ese values for selected polycycloalkanes determined via RS and DFT-IR, with both methods showing consistent trends. The Ese of all compounds is under 100 kcal/mol except for compound 10 (prismane), which is estimated at 126.69 kcal/mol.

These observed Ese in Figure 1 are due to the ring structures of the compounds. The compounds with relatively high Ese actually hold the strained three- or four-membered cyclic structures. As discovered by Dragojlovic [25], the strain energy per –CH2 group is highest in smaller rings, with 9.17 kcal/mol for cyclopropane (n = 3) and 6.58 kcal/mol for cyclobutane (n = 4). In polycyclic systems, however, additional factors such as ring fusion, bridging, and angular strain complicate the Ese landscape. For instance, high strain of compound 7 (quadricyclane) arises from its highly constrained geometry, comprising five rings with two three, two five, and one four-membered ring. In contrast, compound 16 (spirodecane) shows the lowest Ese at 5.59 kcal/mol among these compounds. It is noted that compound 6 (exo-THDCPD, i.e., JP-10) has a moderate Ese of 12.57 kcal/mol. The calculated Ese of the compounds is given in Table S2 of the SM.

3.2. Boiling Point and Flash Point Estimate

3.2.1. Property Dataset and ML Model Performance

An overview of the fuel property dataset and the molecular descriptors used to develop ML models is provided. Specifically, this section focuses on designing a model and validation to predict the BP and FP of the polycycloalkanes listed in Figure 1. The distribution of carbon numbers and ring sizes within the property dataset is shown in Figure 2. It includes a structurally diverse collection of monocyclic and polycyclic hydrocarbons, with carbon numbers ranging from C3 to C21 for BP data and C3 to C20 for FP data. The dataset covers ring sizes from three- to twelve-membered structures, encompassing a wide range of cyclic frameworks. Notably, within the carbon range typical of conventional jet fuels (C7–C18), the BP and FP distributions peak at total carbon numbers of C8 and C9, respectively, which are well represented in the dataset [3].

As shown in Figure 2, five- and six-membered rings are the most prevalent in both BP and FP datasets because they offer an optimal balance between thermodynamic stability and synthetic accessibility. Their conformations (e.g., envelope for cyclopentane, chair for cyclohexane) minimize both angle and torsional strain [25,36], making them energetically favorable. Additionally, they are readily formed in many synthetic and biosynthetic pathways and can accommodate diverse substitutions, thereby increasing their occurrence. In contrast, smaller rings suffer from high strain, while larger ones are less accessible and often less stable.

Figure 3 highlights the importance scores of the 10 selected molecular descriptors used in training the ML models. For BP prediction (Figure 3a), the number of carbon atoms (NC) was identified as the most influential descriptor, with an importance score of approximately 0.87 out of 1. The BertzCT graph-based descriptor appears as the second-most influential in predicting BP, which assesses the complexity of the molecules [56]. In contrast, FP prediction (Figure 3b) was influenced by the information content descriptor (Ipc) [57], which achieved an importance score of approximately 0.60. As demonstrated in SM (Figure S1), NC and Ipc are strongly correlated because both descriptors capture molecular size. In the preprocessing stage, NC was excluded from the FP model, with Ipc retained as the representative size-related variable. While feature selection in ML models is mainly determined by statistical correlations with the target property to improve predictive accuracy, it does not necessarily prioritize descriptors with clear physical significance [58]. It may instead choose less chemically informative variables. Therefore, although NC is more chemically intuitive, Ipc preferred for the FP model to strike a balance between statistical rigor and predictive performance. To maintain chemical interpretability and ensure consistency across both the BP and FP models, NC was still emphasized in our discussion of results.

Aside from size-related descriptors, other features also played a significant role in FP prediction, reflecting the interaction of topological and electronic factors. Including VE1_A, BalabanJ, and GATS1Z emerged as key predictors (Table S6, SM). The VE1_A descriptor, derived from graph theory, describes molecular connectivity and tends to increase with branching, which may affect ignition behavior [56]. The BalabanJ topological index measures molecular complexity by considering both atomic connectivity and distances [2,56], while the GATS1Z descriptor captures autocorrelation of atomic properties (such as atomic number) across a specified topological distance, emphasizing the role of electronic distribution [56]. Collectively, these descriptors improved predictive power compared to models relying only on size descriptors. Their combination demonstrates how ML-based selection of complementary features can produce strong predictive models, while also highlighting the importance of balancing chemical interpretability with statistical performance in developing property prediction models.

Figure 4 shows the relationship between the descriptor NC (number of carbon atoms in a single ring) and the BP dataset, which contains only experimental values. For monocyclic alkanes with three- to twelve-membered rings, the BP increases approximately linearly with ring size. The experimental BP value for cycloundecane (eleven-membered ring) in the property dataset of the NIST Chemistry WebBook [39] shows a slight deviation from this trend. For consistency in the analysis, a more recent value (491.55 K) from Guidechem [59] was adopted. This trend reflects the influence of increasing molecular mass and van der Waals surface area, which enhances intermolecular dispersion forces and raises the BP. Smaller rings such as cyclopropane (C3H6) and cyclobutane (C4H8) have significantly lower BPs, while larger rings exhibit progressively higher values due to their greater surface area and stronger cohesive forces [60].

The predictive performance of the BP and FP using the SVR models was evaluated using three standard metrics: the coefficient of determination (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), which are similar to our previous study [2], and details are given in the SM. Figure 5 reports the model performance for BP and FP across all datasets. In Figure 5a, the model shows a consistent and high R2 value of 0.99 across the training, test, and validation sets for BP prediction, indicating an excellent linear correlation between the predicted and reported values in the property dataset. For instance, the test set yielded an MAE of 6.92 K and an RMSE of 8.46 K, suggesting the model accurately predicts BP with minimal deviation. Even in the validation set, which serves as a test of model reliability, the error metrics remain low (MAE = 5.04 K, RMSE = 6.21 K), highlighting the model’s ability to generalize well to unseen data. While a few minor outliers can be observed (e.g., particularly at higher BP values >490 K), they do not significantly affect the overall predictive performance, and the majority of data points fall close to the parity line (y = x).

Similarly, in Figure 5b, the FP prediction model also exhibits strong performance, albeit with slightly lower R2 values compared to the BP model. The training, test, and validation sets show very similar R2 values of 0.98, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively, indicating consistent model performance. The test set in particular demonstrates high accuracy with an MAE of 9.58 K and an RMSE of 12.50 K, supporting the model’s strength in FP estimation. However, a few deviations are noticeable in the validation set. Despite these discrepancies, the majority of predictions remain closely aligned with the reported values. Hence, the strong agreement between predicted and reported values in both BP and FP models, particularly with consistently high R2 values and low error values across all datasets, demonstrates the efficacy of the SVR approach.

To ensure the robustness and real-world applicability of the developed machine learning models, multiple validation strategies were employed. Specifically, three repeated 5-fold cross-validations [48] were conducted on the training dataset, providing reliable estimates of model generalizability. The models demonstrated strong predictive performance for both BP ( M A E = 5.65 ± 1.70 K , R M S E = 8.08 ± 2.86 K , R 2 = 0.98 ± 0.01 ) and FP ( M A E = 8.28 ± 2.41 K , R M S E = 11.05 ± 4.01 K , R 2 = 0.94 ± 0.05 ) as summarized in SM (Table S8). Because the target property dataset is relatively small, we further assessed model stability and confidence intervals through a sensitivity analysis using 100 bootstrap iterations [49]. The bootstrap analysis further confirmed the stability of the models, with the BP model achieving a mean R2 of 0.99 (σ = 0.01) and the FP model achieving a mean R2 of 0.95 (σ = 0.02). Consistently low MAE and RMSE values across bootstrap samples indicate reliable predictive accuracy and minimal variability, as detailed in SM (Table S9). Slightly higher variation observed for FP can be attributed to the inclusion of both experimental and computational data in the property dataset.

Even with multiple validation strategies, the risk of overfitting or underfitting cannot be entirely eliminated, which remains a key challenge in ML models when applied to new data [61]. In this study, the dataset is relatively small and restricted to strained cycloalkanes only; therefore, while reliability was assessed by comparing ML predictions with values obtained from the GC method and available experimental data in SM (Table S10), a formal Applicability Domain (AD) analysis (e.g., Williams plot) was not performed. Given the limited chemical space considered here, such an analysis would be more meaningful for larger and more diverse datasets [62]. Future studies involving broader chemical datasets will likely incorporate AD approaches. The close agreement across these comparisons supports the robustness of the ML models within the present domain and highlights their practical relevance. In addition to predictive accuracy, the ML models provide rapid estimations and reveal meaningful structure–property relationships, thereby enhancing both efficiency and interpretability in molecular property prediction.

3.2.2. Structure-Property Trends in Polycycloalkanes

To assess the thermal properties of aviation fuels and evaluate the structural influence of the polycycloalkanes listed in Figure 1, trained models were applied to predict their BP and FP, as summarized in Table S10 of the SM. Figure 6 shows the BP/FP relationship, which follows a well-established linear trend [24]. The green boundary in Figure 6 marks the polycycloalkanes that meet both BP and FP requirements. Approximately 65% of the compounds fall within the operational BP/FP range for Jet A (BP: 433.15–573.15 K; FP ≥ 311.15 K) [12,35]. Thirteen polycycloalkanes (1–6, 9, 13, 15–17, 19, and 20) meet these criteria, supporting their strong potential as candidates for aviation fuel design. Notably, compound 6 (JP-10), a well-established military fuel, is also identified by these criteria as a promising candidate, thereby validating the effectiveness of the method. Since both boiling point (BP, reflecting volatility) and flash point (FP, reflecting ignition characteristics) influence fuel safety, a balanced BP/FP profile is critical. Excessive volatility (low BP) can lead to evaporative losses at altitude, while insufficient volatility (high BP) can impair combustion efficiency [63].

A detailed analysis of the molecular structure within the defined boundary in Figure 6 was conducted to evaluate its influence on the studied properties. Figure 7 presents the structures of polycycloalkanes that satisfy both BP and FP requirements, together with the corresponding predictions from the GC and ML approaches. The strong agreement between GC and ML validates the predicted thermal properties. Most candidates feature a dominant five-membered ring structure, often accompanied by a few smaller three- or four-membered rings. For example, compound 2 (THTCPD; NC = 15, BP = 558.68 K, FP = 422.29 K), which contains five five-membered rings, exhibits the highest BP and FP in the studied set. These results indicate that the number of carbon (NC)—a proxy for molecular size—and the presence of ring structures are primary factors influencing BP and FP. Furthermore, Figure S2 in the SM in the illustrates a nearly linear relationship between BP/FP and NC, which likely arises from the increasing contribution of van der Waals volume with molecular size and associated packing effects, as noted in a prior study [64]. Volatility and ignition performance are observed in the C9–C15 range, consistent with previous reports that cycloalkanes in this window generally meet jet fuel specifications [65].

In addition to carbon count, Ese may also modulate thermal behavior. The majority of the candidates within the boundary exhibit moderate strain (Ese < 60 kcal/mol), which appears beneficial for balancing stability and volatility. For instance, compound 5 (tetracyclononane; NC = 9, BP = 439.75 K, FP = 323.27 K, Ese = 63.46 kcal/mol) displays higher BP and FP than compound 18 (5-ethylnorbornane; NC = 9, BP = 424.07 K, FP = 307.30 K, Ese = 12.13 kcal/mol), despite identical NC values, placing 5 inside the boundary and 18 outside. This indicates that constrained topologies with moderate strain can enhance intermolecular interactions, elevating volatility and ignition thresholds. In contrast, excessive strain (>60 kcal/mol), typically arising from multiple small rings, reduces both BP and FP by limiting effective NC and molecular flexibility. Such effects are evident in compound 7 (quadricyclane; NC = 7, BP = 386.89 K, FP = 272.75 K, Ese = 78.59 kcal/mol), which fails to meet BP/FP requirements despite satisfying other fuel criteria and being widely researched as a potential aviation fuel [51,55]. Thus, a balance between molecular size, ring topology, and moderate strain emerges as the key design principle for identifying viable polycycloalkane fuel candidates, as determined by this study. These findings indicate the dual role of Ese in polycyclic fuel performance. Moderate strain improves molecular rigidity and elevates BP and FP, while excessive strain compromises both properties. Polycyclic structures dominated by five-membered rings, with controlled incorporation of three- and four-membered units, strike an effective balance between energy density and operational safety (BP&FP), making them strong candidates for SAF design. Figure 6 and Figure 7 provide a structural rationale for targeted molecular screening.

While this study emphasizes the influence of Ese on volatility, ignition, and stability, it is essential to acknowledge that real-world fuel performance also depends on additional parameters beyond the scope of this work. The cyclic and strained nature of the candidate molecules is particularly relevant, as literature reports that highly strained polycyclic structures can alter reaction pathways, rupture C–C bonds, and thereby promote the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and increase soot production during combustion [66]. For example, while compounds like 1 (pentacyclododecane) and 2 (THTCPD) exhibit promising energy, BP, and FP profiles, their complex polycyclic structures may act as precursors to PAHs, resulting in undesirable sooting behavior in engines. Similarly, strained cyclic motifs, while beneficial for energy density, can influence ignition kinetics and flame propagation in ways that are not captured by the current screening. Incorporating these combustion considerations into future ML- and DFT-based frameworks will be essential for a more accurate assessment of fuel suitability. DFT studies of high-potential molecules, such as 6 (JP-10), could provide additional insight into internal bond strain and reactivity, complementing empirical observations and guiding the design of SAFs.

In addition to combustion performance, cold-flow properties, such as FrP and viscosity, are critical determinants of aviation fuel suitability [3,12,35]. Molecular compactness, ring size, and rigidity strongly affect freezing behavior, potentially disqualifying otherwise promising candidates [18]. For instance, while compound 6 (JP-10, exo-THDCPD) remains suitable with a FrP of 194.15 K [67], its isomer endo-THDCPD solidifies at 350.15 K, making it unsuitable [18,67] for aviation fuel. Likewise, compact molecules such as 5 (tetracyclononane) may exhibit elevated FrP, which can limit performance in extreme cold, despite meeting volatility and ignition criteria. These trade-offs support the importance of integrating cold-flow analysis into future screening frameworks, using computational modeling and ML methods combined with quantum chemistry to ensure that candidate molecules meet the full spectrum of operational requirements for SAFs.

4. Conclusions

This study demonstrates the utility of combining DFT with ML to study fuel properties of strained polycycloalkanes as potential HED SAF. Machine learning using SVR models provided fast and reasonably accurate predictions of BP and FP, enabling the preliminary screening of candidate molecules. Thirteen (approximately 65%) of the compounds, including JP-10, met key volatility and ignition criteria. Although Ese showed no direct correlation with fuel suitability, the limited dataset suggests that promising candidates may cluster below approximately 60 kcal/mol in Ese, indicating a potential balance between energy content and stability that warrants further investigation. The identified C9–C15 compounds, predominantly five-membered ring structures, fall within the typical Jet A range for energy, BP, and FP, suggesting practical potential in aviation fuel. However, these results represent only an initial computational screening, and the actual viability of these candidates as SAFs will depend on a thorough evaluation of their combustion behavior and cold-flow properties. Overall, this work illustrates how integrating ML-based screening with quantum-level analysis can provide a cost-effective and scientifically grounded approach for the early-stage assessment of SAF candidates.

Industry Adoption: Plug Power’s Strategic Pivot to Aviation Fuel Production in 2025

Between 2021 and 2024, Plug Power’s primary market was hydrogen fuel cells for material handling equipment. Its connection to aviation was indirect and speculative, such as its technology being used in test programs by startups like the now-defunct Universal Hydrogen. This period established the company’s core competency in Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) technology but kept it largely outside the mainstream aerospace conversation. The year 2025 marks a dramatic inflection point. Plug Power has executed a decisive strategic pivot, repositioning itself as a critical enabler of aviation decarbonization, not through direct propulsion, but by supplying the core technology for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production.

This shift is evidenced by a series of large-scale commercial commitments. The cornerstone of this new strategy is a 2 GW electrolyzer deal with Allied Green Ammonia for a facility in Uzbekistan explicitly designed to produce SAF. This is not an isolated move; the company is also engaged in over 300 MW of SAF projects in Europe with Arcadia and is delivering a 100 MW system to Galp’s Sines Refinery in Portugal. This pattern demonstrates a clear strategy: focus on the immediate, commercially viable market of producing green hydrogen for SAF. This approach allows Plug Power to generate near-term revenue and forge partnerships with major industrial players, de-risking its aviation ambitions. The key opportunity is capturing value across the entire hydrogen-for-aviation value chain, from fuel production to end-use. However, this aggressive expansion introduces a significant new threat: execution risk. The company’s credibility now hinges on its ability to deliver on these massive, multi-gigawatt-scale projects.

Geography: Plug Power’s Global Expansion into Aviation-Adjacent Markets

Prior to 2025, Plug Power’s geographic footprint was heavily concentrated in North America, driven by its core material handling business. The company’s activities were largely domestic, focused on warehouse and logistics operations within the United States.

The period from January 2025 to today reveals a rapid and deliberate international expansion, directly tied to its new SAF and large-scale hydrogen strategy. Europe has emerged as a primary target, with Plug Power securing a 100 MW electrolyzer project at Galp’s refinery in Portugal and engaging in over 300 MW of SAF-related projects in Denmark and France with Arcadia. This shows the company is targeting regions with strong regulatory support for decarbonization and established industrial partners. The most significant move is into Central Asia with the 2 GW electrolyzer deal in Uzbekistan, a government-backed project that plants Plug Power’s flag in an emerging energy export hub. Simultaneously, the partnership with GH2 Global in Brazil signals an expansion of its core logistics business into South America, targeting the broader ecosystem that includes airports. This geographic diversification is not random; it follows global capital and policy aimed at green hydrogen production, reducing reliance on the US market alone. The risk, however, is the increased exposure to geopolitical and regional economic instabilities, particularly with a massive project in a location like Uzbekistan.

Technology Maturity: From Niche Fuel Cells to Gigawatt-Scale Electrolyzers

Between 2021 and 2024, Plug Power’s technology story was centered on the maturity of its PEM fuel cells for the low-power demands of forklifts. Its PEM electrolyzer technology, while proven, had not yet been deployed at a massive, industrial scale. The use of its fuel cells in the now-defunct Universal Hydrogen’s test aircraft was a notable but early-stage, speculative application, representing a proof-of-concept for aviation propulsion rather than a commercially ready product.

Starting in 2025, the narrative of technology maturity has fundamentally shifted from fuel cells for mobility to electrolyzers for fuel production. The technology being scaled is not the in-aircraft propulsion system, but the foundational green hydrogen production equipment. The live customer demonstrations of its 1 MW and 5 MW GenEco electrolyzers in May 2025 served as a prelude to this scale-up. The subsequent announcements of the 100 MW project delivery to Galp in Portugal and the massive 2 GW deal in Uzbekistan are the ultimate validation points. These projects prove that Plug Power’s PEM electrolyzer technology has moved beyond the pilot phase and is now being deployed at a commercial scale previously unseen for the company. In contrast, the direct application of its fuel cells for commercial aircraft propulsion remains speculative. The company’s most mature and commercially impactful technology for the aviation sector today is the electrolyzer—the key that unlocks green hydrogen for SAF.

Table: SWOT Analysis of Plug Power’s Aviation Strategy

SWOT Category 2021 – 2024 2025 – Today What Changed / Validated Strength Established PEM fuel cell technology and leadership in the material handling market. Leveraging core PEM expertise to secure massive-scale electrolyzer deals (e.g., 2 GW with Allied Green Ammonia for SAF). Strong government backing via a $1.66B DOE loan guarantee. Validated the strategic pivot from a niche mobility provider to a key technology supplier for industrial-scale decarbonization and SAF production. Weakness Primarily focused on a single market (material handling) with limited exposure to the broader energy transition. High dependency on government incentives (IRA’s Section 45V credits) and execution of large, complex projects. Lacks a flagship partnership with a major aerospace OEM like Airbus or Boeing for direct propulsion. The business model’s success is now explicitly tied to political stability regarding clean energy incentives and the immense challenge of executing gigawatt-scale projects. Opportunity Potential to leverage PEM technology for new hydrogen applications and markets. Tapping into the explosive growth of the aviation fuel cell and SAF market (projected to reach $24.63B by 2035). Generating near-term revenue by supplying the SAF value chain. The opportunity crystallized from a general “hydrogen economy” concept into a specific, high-growth, and commercially tangible vertical: providing electrolyzers for SAF. Threat Competition from other fuel cell manufacturers in the material handling space. Significant execution risk on large-scale international projects (e.g., Uzbekistan). Potential for political headwinds to undermine critical tax credits (Section 45V). Loss of early aviation testbeds (e.g., Universal Hydrogen’s failure). The scale of its ambitions has introduced commensurate risks. Project execution and political policy stability have become the primary threats to its growth strategy, far outweighing niche market competition.

Forward-Looking Insights and Summary

The data from 2025 signals that Plug Power has firmly committed to a pragmatic, two-pronged aviation strategy, with an immediate focus on the SAF supply chain. The year ahead will be a test of execution. Market actors should closely watch for progress updates on the 2 GW Uzbekistan project and the 100 MW Galp refinery deployment; successful commissioning of these facilities will be the most potent validation of the company’s ability to deliver at scale.

Another critical signal to monitor is the finalization and political durability of the IRA’s Section 45V hydrogen production tax credit. This incentive is the financial cornerstone for Plug Power’s domestic expansion funded by the $1.66 billion DOE loan. Any dilution or instability in this policy poses a direct threat to the economic viability of its U.S. projects.

While the electrolyzer business for SAF is gaining significant traction, the direct propulsion side of its strategy remains a long-term, speculative upside. The next major milestone for investors would be the announcement of a formal development partnership with a major aerospace OEM like Airbus or Boeing. Without it, Plug Power’s role in aviation will likely remain that of a crucial fuel infrastructure provider rather than an integrated aerospace technology partner. For now, the company’s most bankable contribution to decarbonizing flight is on the ground, producing the green hydrogen that will power the sustainable fuels of tomorrow.

Annual production is expected to include 382,000 tons of SAF, 152,000 tons of electro-synthetic fuel (e-SAF), and 11,000 tons of renewable diesel produced using green hydrogen generated via 2 GW electrolysis.
According to Allied Biofuels representatives, the project aligns with Uzbekistan’s national strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030.
Governor Rahimov emphasized that the project would strengthen Khorezm’s position as a leading region in the field of green energy.
Allied Biofuels was officially registered in Uzbekistan in July this year.","In a groundbreaking move for Central Asia, Uzbekistan has announced plans to build the region’s first plant dedicated to producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The facility will be constructed in the Tuprakkala district of Khorezm region and is being developed by international firm Allied Biofuels, with an estimated investment of $5.9 billion, according to Fergana news agency.

The project was formalized during the International Investment Forum in Khiva, where Allied Biofuels CEO Alfred Benedict and Khorezm Regional Governor Jurabek Rahimov signed an agreement to initiate the venture. As part of the deal, local authorities have allocated land for the plant and committed to providing access to water supply systems.

Once completed, the facility will be the first fully integrated biorefinery of its kind in Central Asia. Annual production is expected to include 382,000 tons of SAF, 152,000 tons of electro-synthetic fuel (e-SAF), and 11,000 tons of renewable diesel produced using green hydrogen generated via 2 GW electrolysis.

According to Allied Biofuels representatives, the project aligns with Uzbekistan’s national strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. It is also seen as a significant step toward reducing the country’s dependence on fossil fuels.

Allied Biofuels CEO Alfred Benedict described the agreement as “historic” for the company. Governor Rahimov emphasized that the project would strengthen Khorezm’s position as a leading region in the field of green energy. He also highlighted the initiative’s potential to generate hundreds of new jobs and make a meaningful contribution to the local economy.

Allied Biofuels was officially registered in Uzbekistan in July this year. The company is headed by Benedict, who also leads Australian-based Allied Green Ammonia. Earlier in 2024, Allied Biofuels signed a memorandum of understanding with the Uzbek government, expressing its intent to invest around $5.5 billion in renewable energy initiatives across the country.

Previously, regional officials briefed President Shavkat Mirziyoyev on the project, outlining initial investments of $820 million. They also proposed installing 4 GW of solar panels over 5,500 hectares to supply energy for the plant.",https://old.asiaplustj.info/sites/default/files/articles/353408/c9bff1b33871bd324f7e294ba39b9cfd.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 01:56:22.486847

The AMS program (Aircraft Management Services) offered by Honda Aircraft Company, which allows owners to entrust aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and operational planning and management to HACI-certified experts, also seemed appealing.
Don’s company is not just a business partner but a company that deeply resonates with Honda’s philosophy and works alongside us with that same commitment.
This approach embodies the Honda Philosophy and aligns perfectly with the principles and philosophy that we at Banyan have always valued.
We will leverage the service quality expertise we have cultivated in other products, such as motorcycles, automobiles, and power products, to achieve further evolution.","Since its founding, HACI has focused not only on selling aircraft but also on improving the quality of after-sales service. We have made safety, quality and customer satisfaction our top priorities, and in 2024, we announced a new commitment to quality management. We outlined three pillars: fostering a culture of quality first, continuous improvement, and the pursuit of customer satisfaction.

These principles are embodied by our network of 21 Authorized Service Centers worldwide, which play a significant role in ensuring the quality of HACI’s services. These centers handle aircraft repairs, upgrades, inspections, and any other maintenance events.

Banyan Air Service is one of the HondaJet’s Authorized Service Centers, and has supported the HondaJet and its operators from the launch of the HondaJet program to the present day.

Thank you. We currently handle maintenance for 60 HondaJets, providing fuel supply for aircraft in the southeastern United States, as well as repairs, inspections, and part replacements for aircraft and electronic equipment in accordance with various guidelines, and aircraft sales.

As mentioned earlier, when we heard the news in 2014 that Honda was developing an aircraft, we were confident that this business would succeed and believed our services could meet Honda’s quality standards. We applied for a business partnership and have been providing after-sales service for HondaJet for over 10 years.

In the field of very light business jets, it is truly innovative to provide a 24/7 rapid response and delivery service for AOG (Aircraft On Ground) situations while maintaining a globally unified and consistent quality standard. This is only possible thanks to the extensive network of HACI owned as well as authorized service centers. As a result, we have achieved a dispatch reliability rate* of 99.81% (As of August 2025), which is among the highest in the world, and this is entirely due to their cooperation.

I first encountered Honda products when I was 15 years old. In the rural town in Nigeria where I grew up, scooters and mopeds with bicycle-style pedals were the most common mode of transportation. One day, I saw a Honda motorcycle without pedals. I begged my parents to buy it for me. That motorcycle had no oil leaks, the lights were bright, and the engine was surprisingly quiet. It was like magic.

Two years later, when I was 17, I rode a Honda CB175 (175cc sports bike) and traveled across West Africa and neighboring countries. I embarked on a journey from my hometown of Egbe in Nigeria to London, England, crossing the Sahara Desert. There were no roads, and I had to refuel at fuel stations at oases every 500 miles on a bike that could cover approximately 250 miles per day. During that 2,000-mile journey, I became completely captivated by Honda products. This experience is the foundation of my trust and affection for Honda. To date, I have purchased over 100 Honda products (motorcycles, automobiles, power products, and aircraft), including those for my family.

When I was a child, the hospital where my parents worked and the boarding school I attended were about 500 miles apart, and the only way to travel was by small aircraft. A journey that would take two and a half days by Land Rover (off-road SUV) could be completed in just three and a half hours by light aircraft.

From this childhood experience, I realized how useful aviation could be as a mode of transportation in rural areas like Africa, and I was deeply attracted to its safety, time-saving efficiency, and comfort. I earned money by repairing and restoring Honda Civics, which at that time were still relatively unknown, but something I knew to be a quality car, while studying aviation in Toronto, Canada.

After graduating from school, I began working as a contract pilot for light aircraft. I flew piston-engine light aircraft carrying about 10 passengers, but I gradually noticed that many small charter aircraft were struggling with maintenance. For small companies with only two light aircraft, it was not practical to hire full-time mechanics and meet the strict maintenance requirements of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Additionally, there were not many companies offering maintenance services for such small operators.

In 1979, when I was 25, I decided to establish a maintenance service company specializing in small charter companies with three or fewer aircraft. Together with a friend I had known since childhood, I founded Banyan Air Service in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Since founding the company, I have dedicated myself to providing swift and high-quality service. For example, if a customer called at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night saying, “The battery has failed, but we need to fly passengers on a charter flight tomorrow morning,” I would rush to the site within 10 minutes and repair the aircraft. Such service and rapid response gained recognition gradually became our reputation.

Time passed, and in 2014, I heard about Honda’s announcement that they were developing an aircraft. The beauty and efficiency of the HondaJet were the epitome of corporate aviation. I was also strongly drawn to the Over-The-Wing-Engine-Mount (the HondaJet’s distinctive feature of positioning engines on top of the wings, rather than on the sides of the fuselage) developed by HACI. The AMS program (Aircraft Management Services) offered by Honda Aircraft Company, which allows owners to entrust aircraft maintenance, pilot training, and operational planning and management to HACI-certified experts, also seemed appealing. I proposed a business partnership with Honda, and here we are today.

“The Power of Dreams” represents a vision, while “How We Move You” symbolizes the emotional connection we strive to create. We are not just a fueling station, we are partners. Our goal is for customers to feel that Banyan is their home.

Additionally, we refer to our associates as “teammates” and have built long-term relationships with them. Many teammates have been with us for decades since our founding. This aligns with Honda’s philosophy of “Respect for the individual,” does it not?

Exactly. At HACI, we treat not only our associates but also our business partners with the same honesty and integrity as a family, pursuing the highest standards of quality and customer satisfaction from a long-term perspective. This mindset is the very essence of Honda’s philosophy. Don’s company is not just a business partner but a company that deeply resonates with Honda’s philosophy and works alongside us with that same commitment.

Just as Don was excited about the development of the HondaJet and believed in its success from the start, it remains our unwavering mission to provide both the power to turn dreams into reality and the emotion that moves people. Honda’s brand slogan is deeply rooted in all our activities.

The Honda Philosophy and brand slogan have guided us since the pioneering efforts in aircraft development led by HACI’s first president, Michimasa Fujino, and they continue to be carried forward under the leadership of the current HACI president, Hideto Yamasaki.

I recall the words Fujino-san (HACI’s first President and CEO) shared with me during my first visit to the HACI factory. At that time, through our discussions, I gained a deep sense of how Honda envisions the long-term future.

Paying close attention to user feedback and incorporating it into improvements. This approach embodies the Honda Philosophy and aligns perfectly with the principles and philosophy that we at Banyan have always valued.

Honda’s “Three Joys” philosophy is something I feel constantly in my work. The joy of buying is evident in the delivery experience at HACI. It is a special moment when the new owner is congratulated by the staff who actually manufactured the aircraft. The joy of selling is felt when conveying the appeal of the HondaJet. And the joy of creating is also realized by Banyan through customization and maintenance.

We have not only met the FAA's strict standards, but have actively pursued the acquisition of AS9100, an aerospace industry quality management standard, and the introduction of our own quality management system. Going forward, we will focus on innovation, including the successful development of the HondaJet Echelon, flight tests using 100% SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and improvements in aerodynamic performance and manufacturing costs.

Under the slogan “One Honda Team,” we will further accelerate the integration of Honda’s global culture. We will leverage the service quality expertise we have cultivated in other products, such as motorcycles, automobiles, and power products, to achieve further evolution.

As I mentioned earlier, our goal is to provide service that makes HondaJet owners feel that Banyan is their home. Recently, we opened a new hangar in St. Augustine, Florida, to enhance service levels for customers in the southern region. We are also considering the construction of a larger facility by 2026. We are committed to continuing to provide new value to the aviation industry alongside Honda, a company I believe in.",http://global.honda/content/dam/site/global-en/stories/cq_img/178-2510-hondajet-service-interview/social.jpg,N,,2025-10-03 01:56:34.653874

Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.
In the Sept. 30 letter, the lawmakers commend provisions of the proposed “Set 2” rule related to biobased-diesel (BBD) RVOs and foreign-produced fuels and feedstocks.
“This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.
“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks,” the lawmakers added.","A bipartisan group of 47 federal lawmakers, led by Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, on Sept. 30 sent a letter to U.S. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin urging the agency to maintained proposed biomass-based diesel renewable volume obligations (RVOs) and move forward with plans to boost the domestic ag industry in its upcoming Renewable Fuel Standard “Set 2” rule.

The EPA on June released its proposed RFS “Set 2” rule, which aims to set 2026 and 2027 RVOs, including record high blending targets for biomass-based diesel. The rulemaking also includes provisions that make substantial changes to the RFS program by limiting the participation of imported fuels and feedstocks and eliminating electricity from the program.

As part of the effort to boost the domestic agriculture industry, the proposed rule would modify the value renewable identification numbers (RINs) based on whether the biofuel is derived from domestic or foreign sources. Under the proposed regulations, foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50% of the RIN value relative to domestic biofuels and feedstocks.

In the Sept. 30 letter, the lawmakers commend provisions of the proposed “Set 2” rule related to biobased-diesel (BBD) RVOs and foreign-produced fuels and feedstocks. “The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities,” they wrote.

“Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel,” the lawmakers continued. “That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

“The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located,” they continued. “This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks,” the lawmakers added. “Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Grassley2025_9dbf3e3707.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 19:56:14.211476

Beyond reducing emissions, the SAF mandate is expected to add over £1.8 billion to the UK economy and create 10,000 skilled jobs across the country.
While SAF currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, the government is taking steps to protect consumers from price hikes.
This policy marks a significant step toward decarbonizing UK aviation without limiting travel demand.","The UK government has officially announced its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, setting a legally binding target for 10% of all jet fuel used on UK flights to come from sustainable sources by 2030. Set to take effect in January 2025, pending parliamentary approval, the mandate places the UK among the first countries in the world to enshrine SAF usage in law.

The move follows the successful launch of the world’s first 100% SAF-powered transatlantic flight from Heathrow in November 2023, backed by up to £1 million in government funding. Now, the government aims to supply 1.2 million tonnes of SAF annually—enough to fuel flights circling the globe 3,000 times.

Beyond reducing emissions, the SAF mandate is expected to add over £1.8 billion to the UK economy and create 10,000 skilled jobs across the country. Recent investment through the £135 million Advanced Fuels Fund is already supporting 13 pioneering SAF projects nationwide.

While SAF currently costs more than traditional jet fuel, the government is taking steps to protect consumers from price hikes. A built-in review mechanism and price control measures will allow adjustments in response to supply shortages or cost fluctuations, ensuring ticket fares remain within typical seasonal ranges.

As part of its broader net zero strategy, the government also launched a consultation into a SAF revenue certainty scheme, proposing a Guaranteed Strike Price (GSP) model. This would give SAF producers pricing stability and incentivize further investment.

Transport Secretary Mark Harper emphasized that SAF is critical for safeguarding British aviation, protecting jobs, and allowing passengers to continue flying sustainably. SAF can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 70% and is made from waste materials like used cooking oil, industrial gases, and household waste.

I GRADUATED with a master’s in chemical engineering from the University of Strathclyde in 2018. I’ve worked at Atkins -Réalis since graduating in a variety of roles in and around the water sector. I started with some drinking water work, then did some desalination work in the Middle East, and now currently my job title is principal bioresources process specialist. Essentially, I focus on how process technology can help tackle some of the water sector’s most pressing challenges associated with wastewater treatment and sewage sludge management.

What attracted you to the sector?

I always had a kind of natural pull towards water treatment. Even back at high school I did my advanced higher chemistry project looking at using roasted banana peel – which you might even now call biochar – as a means of removing heavy metals from water. And I did my master’s thesis in looking at selective recovery of copper from acid mine drainage. So, I’ve always had a kind of interest in water treatment processes. I really thought a career in the water sector could be rewarding and fulfilling. And I also always liked the idea that you could recover some value from waste.

What attracted you to your role?

My role really centres around looking at how process technologies can be utilised to best process sewage sludge, which can typically be the arrow out of the end of the wastewater treatment flow sheet. There’s real global uncertainty in the future of sewage sludge management. This is driven by challenges from public perception issues, contamination, through to things like microplastics and PFAS, process emissions and regulatory uncertainty. And at the same time, we’re wising up to the real energy and nutrient value in sewage sludge and looking at wastewater in general as a sort of feedstock for the circular economy. So, I was attracted to this role in the AtkinsRealis bioresources team, so I could be part of deploying some of the fascinating chemical engineering taking place in the sector.

What does your typical day or week involve?

I’ve got a real variety in my workdays, which I guess is a benefit to working for a consultancy. Often, you’re involved in quite different types of projects, and it makes for a really good way to build up a nice breadth of experience early in your career. Day to day, I manage projects with civil, mechanical, electrical, geotechnical and hydraulic engineers, speak with regulatory experts and work with other process engineers and design, and prepare and run a lot of workshops. I help to develop biosolids management strategies, which requires a bit of creativity, which is nice. I discuss technologies with vendors, which is always interesting, and get to be competitive when preparing proposals for winning work.

What's the most exciting development or opportunity in your field that you wish more people knew about?

One of my favourites, we’re looking at filtering out toilet paper or cellulose pulp from sewage. We’re interested in the downstream benefits of that process, what happens downstream at the wastewater treatment works when you take the cellulose pulp toilet paper out. We’re also looking at what we can do with that cellulose pulp, so one of the avenues is looking at fermentation of that into green chemicals. I’m also supporting on a project where we’re looking at turning a significant portion of the UK’s sewage sludge into jet fuel – that is actually a thing! There’s a process called hydrothermal liquefaction which breaks organic matter such as sewage sludge into a biocrude oil, which can then be refined into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). So, lots of cool things going on.

What IChemE resources do you recommend students use to help them take the first steps in their career

I generally found IChemE’s Chartership programme really useful in shaping the initial years of my career. It ensured I got a good broad range of technical and general experience. And it really helped me, with my mentor, sort out target areas of development. In addition, I’d also advocate for engaging with special interest groups (SIGs) and attending IChemE events. I think it’s a really great way to learn more but, importantly, expand your network, which is something I’ve found to be really vital in my career so far.",https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/media/22935/1012studenthero.jpg?width=960,N,,2025-10-02 17:56:59.143117

The company is gaining momentum thanks to strong demand in the U.S. and a new partnership with Boeing Defense, Space & Security.

Palantir’s data analytics and AI platforms are becoming more important. They impact both government and commercial markets. At the same time, investors remain focused on whether the AI company can balance growth with its high valuation.

From Data to Defense: Palantir’s Boeing Breakthrough

The company’s latest deal with Boeing is a key reason behind its recent stock rally. Boeing will integrate Palantir’s Foundry platform across its defense and space operations. Foundry will help Boeing manage data better, optimize supply chains, and make smarter decisions in its manufacturing facilities.

Steve Parker, president and CEO of Boeing Defense, Space and Security, noted:

“The game-changing capabilities this provides us … is it allows us to make decisions not in weeks, but in days and hours…This is really the AI synthesizing data, allowing us to make decisions.”

For Boeing, the partnership offers tools. These tools help cut costs from supply chain delays and production issues. For Palantir, it strengthens credibility with one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the world. This collaboration also shows how Palantir’s technology can move beyond government contracts into major commercial and industrial operations.

Palantir has been steadily growing its commercial business. Today, over 40% of its revenue comes from commercial clients. This is a shift from earlier years, when it focused almost entirely on government work. The Boeing partnership is expected to help drive more adoption of Palantir’s AI solutions across industries.

U.S. Market Momentum: Earnings on the Rise

Palantir’s financial performance in 2025 has been marked by rapid expansion in the U.S. market. In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $884 million, beating analyst expectations.

U.S. commercial revenue grew 71% year over year, while U.S. government contracts rose 45%. These results show that Palantir is successfully expanding its reach in both defense and commercial sectors.

However, the picture is not equally strong across all regions. Palantir’s European commercial revenue fell by about 5%, suggesting weaker demand outside the U.S.

Even so, the company raised its full-year revenue forecast to nearly $3.9 billion, reflecting confidence in continued growth.

Investors have taken note of this momentum. Palantir shares have recovered from their late summer pullback, gaining nearly 18% and trading close to previous highs at $185. Analysts have set price targets that suggest further upside if the company can keep delivering growth.

AI in the Sky: Why Boeing Chose Palantir

The Boeing agreement shows how Palantir is placing itself at the heart of digital change in defense and aerospace. Boeing will use Palantir’s software to integrate data across its factories and programs. This could help the company predict supply chain issues, make decisions faster, and boost the readiness of its defense systems.

For Palantir, the partnership shows that its platforms can be applied to large-scale industrial problems. It may also open doors to further contracts with aerospace and defense companies worldwide. As more companies use AI-driven analytics, Palantir can grow in industries that need efficiency and security.

Mike Gallagher, Palantir’s head of defense, remarked on this partnership, saying:

“type of partnership that I think has the possibility to unlock transformation within the defense industrial base and enhance deterrence in the near term, not in a matter of distant decades.”

The deal also adds to Palantir’s credibility with investors. Palantir’s tech works well beyond government and niche markets. Their partnerships with big companies show this clearly. Instead, it is proving useful in some of the most complex and regulated industries.

Riding the Wave of Explosive Growth in AI and Data Analytics

The global data analytics software market is growing fast. In 2024, it was worth about $69 billion, and it’s expected to climb to $302 billion by 2030, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of ~28%.

Meanwhile, the enterprise AI market could expand from around $97 billion in 2025 to $229.3 billion by 2030, growing at ~18.9 % per year.

These trends show strong demand for tools like Palantir’s platforms. As more companies adopt AI and analytics, Palantir may benefit from this rising tide of investment and interest.

Behind these financial and market momentum, the AI company is also paying attention to its sustainability commitments.

ESG and Emission Reduction: Palantir’s Net Zero Pathway

Palantir has committed to reaching net zero emissions across all scopes under its 2021 Climate Pledge. The company is working to cut emissions where possible and balance the rest with high-quality carbon offsets. This shows an effort to address both immediate impacts and long-term climate goals.

In 2019, Palantir set a baseline for its greenhouse gas emissions. By 2024, total emissions had risen slightly to about 23,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, a reduction of about 31% compared to the 2019 baseline. This increase of 1.7% from 2023 was due to a gradual return to business travel and operational activities. But overall emissions per employee have dropped 57% since 2019.

The company also achieved carbon neutrality for its UK operations in 2023, covering remaining emissions through offsets.

To support this progress, Palantir is taking these actions:

Invests in better measurement and reporting. This improves how the company tracks emissions from business travel, cloud computing, and employee commuting.

It uses energy-efficient data centers and optimizes software workloads to reduce cloud computing emissions.

For emissions it can’t fully cut, it buys verified offsets and uses sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for travel.

Overall, Palantir’s ESG strategy shows steady progress. While the reductions are gradual, the company is building systems to manage its footprint while aligning with broader net-zero goals.

Flying High or Overvalued? What’s Next for PLTR

Palantir’s path depends on its success in moving from government contracts to commercial industries. The Boeing partnership shows progress on this front, while strong U.S. demand continues to fuel revenue growth.

At the same time, investors remain aware of risks tied to valuation and uneven international performance. The company’s challenge will be to prove that it can replicate U.S. growth in other markets and continue delivering large-scale contracts.

If Palantir succeeds, it could strengthen its status as a top AI-driven software company. This would boost its influence in both public and private sectors. The coming quarters will reveal whether the Boeing deal and other partnerships translate into long-term performance.

As the company looks ahead, success will depend on expanding its global presence, managing valuation concerns, and delivering measurable results from its partnerships. For now, Palantir remains a key player to watch in the evolving world of AI and data analytics.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2556211139.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 16:57:31.422952

Green Taxi’s founder and chief executive David Valaer describes the Plano, Texas-based company’s technology as a retrofit allowing airlines to taxi jets using an electric motor in the main landing gear, powered by the aircraft’s auxiliary power unit (APU).

Valaer says the Zero Engine Taxi system could help airlines reduce fuel burn from running one or both engines at low thrust on taxiways. He also envisions ”faster, more efficient turns with reduced tug use” and reduced overall emissions.

The start-up claims the system could save commercial jet operators about $300,000 per aircraft annually through less fuel burn.

Delta confirmed the partnership with the electric taxi technology developer last month. It will initially see Delta use its operational experience to help Green Taxi optimise its system for regional aircraft.

But Delta says its big-picture vision for the system’s use ”extends far behind a single aircraft model or airline”.

”The Green Taxi partnership is another example of Delta’s approach to impact what it can control today while innovating future technologies like scaling sustainable aviation fuel and revolutionary fleet development,” the airline says.

Green Taxi Aerospace earlier this year launched a partnership with StandardAero aimed at US certification of the Zero Engine Taxi on Embraer 175s.

US regional carriers Republic Airways and SkyWest Airlines fly dozens of E175s on behalf of Delta under the Delta Connection brand.

Delta also recently added Dutch firm Maeve Aerospace to its technology incubator, with an an agreement to “advance development” of the start-up’s conceptual hybrid-electric Maeve Jet.

Instead, we will make a technological leap forward – generating fuels directly from renewable electricity, in a so-called “power to liquid approach.” Vincent Hodder, CEO of Leeds Bradford Airport, said: “This initiative will strengthen our shared goal of accelerating the UK’s efforts to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050.","Leeds Bradford Airport is at the heart of a new £1.5 million government-backed study into producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), in a move that could pave the way for cleaner, greener flights.

The funding, awarded by the Department for Transport, will support a detailed feasibility study into creating Power-to-Liquid SAF, a next-generation fuel made using renewable electricity and captured carbon, at or near the airport.

The project was initiated by the University of Sheffield and is being supported by Leeds North West MP Katie White, who has helped bring together industry, academic and regional partners.

Over the next eight months, the study will explore how this clean fuel – which can be used in today’s aircraft without changing engines or infrastructure – could possibly be produced and deployed at scale from a Yorkshire base. If successful, it could lead to major investment and job creation in the region, with the final report due in 2026.

Unlike biofuels, Power-to-Liquid SAF doesn’t rely on crops or waste. Instead, it uses renewable electricity to convert water and recycled carbon into a synthetic jet fuel with a much lower carbon footprint – a technology widely seen as key to decarbonising long-haul flights.

Katie White MP said: “Leeds is built for this kind of innovation. We have the talent, the ambition, and a track record of turning green innovation into real-world impact. This funding is a crucial step towards making sustainable jet fuel a reality at Leeds Bradford.

“It’s about cutting emissions in one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise, and creating the skilled jobs and investment that come with it. I’m proud to see our region leading the way.”

Leading climate scientist Professor Piers Forster, former Chair of the Climate Change Committee, along with Jet2 and Leeds Bradford Airport, welcomed the move.

Professor Piers Forster, former Chair of the Climate Change Committee and Director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds, said: “Aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise… current sustainable aviation fuels are made from waste fat or energy crops.

“They are not considered a long-term solution, as making our own would use more than 50% of UK farmland, which we need to grow our food. Instead, we will make a technological leap forward – generating fuels directly from renewable electricity, in a so-called “power to liquid approach.”

Vincent Hodder, CEO of Leeds Bradford Airport, said: “This initiative will strengthen our shared goal of accelerating the UK’s efforts to meet its net-zero emissions targets by 2050.

“Investment in decarbonising aviation will benefit not only our local community but also contribute to the broader national effort towards sustainable air travel and a greener future. We can’t wait to get started.”

Bombardier's Global 7500 Jet Soars to New Heights With its 150th Speed Record, Building on its Industry-Defining Record-Setting Performance Back to video

Article content

MONTRÉAL, Oct. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Bombardier today announced that its industry-defining Global 7500 business jet just notched a new performance milestone with its 150th speed record(1), the most ever set by a single business aircraft type. The latest achievements attained by this blazing fast business aircraft include key city pair speed records, such as Tokyo to Los Angeles, Toronto to Paris, New York to London and Hong Kong to Montreal. What’s more, the aircraft averaged a speed in excess of 1,000 km/hr on 20 of its record-setting missions, bringing passengers to their destinations in record time.

Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.","WASHINGTON – Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), a lifelong family farmer and a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, led over 45 Senate and House colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize a rule on imported Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) and hold firm on the proposed biomass-based diesel volumes.

In their bipartisan, bicameral letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the members state such measures would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) continues to strengthen American energy security and support both American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers.

“At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically,” the members said.

In June, the EPA proposed record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in its Set 2 proposal and included a 50% reduction in RINs for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction).

“The Import RIN reduction also aligns with congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called ‘used cooking oil’ from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture and manufacturing,” the members continued.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal, saying it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation and manufacturing – particularly in rural communities.

Additional cosigners include Sens. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Todd Young (R-Ind.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.), Michael Rounds (R-S.D.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) and Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.).

In the House, the letter was signed by Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa), Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa), Zach Nunn (R-Iowa), Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), Angie Craig (D-Minn.), Sharice Davids (D-Kan.), Dusty Johnson (R-S.D.), Derek Schmidt (R-Kan.), Brad Finstad (R-Minn.), Nikki Budzinski (D-Ill.), Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), Don Bacon (R-Neb.), Tracey Mann (R-Kan.), Emanuel Cleaver (D-Mo.), Max Miller (R-Ohio), James Baird (R-Ind.), Michelle Fischbach (R-Minn.), James Comer (R-Ky.), Mike Bost (R-Ill.), David Kustoff (R-Tenn.), John Rose (R-Tenn.), Erin Houchin (R-Ind.), Mark Messmer (R-Ind.), Ron Estes (R-Kan.), Derrick Van Orden (R-Wis.), Mark Alford (R-Mo.), Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Mich.), Darin LaHood (R-Ill.), Mike Flood (R-Neb.), Rudy Yakym (R-Ind.), Eric Sorensen (D-Ill.), Trent Kelly (R-Miss.), Carol Miller (R-W.Va.) and Adrian Smith (R-Neb.).

Organizations endorsing the letter include the American Soybean Association, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Oilseed Processors Association and the National Sorghum Producers.

Grassley helped establish the RFS in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has worked to ensure the executive branch implements the law as intended. In April, Grassley and Klobuchar urged the EPA to restore integrity, stability and growth to the RFS and the U.S. biofuel sector by raising RVO levels for biomass-based diesel and advanced biofuels. The Biden-era EPA set RVOs at levels that fail to align with market conditions and production outlook, which has contributed to biodiesel plant closures in the Midwest.

The Honorable Lee M. Zeldin

Administrator

Environmental Protection Agency

1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW

Washington, D.C. 20460

Dear Administrator Zeldin,

We thank the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for proposing record biomass-based diesel (BBD) volumes in the Set 2 proposal and for including a 50 percent reduction in Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) for imported renewable fuels and fuels made from foreign feedstocks (Import RIN reduction). The combination of the strong BBD volumes coupled with prioritizing U.S. feedstocks represents a commonsense approach that puts American farmers first, strengthens domestic biofuel markets, and delivers tangible economic benefits to rural communities.

Soybean oil may only represent 20 percent of the bean, but it accounts for more than half of its value in the U.S. market, and about half of that oil is used to make advanced biofuels such as biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel. That means roughly a quarter of every bushel's value processed here in the U.S. is directly tied to biofuel demand. At a time when many farmers are struggling to break even, all federal biofuels policies should prioritize domestic agriculture and biofuel production, not foreign fuels made from foreign feedstocks. Additionally, while farmers face the uncertainty of foreign market demand, the Import RIN reduction would provide essential support for the farm economy so farmers could sell more products domestically.

The EPA's own analysis highlights the positive impact of the Import RIN proposal: it will create jobs and generate economic growth in farming, transportation, and manufacturing, particularly in rural communities where oilseed processing facilities are located. This is exactly the outcome Congress intended when it created and expanded the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The Import RIN reduction also aligns with Congressional intent under the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, which prioritizes domestic feedstocks. Aligning EPA's policy with this standard helps level the playing field for domestic feedstock and biofuel producers with imported feedstocks, such as Brazilian tallow and so called “used cooking oil” from China, which would otherwise directly undercut U.S. energy, agriculture, and manufacturing.

For these reasons, we urge EPA to finalize the Import RIN reduction as proposed and to hold firm on the biomass-based diesel volumes in the rule. Finalizing the proposal would ensure the Renewable Fuel Standard delivers on its promises of strengthening U.S. energy security, supporting American farmers and domestic renewable fuel producers, and keeping investment and jobs here at home.

More sensible New Yorkers did their best to avoid the melee, but New Private Markets dove right in last week and scurried from one event to another to get a sense of the mood at Climate Week, the first since Donald Trump began his second term as US president.

Trump, of course, delivered a characteristically long-winded and pugnacious speech on 23 September at the UN, labelling climate change as “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” and criticising the organisation for raising the alarm about global warming.

“If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail,” he said.

Climate Week attendees put on a stoic face as Trump’s combative words hung over the proceedings, but many people present admitted that this year’s festivities had a more subdued tone, saying that the optimism and confidence of previous years had given way to a feeling of quiet resolve.

At the outset in the late 2000s, Climate Week was permeated by rampant optimism that change was afoot. That sense soon gave way to the realisation that a lot of hard work had to be done. This year the atmosphere was described by one prominent manager as “sober”.

As NPM heard from one institutional investor, Trump’s words put a damper on things, but climate investments continue as countries around the world make an inexorable, if halting, advance to a low-carbon economy. Earlier this year, for example, we documented how blue-state pensions were pushing on with climate investment plans.

In fact, as if to underscore the point, Net Zero Tracker released its annual report during Climate Week, revealing that the number of global organisations that have implemented net-zero targets continues to rise. And in the US, Net Zero Tracker found that company commitments to net-zero plans had grown 9 percent in the past year, including new commitments from eBay, Merck & Co and Goodyear.

Not everyone is impressed by commitments. One data centre developer we spoke to scoffed at the notion that companies were adopting new net-zero targets or even sticking to previously announced plans, at least in the technology sector. Tech titans may make all the right noises, they said, but their needs for new data centres to power the AI boom outweigh concerns for the environment. As Microsoft said in February: nearly five years after it announced its “moonshot” sustainability goals in 2020, “the moon has gotten further away”.

Among GPs, meanwhile, some fund managers insisted their firms were sticking to net-zero plans, while others were applying targets on a case-by-case basis.

One fund manager said that 80 percent of portfolio companies in his firm’s next fund will likely adhere to the Corporate Net-Zero Standard from the Science Based Targets Initiative.

Another said her firm had set a target for portfolio companies to reduce emissions by 15-25 percent, but only if it was economical, adding that it was not feasible for an airline, for example, to spend extra for sustainable aviation fuel. Yet another fund manager said their firm does not set specific goals for portfolio companies but does try to put them on a pathway to net zero.

A venture capital fund manager who makes the annual pilgrimage to Climate Week described the “atmospherics” as bad this year, but said he was “pleasantly surprised” by the turnout and encouraged that participants had “not just walked away”.

Perhaps they, like him, were drawn back by the prospects of outsized investment returns. Following a “supercycle” of climate technology investments in the past 10 years, the seeds of innovation are starting to sprout, he said, leading to a deal pipeline “unprecedented in terms of quality and quantity”.

Dealflow is up, valuations are down, and the market is still propelled by macroeconomic tailwinds from Europe, he said. “It is one of the most compelling times to invest capital.”",https://media.newprivatemarkets.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-53273228.jpg,N,,2025-10-02 12:56:54.477178

Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.
Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.
The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy.
And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.","It’s no surprise that the market survey revealed that interest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is most prevalent in the Americas and Europe. This is likely due to this year’s introduction of a 2% mandate in the EU and the UK, which is boosting demand, and the US growing its capacity which Fastmarkets predicts will double from 4 million tonnes in 2025 to 8 million tonnes in 2030.

But while these two regions were of interest to 65% of those surveyed, there is growing interest in developments in Latin America and Asia, with the former seeing key developments in places such as Brazil and the latter becoming a key current and future producer.

Government mandates and incentives were seen as the biggest factor driving SAF adoption, hardly surprising given that the UK and Europe led with the introduction of a 2% SAF blending mandate for 2025, which has cemented this region’s position as the primary demand base for sustainable aviation fuel.

Nevertheless, technological breakthroughs and cost reduction, followed by feedstock availability and sustainability, took the second and third spot respectively.

This was driven in part by concerns about the cost implications of novel production pathways such as alcohol-to-jet (AtJ) and power-to-liquid (PtL) technology, alongside restrictions on the use of certain feedstocks in SAF production and adoption in Europe, where only approved waste-based feedstocks are accepted.

Of the entities surveyed, fuel producers and suppliers were the most prevalent, more than 23% of those surveyed. Under the terms of the EU and UK mandates, the fuel suppliers are the obligated parties and are liable for penalties if the 2% target is not met.

But technology providers (15%) and investors and financiers (13%) were a sizeable portion of respondents with these firms playing a growing role in meeting the production challenges for SAF, with new technologies such as AtJ and PtL proving costly.

Airlines meanwhile, were less than 11% of respondents, exposed to SAF market dynamics but, in most cases, not obligated parties under the terms of the EU and UK SAF mandates.

Following on from the prior indicators, among all participants in the survey, the biggest hurdle to market and operational growth for SAF was indicated as regulatory uncertainty and inconsistency.

The UK and EU have a clear SAF mandate, but in the US no mandate exists or is planned, and incentives have been patchy. Furthermore, an extension of EU trade defence measures to cover US SAF will likely hamper future export potential.

And elsewhere, while countries like Singapore and South Korea will introduce SAF mandates, many other states and regions lack clear plans to require or encourage SAF use.

The project represents the first step toward creating a climate-aligned aviation fuel supply chain in Uzbekistan and positioning the Khorezm region as an emerging hub for sustainable energy and industrial innovation.

The agreements were finalized during the International Investment Forum in Khiva, where Khorezm Governor Jurabek Rakhimov met with a delegation led by Mr. Alfred Benedict, Chairman and Managing Director. The discussions focused on next steps to advance the “Production of Environmentally Friendly Aviation Fuel” project following execution of the land and water agreements, which have now secured the essential resources required for project development.

The project is aligned with Uzbekistan’s national climate ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2030. By producing zero-carbon fuel at scale, the Khorezm SAF, e-SAF and green diesel will displace fossil fuel use in transport and industry, lowering greenhouse-gas emissions and advancing the country’s green energy transition.

In addition to its environmental benefits, the investment is expected to generate hundreds of skilled jobs and strengthen Uzbekistan’s position as a regional hub for green energy.

“This agreement is a landmark moment for Allied Biofuels and for Khorezm,” said Mr. Alfred Benedict, Chairman and Managing Director “By combining international expertise with local support, we are creating a facility that will not only supply sustainable aviation fuel at scale but also help Uzbekistan achieve its ambitious net-zero targets while fostering economic growth in the region.”

The Governor of Khorezm region, Mr. Jurabek Rakhimov, at a meeting within the framework of the International Investment Forum, expressed his gratitude to the company representatives for choosing the Khorezm region for the implementation of this project. He emphasized that the implementation of this project will further strengthen the region's position as a green energy center, create hundreds of jobs through the investments made, and make a significant contribution to the further development of the regional economy.

IAG invests in OXCCU to accelerate SAF development

International Airlines Group (IAG) has joined the £20.75 million ($28 million) Series B funding round for OXCCU, a UK SAF innovator.

The round attracted new and existing investors, including Safran Corporate Ventures, Orlen and Aramco Ventures, among other backers.

IAG invested through IAGi Ventures, its corporate venturing arm, which committed up to €200 million over five years earlier this year. This represents the largest such investment pledge by a European airline group to date.

OXCCU, spun out of Oxford University, has created a patented process converting waste carbon gases and hydrogen into jet fuel hydrocarbons. The process removes a conventional step, reducing capital and operating costs while allowing use of varied carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen inputs.

The Series B funding will help OXCCU execute its scale-up strategy and accelerate commercialisation of its technology. The raise follows the opening of its first demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport last year. It will also support a larger facility, expected to be operational in 2026, advancing the UK’s SAF mandate and IAG’s decarbonisation goals.

Ignacio Tovar, IAG’s Director of Innovation, said the group focuses on backing companies with meaningful climate impact. He highlighted OXCCU’s technology as vital for scaling sustainable aviation. According to him, IAG helps partners grow faster by acting as early adopters, sharing expertise, and encouraging collaboration across its airline ecosystem.

IAG was the first airline group to pledge net zero by 2050. It also targets 10% SAF usage by 2030. In 2024, 1.9% of its fuel came from SAF, saving 469,000 tonnes of CO2, nearly double the previous year.

,,2025-10-02 12:04:07+00:00,Federation Internationale de l'Automobile,FIA REPORTS PROGRESS ACROSS SUSTAINABILITY AND D&I IN 2024,Not Available,,,,,https://www.fia.com/news/fia-reports-progress-across-sustainability-and-di-2024,"The report shows the federation’s progress since the sustainability and D&I strategy was set out in 2020, and outlines its ongoing efforts to drive sustainable and inclusive practices across motorsport and mobility.
Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.
It is a non-profit organisation committed to driving innovation and championing safety, sustainability and equality across motor sport and mobility.
Founded in 1904, with offices in Paris, London and Geneva, the FIA brings together 245 Member Organisations across five continents, representing millions of road users, motor sport professionals and volunteers.
It develops and enforces regulations for motor sport, including seven FIA World Championships, to ensure worldwide competitions are safe and fair for all.","The report shows the federation’s progress since the sustainability and D&I strategy was set out in 2020, and outlines its ongoing efforts to drive sustainable and inclusive practices across motorsport and mobility. It reaffirms the FIA’s commitment across both these areas, which remain a top priority for the FIA.

In environmental sustainability, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

The expansion of the Environmental Accreditation Programme during the year, which saw an 45% uptake increase from 2023

The launch of the Sustainable Fuel Certification Programme to guide responsible use of advanced fuels in competition

Investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the first time

€273,000 granted to sustainability programmes overall

FIA operations:

Maintained commitment to reduce absolute emissions by 2030

Carbon intensity measure fell by 7% year-on-year, despite an absolute emissions increase of 9%

This was against a backdrop of an increase in general activities, revenue and headcount

While the FIA recognises there is more to do, the above demonstrates a positive foundation to build from as it continues the push for decarbonisation and emissions reduction.

In D&I and social impact, highlights included:

Programmes with the wider community

Expansion of Girls on Track programme to new markets

The launch of two flagship initiatives:

FIA Women in Motorsport Mentoring Programme, which benefited 286 participants in 2024 across 79 countries, and has expanded to 445 participants so far 2025

CareerShift, which welcomed 50 students in its first year and has more than doubled participation since

Together, these programmes promote greater inclusivity within the sport by offering young people from different backgrounds and ethnicities the opportunity to connect with and learn from motorsport professionals across the career spectrum.

FIA people

32% of the FIA workface was female in 2024, with almost half of those women in senior roles

Headcount increased by 17% on prior year, with almost half of those new hires being women

The overall employee base comprised over 30 different nationalities across four regions

Alongside this growth trajectory, the FIA continued to improve gender equity practices through its EDGE certification, introduced more flexible working models for employees, and reviewed and improved recruitment and promotion polices and practices during the period

In June 2025 the FIA split its Sustainability and D&I function into two separate divisions, which now report into Willem Groenewald, Secretary General for Automobile Mobility and Sustainability, and Alessandra Malhamé, People, Workplace and D&I Senior Director, respectively. With this new structure in place, and at the mid-point of the 10-year strategy set out in 2020, the FIA will take this opportunity to review its approach to ensure it is driving impactful change against a clear strategy for both areas. A further update on this will be provided in due course.

Please see the full report for details on all activities across Sustainability and Diversity & Inclusion in 2024.

Mohammed Ben Sulayem, President of the FIA, said: “Five years into the FIA’s ambitious strategy, it is clear there is more to do. As we look to the future, I am confident the FIA will continue to play a leading role in facing the challenges ahead, which are significant. Together, with our Member Clubs, partners, and stakeholders, we will drive positive change, not just for performance, but for people, our communities, and our planet.”

Andrew Fraser, Chair, FIA Sustainability and D&I Committee, said: “We strengthened the FIA’s sustainability, diversity, and inclusion foundations to drive meaningful progress across sport and mobility during the year. While there is still more to do, we are determined to focus and lead. Together, these developments reflect our commitment to equipping our Members and the wider community with the tools, opportunities, and oversight needed to turn intent into lasting impact.”​

The plant represents an investment in the future of sustainable mobility and is a key part of Rivian's strategy to expand the adoption of EVs.

The project, which is expected to begin construction in 2026, cements a partnership with the state of Georgia to foster green technology and manufacturing.

“Our Georgia facility will support our global expansion and provide the scale necessary to get millions of future drivers in our incredible all-electric vehicles, both in the United States and overseas.”

The multi-billion-dollar investment is not only a step for Rivian but also a substantial development for the regional economy, framed within the context of the growing green sector.

The plant is expected to create 7,500 direct jobs by 2030. According to an analysis by IMPLAN, the project will also result in nearly 8,000 indirect jobs.

This influx of employment could generate more than US$1bn in labour income annually, supporting suppliers and local businesses in Jasper, Morgan, Newton and Walton Counties.

This development was marked by the attendance of state officials, including Georgia Governor Brian Kemp.

“Today is another milestone in bringing quality, good-paying jobs to Georgians in this part of the state,” says the Governor.

""With today’s groundbreaking, this company is further delivering on its commitment to the people of Georgia and the thousands of hardworking Americans who will work at this facility will see generational benefits for their families.”

This sentiment was echoed by Speaker of the House Jon Burns who noted the project will ""lay the foundation for billions in long-term economic benefits across our state"".

Environmental management in EV production

Rivian plans to build the facility in two phases, with each phase having the capacity to produce 200,000 units annually.

Once complete, the 400,000-unit total yearly capacity will be essential for supporting the sale of American-built EVs in international markets.

The scale of production is an important aspect of making EVs more accessible and accelerating the move away from fossil fuels.

The facilities form part of the Cranfield Hydrogen Incubation Integrator, a hub of laboratories, test cells and hydrogen fuel supply technologies which will be the foundation to bringing about a step-change in the UK’s hydrogen R&D capability.
Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation.
In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.
Additionally, Cranfield Airport has previously supported the first cross-channel hybrid electric flight and the world’s first hydrogen-electric passenger aircraft flight .","An airside hydrogen electric tug is now in operation at Cranfield Airport, in a significant development which is reducing carbon emissions and helping to prove hydrogen technologies in a working airport environment.

The tug is being used to manoeuvre aircraft and is being refuelled from an on-site HyQube hydrogen refueller, and in future it will be refuelled from a mobile hydrogen refueller truck, the HyTruck, supplied by Fuel Cell Systems. The facilities form part of the Cranfield Hydrogen Incubation Integrator, a hub of laboratories, test cells and hydrogen fuel supply technologies which will be the foundation to bringing about a step-change in the UK’s hydrogen R&D capability.

Built by the Ultra Low Emission Mileage Company Ltd (ULEMCo) the tug is an ex-RAF Medium Aircraft Tow Tractor that has been converted from diesel to electric hybrid running with a 100% hydrogen zero emission combustion engine. That means a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions and other air pollutants as an essential part of airport operations.

Robert Abbot, Director of Airport Operations at Cranfield University, said: “Using the ULEMCo hydrogen tug is another step towards the net zero goal for aviation. It’s easy to forget that airports aren’t just about the planes, and all of the vehicles used on site produce emissions that need to be reduced. In the case of the hydrogen tug we’re pleased to support our colleagues at the National Flying Laboratory Centre (NFLC) who drove the project into life.

“At Cranfield Airport we’re always aiming to be at the forefront when it comes to decarbonisation, whether that’s the hydrogen tug, moving to electrification for Executive Handling Vehicles or offering sustainable aviation fuel as a refuelling option. We’re continually exploring ways to make our operation more sustainable.”

Robert Harrison, Head of the NFLC, said: “The ULEMCo hydrogen tug is an important part of the NFLC’s drive to demonstrate sustainable aviation.

""Green hydrogen is a key component of our Strategy 2030 as a means of decarbonizing our fuel production and a key to OMV's responsible transformation"".

OMV awarded Germany's Siemens Energy AG the engineering, procurement and construction contract, including the supply of the plant's electrolysis technology. OMV contracted Vienna-ased STRABAG AG for the civil construction work.

On April 30 OMV announced the start of production at its first commercial-scale green hydrogen facility, built with a capacity of 1,500 MMtpa at the Schwechat refinery. The plant uses a 10-MW PEM (polymer electrolyte membrane) electrolyzer powered by hydro, solar and wind energy.

The process avoids up to 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions a year, equivalent to the CO2 consumption of 2,000 persons per year based on a European Union average, according to OMV.

Output from the hydrogen plant will be used to decarbonize the refinery and produce more sustainable fuels and chemicals including sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel, OMV said.

Also on April 30 OMV and Abu Dhabi Future Energy Co PJSC (Masdar) said they had signed a letter of intent to collaborate on producing green hydrogen and derivatives.

Semielliptical Modification of the Symmetrical Dolphin 0006 Airfoil

Abstract

The original Dolphin airfoil family, invented by Iosif Taposu, has greatly influenced the development and modifications of airfoils. This innovation has led to creating a family of seven hybrid Dolphin airfoils. In this paper, a new symmetrical hybrid semi-elliptical Dolphin airfoil is presented. Using the semi-elliptical modification method, also known as the natural optimization method, a novel airfoil, designated as the hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 airfoil, was obtained. This modification method involves reshaping the sharp leading edge of the original Dolphin airfoils, resulting in a complete redesign in the nose domain. Numerical calculations of the original Dolphin airfoils for subsonic flow regimes and Reynolds numbers around 6.0 x 106, along with standard roughness, have shown significant flow separation occurring in the leading edge zone even at small angles of attack. As a result, around 30% of the leading edge zone had to be remodeled to preserve aerodynamic efficiency. The fourth and final modification of the airfoil resulted in the Dolphin 0006 M4, selected as the final name of the airfoil. Results demonstrate that the modified hybrid Dolphin 0006 M4 shows improved aerodynamic efficiency when compared to its geometrical counterparts, the NACA 0006 and the Original Dolphin 0006 airfoils. This airfoil is suitable for general aviation applications, and potentially UAVs, alongside other airfoils from the hybrid Dolphin airfoil family created by the authors of this paper. This symmetrical airfoil of small 6% thickness ratio would primarily be aimed for the tail surfaces of flying vehicles aimed for high speed cruise regimes.

Prioritizing Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production: An AHP-Based Approach

Abstract

As the aviation industry seeks to reduce its carbon footprint, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) have emerged as a critical solution for achieving sustainability goals. The selection of appropriate feedstocks for SAF production is pivotal, given the diverse options available and their varying impacts on sustainability, cost, and scalability. This study aims to prioritize feedstocks for SAF production using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a well-established multi-criteria decision-making method. The feedstocks analyzed include waste oils and fats, municipal solid waste, cellulosic waste, cover crops, non-biogenic alternative fuels, jatropha, halophytes, and algae. The AHP framework was used to structure the decision-making process by organizing the feedstocks into a hierarchy, with the goal of identifying the most suitable option at the top level. Criteria such as environmental impact, economic viability, and technological maturity were considered in pairwise comparisons to determine the relative importance of each feedstock. The results reveal that Waste Oils and Fats (0.32), Municipal Solid Waste (0.24), and Cellulosic Waste (0.20) are the top feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel production. These feedstocks stand out due to their high sustainability potential and scalability. Their common strengths include efficient resource use and significant environmental benefits, making them key options for advancing SAF production. This study provides a systematic approach to feedstock selection, aiding the aviation industry in making informed decisions that align with sustainability objectives and the scaling of SAF production.

Fast Response Aerodynamic Multihole Probe – Mechanism for Calibration and Possibilities for Measurements

Abstract

Simultaneous measurements of 3D velocity field and pressure is of great importance. Complex air flows exist in nature, as well as in numerous technical systems. These flows exhibit high levels of turbulence, requiring high sampling rates for accurate measurement. Analyzing such flows is possible using optical methods (laser Doppler velocimetry or particle image velocimetry), hot-wire anemometry or spatial probes. The advantage of multihole probes is simultaneous measurement of 3D velocity field and pressure.

The problem with optical methods is that they require laboratory conditions and they are not often used, except in special well prepared cases, on-site.Their advantage lies in non-invasiveness, high sampling rates and precision. On the other hand, standard spatial multiholeprobes are not suitable for measuring flows with high levels of turbulence. Newer generations of the multiholeprobes are capable of these measurements with fewer drawbacks. Integrating fast pressure transducers into the probe handles has enabled high sampling rates. These probes are known as FRAP (Fast Response Aerodynamic Probe).

In this paper is presented five hole FRAP, mechanism and installation for its calibration. The developed half-automatic mechanism for pitch-yaw calibration in the Laboratory of the Hydraulic Machinery and Energy Systems Department, at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mechanical Engineering is introduced. Calibration is performed by placing the probe in a known flow field in the nozzle of the wind tunnel with low level of turbulence (less than 2%). Specified pitch-yaw calibration angles should cover all the angles of attack that will encounter during application.

Investigating the Ability of Turbulence Models to Predict Stall

Abstract

A detailed numerical study of the flows around the airfoil NACA 23012 near stall, at angles-of-attack ranging between 12.4° and 16.2°, Mach number M = 0.18 and Reynolds number Re = 1.8 million, was conducted by Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) equations closed by the commonly employed Menter’s k–ω shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model in contrast to the wall-modelled large eddy simulation (WMLES). All these flow simulations were performed in ANSYS FLUENT on the same, sufficiently refined computational mesh with dimensionless wall distance y + ≈ 30. The comparison of the obtained numerical and available experimental results points to the inability of RANS modeling to adequately capture the flow in the post-stall region whereas it performs satisfactorily in the attached, pre-stall region. Although relative errors of lift and drag coefficients remain within an acceptable range, the numerical stall seems delayed or not predicted at all. On the other hand, WMLES manages to reproduce the expected trend of aerodynamic coefficients, while the actual numerical values appear underrated in comparison to the measured values. Both modeling approaches are critically evaluated with regard to the flow separation phenomenon appearing at airfoils at high angles-of-attack and some conclusions are provided.

Towards Realistic Urban Environment-Based UAV Simulations

Abstract

Up to date information about road surface conditions is a valuable asset that is globally relevant. An efficient system that can collect road surface data allows for targeted and timely use of resources in case of various road surface related problems. The most prevalent use cases are road maintenance planning, emergency repairs and weather effects including floods or snow. Using the data can also benefit road users through enhancing route planning. This study relates to the concept of utilizing a network of UAVs for road surface data provision. While UAVs are more than capable of collecting road surface data, developing a complete system, that can do so safely and efficiently is challenging. To aid the development of such a system, this study focuses on virtualization opportunities through urban environment modelling. Virtually representing road networks in a relevant environment enables more efficient development of the system by reducing cost, risk and greatly improving mission availability and execution performance. The presented methodology is capable of rapid model generation of arbitrary urban regions based on GIS data at a medium fidelity level. The various road surface features (potholes in this example) can be injected into this model and can be detected with UAVs using the Gazebo SITL simulation environment and a computer vision recognition system. The proposed approach demonstrates the viability of further system development within a virtual environment.

Safety of e-VTOL Aircraft Operations in the Context of Maintenance and Engineering Approach

Abstract

Urban air mobility operations using electric-Vertical Take-Off and landing (e-VTOL) vehicles intended for air transportation of passengers and mail within metropolitan areas. Several original aircraft manufacturers and new start-up entities have developed hundreds of e-VTOL aircraft models with various concepts and design architectures. The public expects these air vehicles to have lower operating costs, be less noisy, and be more accessible. Alongside with operational integration of the airspace and the air traffic management system, ground infrastructure development, implementation of vertiports to support the operations, and reliability of communication, navigation, and surveillance systems, this study presents an identification and discussion of future maintenance-related safety challenges. The study reveals that at the stage of initial operations, the most important components vulnerable to failure are the electronic speed controller, elements of battery system, motors, and propellers. Therefore, the original equipment manufacturers intending to obtain type certificates for their e-VTOL aircraft must establish sufficient, reliable Maintenance Planning Document (Maintenance Program) and training programs to adequately mitigate the safety issue. Applying a comprehensive approach and a detailed reliability analysis of safety precautions for e-VTOL aircraft in the context of maintenance and engineering contributes to preventing technical errors and reaching the goal of preserving airworthiness.

Probabilistic-Adaptive Kalman Filtering for Fault-Tolerant Estimation of UAV States

Abstract

A probabilistic-adaptive Kalman filter (pAKF) algorithm for the fault tolerant estimation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) dynamics in the presence of measurement faults is proposed. The proposed pAKF based on the evaluation of the posterior probability of the normal operation of the system, given for the current measurement. This probability is proposed to calculate via the posterior probability density of the normalized innovation sequence at the current estimation step. As a result, faults in the estimation system are corrected by the system, without affecting the good estimation behaviour. The developed pAKF algorithm is applied for the fault tolerant estimation of the UAV dynamics. The proposed pAKF algorithm is tested for the two different measurement malfunction scenarios; continuous bias at measurements and measurement noise increment.

ADS-B System Implementation in Civil Aviation: Benefits and Cyber Security Risks

Abstract

A giant step in the modernization and improvement of the quality of aviation operations is the introduction of the aviation system that relies on satellite positioning technology - Automatic Dependent Surveillance − Broadcast (ADS−B. It operates in two modes: ADS-B Out and ADS-B In. ADS-B Out, the core function for communication between the aircraft and air traffic control (ATC), has become a mandatory global standard. ADS-B In, an optional service, allows the aircraft to receive and display detailed information broadcast by other aircraft in the vicinity. ADS-B is designed with the latest technology, making it suitable for retrofitting on aircraft currently in operation. However, ADS–B transmits information over open and unencrypted protocols, so it can be easily compromised using existing hardware and software: ADS–B can be exposed to different types of cyber-attacks, such as eavesdropping, jamming and spoofing. According to ICAO assessments, the risk of a successful cyber-attack resulting in the loss of human life is relatively low compared to other types of terrorist attacks. However, recent incidents have shown a rising number of cyber disruptions affecting airline operations. While these incidents may seem minor, they are occurring with increasing frequency and could lead to more severe consequences.

Analysis of the Possibility of Measuring the Velocity Field Inside an Axial Fan Impeller Using PIV

Abstract

Although extremely important in the world of science, turbulence is one of the least described physical phenomena. In the world of turbomachinery, it represents an area of great importance to researchers in academia and industry worldwide. Turbulent swirling structures occur inside the fan’s impeller, as well as on its discharge and suction sides. To describe this phenomenon, it is necessary to measure the velocity field in the areas of interest. Various measurement methods are used for this, but PIV and LDA stand out as the most modern non-invasive methods. Taking into account that the mentioned flow must be considered as three dimensional, composed form three components it further complicates the measurement. From a technical point of view, the conduction of these experiments represents a very complex and challenging task. This is a great challenge, especially for the measurements inside the impeller.

To capitalise on this investment, airport operators may consider the benefits of owning and operating their joint user hydrant infrastructure (JUHI). Transferring JUHI ownership to airport operators involves more than simply an asset sale agreement – a new ecosystem of interconnecting contracts and an open access model for its use must be created.

Current fuel setting

Climate change and industry's desire to reduce carbon emissions is reshaping global aviation. Airlines have committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and identified that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is essential to achieving this goal. In Australia, SAF will be required for two-thirds of domestic flights and all international flights to meet the net-zero goal; as electrification and hydrogen offer medium-term solutions for short flights, SAF will be required for flights over 1000km.

While today SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of aviation fuel consumed, the aviation industry is working to ensure that the foundations are in place to enable adequate SAF supply at Australian airports by 2050. One of the key foundations is open access to jet fuel infrastructure. Any restrictions to access in the jet fuel supply chain in Australia may pose barriers to SAF supply and lessen competition between suppliers. In this article, we highlight how Australian airports are opening access to jet fuel infrastructure and the legal issues to consider in these transactions.

Sustainable aviation fuel: the local industry

SAFs are fuels used in commercial aviation which can reduce CO2 emissions by 80%. It contains the same hydrocarbons as fossil-based jet fuel, but the hydrocarbons are derived from sustainable sources. While fossil fuels add to the overall level of CO2 by emitting carbon, SAF recycles the CO2 which had been absorbed by the biomass used in the feedstock. At this stage however SAFs are more expensive to produce and limited in their availability compared to conventional jet fuel.

Recent developments in the local SAF industry include:

Qantas has committed to using 10% SAF in its fuel mix by 2030, and in May this year accepted delivery of Australia's largest SAF import with nearly two million litres arriving in Sydney.

Between March and July 2025, Viva Energy supplied Virgin Australia with blended SAF (consisting of conventional Jet-A1 and a 30-40% synthetic blend made from waste and residue feedstocks) for flights departing from Proserpine, Queensland.

IFM Investors, GrainCorp and Ampol have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to assess the feasibility of a renewable fuel facility, including SAF, at Ampol's Lytton refinery in Brisbane. This project will explore the production of SAF from Australian feedstock and reduce Australia's dependence on overseas fuel imports.

Two of these projects (among others) are supported by the Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel Funding Initiative.

A necessary ingredient in the industry's success is SAF suppliers having access to jet fuel infrastructure to supply their customers. The jet fuel infrastructure is a critical element in the complex supply chain dominated by vertically integrated fuel suppliers.

Jet fuel supply chain in Australia

The Australian jet fuel supply chain is complex and comprises both off- and on-airport infrastructure, including JUHI and pipelines on airport land leased by airport operators from the Commonwealth. Jet fuel is typically shipped from an overseas refinery, transported to a local refinery by tanker or pipeline, then pumped into the fuel tanks at the JUHI facility via a pipeline owned and operated by a fuel supplier.

JUHI owners are often vertically integrated fuel suppliers involved in an unincorporated joint venture which owns and operates the JUHI. Often the only means by which a new entrant can supply fuel to an airline is to purchase an equity stake in a JUHI joint venture.

Australian airport operators have traditionally not owned or operated the JUHI, but since 2020 the position has begun to change.
