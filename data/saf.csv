Pages on the federal government’s SAF Grand Challenge were also updated to reflect the new name. The challenge is a multi-agency effort by DOE, the Department of Transportation and USDA. The grand challenge sets a goal of 3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF production by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050.

Apart from the name, it appears little has changed in the actual substance of what the federal government considers a synthetic aviation fuel. The new DOE page on synthetic aviation fuel notes that the alternative source can reduce airline emissions from flights, and includes a list of feedstocks for producing SAF. That menu still includes key sources like corn grain, oilseeds, algae, agricultural and forestry residues and more.

The move follows a larger push by the Trump administration to remove some climate-related initiatives from agency websites and halt funds for climate measures.

In January, USDA and other agencies began removing some climate-related content from websites. This included information from the Natural Resources Conservation Service page on climate-smart mitigation activities.

Early in the Trump administration, the White House ordered agencies to review programs to ensure they are in compliance with efforts to rid the government of “green new deal” spending. This has also been accompanied by funding freezes for climate-related programs like the Partnerships for Climate Smart Commodities and USDA conservation programs.",,N,2025-03-07 13:01:51.917507

The airline will offer passengers the option to choose SAF when their booking flights.

SAS and Alpine World Cup Åre are working to make travel more sustainable for large international sporting events that rely heavily on air transport.

The use of SAF is expected to lower emissions, with the potential to cut life cycle carbon emissions by up to 80% in comparison to conventional jet fuel.

Alpine World Cup Åre CEO Olle Danielsson said: “We recognise that air travel is an integral part of international sports, and we are committed to making travel to Alpine World Cup Åre as sustainable as possible.

“Through our partnership with SAS, we aim to take responsibility and inspire other stakeholders in the sports world to make conscious travel choices.”

The aviation sector’s transformation towards sustainability requires collective action from various stakeholders, including airlines, policymakers, authorities, corporations, and travellers, according to SAS.

,,2025-03-07 15:25:04+00:00,www.consulting.us,Sustainable aviation fuel demand projected to soar by 2030,,,,,https://www.consulting.us/news/11523/sustainable-aviation-fuel-demand-projected-to-soar-by-2030,"Despite this projected increase in production, current production of SAF is still seriously lagging.
In order to meet the expected demand in 2030, an additional 5.8 Mt of capacity will be needed.
The estimated future demand for SAF was calculated by looking at mandates and targets for SAF set by countries around the world.
HEFA SAF production capacity has been quickly increasing and could be the aviation industry’s best bet to meet increasing demand.
“The capital landscape for SAF investment is complex, with significant financial requirements across different project stages, from conceptualization and pre-feasibility to construction and commissioning.","Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is expected to reach 17.1 Mt/a (million tons per annum) by the end of the decade, according to a report from Kearney and the WEF. That means investment from $19 billion to up to $45 billion will be needed.

Despite this projected increase in production, current production of SAF is still seriously lagging. In order to meet the expected demand in 2030, an additional 5.8 Mt of capacity will be needed. For that to be possible, final investment decisions would need to be made by as soon as next year.

If global production does meet the supply projected by the report, it could well mean that the goal set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for a 5% reduction in the carbon footprint of international aviation by 2030 may well be achievable.

The estimated future demand for SAF was calculated by looking at mandates and targets for SAF set by countries around the world. For example, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Brazil, and Korea have all announced mandates that will be ramped up towards 2030.

It was all of these mandates and targets together that add up to 17.1 Mt/a of SAF in 2030. But with global production still at a very low level, reaching that estimated demand would mean an increase of SAF production capacity equal to around 5.8 Mt/a.

Different feedstocks, different outlooks

There are several different feedstocks that are used to manufacture SAF, each of which requires different amounts of investment in order to be successful. One of the most promising paths to viable SAF supply is what is known as the Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) method, which uses waste oils and fats.

HEFA SAF production capacity has been quickly increasing and could be the aviation industry’s best bet to meet increasing demand. That is mainly because the HEFA method is currently the least expensive, due to its efficiency and the maturity of the technology involved, meaning less capital expenditure is necessary.

“To expand existing pathways further, research is being done to overcome feedstock constraints,” reads the report.

“Examples include Brazilian energy company Acelen Renewables looking into macauba palm oil and GAFT, a Dutch company specializing in green air fuel technology, converting feedstocks using electrolysis and fermentation.”

Another method used to manufacture SAF is the alcohol-to-jet method, which uses ethanol and could be an option for countries with high ethanol production. This method is still an attractive pathway despite requiring more investment than HEFA.

There are other, more novel methods for producing SAF that still require more development, like transforming sewage waste through a process of hydrothermal liquefaction. The most expensive pathway is currently the power-to-liquid method, which can be up to eight times as expensive as conventional jet fuel.

More investment needed

The total estimated investment required to meet the expected demand for SAF by 2030 ranges between $19 billion and $45 billion, according to the report. That wide range in estimates is due to the different costs of developing different pathways.

For example, developing 99% of SAF from HEFA (the cheapest option) would only require around $19 billion in investments, but if the industry shifts towards developing other feedstocks that are more expensive, more investment would be needed.

“Attracting capital for SAF refineries is a challenging process that requires engaging with a wide range of stakeholders and exploring a myriad of financial instruments and mechanisms,” reads the report.

Some of the levers for attracting finance to these projects include pursuing research grants, tapping into funding from multilateral development banks, and issuing green bonds to attract impact investors, among other levers.

“SAF represents a crucial pillar in the decarbonization journey of the aviation industry, offering one of the most viable options to achieve the global vision for 2030,” the report concludes.

“The capital landscape for SAF investment is complex, with significant financial requirements across different project stages, from conceptualization and pre-feasibility to construction and commissioning. For SAF to reach scalable production, a shift in financing mechanisms is necessary, leveraging both private and public capital in innovative ways.”",https://www.consulting.us/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-03-07-102720383-Sustainable_aviation_fuel_demand_projected_to_soar_by_2030_spot.jpg,N,2025-03-07 12:02:00.714841

Gevo North Dakota: Carbon Capture and Sequestration (“CCS”) and Low-Carbon Ethanol Assets generated $150 million in revenue in its last fiscal year3 and we expect it to immediately contribute $30 million to $60 million of Adjusted EBITDA1 annually to Gevo’s carbon business. This facility in North Dakota, which was recently acquired from Red Trail Energy, LLC, is one of two low-carbon ethanol plants with operational CCS that exist today. The site has an operating, fully permitted Class VI CCS well, which captures over 160,000 tons of biogenic carbon dioxide annually; generates multiple times that amount in total carbon abatement; produces approximately 67 million gallons of low-carbon ethanol, including 2 million gallons of corn fiber ethanol with an ultra-low carbon intensity; and more than 230,000 tons of low-carbon animal feed and vegetable oil. As a result, this facility has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores in the industry, at 19 gCO2e/MJ (from British Columbia) or an estimated 21 gCO2e/MJ (under the Argonne-R&D-GREET model). We note that the ethanol 45Z tax credit, which takes effect in 2025 and expires in 2027 (unless renewed by legislation), provides a statutory $0.02 per gallon per carbon intensity point below approximately 50 gCO2e/MJ. In addition, we are developing an additional alcohol-to-jet (“ATJ”) project at this location for further future growth, leveraging our existing ATJ designs associated with the ATJ-60 project in South Dakota. The high quality carbon abatement credits generated at this plant are expected to further catalyze the development of the emerging market for carbon abatement products.

Renewable Natural Gas (“RNG”): We have achieved excellent operational results that are expected to improve further in 2025 and generate meaningful Adjusted EBITDA1. RNG produced in 2024 was 367,000 MMBtu, which was a 17% increase over the prior year, because of a successful gas upgrade capacity expansion. 2025 production is expected to further increase to over 400,000 MMBtu as a result of compressor and reliability upgrades. Our RNG facility has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to generate biogas 45Z tax credits. Based on the expected carbon intensity (“CI”) score for California LCFS of (339) gCO2e/MJ, a negative number, and depending on LCFS prices, monetization of the biogas 45Z tax credit, D3 RIN prices, and price of fossil based natural gas, we expect Adjusted EBITDA1 of $9 – 18 million in 2025.

Alcohol-to-Jet 603 (“ATJ-60”) Project: The ATJ-60 project in Lake Preston, South Dakota continues to proceed towards financial close in 2025. In 2024, we received a conditional commitment for a loan guarantee with disbursements totaling $1.462 billion (excluding capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (“DOE”) Loan Programs Office (“LPO”) for our ATJ-60 project. With capitalized interest during construction, the DOE loan facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.63 billion. We are actively engaged with the DOE on the closing process for the conditional commitment. Our ATJ-60 project is expected to leverage American agriculture to produce both cost-effective fuels and food, which are integral for energy and food security of the United States. We believe our ATJ-60 project integrates seamlessly with existing energy infrastructure and catalyzes the development of the rural economy. The project is expected to generate 100 jobs at the facility, as well as 700 indirect positions in support, plus 1,000 high-paying trades jobs for the three years of construction5. This project is expected to have regional economic impact greater than $110 million per year. We are currently engaged with the DOE LPO on due diligence, definitive documentation, completing the environmental review process, and satisfaction of all conditions precedent that are required for financial close. We expect to incur $40 million of additional spend on ATJ-60 from January 1, 2025, until financial close. Our cumulative ATJ-60 development spending is expected to be partially reimbursed at project financial close. We may invest some or all of the reimbursed funds back into ATJ-60 as equity.

Verity: We are continuing to grow our Verity business, delivering our tracking and tracing solution to the market, expanding the customer base, and achieving revenue. Verity is a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) business that achieved its goal of first customer revenue in 2024 and our grower program has grown to more than 200,000 acres, which is more than double the acreage in the program since the second quarter of 2024, with 100% farmer retention. Verity is a digital measure, report and verify (“MRV”) software platform for end-to-end traceability of the regenerative attributes of agricultural and low-carbon fuel products. This enables producers and customers to measure and track those attributes and create value in the marketplace, where demand for regenerative agriculture and fuels is increasing but visibility is lacking. Verity currently has agreements with seven agriculture processing plant customers, including five ethanol plants and two soybean processing facilities, to assist in tracking environmental attributes of corn, ethanol, animal feed, corn oil, soybean oil and renewable diesel. We believe Verity can provide substantial value to growers and processors of a wide variety of agricultural products globally, in markets valued at billions of dollars.

Ethanol to Olefins (“ETO”): We continue to advance our breakthrough, patented ETO technology. Our patented ETO process is designed to lower capital and operating costs of drop-in, bio-based hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals from ethanol, and adds to Gevo’s global portfolio of more than 300 patents, as well as proprietary processes and know-how concerning processes to convert carbohydrates to hydrocarbons. In October 2024, we signed a development agreement and licensed our ETO technology to Axens with the goal of accelerating the commercialization of our ETO technology for fuels. The alliance between Axens and Gevo was further broadened for ATJ commercialization in December 2024 under a new collaboration agreement. The goal of the alliance is to leverage the most advantaged technologies, which includes Axens Jetanol™ technology combined with Gevo’s plant designs, engineering, know-how, carbon tracking and complete business system. The alliance brings each partner’s complementary value propositions, real-world experience, substantially de-risked technologies, plant integrations, and pre-engineered systems to the ATJ space. We also extended a joint development agreement with LG Chem to accelerate the commercialization of bio-based chemicals using ETO. The global market for drop-in, low-carbon chemicals and materials is estimated to be $400 – 500 billion per year.

Management Comment

“Our strategic acquisition of Gevo North Dakota is transformative for our company,” commented Dr. Patrick Gruber, Gevo’s Chief Executive Officer. “The CCS and low-carbon ethanol provides us with an immediate pathway to monetize carbon abatement through the ethanol 45Z tax credit and by selling carbon abatement in the growing market and the available pore space provides additional opportunities for CCS expansion.”

“In addition, our RNG business is poised for significant growth as we secure a permanent CARB LCFS carbon intensity score and monetize the biogas 45Z tax credit. Taken together, we see a path to achieving a potential run-rate positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2025, even before considering our ATJ-60 project. This is based on the hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon abatement per year that we are currently generating from this diversified, low-carbon asset base,” Dr. Gruber continued.

Dr. Gruber added: “We are pleased that our DOE conditional commitment is progressing towards financial close. We are pleased to see that biofuels, ethanol, and aviation fuels are listed in President Trump’s Executive order “Declaring a National Energy Emergency”. Our ATJ-60 project, targeted for Lake Preston, South Dakota, is expected to create 100 direct jobs, and more than an estimated 700 indirect jobs. The project is expected to employ more than 1,000 construction workers for the three years needed to build the plant. It would draw corn from more than 230 farmers, and we would expect to pay farmers a premium for their regenerative agricultural practices.”

“We never lose sight that we expect that Gevo’s proprietary, integrated ATJ process can deliver sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) with production cost similar to jet fuel made from crude oil,” Dr. Gruber said. “But our process can do this while also eliminating the carbon emission footprint across the whole life cycle of the fuel. It’s about addressing a growing market need, where customers will pay for carbon abatement, in addition to the jet fuel.”

“I don’t think anyone has given up on the pipeline and no one has given up on South Dakota,” says Tom Buis.

The new law would ban the use of eminent domain for a carbon pipeline. Summit Carbon Solutions says the law changes rules in the middle of the game and presents real challenges for the project.

Buis says without eminent domain, the company must get approval from all landowners along the proposed route.

“It’s a setback, but this whole process has been like playing whack-a-mole. One hurdle pops up and you have to take care of it and move on.”

Carbon pipelines can help the U.S. ethanol industry capture, store and sequester carbon to reduce greenhouse gases and make the fuel attractive for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. But these projects haven’t been easy to advance. In 2023, the Navigator CO2 pipeline project was cancelled due to regulatory issues and government processes in South Dakota and Iowa.

The Summit Carbon Pipeline project currently spans five states including Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota. There have been permits issued in many of those states.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz says he thinks the carbon pipeline can still happen.

“We’ll continue to move to different inputs for Sustainable Aviation Fuel, but in the beginning, especially during a trade war, if it’s a good place for a market, we need to work on it.”

But South Dakota is a key state for the project and Governor Larry Rhoden recently told Brownfield “I think it’s incumbent for Summit Carbon to earn back some trust from South Dakota. I think a huge part of our problem is based on this lack of trust.”

Summit Carbon Solutions has previously told Brownfield they’ve been working to repair trust in South Dakota.

Buis says the company has changed from when the project started. “People aren’t giving them any of the benefit of the doubt with the changes made.”

And he says several options are possible for the project moving forward.

“If you look at a map, there are other ways things can be done, I’m sure, but we’ll see what happens. That’s Summit’s decision.”

Summit Carbon Solutions re-submitted a permit application for the project with the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission in November and the project is waiting on the state to issue its decision.",https://cdn.brownfieldagnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Summit-Carbon-Solutions-Map_UpdatedMarch24-e1709591993823.png,N,2025-03-07 11:01:25.841085

Cosmo Energy Holdings is set to launch Japan's first domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in April, a step toward the country's goal of replacing 10 per cent of jet fuel with a cleaner alternative, though cost-cutting challenges remain.

Cosmo, the nation's third-largest refiner, will produce SAF from used cooking oil at its Sakai refinery in western Japan.

""Our goal is to boost SAF supply to 300,000 kilolitres by 2030 through domestic production and imports,"" Takeshi Takada, general manager of new business development, said.

Japanese refiners must supply SAF equivalent to 10 per cent of their aviation fuel sales by 2030, as Japan works to combat climate change and aligns with global efforts to cut carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from airplanes.

Advt

A company official said 300,000 kl (1.89 million barrels) would be sufficient to meet 10 per cent of Cosmo's jet sales.

Cosmo plans to produce 30,000 kl of SAF annually at Sakai, supply 150,000 kl from its Sakaide site in western Japan using bioethanol and import 120,000 kl from Thailand's Bangchak and other Asian suppliers, Takada said.

The refiner aims to build expertise and customer relationships by launching production and sales ahead of competitors, despite challenges in reducing costs, securing raw materials and locking in buyers, he said.

The Sakai project, targeting production of 24,000 kl in fiscal 2025 after accounting for site maintenance, has already secured most customers, including Japan Airlines (JAL), ANA and DHL. Cosmo's next goal is to start SAF production at Sakaide by around 2029, with a final investment decision expected in fiscal 2026. Both projects have secured government subsidies, covering about half of capital expenditures.

Cosmo declined to disclose Sakai's production costs or SAF prices, but the company expects to turn a profit with the help of subsidies. SAF is estimated to cost three to five times more than conventional jet fuel. While higher production volume could lower distribution costs, significant cost reductions are unlikely due to raw material constraints, which make up a large portion of expenses, Takada said.

""Japan's subsidy scheme is at a medium level by global standards ... Countries will compete to offer attractive subsidy schemes for SAF deployment to maintain hub airport status,"" Takada said.

Recently, the Sakaide plant and three other projects secured part of 340 billion yen ( USD2.3 billion) in government subsidies over five years to support local SAF production. The projects include Eneos' 400,000 kl facility in Wakayama, Idemitsu Kosan's 250,000 kl plant in Yamaguchi and Taiyo Oil's 200,000 kl project in Okinawa, all still in the design phase.

Idemitsu has also secured a separate subsidy for a 100,000 kl project in its Chiba refinery near Tokyo. These projects are key to boosting domestic production and meeting Japan's estimated SAF demand of 1.7 million kl by 2030.

Now, he’s helping Corteva look ahead to future generations of seed technology as executive vice president of the company’s seed business unit.

It took a number of years for the entire industry to adopt hybrid corn.
We have 3,000 employees in the state of Iowa, and this is the hub for our global seed business, the R&D.","When Judd O’Connor had the opportunity to join Corteva Agriscience, then Pioneer, in 1999, it was a pivotal time for innovation in the seed industry.

“Biotechnology was really entering into the fray at that point in time and the work, the R&D that was going on in the seed industry was so important to what was going to be the next decade two, three, four to where we are today in agriculture,” O’Connor said.

In his more than 25 years at Corteva, he’s seen transformative innovations become available to farmers, from scientific advancements to technologies based on nearly 100 years of agronomic data. Now, he’s helping Corteva look ahead to future generations of seed technology as executive vice president of the company’s seed business unit. He assumed the role in December 2024, succeeding Tim Glenn.

The agriscience company was formed in 2019 after DuPont Pioneer, DuPont Crop Protection and Dow Agrosciences spun off of DowDuPont to become a stand-alone company. Corteva invests about $4 million each day into research and development across the company and employs around 2,200 people at its Johnston campus, where the seed business is based.

For the first few years of his career, O’Connor worked for American Cyanamid, a crop protection company. He said he often held responsibilities “I really wasn’t qualified” for.

“It shapes you a lot,” he said. “You get to learn things quicker earlier in your career.”

O’Connor said being prepared for the future as a leader is one lesson he’s taken from his career as well as leading people well and doing good work.

“I look forward, and even as I look back, there is never going to be a stagnant point in our industry, in any industry, where you say, ‘We’re done,’ right? … For leaders to prepare themselves to manage change and to lead change versus [reacting] to change, I think is huge,” he said.

The Business Record sat down with O’Connor at Corteva’s Johnston campus to learn more about his career and new role.

This Q&A has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Before this role you served in several leadership roles at Corteva, including as president of the North America business. Can you tell me a little more about that role and what your main focuses were?

I guess first and foremost for us as a business is the farmer is at the center of everything that we do, right? We have a very unique go-to-market in that we’re one of a few companies that have a direct relationship with the farmer. Our people, our Pioneer agents have a direct relationship with the farmer and certainly work really hard to become an integrated part in those farmers’ operations in their decision-making process. So, that’s probably the first thing. The second piece would be as we brought new technologies into the industry, whether it be corn grown above ground or insect control, whether it be below-ground protection, herbicide tolerance in crops, you know, all that innovation that we were bringing through the pipeline at the time, after the farmer, that was the big focus is how we bring this innovation and how we drive in more productivity, more sustainability in the business.

You’ve now been with Corteva for 25 years, how have you seen its innovations and technology evolve?

If you unwind it 100 years, the first big breakthrough innovation, it happened right here in the state of Iowa, was making hybrid corn. We were the ones that did that, and we significantly accelerated the yield per acre of Iowa farm ground with hybrid crosses versus open pollinated corn. It took a number of years for the entire industry to adopt hybrid corn. It was new technology. Information flow wasn’t as readily and easily available like it is today with the push of a button and the entire world knows. I mean, you had to actually go out and knock on doors, right? So hybrid corn was absolutely the first technology, and I guess we can be proud to be the ones that can, you know, say we had the first piece of that. Then we evolved into plant breeding with better disease resistance, and plant breeding with better drought tolerance and plant breeding with all those pieces that come just from the plant breeding side. Then, next generation was around biotechnology and how can you, again, increase those yield and productivity levels on that same acre of ground and do it in a more sustainable way. I think looking forward, gene editing is one that we’re making huge investments in. We have all the optimism in the world. We’re making great strides with it today. It can take seven years to get a hybrid through the pipeline. It can take 15, 16 years to bring a GMO trait through the pipeline. Gene editing is going to allow us to do it in just a fraction of that and it’s just an extremely precise tool. It’s going to be the next breakthrough in terms of next-generation products.

Is Corteva currently developing gene editing solutions?

Our research and development team has been working with it for a number of years now and we’ve actually got products on the shelf ready to go and all kinds of product concepts that our scientists and R&D team are bringing through today, whether that be disease resistance, drought, more yield, reduced stature corn. There’s all kinds of different applications that we can do with gene editing, and not only just in plant breeding. I mean, this can be leveraged in biologicals. You’re seeing things being leveraged in the human health side and the animal health side.

What are some other focuses of Corteva’s R&D teams?

We operate in 100-plus countries around the world today, and I would say that nearly every product no matter where it’s located in the world is likely touched in some way by this facility throughout its life cycle and as we develop those products. This place is an anchor for us and our seed business. We have around 2,200 employees here on campus, and a third of them are scientists with advanced degrees that are operating up here above my level.

We have 3,000 employees in the state of Iowa, and this is the hub for our global seed business, the R&D. Some other spaces that we’re operating in are hybrid wheat. We brought hybrid corn to the table 100 years ago, roughly. Next year, 2026, we’ll be a 100-year-old company and we’ve cracked the code on hybrid wheat and we’re going to bring that into the market commercially here over the next few years. It’ll ramp up obviously but it will be there in 2026, 2027. We’ll have our first hybrid wheat that’ll go in the ground commercially. So you look at what hybridization did for corn and we’ve got some optimists that said, think about what we could do with wheat, which is the largest planted crop in the world. We’ve got a big initiative around biofuels right now and how can we be part of the solution. From a biofuel standpoint, we’re doing some work in the South with winter canola and leveraging our winter canola product line in a double crop situation with soybeans. So a farmer gets two crops in one year and you’ve got a high oil crop like canola that we can work with processors and up the ante on biofuels and our ability to provide sustainable aviation fuel and all those things.

Tell me more about how Corteva is looking at sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). What opportunities are there?

Winter canola, it’s focused there just from a standpoint of can you in a sustainable, renewable way from an ag perspective continue to be part of very specific things like SAF, but we’re already doing that today in a huge way with our ethanol industry in the state of Iowa and Midwest. Biofuels and the shift in energy demand that we’re going to see, we think we have a seat at the table on that and we’re in the beginning stages of working hard to be a part of that.

What shifts in energy demand is Corteva watching?

Well, you’ve seen big shifts in solar, you’ve seen big shifts in wind. Drive around the state of Iowa. You see there’s been big investment in wind. And then sustainable renewable fuel sources like we have with ethanol today, like we have with biodiesel, like we have with now sustainable aviation fuel with the focus on that and some countries having mandates. So can ag and i.e., Corteva, be a pivotal part of enabling that? That’s the play, which means we’re going to probably have evolution in cropping systems, evolution in crops. We’re seeing that with cropping systems we’re testing here in the U.S. today, the products in the ground. We had the first harvest last summer. This will be our second harvest with expanded footprint and expanded acres with winter canola. Biofuels is a big focus for us, and how do we expand the footprint with nontraditional crops that could potentially even be a source, or a solution that we’re not doing today?

What are some of the challenges the regulatory environment can present for Corteva?

We consistently ask for science-based reliable regulation. Some of those things can change with the geopolitical environment, some of those things can change based on things other than science. So how do we keep focused on the fact that we’ve got great technologies that can do great things? And we want it to be fully and thoroughly and rigorously tested. But to invest on the behalf of our farmer customers for a decade and not have consistency or have geopolitical environments that don’t allow consistent and scientific-based regulatory environments creates challenges. It wouldn’t matter whether you talk to us, or Corn Growers Association, Soybean Growers Association, Farm Bureau. It’s a farmer-based challenge as well.

What other challenges does Corteva hear about from farmers and how are you working to address them?

It’s always about productivity. We’ve got a big effort from a decision sciences standpoint to say how do we leverage all the data that a farmer has and help them make better tools, whether it be on hybrid selection or fertility, agronomic practices, timing of when they make applications. We’ve been core and fundamental in high-touch agronomy since our existence started, so what are those key agronomic tools and practices that you can take this great genetic product that you’ve got here in seed and maximize it, right?

When have you had to manage change as a leader?

If you look at where we’re at with production agriculture today versus where we were when I started my career it’s not even identifiably the same. Technology in every way has really changed that. In the seed space, in the implement space, in data and tools that we have available. Recognizing how that change in evolution of agricultural practices is huge. Certainly, bringing three different legacy organizations into one Corteva — we were fortunate in that the cultures of the three different organizations were similar enough, and they were focused on agriculture and focused on farmers that the transition was good. But how do you bring all those years of history and legacy together and get to a common point? The opportunity for me to be directly involved in the integration efforts and standing up the new Corteva and shape what the structure of the organization needed to look like and who did we want to be, that was a privilege to get to be a part of that. It certainly shaped my thinking around change and change management.

As Corteva continues to innovate, will there be opportunity to add employees or grow the footprint of the Johnston campus?

In terms of the work that we’re doing in the seed space, this is where we will be. We’re fully 100% committed to Johnston in terms of the ebbs and flows of the number of people in the needs of people. Obviously this is home base for our seed business. One of the other pieces is obviously how do we continue to access the very best talent in the world. We have people here that come from many, many different places around the world and have made Iowa home.",,N,2025-03-07 07:15:50.816270

Weight: Despite its strength, the weight of aviation glass is nearly identical to polycarbonate, making it a lightweight solution without compromise.
Sustainability in aviation: A comprehensive approach The aviation industry’s approach to reducing emissions must be comprehensive.
Its lightweight, durable, and sustainable materials contribute to reduced emissions while enhancing passenger experience and operational efficiency.","The aviation industry faces an urgent challenge to reduce its environmental impact. While CO2 emissions have been in the spotlight for years, non-CO2 effects—such as contrails—are gaining attention for their significant role in global warming. Research, including NASA’s CODEX program, reveals that contrails can have a climate impact comparable to the accumulated CO2 emissions of aviation over the past century.

However, sustainability isn’t just about engines and flight paths—it’s also about smarter design and materials. And this is where AviationGlass wants to proves its value.

Addressing the misconceptions about glass in aviation

Many in the industry assume glass is too fragile or heavy for aircraft applications. Yet, innovations in ultra-thin, layered aviation glass have transformed these perceptions:

Strength: By using advanced layering techniques, aviation glass achieves exceptional hardness and scratch resistance, rivaling polycarbonate in durability.

Weight: Despite its strength, the weight of aviation glass is nearly identical to polycarbonate, making it a lightweight solution without compromise.

Why does glass stand out?

Lightweight construction: Reducing aircraft weight directly lowers fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. AviationGlass products are carefully engineered to maintain strength while being lightweight.

Durability & Longevity: Scratch-resistant, impact-resistant glass ensures fewer replacements, less waste, and long-term performance reliability.

Eco-Friendly Materials: AviationGlass aligns with the industry’s push for sustainability, offering materials with lower environmental impact and reduced maintenance needs through advanced coatings.

Sustainability in aviation: A comprehensive approach

The aviation industry’s approach to reducing emissions must be comprehensive. This includes contrail mitigation strategies, such as rerouting flights to avoid contrail-prone regions, combined with innovations like cleaner-burning engines, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and eco-friendly materials. AviationGlass can play a pivotal role in this transformation.

From inboard lenses, glass dividers, mirrors, in-flight screen covers, and ceiling panels to cabin interiors, AviationGlass supports airlines and OEMs with high-performance solutions designed for a greener future. Its lightweight, durable, and sustainable materials contribute to reduced emissions while enhancing passenger experience and operational efficiency.

Driving industry innovation

Recent advancements, such as JetZero’s blended-wing body aircraft and Delta’s focus on sustainable technologies, demonstrate the industry’s commitment to innovation. Reducing emissions, both CO2 and non-CO2 is more than just a technological challenge. It’s an opportunity to rethink the materials, processes, and designs that define modern aviation.",https://aviationglass.aero/wp-json/yootheme/image?src=%7B%22file%22%3A%22wp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F02%2FKopie-van-Posts-AGT-935-x-622-px.jpg%22%2C%22thumbnail%22%3A%22610%2C%2C%22%7D&hash=52765195,N,2025-03-07 11:01:49.672816

Innovations in these materials provide a significant opportunity to reduce the carbon footprint of our car, supporting our goal to achieve Net Zero across all scopes by 2040.

Carbon fibre composites are primarily formed of two key components: the fibres and the resin system. By weight, approximately 60% of the composite material is formed of fibres, with 40% made up by the resin system. Impregnating the fibres with the resin system, followed by curing, creates a lightweight material with outstanding mechanical performance necessary to meet the unforgiving demands of Formula 1.

Working closely with the FIA within the scope of the relevant regulations, we aim to demonstrate that sustainable carbon fibre composites can perform to the same technically demanding requirements as traditional materials.

To qualify a carbon fibre composite material for use on the race car, it must undergo rigorous laboratory testing to provide understanding of its technical properties and performance. Transferring from the lab to the racetrack requires further trials and verification to ensure the material behaviour aligns with expectations.

The identification and subsequent qualification of sustainable materials solutions would not be possible without the continuous innovation and ongoing support of our supply chain; each carbon fibre composite component involves four to eight suppliers to deliver the final product.

To achieve a sustainable carbon fibre composite, both components – the fibres and the resin system – must be addressed. Working collaboratively with our supply chain, the team has two separate projects underway for introduction later this year, one of which will address the resin system and one the carbon fibres themselves.

Formula 1 is the world’s fastest test lab and these innovations represent the latest step in our transition towards a more sustainable sport. As a team, we are committed to pursuing sustainable high performance. We were the first global sports team to invest in and help scale the market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel and in 2024, we successfully powered our European season using HVO100 biofuel.

Our work on these pioneering sustainable materials projects in Formula 1 provides a significant opportunity to scale this innovation beyond motorsport. Innovation drives performance, and these developments can shape industry futures from aviation and aerospace to technical performance fabrics.

Toto Wolff, Team Principal and CEO, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team: “When you combine performance and innovation, you create progress. I am proud to lead a team of problem solvers who are committed to driving sustainable change. I would like to thank our partners for supporting our drive for material innovation, and to the FIA for enabling us to test these materials. Collectively we are moving the dial on sustainable products and demonstrating that Formula 1 continues to be the fastest laboratory in the world.”

Alice Ashpitel, Head of Sustainability, Mercedes-AMG PETRONAS F1 Team: “We are proud to be at the forefront of sustainable innovation within our sport. Leadership must be driven by innovation and our team’s efforts in this space are the latest demonstration of our ambition to become one of the world’s most sustainable global sports teams. We look forward to exploring the application of sustainable materials this season.”",,N,2025-03-07 07:15:57.298497

Through this partnership, Cluj International Airport and OMV Petrom reaffirm their commitment to supporting the energy transition and adopting of sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

Starting January 2025, aircrafts taking off from Cluj airport, the second largest airport in Romania, are being fuelled with aviation fuel mixed with 2% SAF, thus reducing the environmental impact. Nearly 1,800 flights were operated in January and February using this fuel, covering all departures from the airport.

“We are proud to contribute to the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel at Cluj International Airport. SAF is produced from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, transformed into fuels with properties similar to conventional kerosene using innovative technologies. At OMV Petrom, we have started construction works on a EUR 750 million investment so that, starting 2028, we can produce such fuels in Romania, at the Petrobrazi refinery. We believe in Romania’s potential to become a regional hub for such fuels,” said Radu Căprău, member of the OMV Petrom Executive Board responsible for Refining and Marketing.

„Together with our supplier OMV Petrom, we have managed to initiate the process by which the aircrafts operating flights at Cluj International Airport will be fueled with sustainable aviation fuels. This is another important goal we have achieved to fulfill our commitments to reduce carbon emissions and support less polluting air transport,” said David Ciceo, General Manager of Cluj International Airport.

With nearly 3.3 million passengers in 2024, Avram Iancu Airport in Cluj is the largest regional airport in Romania and the second largest airport in the country, after Otopeni. As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint, in addition to supplying sustainable aviation fuel, the airport has also acquired two electric aircraft de-icing/anti-icing vehicles and an electric bus to ensure passengers’ transport from the terminal to the planes.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are fuels produced by processing renewable raw materials, such as used oils and animal fats. Using advanced refining processes and green hydrogen, these materials are transformed to have characteristics similar to conventional kerosene. SAF can be dropped straight into existing infrastructure and aircraft. It has the potential to provide a lifecycle carbon reduction of up to 80% compared to the traditional jet fuel it replaces. SAF will play a really important role in meeting the aviation industry’s carbon reduction targets.

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates the use of sustainable aviation fuels on European Union airports in a minimum proportion of 2% starting January 1, 2025, with a gradual increase in the use of SAF up to 6% by 2030.",,N,2025-03-07 07:16:05.312238

International Airport Review’s Editorial Assistant, Gabriel Higgins, examines how the production and uptake of sustainable aviation fuel will progress under the new President who has traditionally taken a sceptical stance on climate change issues.

The return of Donald Trump to the U.S. presidency has created uncertainty for the sustainable development of aviation and airports in America. The aviation industry’s ambitious target to achieve net zero by 2050, crucially relies on the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

In 2022, then President Joe Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act. It included a tax credit for SAF production, of $1.25 for each gallon from a qualified mixture[1]. Almost $300 million in investment towards SAF and technologies, and the establishment of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge which aimed to scale up SAF production to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 50%; produce three billion gallons of SAF by 2030; and support 100% of domestic aviation fuel demand by 2050.

Under the Biden Administration (2021-2025) SAF took off. SAF production grew from 2021 of five million gallons to 93 million gallons in the first three-quarters of 2024. More than 750,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent to domestic GHG emission reductions occurred in 2024, compared to 50,000 in 2021.[2]

It is projected that SAF would continue to grow and become imperative in lowering aviation emissions in America, however, under Trump sweeping changes are already affecting production. On the first day of Trump’s second term, he froze Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, and signed the executive order Unleashing American Dominance, a less inclusive order for sustainable initiatives.

As of February 2025, CVR Energy Inc. announced that it has halted SAF production as it waits on government clarification on whether tax credits will continue. Though, on the other hand, the new administration approved a SAF refinery loan in Montana[3].

It seems SAF is entering a turbulent future, with many questions arising from the uncertainty that currently clouds it around achieving net zero.

Will the Trump administration stall SAF, or could it propel it to new heights?

What is SAF and why is it important?

Concisely, SAF is a fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including, but not limited to; the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.[4]

The freeze on regulatory development is seen as a significant setback for the SAF industry.”

The benefits of SAF reveal how fundamental its production is for achieving net zero. The aviation industry accounts for 2.5% of global Co2 emissions, but it has contributed around 4% to global warming to date[5]. With SAF, however, it has the potential to lower flight emissions by 80%, compared to conventional jet fuel. It is also a drop-in fuel, meaning there is no need for modifying aircraft or constructing new fuelling stations. SAF produces fewer harmful pollutants and contains lower levels of sulphur and aromatic components, allowing aircraft engines to burn more cleanly and generate less pollution compared to conventional fuels.

Critical role of the 45Z Tax Credit

Fayaz Hussain, Editor of SAF Investor, stresses the importance of Biden’s 45Z tax credit, stating: “45Z is critical to development of SAF and includes incentives that have the potential to make or break projects as SAF is currently significantly more expensive compared to kerosene. Without the 45Z incentives, developers will have difficulty in selling SAF at high prices.” With the tax credit in limbo under the new administration, developers are hesitant to move forward with projects, as seen with CVR Energy.

The freeze on regulatory development is seen as a significant setback for the SAF industry. With SAF producers needing both federal and state-level incentives to bridge the price gap between SAF and traditional jet fuel, the future of the industry now hinges on how these incentives are shaped moving forward.

State-level incentives

Despite the federal uncertainty, state-level incentives have played a key role in keeping the SAF industry afloat. Washington, Illinois, and Minnesota, among other states, have implemented policies designed to encourage SAF production. Hussain highlights the importance of both state and federal incentives in creating an “incentive stack” that is necessary to scale up SAF production. He explains: “Federal and state-level incentives are key to achieving the desired incentive stack to scale SAF. At the moment, SAF producers need both incentives to have the desired stack to plug the massive gaps between kerosene and SAF prices.”

As countries like the UK and EU implement clear mandates and aggressive policies for SAF, the U.S. risks falling behind unless it solidifies its commitment to SAF production and development.”

These state-level policies are crucial in sustaining the momentum in SAF production, especially in the face of federal regulatory freezes and uncertainty. However, the real challenge lies in ensuring that the incentives at both the federal and state levels are aligned to achieve the scale needed to meet the aviation sector’s future fuel demands.

Can the U.S. still achieve its target of three billion gallons by 2030?

The Biden Administration set an ambitious goal of producing three billion gallons of SAF by 2030, a target that now faces the possibility of being derailed. Despite the recent setbacks, there is still hope that the target can be met, as the U.S. has already announced a SAF production pipeline expected to yield between 2.6 billion and 4.9 billion gallons by 2030. However, as Hussain points out, the uncertainty surrounding incentives could alter this forecast. “Any uncertainty around the incentives has the potential to change this forecast,” he says. The recent pause by CVR Energy is just one example of how political instability can disrupt the growth of the industry.

It’s clear that without a supportive policy, the U.S. may face challenges in meeting its production targets for SAF. The polarised politics only exacerbates the uncertainty, leaving industry stakeholders with more questions than answers about the long-term outlook for SAF.

Could Trump propel SAF with corn-based Ethanol?

One area that Trump could benefit SAF is the potential for corn-based Ethanol to become a dominant feedstock. Given Trump’s focus on rural economic priorities (states/areas that typically vote Republican), there is speculation that corn-based ethanol could play a more significant role in SAF production. However, this pathway faces significant challenges. According to Hussain, “SAF produced from corn-to-Ethanol (alcohol-to-jet) pathway is significantly more expensive than that produced via HEFA [Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids] pathway. Although it is a viable pathway, the carbon intensity of corn-based Ethanol in the U.S. will have to come down before it can scale to the level needed to deliver volumes.”

Could the U.S fall behind the rest of the world?

The global SAF landscape is divided into two main approaches: the “stick” approach, used by the UK and the EU, which mandates SAF production with civil penalties in place for those who don’t comply, and the “carrot” approach employed by the U.S., which focuses on incentives to stimulate growth. Hussain is concerned that the U.S. could lose its competitive edge if it fails to stabilise its policies. “The current U.S. Administration has yet to issue its stance on goals for the SAF industry during its term. This will ultimately determine whether the U.S. will emerge as a leader in SAF production or lose ground to other countries.”

As countries like the UK and EU implement clear mandates and aggressive policies for SAF, the U.S. risks falling behind unless it solidifies its commitment to SAF production and development.

Conclusion

The future of SAF production in the U.S. hangs in the balance, caught between political uncertainty, regulatory freezes, and the critical need for incentives. The 45Z tax credit remains a cornerstone, and without it, SAF projects will stall. At the same time, state-level incentives provide some relief, but the need for a co-ordinated federal policy remains critical. As the Trump administration’s freeze on key regulations and incentives continues, and regressive policies for sustainability are implemented, it seems likely that SAF production will experience major setbacks, making it increasingly difficult for the aviation industry to meet its ambitious goals. Without stable and supportive federal policies, the U.S. may fall short of its target of three billion gallons by 2030, stalling progress towards net zero emissions in aviation. The uncertainty surrounding the future of SAF production under the Trump administration could ultimately delay or even derail efforts to significantly reduce aviation emissions, putting the aviation industry’s 2050 net-zero goal at risk.

Boeing investment will support development of one of Europe’s first industrial-scale Power-to-Liquids facility

Boeing [NYSE: BA] has become a key project development partner of Norsk e-Fuel, supporting one of Europe’s first industrial scale Power-to-Liquids (PtL) facilities. Boeing’s investment will accelerate the production and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the Nordics and globally. It is also intended to support the commercial aviation industry’s and ICAO member states’ common goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Norsk e-Fuel will produce jet fuel known as electro-SAF, or e-SAF. This involves the PtL process: using fossil-free power to generate green hydrogen and combining it with recycled CO₂ from biogenic sources. This fuel can reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of air travel by over 90% compared to conventional jet fuel.

“Our support of and collaboration with Norsk e-Fuel underscores the importance of using fossil-free energy to accelerate SAF production, which is key to reducing aviation’s carbon emissions towards 2050,” said Steve Gillard, Boeing’s regional sustainability director for Europe, Middle East, Türkiye, Africa and Central Asia. “Our partnership to advance e-fuels will help mobilize the commercialization of SAF in the Nordics and across the world, increasing accessibility and availability for our customers as we help build a robust SAF ecosystem.”

It is estimated that SAF accounted for only 0.53% of the global commercial fuel use in 2024. In Europe, the RefuelEU SAF initiative’s proposed mandate aims to gradually increase the share of SAF, reaching a target of 6% by 2030, and 70% by 2050. There are also sub-mandates for e-SAF, such as that produced by Norsk e-Fuel, with targets of 1.2% in 2030 increasing to 35% in 2050.

Boeing’s investment will contribute to achieving the SAF volumes needed by the EU commitments and strengthen national energy security across the Nordics. The partnership will also inform policies that enable the economic viability of the global SAF industry, while supporting long-term competitiveness of the aviation industry in the region.

“Our goal is to make e-fuels competitive with and eventually replace fossil fuels in critical infrastructures as SAF needs to become readily accessible and affordable for advancing aviation’s decarbonization,” said Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO of Norsk e-Fuel. “Boeing’s investment will further accelerate our project pipeline and will facilitate the broader aviation industry’s transition to net-zero emissions.”

The strategic partnership combines Boeing’s SAF industry leadership and fuels expertise with Norsk e-Fuel’s technology know-how and strong network of partners, including Norway’s largest air carrier, Norwegian.

“We are pleased to welcome Boeing on board. Their investment marks a significant milestone for Norsk e-Fuel and confirms the positive development we have had. We look forward to leveraging Boeing’s expertise and experience in the development and growth of this pioneering industry. This investment also reinforces the need for a supportive policy environment to fully realise the potential of e-fuels production in Norway, in line with the Norwegian parliament’s call,” said Geir Karlsen, CEO of Norwegian.
