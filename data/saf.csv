The improvements address concerns raised by unsheltered individuals during listening sessions held by the City’s Community Development Department and Continuum of Care (CoC) providers.
“Safety and security have consistently been the top two concerns that we identified by those living in the camp,’’ Erwin said.
Community Development notified former occupants of the steps required to register for participation, which include the new community standards that must be signed by each individual.
Fences provide security, and the tents are anchored to the concrete platform below.","Attempting to get a firm direction relating to the growing homeless community, the City of Huntsville is taking a progressive approach to reopening the campsite on Derrick Street near downtown.

Scott Erwin, director of the city’s community development arm, led reporters on a tour of the soon-to-be-open, restructured site that was shut down by a damaging fire in 2024. The South Derrick Street Camp has undergone improvements to improve safety and security for the camp’s occupants.

The improvements address concerns raised by unsheltered individuals during listening sessions held by the City’s Community Development Department and Continuum of Care (CoC) providers.

“If you’ll remember back to last fall and the fire, the conditions of the camp as a result of the fire were extremely hazardous and unsanitary,’’ Erwin said. “So the city stepped in to figure out exactly what we can do.

“Over the past few months, the city has worked diligently to complete improvements to the safety and security for the camp’s occupants. And I wanna sincerely thank the Public Works Department for the City of Huntsville, Landscape Management, Parks and Recreation and HPD. It took a lot of different hands in my departments within the city to bring us to where we are today.’’

The new site has a privacy fence for increased security and a 12×12 outlined grid system that will represent 84 individual spaces to provide structured living areas. Each space is equipped with a 10×10 tent, which will be anchored to a platform to keep tenants’ belongings off the ground and provide the anchor for the tents. A new entryway was created for emergency vehicle access.

“Safety and security have consistently been the top two concerns that we identified by those living in the camp,’’ Erwin said.

Possible tenants must register in order to obtain housing in the camp. Community Development notified former occupants of the steps required to register for participation, which include the new community standards that must be signed by each individual. The new standards will help maintain order and ensure the camp remains a safe, secure, and sanitary and respectful place for everyone to temporarily live here.’’

Representatives from organizations that aid in getting unhoused citizens permanent living quarters joined Erwin at the press event. Among those speaking were representatives from First Stop, CoC, Family Services Center and Catholic Charities.

“Outreach is a core tenet of First Stop and our mission to support our unhoused neighbors, and with the support of the city and the progressive steps they have made to mitigate the environmental safety and health issues that existed at the camp we hope that our case managers will be able to be more involved and help our friends in need get out of homelessness and approach sustainable long-term housing with the support of the city.’’

Each tent will house either individuals or those with a significant other. Fences provide security, and the tents are anchored to the concrete platform below. An old tin building next to the camp will be repurposed so residents can access potable water while Shower Up, a mobile unit, will provide bathing and laundry services.

As for sanitation, portable potties are too mobile and a standing restroom facility might invite predatory or unseemly behavior. The city is still weighing options for the camp’s refuse.

“We’ll have an agency close by having a portable bathroom facility on site and we’ll see how that works,’’ Erwin said. “The water access will be very soon.’’

As Erwin stressed, the goal of the camp is to be a temporary solution.

“Our goal for everyone in the camp is this to be a pathway to allow them to get permanently housed,’’ Erwin said. “Today, we have some of our organizations that can lead to that, help them get permanent housing to have a stable way of life.’’",https://huntsvillebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-2025-04-19T111756.045.png,N,,2025-04-21 15:57:31.756141

The Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), in collaboration with Lufthansa Airlines, has reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to ensuring sustainability in the aviation sector.

This firm commitment was made at the Exclusive Discourse Event organized by Lufthansa Airlines at Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island,Lagos

Director of Air Transport Regulations, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) Mrs. Olayinka Babaoye-Iriobe, who was represented by Mrs. Evelyn Tanko, Deputy General Manager, (Commercial Agreement & Aviation Environment) stated that the Authority is empowered by the Civil Aviation Act, 2022 to regulate environmental issues and further to reiterate its commitments to the sustainability of the industry, NCAA has domesticated ICAO Annex 16 on Environmental Protection into the National regulations under Part 16 of Nig. CARS which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the initiatives of the NCAA on the sustainability of the industry. These initiatives include: The development of a State Action Plan on CO2 Emission reduction from international aviation, Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA and also leading on a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

He says his work at Boeing, particularly in autonomy and electric aircraft, made for a very natural transition to Electra.
“Our goal is to bring commercial transport levels of safety to general aviation,” Allen says.","A startup working on hybrid-electric aircraft aims to cut down on both aircraft noise and the space that small planes need to take off and land.

Inc. can exclusively report that Manassas, Virginia-based Electra raised $115 million to bring its hybrid-electric aircraft, the EL9, to pre-production and work towards its FAA certification. The series B round of funding was led by Prysm Capital, and Prysm co-founder and managing partner Jay Park joined Electra’s board. A 9-seat aircraft, the EL9 is expected to carry a max payload of 3,000 pounds and travels a maximum distance of more than 1,200 miles. When loaded up with passengers and luggage, the plane is expected to fly a competitive 380 miles, Electra CEO Marc Allen says.

The prototype that the company is currently testing is about 1,000 times quieter in battery mode than a plane using traditional propulsion and is designed to take off and land in ultra-short spaces, Allen says. Expected to be able to take off and land in a 150-foot ground roll, it offers the potential to bring aviation to previously inaccessible places. “You can be quiet, you can land without a lot of space, which means you can really bring aviation right there to you,” Allen says.

A Boeing veteran of about 17 years and a private pilot, Allen joined Electra about six months ago to ramp up the company and product. He says his work at Boeing, particularly in autonomy and electric aircraft, made for a very natural transition to Electra.

“Once it became clear to me that electric [propulsion] could do things that standard propulsion could not do, it became imperative that we find a way to really bring those to market,” he says. “Those have to start with small airplanes.”

The aircraft is a hybrid. A turbine generator that runs on jet fuel or sustainable aviation fuel produces electricity that charges the aircraft’s batteries or spins motors on the aircraft’s wing. Different modes of flight enable the aircraft to draw power from different sources. And its electric capabilities also help it reduce fuel burn.

The EL9 has potential for both civil and defense applications. On the civil side, the EL9 can replace noisy jets or helicopters that communities surrounding local airports don’t like. It also offers the potential to expand the bases of operation for commercial enterprises that for now may be excluded from certain areas, due to limited take-off and landing space. Furthermore, it offers benefits from cost and emissions perspectives.

Allen says the aircraft has generated significant enthusiasm and has racked up more than 2,200 provisional orders, making for a backlog worth more than $10 billion. One customer in the Caribbean, he says, is excited to apply the technology to fly tourists to islands that currently don’t have runways long enough for passenger service.

On the defense side, the EL9 could serve an important role in tactical last leg logistics, because it could carry cargo and then land in austere conditions or on nontraditional runway surfaces. Plus, Allen says, Electra’s aircraft can also serve as a power source once on the ground.

“This airplane flies in, it lands, it’s your generator. You can charge drones from it. You can charge your communications gear,” he says. “It’s the Amazon Sprinter van for getting fuel and munitions to distributed operating bases across large ranges where you don’t have access, easy access to runways, to drop in big cargo planes.” (A growing number of Amazon’s vans are now electric, thanks to a partnership with Rivian to bring 100,000 electric delivery vehicles to roads by 2030).

A crucial component of Electra’s aircraft is safety, an issue that’s all the more important in light of cutbacks in staffing at the Federal Aviation Administration and a spate of high profile crashes, some fatal, in recent months. Although flying remains statistically the safest form of transportation, recent accidents have understandably shaken commercial travelers. Allen says the EL9 can lose a motor and still take off and fly safely—it can even seamlessly fly having lost two motors in flight, thanks to its eight propeller propulsion system and a flight computer capable of adjusting the power and thrust of the remaining propellers. There are also four batteries for added redundancy.

“Our goal is to bring commercial transport levels of safety to general aviation,” Allen says.

Electra has been flying its smaller, two-seat prototype aircraft for about a year and a half, including a high-profile flight of former NASA Administrator Bill Nelson in December. With its new funding, Electra aims to begin flight testing its EL9 aircraft in 2027, and hopes to achieve FAA type certification in 2028 or late 2029 with a goal of entering commercial service in 2029.

“Aviation was supposed to be direct that takes you from where you are to where you want to go, and that doesn’t rely on long drives onto airports,” Allen says. “We’re bringing something together that’s practical, yet it has that promise of bringing air transport right to you.”","https://img-cdn.inc.com/image/upload/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit,w_1024,h_1024/vip/2025/04/Electra-pano-inc.jpg",N,,2025-04-21 10:56:06.241358

In its quest to bring back supersonic passenger travel, Boom Supersonic of Colorado knows that speed alone isn’t enough to guarantee success. In the decades since Concorde made its final flight in 2003, passengers and the broader air transportation industry have become more conscious of the noise and environmental impacts of soaring through the air faster than the speed of sound.

Boom believes it has solved the first portion of that equation, as demonstrated in the January and February flight tests of its subscale XB-1 demonstrator. During flights over the Mojave Desert in California, the pilot maintained the required speed and altitude for XB-1’s sonic boom to refract and never reach the ground. For its Overture airliners, Boom plans to develop a collection of software algorithms that would continuously pull in weather forecasts and other information to make those calculations. An autopilot setting on the flight deck would automatically speed up or slow down the plane, as well as adjust altitude as needed.

RELATED READING: How Boom conquered the boom

However, an executive of a previous supersonic venture sees another potential application for this Boomless Cruise technology that could help Boom reduce its environmental impact: predicting contrail formation. These clouds of ice crystals form when the warm soot particles and water vapor emitted during combustion meet the cold atmospheric air. They make up roughly one-third of aviation’s emissions, according to the journal Atmospheric Environment, because the clouds can linger in the stratosphere, trapping surface radiation.

“At Aerion, what we were looking to do was provide real-time management of the contrails to reduce that part of our environmental impact,’’ says Gene Holloway, the former head of sustainability at Aerion Supersonic, the Nevada-based company that explored its own boomless cruise concept for its planned AS2 supersonic business jets. Aerion declared bankruptcy in 2021 and never flew an aircraft, but contrail prediction was on the mind of Holloway and his colleagues, he told me in an interview. “It went hand in hand with the way we planned to operate our boomless cruise.”

Aerion was in talks to receive the required “real-time climate profiles” from Virginia satellite operator Spire Global, Holloway says, which provides “ the information you needed in order to manage your sonic boom as well as manage your contrails.’’

Boom said in response to written questions that it does not anticipate contrails being a large concern for Overture operations based on the scientific consensus that contrails do not form as easily at their planned cruising altitude of around 60,000 feet. “However, we do recognize that contrails are responsible for a significant share of aviation’s climate impacts,’’ a spokeswoman said.

It’s true that historically, aircraft cruising in the stratosphere were not thought to form contrails as often, because the thin air at those altitudes is also too dry and warm to be conducive to ice crystal formation. But this may no longer be the case: A 2024 study led by Imperial College London found that flights by private jets — which fly at similar altitudes as Overtures would — were forming contrails more frequently than expected. The researchers also determined that these contrails were lingering for a longer period in the stratosphere, increasing their warming potential. The researchers examined some 64,000 cases in which contrails were emitted by aircraft flying over the North Atlantic, using artificial intelligence software to match satellite images of contrails with air traffic data to determine which aircraft types were emitting the most persistent plumes.

Higher-altitude flight also comes with other environmental concerns: Because the thin stratospheric air is more stagnant, any water vapor emitted during combustion can linger for 10 to 15 times longer than similar amounts emitted at lower altitudes, says David Lee, a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University who has spent 20 years studying aviation’s climate impact.

“Just the fact of the emission of water vapor into a very, very dry background atmosphere will have a warming effect,’’ he says. “That effect is not present for normal civil aviation in any great magnitude.’’

And while Boom plans for the Overtures to spend very little time at lower altitudes — mainly during the ascent and descent phases — that might not be the case for other supersonic designs, Holloway notes.

“Our thought [at Aerion] was we’re not always going to be flying at those high altitudes. There will be short jaunts we will be taking” at lower altitudes where contrails were more likely to form,” he says. “The other piece was we wanted to do everything we can to minimize environmental impacts.’’

There is good reason for caution, given the lack of certainty about the precise range of conditions in which contrails form and how long they linger. Lab tests cannot perfectly recreate the atmospheric conditions of flight, and researchers can’t always differentiate between contrail cirrus clouds and naturally occurring cirrus clouds when viewing satellite imagery. Kshitij Sabnis, a scientist at Queen Mary University of London who researches high-speed aerodynamics, notes that huge strides could be made in closing this knowledge gap if Boom or other entities conducting supersonic flights would track their contrail formation and share that data publicly. It could even help operators of subsonic aircraft address their own emissions.

By determining where contrails are most likely to form and routing aircraft around those areas, “that could have quite a big impact on the environment,’’ Sabnis says. “But at the moment, we just don’t know what those trajectories should be, and we can’t compute them to be able to make that happen in real time.’’

Another possible factor in the amount of contrails that Overtures could produce is the choice of fuel, says Lee, the Manchester scientist. To reduce its carbon footprint, Boom previously pledged that all Overtures will be able to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. SAFs produce just as much carbon dioxide during combustion as conventional jet fuels, but those emissions are offset by their source — for instance, forest waste that drew carbon dioxide from the air before its residue became feedstock for SAF. Studies by NASA and the German Aerospace Center (DLR) indicate that burning SAFs forms fewer contrails than conventional jet fuel, perhaps because most SAFs contain fewer hydrocarbon aromatics. These molecules are among the components of jet fuel that produce the pure carbon soot particles that ice crystals form around.

RELATED READING: Curbing contrails

“So what we do know is that if you burn SAF in an aircraft engine, you get reduced soot numbers behind the aircraft,” Lee says, but he notes that “you do not get zero soot.’’

He adds that SAFs could also increase the amount of water vapor that Overtures emit.

For Aerion’s Holloway, the choice is clear. Even if contrails end up not being a major concern for supersonic aircraft, he says that Boom and other companies pursuing these designs should do everything they can to reduce their climate impact, particularly given the increased amounts of fuel that these aircraft will require.

“There’s no way around it, [supersonic] is a gas hog,’’ he says. “It’s going to put a lot of pollutants in the atmosphere.’’",https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NASA-2013-contrail-flight.webp,N,,2025-04-21 14:01:36.228791

This is the company's first SAF plant but its second biodiesel plant, Revo said. The firm already has a biodiesel plant in Kyoto, western Japan.

Revo held an opening ceremony at the Aichi plant on 18 April. The plant has a production capacity of 30,000 litres/d for biodiesel, and can process 600 l/d of used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstock to make SAF.

The plant can produce SAF at low pressure and temperature, Revo's president Tetsuya Koshikawa said at the ceremony. This helps to save energy consumption during SAF production, which results in a lower production cost, the firm explains.

Revo hopes to supply the produced SAF to planes at Chubu International Airport, near the Aichi plant. The company has applied for international certifications on SAF including the UN's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards, and expects to be certified in the 2025 fiscal year starting from April.

Revo also joined Japan's first large-scale domestic SAF production venture Saffaire Sky Energy, jointly funded by Japanese refiner Cosmo Oil, engineering firm JGC and Revo. Saffaire has a SAF plant at Cosmo's Sakai refinery, Osaka, and started delivering its SAF in this April. In the venture, Revo takes charge of collecting UCO as feedstock for SAF.

The companies have announced the plans to start delivering Saffaire's SAF to domestic airlines Japan Airlines (JAL) and All Nippon Airways (ANA), the US' Delta Air Lines, Finnish airline Finnair and German logistics group DHL Express in the 2025 fiscal year.

En cause: tant les investisseurs que les consommateurs.

Bertrand Piccard a à peine entamé son discours d'ouverture qu'un rire éclate dans l'assistance. Le pionnier suisse de l'aviation et fervent défenseur du climat vient de citer Thomas Watson. En 1943, ce dernier, alors à la tête d'IBM, avait prédit qu'il n'y aurait de marché que pour cinq ordinateurs, tout au plus, dans le monde. ""Et aujourd'hui, nous en avons tous un dans notre poche"", s'amuse Piccard.

Sa silhouette élancée se dessine parfaitement dans le contre-jour de la grande baie vitrée qui laisse entrevoir un majestueux avion. Invité par Airbus, il s'exprime lors d'un congrès à Toulouse, au siège du constructeur aéronautique. Le sujet du jour: comment arriver à une aviation sans émissions d'ici 2050?

2,5%

part de l'aérien dans les émissions mondiales

Le secteur de l'aviation émet 900 millions de tonnes de CO₂ par an, soit environ 2,5% des émissions mondiales

Tout le monde a bien conscience que l'aviation ne deviendra réellement plus durable que si les carburants le deviennent également, comme pour d'autres modes de transport. De nombreuses alternatives au kérosène, dérivé du pétrole brut, sont en cours de développement, mais le chemin est semé d'embûches. ""Pour les trajets courts, entre 500 et 1.000 kilomètres, les batteries sont une option"", explique Robert Malina, économiste de l'environnement à l'UHasselt, spécialiste des carburants d'aviation durables. ""Mais pour des distances plus longues, les batteries deviennent trop lourdes.""

Et puis, ces vols courts ne pèsent pas lourd dans la balance. Ce sont surtout les vols long-courriers qui contribuent aux émissions de l'aviation, estimées à environ 900 millions de tonnes de CO₂ par an, soit environ 2,5% des émissions mondiales. ""La solution la plus avancée reste le carburant d'aviation durable, ou SAF (sustainable aviation fuel)"", précise Malina.

""L'un des grands atouts du SAF, c'est qu'il s'adapte parfaitement aux moteurs d'avion actuels. Cependant, sa rareté en fait un carburant coûteux.""

Robert Malina

Économiste de l'environnement à l'UHasselt

""Le SAF est un terme générique pour des carburants issus de la biomasse, comme les déchets alimentaires, les résidus de bois ou l'huile de friture usagée"", détaille Malina. ""L'avantage du SAF, c'est qu'il fonctionne avec les moteurs d'avion actuels. Des avions volent déjà avec des mélanges de SAF et de kérosène. Le hic, c'est que ce carburant est rare, et donc coûteux. Si le monde a volé jusqu'à présent avec du pétrole brut, c'est parce que c'était l'option la moins chère.""

En quête de masse critique pour faire baisser les prix

À Toulouse, Piccard poursuit son cours accéléré de macroéconomie. ""Pensez au premier ordinateur, au premier smartphone, au premier panneau solaire. Ils étaient impayables"", rappelle-t-il. ""Aujourd'hui, l'énergie solaire est la source d'énergie la moins chère. Pour en arriver là, il a fallu atteindre une masse critique. L'offre et la demande doivent augmenter pour que les prix baissent. C'est ce qui arrivera avec le SAF, et aussi avec l'hydrogène.""

Précurseur dans le domaine de l'hydrogène, Piccard voit en cette technologie, aux côtés du SAF, un potentiel immense pour l'aviation. Avec son projet Climate Impulse, il ambitionne de faire le tour du monde sans escale sur 43.000 kilomètres, sans une goutte de carburant fossile. Pour ce faire, un avion spécial à hydrogène est en développement, notamment par Airbus, avec la participation de l'entreprise belge Syensqo. Le fuselage et les ailes sont prêts. Le premier vol d'essai est prévu pour le mois prochain.

C'est un projet pionnier, car l'aviation à hydrogène est quasi inexistante aujourd'hui. Les compagnies aériennes sont en pleine phase de développement technologique et de projets pilotes. Le choix d'Airbus d'organiser cette conférence et de faire appel à Piccard est d'autant plus surprenant que le constructeur a annoncé, il y a deux mois à peine, qu'il mettait en suspens ses plans pour un avion commercial à hydrogène.

""L'aviation ne passera à l'hydrogène qu’après d'autres industries.""

Guillaume Faury

CEO d'Airbus

""Un report n'est pas une annulation"", rétorque Guillaume Faury, CEO d'Airbus, en prenant place sur scène après le discours de Piccard. ""Techniquement, nous avons terminé la première phase et conclu qu'un avion commercial à hydrogène est possible. Mais il n'est pas encore compétitif. L'aviation ne passera à l'hydrogène qu’après d'autres industries.""

Faury ne précise pas quand l'avion à hydrogène reviendra sur le devant de la scène. Aussi, les perspectives de l'hydrogène comme alternative au kérosène à court terme s'amenuisent. ""Il a le même problème que le SAF: pour être durable, l'hydrogène doit être vert, issu d'une source renouvelable, ce qui n'est ni bon marché ni largement disponible. Et technologiquement, il est encore moins avancé"", souligne le professeur Malina. ""Le premier avion commercial capable de voler sur une longue distance à l'hydrogène reste à construire.""

Dialogue avec les géants pétroliers

Dès lors, les compagnies aériennes misent d’abord sur le SAF. Julie Kitcher, directrice du développement durable chez Airbus, souligne que le défi est de taille. ""La technologie est prometteuse, mais il manque un modèle économique viable. Le SAF coûte actuellement trois à cinq fois plus cher que le kérosène. Pour combler cet écart, il est impératif d'augmenter considérablement la production. Des mesures incitatives sont nécessaires pour rassurer les fournisseurs et encourager ce type d'investissements pionniers.""

Les entreprises se tournent vers les décideurs politiques pour obtenir du soutien. Depuis le début de l'année, la Commission européenne impose une obligation de mélange: les compagnies aériennes se ravitaillant en Europe doivent intégrer au moins 2% de carburant durable. Ce pourcentage passera à 6% en 2030, pour atteindre 70% d'ici 2050. À ce stade, les carburants synthétiques ou e-fuels, issus d'hydrogène et de CO₂ capturé, joueront également un rôle crucial.

Ce cadre réglementaire semble porter ses fruits, avec l'émergence de nouveaux sites de production de SAF. Le groupe énergétique autrichien OMV, propriétaire de Borealis, envisage de construire une raffinerie dans le port d'Anvers, capable de transformer 300.000 tonnes de déchets organiques en carburant d'aviation durable chaque année. Dans le port de Gand, Terra Mater a signé un accord pour importer du bioéthanol du Brésil afin de le convertir en carburant d'aviation durable.

""Pour construire une usine de SAF complète, nécessitant entre 250 et 300 millions d'euros, nous sommes en discussions avec des géants pétroliers tels que BP, Shell et ExxonMobil.""

Kapil Shyam Lokare

CEO de Terra Mater

Pour Terra Mater, l'objectif est identique: augmenter le volume. ""Nous travaillons activement à augmenter la voilure de notre technologie"", explique Kapil Shyam Lokare, fondateur et CEO. ""Nous recherchons des partenaires à l'échelle mondiale. À Gand, notre projet pilote produit quelques milliers de litres par semaine. Nous cherchons maintenant des investisseurs pour construire une usine complète, nécessitant entre 250 et 300 millions d'euros. Nous sommes en discussions avec des géants pétroliers tels que BP, Shell et ExxonMobil.""

En parallèle, Lokare a conclu des accords avec des entreprises chimiques pour utiliser leurs installations sous-exploitées, dans le but d’accélérer la montée en puissance de sa production. ""C'est un raccourci bien pensé. Si nous voulons réduire le coût du SAF, nous ne pouvons pas perdre de temps à chercher des terrains, des financements ou des permis. C'est pourquoi nous suivons deux voies. Avec le soutien adéquat, notre prix pourrait devenir compétitif d'ici trois à cinq ans.""

Lokare admet que le modèle économique reste complexe. ""Le soutien de la Commission européenne est indispensable. La production de SAF en Europe doit être subventionnée pour permettre cette montée en puissance"", affirme-t-il. Airbus partage cet avis: les gouvernements devront intervenir. ""Partout dans le monde, nous avons vu émerger de nouvelles sources d'énergie"", déclare Julie Kitcher, responsable de la durabilité. ""L'Europe a l'opportunité de créer une nouvelle industrie dans les carburants renouvelables, attirant innovation et emplois.""

Pour Robert Malina, la responsabilité doit être partagée entre gouvernements et entreprises. ""Pour d'autres technologies, les gouvernements ont joué un rôle clé au démarrage, comme pour les panneaux solaires. Mais ce soutien doit être progressivement réduit. Le surcoût qui en résulte devra être répercuté, rendant les billets plus chers. Mais ce n'est pas ce que souhaitent les compagnies aériennes, car cela freine leur croissance.""

Trump et la Défense ont coupé les ailes à l'élan vert

La croissance du secteur aérien est l’éléphant dans la pièce. La demande pour le transport de passagers et le fret aérien ne cesse d'augmenter, avec une progression annuelle d'environ 10%. La conférence Airbus a bien mis en lumière l’aspect économique, devenu prioritaire. Le CEO Faury a remarqué que personne n'avait posé de questions sur la durabilité, mais uniquement sur Trump et la défense. Cela en dit long sur les priorités actuelles. La transition écologique est sous pression, tant chez les consommateurs que chez les investisseurs.

""Les tarifs douaniers de Trump rendent d’autant plus nécessaire le renforcement de notre indépendance énergétique, y compris dans l'aviation.""

Kapil Shyam Lokare

L'année dernière, des géants comme BP et Shell ont mis un frein à des projets d'investissement majeurs dans les carburants d'aviation durables (SAF), ébranlant la confiance en leur potentiel de croissance. Les données de l'UHasselt confirment cette tendance. En comparant les annonces de production de SAF avec la capacité réellement atteinte, on constate un écart grandissant. En 2023, 3,52 millions de tonnes de SAF prévues n'étaient pas disponibles. En 2024, cet écart a grimpé à 6,2 millions de tonnes.

Dans un contexte géopolitique instable, Faury souligne l'importance d'une aviation européenne robuste. Lokare partage cet avis, voyant dans la production de carburants durables une opportunité pour la réindustrialisation en Europe. ""Les tarifs douaniers de Trump rendent d’autant plus nécessaire le renforcement de notre indépendance énergétique, y compris dans l'aviation"", affirme-t-il.

Créer une industrie SAF européenne semble idéal, mais pourrait relever du vœu pieux. L'exemple de l'industrie des batteries en Europe est interpellant: l'ambition était de stimuler une réindustrialisation verte et de devenir au passage autosuffisant en énergie. L'échec de Northvolt, entreprise suédoise qui a fait faillite en mars malgré des milliards d’euros de subventions, sert d'avertissement. L'entreprise, symbole d'une renaissance industrielle verte, a succombé sous le poids de ses ambitions. Innover et produire à grande échelle s'est avéré trop ambitieux pour les idéalistes suédois.

L'aviation doit être prudente face à ces risques. Dans notre quête européenne de durabilité, nous risquons de perdre nos acteurs du secteur en poursuivant aveuglément des normes, alors que le reste du monde continue de voler davantage.

Pour des innovateurs comme Piccard, l'Europe doit cependant rester à la pointe. ""Bannir l'aviation n'est pas une option. Nous devons inciter les entreprises à se verdir, et le reste suivra"", conclut-il lors de son discours à Toulouse, fidèle à son idéalisme.

(NASDAQ: AMTX), a diversified global renewable natural gas and biofuels company, announced the Company’s subsidiary in India, Universal Biofuels, received multiple orders for an aggregate of $31 million for the delivery during May, June and July of more than 33,000 kiloliters of biodiesel to the three government-owned Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs).

Additional OMC orders are expected throughout the year in order to continue shipments to fuel blending terminals on an ongoing basis to support the India government goal of increasing from a 1% to 5% biodiesel blend.

”Universal Biofuels and other biodiesel producers look forward to continuous support from the government of India to ensure that climate issues are addressed, while ensuring a healthy biodiesel industry,” stated Sanjeev Duggal, CEO of Universal Biofuels.

“We are pleased with the progress being made in India in support of the 5% biodiesel blending target of more than 1.2 billion gallons per year,” stated Eric McAfee, Chairman and CEO of Aemetis. “The OMCs did not take deliveries during this past winter and instead decided to issue new orders for biodiesel with deliveries from May to July. Our Universal Biofuels subsidiary has successfully completed deliveries under contracts with the OMCs for the past several years, highlighting our track record for producing and timely delivering high quality renewable fuels at our India plant.”

Recently, India achieved a 20% ethanol blend into gasoline and the government stated a new 30% blend target for ethanol, enabling further growth in ethanol production and expanding revenues for farmers while reducing the importation of petroleum gasoline into India.

Universal Biofuels significantly expanded the production capacity of the Kakinada biodiesel plant to 80 million gallons per year during a recent plant upgrade and maintenance cycle, including expansion of its proprietary process that produces biodiesel from waste and byproducts that Universal utilizes to produce biofuels that are lower carbon intensity at a significantly reduced cost.

Aemetis’ Universal Biofuels subsidiary is one of the largest biodiesel producers in India, having been in operation for more than 17 years. Universal Biofuels increased annual biodiesel capacity from 50 million gallons to 80 million gallons last year, with further biodiesel expansion to other locations and diversification into biogas production planned for 2025. To support further growth, Universal Biofuels is preparing for an IPO in India which is expected to be completed in late 2025, subject to continued favorable stock market conditions.

Universal Biofuels completed $112 million of biodiesel and glycerine shipments in the twelve months ended September 2024, including deliveries to the three government-owned oil marketing companies under a cost-plus contract. Shipments of biodiesel to OMC’s are expected to begin in early May under the next round of biodiesel contracts.

Bila dikelola dengan baik, limbah ini dapat diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), bahan bakar ramah lingkungan untuk industri penerbangan.

Hal ini mengemuka dalam Focus Group Discussion (FGD) bertema Sustainable Used Cooking Oil Supply Chain for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang digelar BRIN pada Rabu (16/4). Kegiatan ini menghadirkan para peneliti dari dalam dan luar BRIN, baik secara daring maupun luring.

Arif Rahman, peneliti postdoktoral BRIN, menekankan pentingnya produksi SAF yang berkelanjutan untuk menekan emisi gas rumah kaca. SAF juga berperan dalam mengurangi ketergantungan terhadap bahan bakar fosil dan memperkuat ekonomi sirkular.

Menurutnya, industri penerbangan global telah menetapkan target emisi nol bersih pada 2050, yang menuntut transisi dari bahan bakar fosil ke alternatif ramah lingkungan. SAF yang berasal dari minyak jelantah menjadi salah satu solusi menjanjikan dalam pencapaian target tersebut.

Hasil analisis Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) menunjukkan bahwa pemanfaatan minyak jelantah sebagai bahan baku SAF dapat menjadi dasar ilmiah bagi kebijakan dan investasi masa depan. Teknologi ini tidak hanya mendukung pembangunan berkelanjutan, tetapi juga memperkuat daya saing energi hijau nasional.

Melansir pada laman BRIN Indonesia sebagai negara dengan populasi besar dan budaya konsumsi gorengan yang kuat, menghasilkan volume tinggi minyak jelantah dari rumah tangga dan sektor makanan. Hal ini menjadikan Indonesia memiliki potensi besar untuk mengembangkan SAF berbasis limbah domestik.

Namun, untuk memaksimalkan potensi ini, dibutuhkan ekosistem yang terintegrasi dari hulu hingga hilir, termasuk pengumpulan, pengolahan, dan distribusi minyak jelantah. Peran serta masyarakat sangat penting dalam memastikan pasokan bahan baku tetap berkelanjutan.

Matias Tumanggor dari Asosiasi Pengumpul Minyak Jelantah Indonesia (APJETI) menyoroti perlunya regulasi harga dari pemerintah. Tanpa regulasi, para pengumpul kerap menghadapi kendala di lapangan karena dianggap melakukan pelanggaran.

Sementara itu, Setiady Goenawan dari Asosiasi Eksportir Minyak Jelantah Indonesia (AEMJI) mengungkapkan bahwa minyak jelantah Indonesia telah diekspor ke berbagai negara selama 17 tahun terakhir. Kerja sama dengan lembaga internasional juga dilakukan untuk memastikan data ketertelusuran sesuai standar global.

Dengan langkah terintegrasi dan dukungan semua pihak, minyak jelantah bukan lagi sekadar limbah, tetapi energi masa depan yang bersih dan berkelanjutan. Pemanfaatannya bisa menjadi jawaban bagi tantangan transisi energi di era perubahan iklim.

Sustainable aviation fuel: A key solution for decarbonising air cargo

The aviation industry has long been a cornerstone of global trade and connectivity. However, it is also a significant contributor to global carbon emissions. In 2023, aviation accounted for 950 Mt CO2 emissions, almost 2.5% of the global energy-related emissions. With the rise of e-commerce and international logistics, the aviation industry is under increasing pressure to adopt low-carbon aviation solutions.

International Air Transport Association (IATA) member airlines have set an ambitious goal to achieve Net-Zero Emissions by 2050; however, the road to achieving decarbonisation is far from easy. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is emerging as a leading solution, capable of significantly reducing emissions while ensuring operational efficiency. However, its widespread adoption faces numerous hurdles, from supply constraints to high costs.

Hurdles in decarbonising air cargo

Reducing emissions in air freight is far more complex than in other transport sectors. The key challenges to achieving low-carbon aviation include:

Technological barriers to decarbonisation

While electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft are gaining traction, their feasibility is limited to short-haul regional flights. In long-haul aviation, zero-carbon aircraft face significant technological limitations, including battery weight, energy density, and range constraints. Moreover, most commercial aircraft have a lifespan of several decades, making immediate fleet replacement unrealistic. This prolonged dependency on traditional jet fuels reinforces the urgent need for green aviation fuel alternatives.

Infrastructure and supply chain challenges

The fuel infrastructure of the aviation industry revolved around conventional jet fuels. Transitioning to sustainable aviation fuel will require significant investment in production facilities, distribution networks, and regulatory frameworks. The limited supply of raw materials – like waste oils, agricultural residues, and synthetic feedstocks – can also create supply chain bottlenecks.

Economic and regulatory hurdles

The high cost of SAF is another major barrier to adoption. Currently, green aviation fuel can be anywhere between three to eight times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. While regulatory incentives are beginning to emerge and production is amping up, widespread adoption will depend on government support, policy interventions, and subsidies that make SAF commercially viable for airlines and logistics providers.

Understanding Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The aviation industry cannot afford to wait for zero-emission aircraft to become viable. Green aviation fuel is the most immediate and scalable solution that can drive low-carbon aviation while leveraging existing aircraft and infrastructure. Sustainable aviation fuel is a low-carbon aviation alternative to fossil fuels, which uses renewable resources like used cooking oils, agricultural waste, and synthetic processes.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%. Companies investing in SAF can not only reduce their carbon footprint but also future proof their operations against tightening environmental regulations. As a result, many global airlines and logistics companies have already started integrating green aviation fuel into their operations. However, government incentives, industry collaboration, and technological advancements will be necessary to scale production and reduce costs.

Catalysing shift to green aviation fuel

Overcoming hurdles in decarbonising will depend on several factors. The key catalysts that can accelerate the transition to green aviation fuel include:

Government policies and producer incentives

Government authorities will play a crucial role in scaling up SAF production. Incentives like tax credits, subsidies, and regulatory mandates can help producers expand their capacity, making green aviation fuel more accessible and affordable for airlines.

Subsidies for airlines and logistics providers

Policymakers can also provide financial support for early adopters to encourage sustainable aviation fuel use. This can help offset the high costs associated with SAF and make it more viable for airlines and logistics providers.

Innovation in synthetic fuels

Advancements in synthetic aviation fuel – relying on clean hydrogen and captured CO2 for production – could be a revolutionary innovation. Unlike bio-based SAF, these do not rely on limited biomass resources, making them a more scalable solution for long-term low-carbon aviation.

The government has held six allocation rounds in which renewable project developers apply to the scheme, with allocation rounds now being held annually (the first four being held approximately every two years).

The government recently ran a consultation on potential changes to the seventh allocation round (AR7), allowing industry and investors the opportunity to comment on changes to the CfD. In this Insight, we review the proposed changes under discussion. The changes will take effect in time for AR7 opening later this year.

CfD summary

Renewable project developers that meet the eligibility criteria applicable to the relevant allocation round must submit a form of ""sealed bid"" to the National Electricity System Operator (NESO), which runs the allocation process. Successful developers then enter into contracts with Low Carbon Contracts Company Limited (LCCC), a government-owned entity, in order to benefit from difference payments against a flat indexed rate for the electricity they produce over a 15 year period. When the market price of electricity is below an agreed fixed, or ""strike"", price, the project developer receives the difference from LCCC, so that it receives a guaranteed price. Conversely, should the market price be above the strike price, the project developer must pay the difference to LCCC. LCCC was the beneficiary of payments during the whole electricity power spike caused by the Ukraine conflict.

The government ran a consultation from late February to March of this year to garner opinion on potential changes to AR7, due to open this summer (the Consultation). One critical influence on the government's proposals is the ambition for the UK to deliver clean power by 2030 as set out in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan.

What is likely to change?

Allowing fixed-bottom offshore wind projects to apply for a CfD with pending planning consent

Currently, projects must have all required planning consents in place before they can bid for a CfD. However, due to considerable lead-in times for obtaining Development Consent Orders, fixed-bottom offshore wind projects have been under-represented in previous allocation rounds. The government believes that removing the requirement to secure planning consent prior to bidding in AR7 will attract more project bidders, who may then be able to deliver more quickly without a gap between obtaining consent and making a CfD application. It is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, and means developers will be ""at risk"" for a shorter period of time, hopefully reducing project costs.

The government does recognise the risk of early-stage projects failing to deliver as a result of being refused planning consent or submitting bids that are proved to be too low. Conversely, they may incorporate a risk premium into their bids in order to combat project cost uncertainty, which will result in increased costs to consumers. However, the government believes such risks do not outweigh the benefits.

The government has asked industry for its opinion on the proposed change, as well as a host of resultant amendments; for example, unconsented projects won't be able to commit to existing time and cost restricted milestones. The government suggests that such milestones be deferred until the developer receives the planning decision. Moreover, while the government believes unconsented projects should still be subject to NDD (the Non-Delivery Disincentive that prevents projects that fail to sign a CfD with LCCC within 10 working days of offer from participating in the next two allocation rounds for which they are eligible), it suggests that NDD may be waived in certain circumstances. If approved, this would greatly accelerate many fixed bottom wind projects, which are key to delivering clean power by 2030.

Publishing a capacity ambition in place of a budget and allowing the Secretary of State greater visibility of auction information

The sixth auction round, in 2024, resulted in unspent budget for fixed-bottom offshore wind. This was due to project owners having to bid in a later round because their bid prices came in over budget. The government looks to amend auction processes in AR7 to create greater certainty of outcome by announcing a capacity ambition rather than budget, with the aim of procuring more fixed-bottom offshore wind projects. The government also plans to publish the budget after the allocation round has run (rather than prior to bidding opening, as is currently the case) in the hopes that this will encourage projects to bid at their minimum viable price.

The government is also considering allowing DESNZ to use anonymised bid information for fixed-bottom offshore wind in making its final budget decision, on the basis that the government has a greater chance of purchasing the correct volume of offshore wind. However, the Consultation does acknowledge the risk of gaming and inflated bids. While the government hopes that this regulatory change will in time apply to all technologies, for AR7 it will apply to fixed-bottom offshore wind only. Commentators have said that this is likely to be to push up prices for offshore wind, as potential auction participants will have visibility of their competitors and be able to identify where the likely breakeven points for projects are. Given that the budget could be unconstrained, this incentivises projects to bid at what they estimate will be the highest price they could reasonably receive.

Increasing contract term for future projects

Contracts with LCCC currently have a 15-year term. However, longer contracts may reduce the exposure of renewable assets to ""price cannibalisation"" (where renewable sources generate an oversupply of electricity, causing a drop in market prices) post-CFD, thereby reducing project risk and cost. Longer contracts would also align with increased lifespans of modern technology. The Consultation, however, does not give any indication of what this increase will look like, as the government intends to first assess how such changes will affect consumer interest. Depending on the outcome of further review, it may be that this amendment will apply only to certain technologies. Increasing the 15 year term is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. If the 15-year term is extended, there will likely be advocacy to increase the tenor of other CfD-style support mechanics, e.g. the guaranteed strike price for sustainable aviation fuel currently being designed.

Increase Target Commissioning Window (TCW) for solar projects

Generators have a fixed TCW in which to commission their projects, after which the 15-year payment term begins, regardless of whether the project is live. While most technologies' TCW is 12 months, Solar PV has only three months (given its faster build time). The solar industry has expressed concerns that the TCW does not allow for the increasing size, and associated risk, of solar projects and requested that solar be brought in line with other technologies. The government has proposed increasing the TCW, as mentioned in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, but only to six months at this time.

Temporarily restricting the entry of surrendered CfD capacity into AR7

Currently, developers may reduce their contracted capacity prior to commissioning the construction of their power stations (i) by 25% before the Milestone Delivery Date; and/or (ii) by meeting only 85% (for offshore wind) or 95% (for all other technologies) of their Installed Capacity Estimate by the Longstop Date. Under existing rules, developers can then enter any surrendered contracted capacity in future allocation rounds.

However, such opportunity for capacity re-bidding may encourage generators to increase their income under CfD beyond that agreed in their original contract, with consumers ultimately bearing the additional cost. The government therefore proposes to prevent generators from bidding for previously reduced capacity in AR7, while the government reviews and clarifies its policy in time for AR8. Participants in AR7 will therefore have to confirm that their applications do not include any capacity that was previously subject to a CfD awarded in ARs 1-6.

Allowing repowered onshore wind projects to participate in AR7

The government's October 2024 response to a previous consultation confirmed that repowered wind projects (i.e. old wind farms that have their old turbines replaced with new) would be able to participate in AR7. The Consultation looks to set out eligibility criteria for such projects: for example, developers must demonstrate that the project commenced commercial operations at least 25 years before the Target Commissioning Date set out in their CfD application (thereby evidencing that the project has reached end-of-life). Developers must confirm they will not use any pre-existing assets other than refurbished foundations and show separation between existing and repowered facilities. This ensures that the projects are genuinely being repowered, rather than simply undergoing a life-extension. The key will be designing a process where repowered and new projects compete on an even playing field, so that repowered projects with potentially lower costs for some items do not crowd out new projects. If there are material differences (which may depend on the technology type), one way to solve this will be to have a separate pot for repowered projects.

Allowing floating offshore wind projects (FLOW) participating in AR7 to build in phases

Currently, only fixed offshore wind CfD participants are allowed to build in several stages, with FLOW historically being deemed too small to justify inclusion. However, the government is keen to increase the UK's offshore wind capacity by 2030 and FLOW, being situated in deeper waters further from shore, can gain access to higher, more consistent wind speeds. In a positive change for FLOW developers (and as is the case with fixed offshore wind projects), they will be able build in up to three phases, subject to a 1,500MW total maximum capacity.

Changes not subject to consultation

The government has also confirmed that the CfD price base used in budgets will be updated in AR7 to 2024 prices (current prices being set at a 2011/12 price base) and that it will consider how frequently the price base will be updated for future allocations.

Next steps

The consultation closed on 21 March 2025, meaning the government will be reviewing industry feedback and looking to publish its response. The government has already indicated that it may publish a response to budget process and visibility of auction information before responding to the rest of the topics consulted on, so that AR7 is not delayed.

According to agricultural officials, a typical avocado tree free from disease and pests can yield between 100 and 200 avocados. However, avocado trees in Pingtung now only have two to three small fruits on many trees this harvest season, per CNA.

Furthermore, avocado trees only fruit once a year, leading farmers to express extreme concern about this year’s crop. It is the first time such a disaster has hit local avocado farmers. Many are blaming climate change.

DPP legislator Chung Chia-pin (鍾佳濱) visited avocado growers in Pingtung’s Wanda and Gaoshu Townships on Sunday after learning of their plight. Agricultural officials and government staff will activate relief processes as soon as possible.

A fruit farmer named Chen (陳) said the main costs of avocado production are fertilizer and labor. He said avocado cultivation is relatively simple, but large temperature differences in a short period have caused his avocado orchard to be largely barren.

Chen said he planted 56 avocado trees on 1,200 square meters of land, but the yield dropped by 80%. He joked that there won’t be much work for him this year due to the dramatic decline in avocado production.

Gaoshu Township Chief Liang Cheng-han (梁正翰) said many avocado farmers are facing the same issue. He appealed to legislators for relevant subsidies to reduce farmers' losses. In addition, Liang called for relevant follow-up research on seedlings in response to the effect of climate on avocado harvests.

Chung said avocados have been embraced by the local market in recent years, with main production areas located in Pingtung townships such as Ligang, Jiuru, Gaoshu, and Wandan. He called on all avocado farmers to report to the township office if their fruit trees are damaged, and to apply for natural disaster relief as soon as possible.",https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/2025%2F04%2F20%2Fc544931d295a4d1488841c1cccbad450.jpg,N,,2025-04-21 10:56:11.385361

Company chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher remarked on this at the Airbus Industry Outreach event held in Bangkok, Thailand last 11th April.

Kitcher said: “Thanks to its strong agricultural sector, Thailand has rich potential as a producer of SAF, with extensive feedstocks including molasses, agricultural waste such as rice straw and rice husk, corn cobs and leaves, and manure. It’s extremely encouraging to see Thailand’s ethanol industry considering SAF production. It is also very encouraging to see this ‘industry cooperation’ approach as this mindset will be needed in developing and validating data such as Life Cycle Assessment data for new feedstocks.”

Thailand’s place in the global SAF sector

Several projects are already under development to produce SAF from used cooking oil, such as that announced by Bangchak, as well as PTT Global Chemical’s initial foray into SAF via a co-processing pathway.

At the same time, Airbus executives note that alcohol-to-jet fuel derived from ethanol holds great promise here too.

It should also be noted that Thailand’s strategy to increase the number of electric vehicles on its roads nationwide will reduce demand for bioethanol in the road transport sector, freeing up more for use in SAF.

Kitcher said: “At Airbus, we look forward to working with the Thai government and SAF producers to help develop the industry.”

She added that there were two critical challenges that Thailand needs to address if it is to succeed as a primary source of SAF for the global aviation sector.

What needs to be done?

The first of these two issues is the need to pull new SAF technologies through their first stages of development, as these are the points where developmental and financial risks are at their highest.

Kitcher said of this: “We are also working to support SAF projects here in south-east Asia and Thailand. For example, we signed a memorandum of understanding with CP last year to explore the potential of SAF production from agricultural waste. We are also keen to help bring other new feedstocks on-stream here, too.”

The second issue that needs to be dealt with involves gaining a thorough understanding of the various feedstocks here.

According to Kitcher: “What we’ve learned at Airbus is that it’s not simply enough to understand the potential production capacity of a given feedstock. You also need an in-depth understanding of its location, accessibility and the costs of collecting and transporting it. Thailand has already made strong progress in gathering valuable data and information about where the country’s feedstocks are located.”

Keeping this in mind, policymakers play a key role when it comes to developing the Thai SAF industry.

Also, attaining success will require a high level of coordination between different stakeholders and the setting out of a clear ambition and roadmap.

Kitcher pointed out that the swift publication of a national SAF roadmap, including a 1 percent blending target for 2026, would provide potential producers and investors with the clarity they need.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/04/a18f0b5e-image003-15.jpg,N,,2025-04-21 09:58:03.674784

The volumes involved are tiny, however.

Since January 2025, Mabanaft has worked with partner Skytanking, an aviation fuelling services company, to support operations at the airport. The company has already commenced supply agreements with Singapore Airlines and the Lufthansa Group.

The move adds Frankfurt to Mabanaft’s existing aviation fuel network, which includes locations in the UK and Norway. Under the European SAF Mandate, Mabanaft plans to deliver 1,000 tonnes or more of SAF at Frankfurt this year. (Globally, 350 million tonnes of aviation fuel was burned in 2023.)

SAF supplied by Mabanaft includes a blend of hydroprocessed vegetable oils, fats and greases which can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its life cycle compared with conventional aviation fuels.

Simon Weiss, Head of Aviation at Mabanaft, said the expansion supported the company’s wider strategy to strengthen aviation supply chains in Germany and across Europe.

Mabanaft said it is focused on developing its presence in hard-to-electrify sectors such as aviation by offering both conventional fuels and lower-carbon alternatives.

Under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, fuel suppliers must provide increasing volumes of SAF to airports from 2025 onwards. The policy includes specific targets for synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, which remain at early stages of commercialisation.

A report by the non-governmental organisation Transport & Environment notes that while 25 industrial projects aim to produce 1.7 million tonnes of e-kerosene by 2030, this exceeds the 600,000-tonne target set by EU regulation. However, no major project has yet reached a final investment decision, illustrating the ongoing uncertainties in the nascent market.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/01/shutterstock_2304836079-3.jpg",N,,2025-04-21 09:58:08.551569

According to agricultural officials, a typical avocado tree free from disease and pests can yield between 100 and 200 avocados. However, avocado trees in Pingtung now only have two to three small fruits on many trees this harvest season, per CNA.

Furthermore, avocado trees only fruit once a year, leading farmers to express extreme concern about this year’s crop. It is the first time such a disaster has hit local avocado farmers. Many are blaming climate change.

DPP legislator Chung Chia-pin (鍾佳濱) visited avocado growers in Pingtung’s Wanda and Gaoshu Townships on Sunday after learning of their plight. Agricultural officials and government staff will activate relief processes as soon as possible.

A fruit farmer named Chen (陳) said the main costs of avocado production are fertilizer and labor. He said avocado cultivation is relatively simple, but large temperature differences in a short period have caused his avocado orchard to be largely barren.

Chen said he planted 56 avocado trees on 1,200 square meters of land, but the yield dropped by 80%. He joked that there won’t be much work for him this year due to the dramatic decline in avocado production.

Gaoshu Township Chief Liang Cheng-han (梁正翰) said many avocado farmers are facing the same issue. He appealed to legislators for relevant subsidies to reduce farmers' losses. In addition, Liang called for relevant follow-up research on seedlings in response to the effect of climate on avocado harvests.

Chung said avocados have been embraced by the local market in recent years, with main production areas located in Pingtung townships such as Ligang, Jiuru, Gaoshu, and Wandan. He called on all avocado farmers to report to the township office if their fruit trees are damaged, and to apply for natural disaster relief as soon as possible.",https://image.taiwannews.com.tw/2025%2F04%2F20%2Fc544931d295a4d1488841c1cccbad450.jpg,N,,2025-04-21 00:56:09.179628

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

But when done right, it can unlock leaner, smarter, and more sustainable supply chains. Rather than a regulatory headache, companies that embrace emissions tracking as a strategic tool can cut costs, build resilience, and even gain a competitive edge.

Beyond compliance: Turning Scope 3 into a strategic asset

With regulations like the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and California’s Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act (CCDAA) now in force, businesses must track not just their direct (Scope 1) and energy-related (Scope 2) emissions, but also the vast network of indirect emissions (Scope 3) spanning suppliers, logistics, and product end-of-life impacts.

But the best companies don’t treat Scope 3 as a box-ticking exercise. Zero100’s research shows that industry leaders leverage emissions data to optimize costs, strengthen supplier relationships, and increase operational efficiency.

Consider supply chain resilience: Mapping emissions hotspots helps businesses identify suppliers at risk of regulatory non-compliance, financial instability, or environmental disruption. A robust emissions baseline acts as a risk heat map, guiding smarter procurement decisions.

Emissions sources vary industry by industry and even companies in similar industries may have significantly different Scope 3 footprints. Industry-wide, emissions footprints vary significantly. These differences highlight why generic, one-size-fits-all approaches often fall short, and emissions tracking should be embedded into core business operations, rather than just a compliance exercise.

Tackling data complexity: From bottleneck to breakthrough

To turn these insights into action, companies must first overcome a fundamental challenge: data complexity. At its core, emissions calculations rely on two data types – activity data (measuring emissions-generating activities), and emissions factors (multipliers converting activity data into greenhouse gas outputs).

Most organizations use one of three approaches, each with varying levels of accuracy:

Spend-based calculations: estimating emissions using costs of purchased goods/services

Average-data calculations: applying industry averages based on mass or other units

Supplier-specific calculations: collecting primary data from suppliers

Not only is primary data more valuable because it gives a clearer picture of reduction opportunities than simple averages do; it is also more accurate, especially given industry averages are inherently conservative.

Some leaders are equipping suppliers with training, e-learning tools, and direct support to improve emissions tracking.

The key to success seems to be moving beyond one-size-fits-all methodologies to build granular, scalable data ecosystems that enable action, not just reporting.

Tech and AI: The ESG game-changer

This is where technology steps in. Perhaps the most promising development in Scope 3 reporting is the emergence of AI and automation technologies, transforming Scope 3 reporting from a labor-intensive task into a strategic asset. Zero100 research found that companies aggressively hiring for digital skills are 57% more likely to hit their science-based targets (SBTi) than less tech-savvy competitors.

New AI-powered platforms help companies bridge data gaps, streamline supplier collaboration, and automate emissions calculations. They can:

Generate synthetic product footprints to fill information voids

Create digital twins of supply chains to visualize emissions hotspots

Simulate the impact of design, sourcing, and operational changes

The most valuable innovations focus on three areas: filling data gaps, enabling supplier collaboration at scale, and providing actionable intelligence beyond compliance metrics.

When embedded into procurement and operations, these technologies shift emissions tracking from an afterthought to a continuous improvement driver.

A practical roadmap for supply chain leaders

Scope 3 may be complex, but breaking it into manageable steps makes it achievable:

Establish a high-level emissions baseline – Identify key hotspots and use them to guide strategic supplier engagement. Prioritize speed of insight over data perfection.

Invest in supplier collaboration – Move beyond industry averages by collecting primary data from suppliers. Start with those contributing most to emissions.

Embed emissions into procurement decisions – Making sustainability non-negotiable in supplier evaluations and risk assessments.

Leverage AI and automation – Adopt digital tools to streamline reporting, fill data gaps, and generate actionable insights. Bain & Company estimates that sustainability teams spend 70% of their time on data tasks; technology can free them to focus on impact.

Prioritize data accuracy – Move beyond spend-based estimates to real-time, supplier-specific tracking. One VP at a major distributor found a 65% emissions reduction after switching to real customer use data.

Gaining a competitive edge

As regulations tighten, companies face a choice: scramble to comply or seize the opportunity to lead. Unlocking what the matryoshka doll – reaching deep into nth-tier supplier emissions – is challenging but transformative. Businesses that master this will drive innovation, strengthen supplier relationships, and build more resilient operations capable of withstanding future disruptions.

Scope 3 is more than an ESG obligation. Companies that take the lead now won’t just keep pace with regulations; they’ll define the competitive landscape of tomorrow.",https://img.sdcexec.com/files/base/acbm/scn/image/2025/04/Stock_sustainability.67ffe72100bbe.png?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-04-20 22:56:06.700651

충남 서산시가 지속되는 경기 침체와 정부의 건전 재정 기조에도 불구하고 시민 편의와 미래 성장동력 확보를 위해 효율적인 조직 운영에 행정력을 집중하고 있다.

시는 ‘도약하는 서산, 살맛나는 서산’이라는 비전 아래 다양한 부서의 협력으로 매년 역대 최대 규모의 외부 재원을 확보하며 가시적이고 역동적인 성과를 창출해왔다.

2023년 신설된 미래전략담당관은 탄소포집활용 실증지원센터 구축사업 공모 선정과 충청권 최초 국제 크루즈선 유치에 성공했다. 국제 크루즈선 유치로 2016년 준공 이후 멈춰 있던 서산 대산항 국제여객터미널이 처음으로 가동되며, 국제 여객선 유치의 발판을 마련했다.

지난해에는 그린 UAM-AAV 핵심부품 시험평가센터 유치, 제3기 수소도시 지정, 대산그린컴플렉스 일반산단 기회발전특구 지정 등 미래 친환경 산업 기반을 다졌다.

특히 올해는 국내 최초 지속가능항공유(SAF) 종합실증센터 최종 입지 선정으로 약 3천억 원 규모의 외부 재원을 확보, 이는 서산시 역사상 최대 규모의 정부 공모사업 성과로 평가받고 있다.

탄소포집활용 실증지원센터, 그린 UAM-AAV 시험평가센터, 지속가능항공유 종합실증센터 등은 서산시가 미래 기술 확보의 중심지로 도약하는 계기가 될 전망이다.

또한, 시민 편의를 위한 원스톱 건축 행정 서비스 제공에도 힘쓰고 있다. ‘원스톱허가과’는 복합민원 상담 사전 예약제를 운영해 시민의 여러 부서 방문을 최소화했으며, 올해는 일주일 이내 건축인허가 결과를 제공하는 ‘one-week-end’ 시책을 추진 중이다.

이러한 노력의 결과로 서산시는 2021년부터 2023년까지 3년 연속 충청남도 건축행정 종합평가 최우수 기관에 선정됐고, 2024년에는 우수기관으로 선정되는 쾌거를 이뤘다.

주요 현안 추진을 위한 TF팀도 탄력적으로 운영 중이다. 체전준비 TF팀은 지난해 6월 76회 충청남도민체육대회를 안전하게 성료했고, 대중교통혁신 TF팀은 행복택시와 행복버스 운영을 통해 교통약자의 이동 편의를 개선하고 있다.

서산시는 올해 6,354억 원의 역대 최대 외부 재원을 확보했으며, 지난해에는 충청권 유일 행정안전부 주관 지방재정 평가에서 3관왕을 달성하는 등 다방면에서 성과를 거두고 있다.

공무원 정원은 2022년 1,278명에서 올해 1,286명으로 소폭 증가하며 평균 1,280명대로 안정적으로 유지되고 있다.

이완섭 서산시장은 “효율적이고 탄력적인 부서 운영을 통해 시민 편의를 극대화하고, ‘도약하는 서산, 살맛나는 서산’ 실현을 위한 다양한 시책 추진에 최선을 다하겠다”고 밝혔다.

서산시는 앞으로도 미래 성장동력 확보와 시민 만족도 향상을 위해 적극적 행정을 이어갈 계획이다.

Despite the ongoing economic downturn and the government's sound fiscal policy, Seosan City in South Chungcheong Province is focusing its administrative power on efficient organizational operation to secure citizen convenience and future growth engines.

Under the vision of 'Seosan that leaps forward, Seosan that is worth living in', the city has secured the largest amount of external funding ever every year through cooperation among various departments, creating visible and dynamic results.

The Future Strategy Office, newly established in 2023, succeeded in selecting the Carbon Capture and Utilization Demonstration Support Center construction project and attracting the first international cruise ship in the Chungcheong region. With the attraction of international cruise ships, the Seosan Daesan Port International Passenger Terminal, which had been at a standstill since its completion in 2016, will be put into operation for the first time, laying the foundation for attracting international passenger ships.

Last year, the city laid the foundation for future eco-friendly industries by attracting the Green UAM-AAV Core Components Test and Evaluation Center, designating the 3rd Hydrogen City, and designating the Daesan Green Complex General Industrial Complex Opportunity Development Special Zone.

In particular, this year, the city secured approximately KRW 300 billion in external funding through the selection of the final site for the country's first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Comprehensive Demonstration Center, which is evaluated as the largest government public offering project in the history of Seosan City.

The Carbon Capture and Utilization Demonstration Support Center, Green UAM-AAV Test and Evaluation Center, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel Comprehensive Demonstration Center are expected to be opportunities for Seosan City to leap forward as a center for securing future technologies.

In addition, efforts are being made to provide one-stop architectural administrative services for the convenience of citizens. The 'One-Stop Permit Division' operates a pre-booking system for complex civil affairs consultations to minimize citizens' visits to multiple departments, and this year, the city is promoting the 'one-week-end' policy to provide building permit results within a week.

As a result of these efforts, Seosan City was selected as the best institution in the Chungcheongnam-do Architectural Administration Comprehensive Evaluation for three consecutive years from 2021 to 2023, and achieved the feat of being selected as an excellent institution in 2024.

The TF team for promoting major issues is also operating flexibly. The TF team for preparing for the Games successfully completed the 76th Chungcheongnam-do Provincial Sports Festival in June last year, and the TF team for innovation in public transportation is improving the convenience of transportation for the transportation disadvantaged by operating Happy Taxi and Happy Bus.

Seosan City secured the largest external funding of KRW 635.4 billion this year, and last year, it achieved triple crowns in the local finance evaluation hosted by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, the only city in the Chungcheong region, and is achieving results in various fields.

The number of civil servants increased slightly from 1,278 in 2022 to 1,286 this year, and is stably maintaining an average of 1,280.

Seosan Mayor Lee Wan-seop said, “We will do our best to maximize citizen convenience through efficient and flexible department operation and promote various policies to realize ‘Seosan that leaps forward, Seosan that is worth living in.’”

Seosan City plans to continue to implement proactive administration to secure future growth engines and improve citizen satisfaction.

충남 서산시가 불확실한 경제 여건과 정부의 긴축 재정 기조 속에서도 시민 삶의 질 향상과 미래 산업 기반 구축이라는 두 가지 목표를 동시에 달성하기 위해 전력을 다하고 있다.

핵심은 ‘효율적인 조직 운영’과 ‘행정력의 집중’이다. 시는 이를 통해 역동적이고 가시적인 성과를 만들어내며 주목받고 있다.

첫해부터 눈에 띄는 성과를 내고 있다는, 지난 2023년 신설된 미래전략담당관은 탄소포집활용(CCUS) 실증지원센터 유치, 충청권 최초 국제 크루즈선 유치 등 굵직한 사업을 선도하며 이름값을 톡톡히 해냈다는 평가를 받고 있다.

특히, 국제 크루즈선 운항은 2016년 완공 이후 가동이 중단됐던 대산항 국제여객터미널을 다시 움직이게 만들며 서산시 해양관광의 새 전기를 마련했다.

이외에도 그린 UAM-AAV 시험평가센터, 제3기 수소도시 지정, 대산그린컴플렉스의 기회발전특구 지정 등 첨단 산업 분야의 연이은 성과는 서산시가 미래 기술 거점 도시로 거듭나고 있다는 신호탄이다.

올해는 이 흐름을 더욱 가속화해 국내 최초 지속가능항공유(SAF) 종합실증센터를 유치, 약 3000억 원 규모의 외부 재원을 확보하며 시 재정에 큰 숨통을 틔웠다.

서산시는 ‘원스톱허가과’를 통해 민원인을 배려한 건축행정 서비스도 선보이고 있다.

복합민원 사전 예약제를 통해 여러 부서를 방문해야 하는 번거로움을 줄였고, 올해는 ‘one-week-end’ 시책을 도입해 일주일 내 인허가 결과 제공을 추진 중이다.

그 결과, 시는 충남도 건축행정 종합평가에서 3년 연속 최우수기관(2021~2023년), 2024년에는 우수기관으로 선정되며 대외적인 신뢰를 굳혔다.

서산시는 주요 현안 대응에 민첩하게 움직이기 위해 6개 TF팀을 운영 중이다.

그 중 체전준비 TF팀은 지난해 열린 제76회 충청남도민체육대회를 성공적으로 개최하며 시의 조직력과 추진력을 입증했다.

또한, 대중교통혁신 TF팀은 교통 소외 지역 주민을 위해 행복택시, 행복버스 등 수요응답형 교통수단을 확대 도입해 교통복지를 실현하고 있다.

올해 서산시는 역대 최대 규모인 6354억 원의 외부 재원을 확보했으며, 지난해에는 행정안전부 지방재정 평가에서 충청권 유일의 ‘3관왕’을 달성하는 기염을 토했다.

인력 규모는 2022년부터 평균 1280명 대를 유지하면서도, 탄력적인 조직 운영으로 실질적인 성과 창출에 집중하고 있다는 평가다.

이완섭 서산시장은 “효율적이고 전략적인 조직 운영을 통해 시민 중심의 행정과 미래 산업 기반을 동시에 이뤄낼 것”이라며, “도약하는 서산, 살맛나는 서산 실현을 위해 전 공직자가 함께 노력하겠다”고 말했다.

Seosan City catches ‘two birds with one stone’: future food and citizen-centered administration

Strengthening regional competitiveness by securing external resources, organizational innovation, and accelerating future strategic projects -

Seosan City in South Chungcheong Province is doing its best to achieve two goals simultaneously: improving the quality of life of citizens and establishing a future industrial base, despite uncertain economic conditions and the government’s tight fiscal policy.

The key is ‘efficient organizational operation’ and ‘concentration of administrative power.’ Through this, the city is attracting attention by creating dynamic and visible results.

The Future Strategy Officer, newly established in 2023, which has been producing notable results since its first year, is receiving favorable reviews for leading major projects such as attracting a carbon capture and storage (CCUS) demonstration support center and attracting the first international cruise ship in the Chungcheong region.

In particular, the international cruise ship operation has brought back into operation the Daesan Port International Passenger Terminal, which had been suspended since its completion in 2016, and has created a new era for marine tourism in Seosan City.

In addition, the successive achievements in the cutting-edge industry sector, such as the Green UAM-AAV Test and Evaluation Center, the designation of the 3rd hydrogen city, and the designation of Daesan Green Complex as an opportunity development special zone, are signals that Seosan City is being reborn as a future technology hub city.

This year, the city has further accelerated this trend by attracting the first Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Comprehensive Demonstration Center in Korea, securing external funds worth approximately 300 billion won, and greatly relieving the city's finances.

Seosan City is also introducing architectural administration services that are considerate of citizens through the 'One-Stop Permit Department'.

The city has reduced the inconvenience of having to visit multiple departments through the complex civil complaint advance reservation system, and this year, it is promoting the provision of permit results within a week by introducing the 'one-week-end' policy.

As a result, the city has solidified its external trust by being selected as the best institution for three consecutive years (2021-2023) in the Chungnam Province Architectural Administration Comprehensive Evaluation and as an excellent institution in 2024.

Seosan City is operating six TF teams to respond to major issues with agility.

Among them, the Sports Festival Preparation TF Team successfully hosted the 76th Chungcheongnam-do Provincial Sports Festival last year, proving the city's organizational power and driving force.

In addition, the Public Transportation Innovation TF Team is realizing transportation welfare by expanding the introduction of demand-responsive transportation means such as Happy Taxi and Happy Bus for residents of transportation-deprived areas.

This year, Seosan City secured the largest amount of external funding ever, KRW 635.4 billion, and last year, it achieved the feat of being the only 'triple crown' in the Chungcheong region in the local finance evaluation of the Ministry of the Interior and Safety.

It is evaluated that the workforce size will be maintained at an average of 1,280 people from 2022, while focusing on creating tangible results through flexible organizational operation.

Seosan Mayor Lee Wan-seop said, “Through efficient and strategic organization operations, we will simultaneously achieve citizen-centered administration and a future industrial foundation,” and added, “All public officials will work together to realize a Seosan that leaps forward and a Seosan worth living in.”

Delusione Carlos Alcaraz a Barcellona. Il tennista spagnolo oggi, sabato 20 aprile, ha perso la finale dell'Atp 500 'di casa' contro il danese, numero 13 del mondo, Holger Rune, che si è imposto in due set con il punteggio di 7-6 (8-6), 6-2.

As Saudi Arabia ascends the global aviation ladder, its air travel ambitions are no longer grounded by regional limitations. Instead, the Kingdom is strategically investing in its Total Air Market (TAM), which is forecasted by VIDEC to reach a staggering USD 11.3 billion by 2028 — growing at a robust CAGR of 12.2%. The Kingdom’s airspace, once primarily serving domestic passengers and pilgrimage traffic, is now being reimagined as a global crossroads, with state-owned SAUDIA leading an aggressive international expansion and newcomer Riyadh Air targeting global dominance by linking Saudi Arabia to over 100 cities by the end of the decade.

This shift is not merely a national milestone; it’s a geopolitical repositioning of air routes, economic influence, and tourism strategy. It is a core pillar of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, aimed at reducing reliance on oil and diversifying into high-growth sectors like travel and tourism. With the international air travel market projected to grow even faster—at a CAGR of 14.1%—Saudi Arabia is positioning itself to capitalize on, and even help drive, this global aviation surge.

The TAM Surge: A USD 11.3 Billion Opportunity

According to VIDEC, Saudi Arabia’s Total Air Market (TAM) growth trajectory is among the highest in the Middle East. From 2024 to 2028, the TAM is expected to more than double in value, reaching USD 11.3 billion. This rise is underpinned by increased passenger volumes, expanded international flight networks, and heavy state investment in aviation infrastructure, including the construction of new airports and the transformation of existing hubs like Jeddah’s King Abdulaziz International Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport.

The TAM encompasses all commercial aviation activities including international and domestic travel, business aviation, and cargo services. The surge is driven not only by demand but by structural changes—policy liberalization, visa facilitation, new carriers, and technology upgrades. This holistic modernization of air infrastructure and policy is unlocking both inbound and outbound traffic.

SAUDIA’s Global Push: A Legacy Carrier Reimagined

Saudi Arabia’s national carrier, SAUDIA, is no longer just a symbol of domestic pride but an evolving global brand. Once seen largely as a pilgrimage and regional connector, SAUDIA is now venturing deep into Europe, Asia, Africa, and North America. Its recent moves—launching direct flights to cities like Barcelona, Zurich, Seoul, and Chicago—reflect a strategy not just to increase frequency, but to reposition the airline as a global competitor.

Part of this transformation includes modernizing its fleet with Boeing 787 Dreamliners and Airbus A321XLRs, introducing in-flight entertainment upgrades, and enhancing passenger experience through AI-driven personalization and onboard services.

Additionally, SAUDIA’s alignment with the Kingdom’s broader economic goals—such as doubling tourism numbers to 70 million international visitors by 2030—creates a multiplier effect. Each new route opens a corridor for trade, investment, and cultural exchange, boosting the Kingdom’s economic profile far beyond aviation alone.

Enter Riyadh Air: The Future Flag-Bearer of Global Connectivity

Launched in 2023 and backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Riyadh Air is Saudi Arabia’s bold bet on the future of global aviation. Targeting a launch fleet of Boeing 787s, the airline has already made global headlines for its ambition to connect the Kingdom to over 100 cities by 2030. Riyadh Air is positioning itself as a premium full-service airline, appealing to both leisure and business travelers.

Riyadh Air’s entry is disruptive in all the right ways. It introduces competition that will not only elevate service standards but also redefine pricing, route planning, and strategic partnerships within the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) aviation ecosystem. Analysts predict that Riyadh Air’s impact will mirror that of Emirates in Dubai or Qatar Airways in Doha—but tailored to Saudi’s unique geopolitical positioning and tourism transformation.

The carrier also plans to integrate seamlessly with Neom, the futuristic megacity under development in northwest Saudi Arabia, thereby channeling passenger traffic directly into a visionary economic and tourism zone.

International Travel Surge: Growing at 14.1% CAGR

While the overall TAM is forecasted to grow at 12.2%, international air travel from and to Saudi Arabia is expected to outpace it at a CAGR of 14.1%. This growth is fueled by several key factors:

Tourism Reforms: Introduction of eVisas and visa-on-arrival for over 60 countries.

Religious Tourism Boom: Continued rise in Umrah and Hajj visitors, targeted to reach 30 million annually by 2030.

Business and MICE Events: Saudi’s increasing role as a host for global summits, expos, and tech events.

Outbound Tourism: Growing appetite among Saudis for global travel, supported by rising disposable income.

Saudi Arabia is now firmly in the league of nations whose outbound and inbound travel flows carry geopolitical and economic weight.

Aviation Infrastructure at Warp Speed

Supporting this explosive growth is an equally ambitious investment in aviation infrastructure. Riyadh is planning a new mega airport—King Salman International Airport—with six parallel runways and the capacity to serve 120 million travelers annually by 2030. Meanwhile, upgrades at Jeddah, Dammam, and Madinah are enhancing capacity and efficiency, while secondary airports are being developed to support tourism in AlUla, Abha, and the Red Sea coast.

The Kingdom’s General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA) is also rolling out new air traffic management systems, safety protocols, and digital check-in services—all part of its smart aviation vision.

Regional Implications: Competition and Cooperation

Saudi Arabia’s aviation renaissance will impact neighboring aviation hubs like Dubai, Doha, and Abu Dhabi. While some industry observers foresee intensified competition for transfer traffic, others argue that the Kingdom’s rise will expand the pie rather than steal slices. If coordinated well, Gulf aviation could evolve into a more interlinked system of mega-hubs, each with niche positioning—luxury, pilgrimage, MICE, or business.

Regional low-cost carriers such as flynas and Flyadeal are also scaling rapidly to meet domestic and regional demand, ensuring that price-sensitive travelers are not left behind in this transformation.

Challenges on the Radar

Despite the bullish outlook, the journey is not without turbulence. Riyadh Air’s aggressive expansion will test air traffic control systems, pilot availability, and slot management. Geopolitical volatility in the Middle East could pose security concerns. Additionally, sustainability remains a pressing issue as Saudi Arabia faces pressure to align its aviation growth with environmental commitments.

To this end, both SAUDIA and Riyadh Air have pledged investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon-neutral operations. The Kingdom is also exploring partnerships with global green aviation innovators.

The Broader Economic Context: Aviation as a GDP Driver

Aviation is poised to become a central pillar of Saudi Arabia’s non-oil economy. Already, the industry supports over 500,000 jobs directly and indirectly. With increased route density, cargo handling, maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) activities, and airport services, this number is expected to rise significantly.

Tourism, linked inextricably with air travel, is projected to contribute 10% of GDP by 2030. This includes leisure, pilgrimage, cultural, heritage, medical, and business travel.

Conclusion: A Skyward Ascent

Saudi Arabia is not merely growing its air travel sector—it is redefining it. From a TAM of USD 11.3 billion to a network of over 100 global cities, the Kingdom’s aviation strategy is part of a larger national reawakening. With SAUDIA transforming into a modern global airline and Riyadh Air preparing to revolutionize the skies, Saudi Arabia is making an audacious yet calculated bet: that the world will fly through its skies and land on its soil.

Whilst most are extremely ecstatic about these good tidings, others have cast aspersions on the figures. These are the facts as they obtained in the investor briefing.

1. The profit is real. Kenya Airways does not engage in creative accounting.

First, because it is illegal. Second, Kenya Airways books are subjected to both internal and external audits from internationally reputable firms like PWC. Moreover, KQ’s accounts are publicly available for scrutiny on its website. KQ also keeps its books in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. A deficit of accounting knowledge perhaps creates any misimpression to the effect that it has cooked its books.

2. KQ’s great results did not happen overnight.

They are the result of several years of restructuring, which culminated in Operation Kifaru, which started in 2020 and is now in its second phase.

3. Operation Kifaru was essentially a “stop digging the hole” process.

This entailed an imbuing of operational efficiencies through route rationalization (cutting back on low traffic routes to concentrate on lucrative ones). It also focused on other aspects of cost optimization even as it grew passenger and cargo numbers evinced by a Cabin Factor of 75.2% and 71 thousand tonnes of cargo uplifted, which is a 25% increase over the previous year.

4. It is true that KQ benefitted from a favourable forex exchange regime.

This contributed to an increase of Ksh 1.2 billion to the airline’s coffers. But even without that benefit, KQ would still have made a profit of Ksh 4.2 billion. Still, when Total Operating Costs of Ksh 171. 874 billion are subtracted from the airline’s Total Income at Ksh 188.485 billion, an Operating Profit of Ksh 16.621 billion results, proving that the business is viable.

5. Going forward, KQ has been cushioned from foreign exchange fluctuations through actions of the Government of Kenya.

The government has taken up a portion of KQ’s dollar loans guaranteed by it and is now settling them. KQ is paying back the government with interest and in Kenya shillings in a process called a novation. This will help to make KQ’s progress sustainable.

Responsibilities and obligations of airline passengers

6. Apart from the flying business, KQ also has other income streams.

It does Maintenance, Repairs and Overhauls for not only its fleet but also for aircraft for other airlines and jurisdictions. Recently, KQ received certification from the European Union Aviation Safety Agency allowing it to service planes that originate from the European Union.

7. Following the success of Operation Kifaru 1, Phase 2 of the same is ongoing.

It entails paying down KQ’s legacy debt incurred in the turbulent period of the ill-fated Project Mawingu and recapitalizing the business to acquire new planes even as new routes are added. The airline intends to increase its fleet to over 50 planes in the next few years.

8. KQ as anchor tenant of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, must grow in tandem with Kenya’s premier airport.

The government has indicated that it is looking for a strategic investor for both airline and airport. This is in keeping with best practice globally where major airlines are synonymous with their hubs. For instance, Emirates Airlines immediately evokes images of Dubai and BA, Heathrow Airport in London.

9. KQ has an environmental sustainability programme where recycled plastic is used to manufacture pyro-diesel.

This diesel is used to power the airline’s ground-handling equipment. KQ was also the first African airline to fly a long-haul commercial flight from Africa to Europe using Sustainable Aviation Fuel. With these initiatives, the airline is future-proofing itself.

10. Africa has 17 percent of the world’s commercial airlines yet it commands less than 3 percent of global air traffic.

In other words, the continent has more airlines than is necessary. The future lies in consolidating these numerous airlines to a few dominant airline groups. To that end, KQ is in talks with South African Airlines to form one pan African airline group. It is hoped that others will soon join in so that economies of scale benefits can be enjoyed. This will lead to greater efficiencies, wider reach and more competitive fares for citizens of the continent. The future is bright and KQ is right in the middle of it!",https://biznakenya.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/468782247_10161181601624121_5120546733599496377_n-2.jpg,N,,2025-04-20 11:56:28.779524

This firm commitment was made at the exclusive discourse event organised by Lufthansa Airlines at the Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos.

During the discourse, it was emphasised that Airlines, Airports, Aircraft Manufacturers, and Regulators must all play their roles to promote eco-friendly practices by lowering carbon emissions, improving fuel efficiency, developing alternative energy sources, and enhancing operational efficiency for the sustainability of the aviation industry.

Director of Air Transport Regulations, Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Mrs Olayinka Babaoye-Iriobe, represented by Mrs Evelyn Tanko, Deputy General Manager, (Commercial Agreement & Aviation Environment), stated that the Authority is empowered by the Civil Aviation Act, 2022 to regulate environmental issues and further to reiterate its commitments to the sustainability of the industry.

NCAA has domesticated ICAO Annex 16 on Environmental Protection into the National regulations under Part 16 of Nig. CARS, which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the NCAA’s initiatives regarding the industry’s sustainability, including the development of a State Action Plan on reducing CO2 Emissions from international aviation. Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA. The NCAA is also leading a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

Key challenges in implementing and scaling sustainability policies within the aviation sector were identified, including a fragmented policy environment, limited data and monitoring systems, financing constraints, regulatory and institutional capacity, awareness, and industry readiness.

Also speaking at the panel session, the Senior Director (Sales), Lufthansa Sub-Saharan Africa, Mr Rene Koinzack, said that the airline has deployed Science-Based Target Initiatives (SBTI), which comprises modern fleet, efficient flight operations, carbon neutral flying, sustainable aviation fuel, reduction of waste and plastics as part of their effort to sustain the industry.",https://thewillnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ncaa.jpg,N,,2025-04-20 06:56:10.284657

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely considered the most viable alternative to conventional jet fuel, offering potential emissions reductions of up to 68%. However, despite its promise, SAF adoption remains below 0.1% of total aviation fuel use in 2024, largely due to high costs, supply chain constraints, and policy uncertainty.

SAF as a decarbonisation pathway

SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure. This makes it an attractive option for immediate carbon reductions. However, current production methods face limitations due to feedstock availability.

Lead author Yuchao Xu from UniSA Aviation joined C-EDGE researchers Professor Shane Zhang and Dr Xin Deng and international researchers from The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Tongji University to analyse the academic literature.

As a result, five key themes were identified that influence SAF's role in aviation decarbonisation:

Sustainable certification of pathways and feedstocks – SAF production relies on certified pathways and sustainable feedstocks to ensure environmental integrity. However, ensuring sustainable sourcing is critical with the rising global demand for biomass. While HEFA from waste oils is currently the most mature technology, its scalability is limited. Future research must explore novel feedstocks such as lignocellulosic biomass, industrial waste gases, and algae-based oils.

Economic simulation of alternative solutions – While SAF is the most promising near-term solution, alternative decarbonisation strategies such as improved aircraft efficiency, route optimisation, and demand management (e.g., carbon pricing and voluntary flight reductions) could complement SAF adoption. Economic simulations suggest that without SAF, airlines may need to reduce flight distances by up to 27% or increase fares by 48% to meet climate goals, which would have negative economic impacts on tourism and global connectivity.

Economic feasibility and market challenges – SAF is 3.5 times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, with prices averaging USD 2,500 per tonne compared to USD 690 per tonne for fossil-based alternatives. The high production cost, coupled with limited government incentives and inconsistent policy frameworks, makes SAF financially unattractive for airlines. Cost reductions will require investment in larger production facilities, improved logistics, and policy-driven financial mechanisms.

Supply chain dynamics and stakeholder involvement – The SAF supply chain involves feedstock suppliers, refineries, airlines, airports, and regulators. Ensuring a stable and cost-effective supply will require coordinated efforts across multiple stakeholders. The research underscores the importance of international collaboration to prevent market fragmentation and ensure equitable SAF availability across different regions.

Policy interventions and market incentives – Governments are crucial in breaking the deadlock between airlines, fuel producers, and infrastructure providers. The European Union, Japan, and Singapore have introduced SAF mandates, requiring airlines to increase SAF percentages over the next three decades. However, researchers warn that poorly designed mandates could create market distortions, favouring certain fuel types and limiting innovation. Instead, a mix of carbon pricing, subsidies, and research incentives may be more effective in scaling SAF production.

The need for global collaboration

The aviation industry cannot drive SAF adoption alone; it requires coordinated global action. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) are critical in setting international standards and ensuring compliance. However, current policies remain fragmented, with different countries adopting varying regulatory approaches.

One of the most significant challenges is the economic competitiveness of SAF. Without financial incentives such as tax credits, production grants, or subsidies, airlines are unlikely to switch to SAF at scale voluntarily. Researchers propose that carbon pricing mechanisms, such as emissions trading schemes (ETS), may be more effective than blending mandates, as they provide flexibility while incentivising cost-effective emissions reductions.

Future research directions

The research identifies additional research opportunities to accelerate SAF adoption:

Regulatory concerns remain a significant topic.

Understanding decarbonisation scenarios without SAF in place across different jurisdictions.

Engineering economic analyses are needed to understand cost-benefit scenarios.

The dynamics between various stakeholders, such as farmers, logistics agencies, and regulatory bodies, remain underexplored.

Investigating existing treaties and agreements between jurisdictions is essential for understanding their real impacts and understanding opportunities for international collaboration.

Understanding to what extent passengers can influence airlines’ adoptions of SAF is critical.

Greater attention to be paid to grey literature, including technical certification, sustainability certification, technological analysis, prediction, and policy considerations.

In summary

The aviation sector is at a critical juncture, with SAF playing a pivotal role in its decarbonisation efforts. While technological advancements and policy interventions are helping to scale SAF production, high costs and supply chain challenges remain significant barriers. This review of the current literature underscores the need for coordinated global action, market-based incentives, and continued innovation in feedstocks and production methods.

Non-CO₂ warming effects could be as significant as CO₂ in aviation’s total climate impact.

However, non-CO₂ emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.

What are contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO₂) and non-CO₂ emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO₂ emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO₂ emissions is complex and hard to measure.

Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions. They are using different fuel types (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation.

The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

One company leading this charge is Boom Supersonic.
Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Supersonic, said the XB-1 was built with a “tiny budget and just 50 people, including engineers, technicians, pilots”.
The stasis has bled into the experience of flying, Scholl says.
We’ve proven we can build a supersonic jet.","Technological disruption has upended banking, communication, even space travel (think SpaceX’s reusable rockets), but somehow, commercial aviation has remained largely unchanged.

For decades, Boeing and Airbus have dominated aircraft manufacturing. But that could change if a new entrant, exploiting new technology, can build a faster, cheaper plane and effectively reprice the industry’s costs.

One company leading this charge is Boom Supersonic. At the end of January, Colorado-based Boom successfully flew its test plane, the XB-1, at the speed of Mach 1.1 (or 1.1 times the speed of sound).

This marked the first time a jet developed independently of major aircraft manufacturers has achieved supersonic speeds.

Blake Scholl, chief executive of Boom Supersonic, said the XB-1 was built with a “tiny budget and just 50 people, including engineers, technicians, pilots”.

Data from the test flight is being used to inform the design of a bigger jet, one that Boom hopes will develop a new market: the Overture.

Boom’s Overture will carry between 64 and 80 passengers at speeds about double that of Boeing 787s or Airbus 350s (up to Mach 1.7). The engines are designed to run on 100 per cent sustainable aviation fuel.

Building Overture would be one feat. Successfully commercialising at would be another, but the excitement around the plane is genuine. Scholl says interest in Boom is “just absolutely overwhelming”.

Part of the drive by Boom is to challenge the status quo in aviation. Boeing is beset by problems with its 737 Max, labour and safety issues, and production slowdowns. Airbus has gained market share, but it is also slowed by lingering production disruptions created by the pandemic aftermath.

“This is an industry where there are only two players in the world, Boeing and Airbus, and neither of them has launched a new product in more than 20 years,” says Scholl.

The stasis has bled into the experience of flying, Scholl says. “We’ve taken flying, which is an experience that used to be inspiring, and turned it to something that most people dread.”

A future of sleek airliners transporting passengers at supersonic speeds and reasonable prices over land would help restore some of the thrill of flying.

Scholl says he was inspired by seeing the Concorde in a museum when he was in his 20s. “I wondered why the most amazing airliner ever made was in a museum, not in our skies.”

The last and only commercial supersonic jet, the Concorde, travelled at cruising speed of 2160km/h or Mach 2, up to 60,000 times across the Atlantic, linking London and Paris to New York.

Before the era of Facebook and Apple, the Concorde was a symbol of technology’s possibility. The British-French Concorde capped a century in which humans progressed from the first flight of the Wright Brothers to landing on the Moon in a span of 66 years. The Concorde’s first test flight took place in 1969 – the same year of the Apollo moon landing.

But it was built with the technology of its time. The Concorde was loud, used lots of fuel and had cramped seating (its seats were smaller than many economy seats today). As it exceeded the speed of sound in flight, the pressure of the air created sonic booms – loud explosions that rattled the ground, frightening people.

This limited the Concorde’s routes to flying over the Atlantic.

The Overture promises to get around the prospect of sonic booms by using something called Mach cut-off physics, which involves the plane flying high enough and in the right conditions to a point where sonic boom never reaches the ground.

If Boom planes flying at or near Mach speed over land become viable, they will open up coast-to-coast routes in North America or between the US east coast and deeper into Europe – and across the Pacific.

“It’d be great if Sydney to LA were eight and a half hours, not 15,” Scholl says.

Boom is also building its own engine to efficiently burn sustainable aviation fuel. There is some debate about how easy this is.

Richard Aboulafia, managing director of Washington DC-based AeroDynamic Advisory, says Boom lacks a realistic path towards an engine.

“The real challenge with creating a modern supersonic jetliner is the engine – far more than the airframe,” he says, with only three companies in the world qualified to do “such a complicated and expensive engine”: GE, Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce, none of which are partnering with Boom.

“Boom is doing its own engine ... in conjunction with three minor partners who really don’t have anything like the capabilities needed,” said Aboulafia.

Scholl says such an assessment is rooted in legacy aerospace costs. “There’s a myth today that jet engines are basically impossible to develop and only big companies can do them.”

“That was also a myth about supersonic jets before XB. We’ve proven we can build a supersonic jet. The next thing is we’ll prove we can build a jet engine.”

Brian Potter of the US-based Institute for Progress writes that “the boundary of technological possibility” is defined not just by mastery of the universe but the “limits of the economy and the organisations that operate within it”.

One of those boundaries may be the cost of its creation. Potter says it’s not uncommon for aircraft companies to spend more than their value to complete a plane. Based on past – even recent examples – creating the Overture could require $US15 billion ($23.5 billion) for completion.

Scholl says the $US15 billion price tag would be right “if one of the big old players did it”.

Scholl says Boom has “demonstrated an ability to develop 10 times more efficiently than the traditional players”. So we are expecting costs more in the $US1-2 billion range “versus the much higher costs that would be realised at traditional players”.

Boom has so far amassed funding just shy of $US1 billion, some of it backed by the Saudi-based NEOM Investment Fund.

Loading

Boom also uses AI and proprietary software engineering tools, Scholl says, which “speed development while reducing costs”.

However, for Boom’s Overture to succeed, market economics must support it where they didn’t for the Concorde, which only flew a niche market of London, New York and Paris.

With a cheaper operational cost, Scholl forecasts flights on the Overture would fetch as much as business flights today – in the $US2500 to $US5000 range one-way – and, unlike with Concorde, prices would fall with time. The premium travel segment is expanding. More passengers are willing to pay for a higher level of service.

But economics probably weren’t the only reason for a plane’s success. Catching the right moment in the market matters too.

Loading

The Concorde was brought to completion in part for the same reasons the moon landing happened – the plane said something about societies that built it.

The Concorde wasn’t even the only supersonic airliner then; Soviet Russia also successfully built a short-lived supersonic transport called the Tu‑144.

Today, China is reportedly developing the C949, a supersonic commercial liner, that will also avoid creating sonic booms and put the Pacific in closer reach of Beijing.

Perhaps supersonic commercial flight will become more attractive both logistically and strategically now than in the past half-century. Boom is also planning a military version of the Overture. Still, the Overture is unlikely to succeed unless it can make a commercial use case.

To date, Boom has orders or options for orders from United Airlines, American Airlines and Japan Airlines. However, aircraft purchasing is a long and complicated business, with sizeable differences between initial options and final delivery.

Scholl is both unbowed and optimistic. “We have an opportunity here to build a company that’s not just larger than Boeing, but one of the most significant companies, one of the most valuable companies on the planet.”

Among several events was a march through midtown Manhattan, a demonstration at a Massachusetts celebration of the 250th anniversary of the start of the American Revolutionary War, and a gathering in front of the White House.

Protesters in San Francisco raised a human flag reading “Impeach & Remove” on the dunes of Ocean Beach, which overlooks the Pacific Ocean.

Thomas Bassford took part in the reenactment of the Battles of Lexington and Concord in front of demonstrators outside Boston. On April 19, 1775, the “shot heard ’round the world” signaled the beginning of the nation’s war for independence from Britain.

An 80-year-old retired mason from Maine believes that Americans must reject their own government, which is currently assaulting them. Bassford remarked, “This is a perilous era for liberty in the United States,” as he attended the ceremony with his daughter, companion, and two grandchildren.

“We should understand the nation’s origins and fight for freedom.”

Tesla dealerships planned to hold protests against Elon Musk, a wealthy Donald Trump advisor, and his role in the decrease of the federal government. Others created additional community service efforts, such as food drives, training seminars, and volunteer work at local shelters.

It’s only been two weeks since thousands of people took to the streets around the country in response to similar statewide protests against the Donald Trump administration.

The organizers claim that they are opposed to Trump’s alleged violations of the Constitution and civil rights, which include his efforts to deport a large number of immigrants and shrink the federal government by firing thousands of employees and effectively closing entire agencies.

Events calling for “no kings” and opposing tyranny inspired the spirit of the American Revolutionary War.

While holding a sign that said, “Donald Trump fascist regime must go now!” During the Concord, Massachusetts demonstrations, Boston resident George Bryant raised concerns that Trump was constructing a “police state” in the United States.

“He is violating the law.” He is kidnapping students. Bryant stated, “He is dismantling the checks and balances.” “This is fascism.”

Bob Fasick had said in Washington: “I attended the march near the White House because I was concerned about the potential threats to the Constitution’s guarantee of due process rights, as well as to Social Security and other federal safety-net programs.”

Under Donald Trump, transgender protections have been compromised.

The 76-year-old retired federal employee from Springfield, Virginia, claimed, “I am unable to remain inactive, as I am aware that if we do nothing, our children and neighbors will be forced to live in a world that I would not wish to inhabit.”

Several hundred protesters were seen at the statehouse in Columbia, South Carolina. They exhibited placards that read “Save SSA,” which stands for the Social Security Administration, and “Fight Fiercely, Harvard, Fight.”

Protesters gathered in Manhattan and marched north from the New York Public Library into Central Park, past Donald Trump Tower, to express their opposition to the continuous deportation of immigrants.

To the rhythmic beat of drums, they declared, “No fear, no hate, no ICE in our state,” referring to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Marshall Green, a protester, expressed his principal concern about Donald Trump use of the 1798 Alien Enemy Act during the conflict. He claimed that the United States is at odds with Venezuelan bandits who work for the South American country’s government.

“Congress should make it clear that we are not at war.” The 61-year-old Morristown, New Jersey resident responded, “That is not feasible.” The right to due process is guaranteed to all individuals in this country, regardless of circumstances, and it is impossible to deport someone without it.

Melinda Charles of Connecticut raised her concerns about Donald Trump “executive overreach,” citing legal fights with federal courts involving Harvard University and other respected organizations.

She went on: “The executive branch has become excessively powerful, despite the fact that we are supposed to have three equal branches of government.” “It is truly remarkable.”

Salah satu langkah strategis yang diambil adalah beralih dari penggunaan bahan bakar fosil seperti avtur, menuju bahan bakar yang lebih ramah lingkungan dan dapat diperbarui. Bahan bakar yang tengah dikembangkan untuk tujuan ini adalah Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Lebih lanjut, menurutnya Indonesia telah menetapkan tiga tujuan utama dalam peta jalan yang disusun oleh pemerintah. Tujuan pertama adalah melakukan dekarbonisasi di sektor penerbangan untuk mendukung pencapaian target pengurangan emisi karbon secara global dan nasional, khususnya melalui penggunaan Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

“Kedua, kedaulatan energi dengan memenuhi kebutuhan energi sektor aviasi secara mandiri dengan memanfaatkan bahan baku domestik. Ketiga, penciptaan nilai ekonomi melalui hilirisasi bahan baku, penjualan SAF untuk pasar ekspor dan domestik, serta peningkatan investasi,” tuturnya.

Ia menambahkan bahwa saat ini produksi SAF di Indonesia masih mengandalkan jalur Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), dengan bahan baku berupa Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) yang dinilai belum sepenuhnya ramah lingkungan. Oleh karena itu, kegiatan riset dan pengembangan (RnD) terhadap beragam jenis bahan baku untuk SAF melalui metode HEFA perlu terus dikembangkan.

“Pentingnya keberlanjutan dalam produksi SAF antara lain mengurangi emisi Gas Rumah Kaca (GRK), mengurangi ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil, mendorong ekonomi sirkular. Mengurangi polusi udara lokal, Mendukung pembangunan berkelanjutan, memenuhi regulasi dan tuntutan pasar,” kata dia.

Ia menegaskan bahwa saat ini terdapat dua bahan baku yang memiliki potensi besar untuk dikembangkan sebagai alternatif dalam produksi SAF melalui jalur HEFA generasi berikutnya, yakni Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah, serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD). Kedua bahan tersebut merupakan limbah yang dinilai lebih berkelanjutan sebagai sumber energi.

Untuk menilai sejauh mana dampak lingkungan dari berbagai jenis bahan baku SAF tersebut, ia menjelaskan bahwa pendekatan yang dapat digunakan adalah Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Metode ini merupakan cara sistematis untuk mengukur dampak lingkungan suatu produk, proses, atau aktivitas, mulai dari tahap awal hingga akhir dari siklus hidupnya.

Lebih lanjut, ia menyampaikan bahwa kajian LCA mencakup seluruh tahapan penting dalam siklus hidup produk, termasuk ekstraksi bahan baku, proses produksi, distribusi, penggunaan, hingga ke tahap akhir seperti pembuangan atau daur ulang. Pendekatan ini penting agar pengembangan SAF benar-benar memberikan manfaat lingkungan yang optimal.

“LCA memiliki beberapa manfaat yang signifikan di Indonesia, seperti mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan produk atau layanan, mengurangi biaya produksi, meningkatkan efisiensi produksi dan penggunaan sumber daya. Memenuhi persyaratan peraturan lingkungan, membantu perbaikan berkelanjutan, meningkatkan citra perusahaan, membantu pengambilan keputusan yang lebih baik untuk bisnis dan investasi,” ujarnya.

Kemudian, lanjut Arif, tantangan dalam penerapan LCA untuk produksi SAF mencakup beberapa aspek, antara lain terbatasnya data yang akurat dan menyeluruh, rumitnya rantai pasok, perbedaan metodologi yang digunakan, serta kebutuhan biaya dan waktu yang tidak sedikit. Selain itu, ketiadaan standar dan regulasi yang seragam juga menjadi hambatan tersendiri dalam pelaksanaan LCA secara efektif.

“Kami menyimpulkan, bahwa LCA menyediakan kerangka kerja yang sistematis untuk mengevaluasi dampak lingkungan dari seluruh siklus hidup SAF, mulai dari produksi bahan baku hingga penggunaan akhir. LCA membantu mengidentifikasi jalur produksi SAF yang paling berkelanjutan, serta area hotspot di mana dampak lingkungan dapat dikurangi,” kata dia.

Adapun hasil kajian LCA dapat menjadi landasan ilmiah dalam menetapkan kebijakan, menentukan arah investasi, dan mendorong inovasi teknologi dalam produksi SAF yang lebih efisien. “Dengan mengintegrasikan LCA ke dalam proses pengambilan keputusan, kita dapat memastikan bahwa industri penerbangan melangkah ke arah yang lebih berkelanjutan dan ramah lingkungan,” ujar Arif.",https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/04/20/id_1392885/1392885_720.jpg,N,,2025-04-19 23:56:11.374718

Bahkan, kualitas jelantah Indonesia diakui sebagai yang terbaik nomor satu di dunia. Sayangnya, potensi emas ini justru belum dimanfaatkan secara optimal oleh negeri sendiri.

Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Ketua Asosiasi Pengumpul Jelantah untuk Energi Baru Terbarukan Indonesia (APJETI), Matias Tumanggor, dalam Workshop Rantai Pasok Minyak Jelantah Berkelanjutan untuk Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang digelar di Gedung BJ Habibie, Jakarta beberapa waktu lalu.

Dalam pemaparannya, Matias menyampaikan bahwa potensi jelantah Indonesia sangat besar dan berkualitas tinggi, bahkan diakui oleh mitra internasional.

“Hal ini sebagai pengakuan dari mitra di luar negeri, dan dibuktikan oleh masyarakat Indonesia dengan sertifikasi halal yang dimiliki oleh setiap hotel, restoran, dan cafe. Bahan yang mereka gunakan adalah 95% minyak goreng berbahan nabati, karena asasnya adalah halal,” ujar Matias.

Namun, ia menambahkan bahwa hingga saat ini jelantah masih belum dimanfaatkan secara maksimal untuk kebutuhan energi di dalam negeri. Penggunaannya lebih banyak terbatas pada bahan baku lokal seperti lilin dan produk lainnya.

Matias juga menyayangkan belum adanya regulasi yang jelas dalam pengelolaan minyak goreng bekas. Hal ini, menurutnya, menjadi salah satu hambatan terbesar dalam pemanfaatan jelantah sebagai energi terbarukan.

“Kemudian, pentingnya dan belum adanya regulasi tentang tata kelola penanganan minyak goreng bekas atau jelantah, serta kami perlu untuk diajak berdiskusi. Menurut kami hal ini sangat penting, karena berhubungan dengan kesehatan lingkungan dan energi,” tegasnya.

Tujuan utama dari forum diskusi ini, lanjut Matias, adalah memetakan rantai pasok jelantah dari hulu ke hilir, mengidentifikasi tantangan dan potensi inovasi teknologi pengumpulan, serta menyusun strategi peningkatan kapasitas pengumpulan minyak bekas untuk mendukung pengembangan SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

“Kami menerima produk jelantah sebagai sumber penghasil UCO, terdiri dari rumah tangga dengan Bank Sampah atau langsung door to door. Sektor industri yang bergerak di bidang makan dan minuman, seperti hotel, restoran, dan cafe,” jelasnya.

Lebih lanjut, sumber jelantah juga berasal dari pelaku UMKM, kantin, industri pertambangan, hingga pedagang kaki lima yang menghasilkan limbah penggorengan seperti gorengan dan kerupuk yang sudah kadaluarsa.

Meski demikian, proses pengumpulan jelantah masih menghadapi berbagai kendala, seperti ketiadaan regulasi, ketidakpastian arah pemanfaatan dalam negeri, serta banyaknya pelaku usaha ilegal yang tidak terorganisir.

“Untuk mengatasinya, kami memiliki strategi pengumpulan dengan melahirkan pelaku usaha yang teredukasi dan terorganisir dari desa sampai provinsi. Meningkatkan kegiatan sosialisasi kepada masyarakat, merangkul dan bersinergi dengan komunitas, organisasi masyarakat, Badan Usaha Milik Desa (Bumdes) atau daerah. Memperluas wilayah pengumpulan sampai ke pelosok desa,” pungkas Matias.

Workshop yang diselenggarakan oleh BRIN melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH) ini bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama, dengan fokus pada kajian Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Kegiatan ini menjadi ruang strategis untuk mempertemukan berbagai pemangku kepentingan guna mengidentifikasi tantangan, peluang, dan solusi inovatif dalam pengembangan rantai pasok jelantah untuk produksi SAF.

CARS, which covers requirements for monitoring, reporting, and verification of CO2 Emissions for international aviation, and Part 5 addresses aircraft noise and emission certification.

The Director highlighted some of the initiatives of the NCAA on the sustainability of the industry. These initiatives include: The development of a State Action Plan on CO2 Emission reduction from international aviation, Nigeria voluntarily joined the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) during its pilot phase in 2018 and has continued to ensure the timely submission of CO2 emission data from airlines under CORSIA and also leading on a Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Roadmap for the development and deployment of SAF in Nigeria.

She added that the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) is rolling out Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) at major airports ultimately to reduce their carbon emissions and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, (NAMA) has implemented Free Route Airspace (FRA) and Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) all efforts for the reduction of carbon footprints and towards the sustainability of the industry.

Key challenges in implementing and scaling sustainability policies within the aviation sector were identified to include: fragmented policy environment, limited data and monitoring systems, financing constraints, regulatory & institutional capacity, and awareness, and industry readiness.

Also speaking at the panel session, Rene Koinzack, the Senior Director (Sales), Lufthansa Sub-Sahara Africa, said that the airline has deployed Science- Based Target Initiatives (SBTI) which comprises modern fleet, efficient flight operations, carbon neutral flying, sustainable aviation fuel, reduction of waste and plastics as part of their effort to sustain the industry.

It was emphasised that airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators must all play their roles to promote eco-friendly practices by lowering carbon emissions, improved fuel efficiency, develop alternative energy sources, and enhance operational efficiency for the sustainability of aviation industry.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nigerian-Civil-Aviation-Authority-NCAA.jpg,N,,2025-04-19 12:56:31.527543

Belangrijke succesfactoren voor een duurzaam reisbeleid Volgens Maarten kunnen andere bedrijven ook aan de slag met een beleid zoals dat van PwC.","PwC heeft het niet alleen bij het stellen van doelen gelaten. Vanaf 2018 heeft het bedrijf geleidelijk maatregelen ingevoerd om reiskilometers en uitstoot te verminderen. Maarten vertelt: ‘Klantcontact is cruciaal in ons werk, maar we stellen ons altijd de vraag of een fysieke reis noodzakelijk is. Is een online meeting mogelijk? Of kunnen we de ontmoeting met minder collega’s of minder vaak plannen, zodat we minder hoeven te reizen? Als reizen noodzakelijk is, geven we de voorkeur aan auto of trein. Sinds 2024 is voor alle reizen tot 700 kilometer de trein de standaard, mits de reis niet langer dan zes uur duurt. Je kunt altijd aanspraak maken op een eersteklas treinticket.’

‘Moet er toch gevlogen worden? Dan is goedkeuring van een leidinggevende vereist. We zijn hierin sinds 2024 strikter geworden. Voordat een vlucht wordt goedgekeurd, overwegen we verschillende factoren: is een directe vlucht mogelijk, kun je de trip combineren met ander werk, en reis je met niet meer dan vier personen? Ook moedigen we aan om zoveel mogelijk in economy class te vliegen, behalve bij langere nachtvluchten. Zo beperken we de uitstoot van de noodzakelijke vliegreizen die we nog maken.’

Hoewel volledig stoppen met vliegen geen optie is voor PwC, probeert het bedrijf de luchtvaartsector te helpen transformeren door te investeren in innovatie. Sinds 2022 koopt PwC een hoeveelheid biobrandstoffen in die gelijkstaat aan alle gemaakte vliegkilometers, bekend als Sustainable Aviation Fuel, die vervolgens door leveranciers aan het brandstofnetwerk wordt toegevoegd. Omdat er niet genoeg biobrandstoffen beschikbaar zijn om de gehele luchtvaart te verduurzamen, investeert PwC ook in onderzoeksprogramma’s voor de productie van synthetische kerosine. Bovendien hanteert het bedrijf een interne CO2-prijs. ‘Voor elke ton CO2 die we uitstoten, investeren we honderd euro in reductie, compensatie en innovatie. Deze CO2-prijs maken we ook zichtbaar in projecten, zodat klanten bewust worden van de klimaatimpact van hun zakelijke reizen en daardoor andere keuzes kunnen maken’, zegt Maarten.

Belangrijke succesfactoren voor een duurzaam reisbeleid

Volgens Maarten kunnen andere bedrijven ook aan de slag met een beleid zoals dat van PwC. ‘Minder vliegen kan zowel tijd als geld besparen voor je bedrijf. Het is belangrijk om een sterke business case te maken en deze goed te presenteren. Daarbij is het cruciaal om met het bestuur realistische doelen te stellen die bij het bedrijf passen.’

Maarten benadrukt het belang van een “holistische benadering”. ‘Verwacht niet dat je onmiddellijke resultaten ziet door slechts één maatregel te implementeren. Meerdere maatregelen samen zorgen vaak voor het grootste effect. Sommige maatregelen zullen pijnlijk zijn, terwijl andere juist meer comfort bieden aan medewerkers. Het vinden van een balans is essentieel voor acceptatie. Daarnaast is het belangrijk om te monitoren en handhaven. Pas dan kun je zien of je beleid effectief is. Wij zien dit als een continu proces. We voeren halfjaarlijkse analyses uit en op basis daarvan scherpen we onze maatregelen aan of verhogen we onze communicatie hierover.’

Is deze holistische benadering een stap te ver voor jouw bedrijf? Dan raadt Maarten aan om te onderzoeken wat wel mogelijk is. ‘Het is nuttig om te leren van andere bedrijven en bestaande informatie. Sluit je bijvoorbeeld aan bij een coalitie zoals Anders Reizen. De Vliegwijzer biedt bovendien veel tips en inspiratie van ervaren bedrijven.’",https://www.nieuwsbladvoorhuizen.nl/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Exclusief-Interview-PwC-Treinreizen-Nieuwe-Standaard-voor-Afstanden-tot-700.jpeg,N,,2025-04-19 11:56:59.718167

They include: Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels.","Say the word ""sustainable"" around an airline executive, and they'll probably try to change the subject. That's because green air travel is a distant dream.

But not for Air New Zealand.

""We're doing everything we can to become sustainable now,"" says Kiri Hannifin, Air New Zealand's chief sustainability and corporate affairs officer. ""And we're leaving no stone unturned.""

Hannifin is not your typical airline executive. She's too casually dressed, too plain-spoken to fit the stereotype, answering my questions quickly and candidly. Hannifin readily admits she prefers being among the workers at the airport instead of sitting at a desk in Air New Zealand's Auckland headquarters, where I met her.

Air New Zealand is unique among airlines. It's the national air carrier for a geographically isolated island on the far edge of the Pacific Ocean. New Zealand depends on long-haul aviation for tourism and trade, and the airline imports 100 percent of its jet fuel. That creates a paradox. If you cut back on carbon emissions, you could cut yourself off from the rest of the world.

So can you explore the world and protect it at the same time? Hannifin doesn't just hope the answer is yes — she's counting on it. But Air New Zealand's path to sustainability has already been turbulent, and there's more rough air ahead. There have been missteps. Hannifin's work may affect your next flight on all airlines beyond Air New Zealand, no matter where you're headed.

Air New Zealand's flight plan for sustainability

A bold experiment is underway to turn Air New Zealand green. The airline is exploring strategies to reduce its environmental impact. They include:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF): SAF is an alternative jet fuel that reduces carbon emissions across its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil fuels. The airline recently purchased 30 million liters of SAF for its flights from Los Angeles and San Francisco to Auckland.

Electric planes: Air New Zealand expects to be one of the first commercial airlines to add an electric plane to its fleet in 2025. It's a six-seater, all-electric aircraft from Beta Technologies with a range of 350 kilometers. The airline intends to use the electric plane for short cargo routes from Wellington to Blenheim on New Zealand's South Island.

Next-level conservation. The airline is also experimenting with other sustainability measures. For example, it recently removed single-use coffee cups from one of its flights and encouraged passengers to bring their own cups. The airline has also removed disposable coffee cups from their lounges and replaced them with washable ones. (The bring-your-own-cup experiment was short-lived, but the paper cups in the lounges are gone for good.)

Granted, these are baby steps toward Air New Zealand's goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Hannifin says achieving it will require a ""huge lift"" and she predicts it'll be a bumpy ride as the airline navigates passenger demand, regulations and a need to be profitable.

What's the journey been like?

It's been an adventure so far. One challenge is getting buy-in from passengers. While its customers say they care about the environment, only between 3 and 4 percent buy a carbon offset when they book a ticket.

And then there's the great paper cup experiment. The airline uses hundreds of thousands of landfill-clogging disposable cups every year. But getting passengers on board with conservation efforts has proven difficult. Hannifin recalls a recent flight where the airline scrapped its paper cups on a trial basis.

""We texted the customers twice,"" she recalls. ""We said, 'Please bring your own cups. We're just doing a little trial and we'll give you prizes.'""

Only 10 percent of the passengers brought their cups. Flight attendants handed out Air New Zealand lapel pins and keychains to the participating passengers. Back to the drawing board.

Another giant hurdle: sustainable aviation fuel made from agricultural waste. It's the primary driver of green aviation. There's no clear, consistent global framework to support its widespread use.

Air New Zealand is voluntarily purchasing SAF, placing it at a commercial disadvantage compared to other airlines that continue to rely solely on cheaper fossil fuels. The airline is pushing for a SAF mandate in New Zealand, which would level the playing field by requiring all airlines to use a certain percentage of sustainable fuel.

This lack of regulatory support also hinders the development of a domestic SAF industry, because fuel companies require the assurance of long-term demand before investing in SAF production facilities in New Zealand.

What does this mean for your next flight?

How will all of these initiatives affect your next trip? In the short term, the most noticeable change might be the absence of single-use coffee cups.

As SAF becomes more prevalent, you might be flying with a fuel mix that reduces carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to regular jet fuel. Down the line, the use of electric planes for regional routes may become more common. And the amount of sustainable fuel being used will increase every year.

And what about that 2050 goal? Air New Zealand is far from getting there, and Hannifin says the airline is currently the fifth largest polluter in New Zealand, which, she admits, ""is a terrible position to be in.""

But she says the company is determined to be taken off the list quickly as it adopts sustainable fuels and switches to electric planes.

Hannifin predicts the flying experience itself will change as 2050 draws closer. Faster planes and quieter engines may make it more convenient to get to New Zealand. Sustainability aviation will be at the center of it.

""Travelers will be much more cognizant of where they travel based on climate footprint,"" she says.

It's a slow journey toward sustainability — but one worth taking

If Air New Zealand wants to reach its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, it will require a multi-pronged approach. The airline will have to address not just decarbonization but also waste reduction and broader sustainability practices. It will have to solve the paradox of being a carrier of passengers, some of whom are trying to reach family or experience the natural beauty of New Zealand, with being a polluter.

This odyssey is happening across the tourism industry, as governments and passengers start pressuring air carriers to do more for the environment. So Air New Zealand's journey might affect an airline closer to home soon.

Reality check: With New Zealand entering a recession and Air New Zealand's competitors still using cheaper fossil fuels, it sounds almost impossible. But Hannifin likes those odds.

""We have to really hustle,"" she says. ""But we'll get there. I'm sure of it.""",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/680351d75abd153ea9b71a07/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-04-19 09:56:08.423187

Yet there comes a moment, often during the fifth month of gray skies, when even the most loyal resident starts scanning airline apps for sunshine and something profoundly different. Egypt answers both cravings in one sweep: year-round warmth, legendary hospitality, and a cultural pedigree that predates the oldest Seneca Lake stone wall by four millennia.

The following guide breaks down ten timely, tangible reasons Egypt should rise to the top of your 2025 travel shortlist. Think of it as a fact checked roadmap: each section pairs the latest intel (museum openings, currency shifts, visa updates) with practical tips, so you can move from daydreaming to departure with confidence.

1. Grand Egyptian Museum Finally Opens (July 3, 2025)

Cairo has waited nearly twenty years for the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) to fling open its pyramidal glass façade. The wait ends July 3, when the world’s largest archaeological museum welcomes the general public. Once inside, visitors will encounter 100,000 artifacts, including the full, gilded funerary collection of Tutankhamun, shown together for the first time in a single climate controlled space.

What this Means for Travelers:

A single, ticketed campus beside the Giza Plateau slashes cross-town traffic time; you can pair the Pyramids, Sphinx, and GEM in one seamlessly guided day.

Evening entry slots (announced for late 2025) will allow sunset pyramid views followed by air conditioned gallery strolls, ideal for summer visits.

Local tip: Book GEM tickets the moment your international flights are locked in; daily visitor caps mirror the timed entry model used by the Louvre.

2. E-visa Approval Arrives in Under 24 Hours

Remember mailing passports to consulates? Egypt scrapped that hassle. U.S. and most EU citizens can now apply, pay, and download a 30-day tourist e-visa on the government portal. Many approvals land in your inbox the same day, and the PDF works on your phone, no print-outs required.

Pro move: Submit the form one week out; if immigration requests a quick clarification, you still have days to spare.

3. Year-round Nonstop Flights From JFK Cut Travel Time

EgyptAir’s MS 986 departs JFK around lunchtime three times weekly (schedule expands to daily over summer), landing in Cairo the next morning. The single hop erases the European layover and, crucially, keeps your checked bag on the same aircraft. Even with a six-hour time change, you can clear customs, meet your guide, and reach the Pyramids before noon.

Sleep hack: Choose a window seat on the port side (rows 35–45) for dawn views of the Nile Delta on descent.

4. A Strong Dollar Turns Luxury Into a Bargain

Currency devaluations aren’t great for Egyptians, but they stretch American vacation budgets in a way unseen since the early 1990s. The pound slid to ≈EGP 51 per U.S. dollar in early April after another market wobble, and economists expect it to hover near that mark through peak travel season. Five star hotels that once rivaled Rome’s prices now cost less than midrange Manhattan rooms, and a private, Egyptologist-led day tour averages what a group bus excursion did three years ago.

Bottom line: This is the year to upgrade, think Nile view suites, hot air balloon dawn flights, or a cabin on a boutique dahabiya (see Reason 7).

5. Abu Simbel Sun Festival, a Twice Yearly Sunrise You Can Plan Around

On February 22 and October 22, sunlight pierces the innermost sanctuary of Ramses II’s Great Temple at Abu Simbel, illuminating statues of three gods and the pharaoh himself. Thousands gather before dawn on Lake Nasser’s shore, drums echo across the desert, and the spectacle lasts a mere 20 minutes.

How to catch it:

Fly to Abu Simbel from Aswan the afternoon prior, overnight at a lakeside lodge, and walk to the temple by 4 a.m.

Alternatively, board a Lake Nasser cruise that docks overnight, cabins sell out a year in advance.

6. Unesco Sites Deliver History in High Definition

Egypt packs seven UNESCO World Heritage inscriptions into a country smaller than Texas. From the Pyramids of Giza to the monastic summit of St. Catherine in Sinai, each site layers thousands of years of religious, political, and engineering innovation. Highlights include:

Memphis and its Necropolis – the full pyramid fields from Giza to Dahshur.

Ancient Thebes – Luxor’s east bank temples and west bank Valley of the Kings.

Historic Cairo – 600 plus listed buildings spanning Islamic, Coptic, and Ottoman eras.

Why this matters: Few destinations let you trace an unbroken architectural timeline from 2600 B.C. limestone to 14thcentury marble mosques within one week’s itinerary.

7. Nile Cruises, Culture on Cruise Control

Imagine waking to temple columns instead of city skylines. Modern riverboats (150–200 passengers) and intimate dahabiyas (10–16 guests) glide from Luxor to Aswan on itineraries that double as floating history seminars. Each afternoon, certified guides lead small groups through Kom Ombo or Edfu; evenings bring galabeya parties, cooking demos, or rooftop stargazing under skies unmarred by city light.

Why it clicks with Upstate travelers: If you enjoy pairing Seneca Lake wine cruises with Civil War history tours, a Nile cruise offers the same move-once-see-a-lot convenience—just add 4,000 extra years of backstory.

Ready to sail? Browse these Nile cruises, which feature luxury riverboats, boutique dahabiyas, and familyfriendly itineraries. These cruises include private tours led by certified Egyptologists, seamless air conditioned transfers to iconic attractions across Luxor and Aswan, and culturally immersive itineraries that blend historic insights with modern comforts.

8. Red Sea Resorts Keep Winter Water at 72–75°F

January in New York means sidewalks crunch with salt and wind bites. January in Hurghada means coral gardens sway under 73-degree water, and the hotel’s infinity pool is genuinely warm. Official sea temperature records place February averages at 22.2 °C / 72 °F, balmy enough for snorkelers, divers, and kite surfers chasing reliable wind.

Beyond the beach: desert yoga domes, thalassotherapy spas using salt harvested on-site, and camel-trek sunset dinners offer non-aquatic bliss.

9. Cairo’s Contemporary Art and Music Scene Hits Its Stride

While pharaohs steal headlines, Egypt’s creative class is busy reclaiming abandoned palaces and rooftops for jazz nights, design fairs, and film screenings. The Art Cairo fair held its sixth edition in February inside the Grand Egyptian Museum’s atrium, juxtaposing modern installations with 4,500 year-old statues. Rooftop bars in Garden City host weekly Afro-house DJs, while the Townhouse Gallery’s new satellite space doubles as a co-working hub for animators and podcast producers.

Traveler takeaway: Allocate at least one unstructured evening in Cairo. Ask your hotel concierge for the latest pop-up; the city’s creative calendar moves fast.

10. Fresh Archaeological Discoveries Every Season

Egypt is one of the few destinations where “newly opened” can describe a tomb carved in 1400 B.C. In January, archaeologists unearthed more than 1,000 vibrantly painted blocks from Queen Hatshepsut’s valley temple, alongside a limestone tablet naming her architect Senmut. Finds like these trigger temporary exhibitions, special access permits, and press tour discounts that travelers can tap within months.

Why it matters: Repeat visitors see something genuinely new each trip, rare in world heritage travel, where most attractions are static.

Sustainable Steps You Can Take

Fly economy or purchase SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) offsets when booking.

Carry a filtered water bottle; Egypt’s tap water is treated, and filters reduce singleuse plastic.

Choose a cruise that participates in Nile clean-up days and employs local staff above industry minimums.

Respect site capacity rules at tombs with fragile pigment (guides can suggest rotating tombs with equal artistry).

Final Word – the Joy of Contrast

Travel is partly about contrast: tasting flavors, hearing cadences, and seeing horizons that reset your sense of scale. Few countries deliver contrast like Egypt. One morning you’re tracing chisel marks inside a pyramid; that night you’re sipping pomegranate spritz on a Nile deck while Wi-Fi pings in the background. Add the favorable dollar, new museum buzz, and direct flights, and the equation tilts from “maybe someday” to “why not this year?”

This SAF book-and-claim pilot launch offers around 1 million gallons of SAF – enough to power almost 15,000 individual business traveler flights from London to New York.

The pilot phase of the program aims to demonstrate the credibility of the book-and-claim model, using blockchain technology to ensure secured allocation of SAF’s environmental attributes to companies and airlines after the fuel has been delivered into the fuel network.

Airlines and business customers could simultaneously reduce emissions in their respective scopes, while ensuring transparency and accountability by avoiding issues such as double-counting.

The software was developed by Shell and Accenture with the support of the Energy Web Foundation (EWF) and includes Amex GBT’s travel management services to aggregate global business demand for SAF, which will increase SAF supply and use and help accelerate the aviation industry’s pathway towards net-zero emissions.

“SAF is a key enabler of decarbonisation in the aviation industry, and it’s available today,” said Jan Toschka, President, Shell Aviation said in a statement. “However, it’s currently scarce and costs more than conventional jet fuel. Avelia will help trigger demand for SAF at scale, providing confidence to suppliers like us to further increase investment in production, and in turn helping to lower the price point for these fuels.”

The first customers are Shell, Accenture and Amex GBT. Shell committed to purchasing the environmental attributes equivalent to 100,000 gallons of SAF over the pilot phase of the Avelia program. Shell will increase this commitment as soon as more SAF is available, to achieve its ambition to abate 45% of Shell’s corporate travel emissions through SAF by 2030.

Sayangnya, tambah dia, sampai saat ini jelantah belum dimanfaatkan oleh negara, tetapi baru digunakan untuk bahan-bahan lokal yang lain seperti bahan pembuatan lilin, dan sebagainya. Berbagai upaya dilakukan untuk meningkatkan produksi minyak goreng. Sementara, pihaknya mengumpulkan minyak goreng bekas pakai sejak 2010.

Dia menambahkan, penting untuk mendorong adanya regulasi tentang tata kelola penanganan minyak goreng bekas atau jelantah.

“Menurut kami hal ini sangat penting, karena berhubungan dengan kesehatan lingkungan dan energi,” tegasnya dalam diskusi yang digelar Badan Riset dan Inovasi Nasional (BRIN) melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH).

Matias menilai perlu adanya pemetaan rantai pasok minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) dari hulu ke hilir dan mengidentifikasi tantangan dalam pengumpulannya.

Perlu juga mengidentifikasi inovasi teknologi pengumpulan, menyusun strategi untuk meningkatkan kapasitas pengumpulan, dan mendiskusikan potensi permintaan dan implementasi SAF.

“Kami menerima produk jelantah sebagai sumber penghasil UCO, terdiri dari rumah tangga dengan bank sampah atau langsung door to door. Sektor industri yang bergerak di bidang makan dan minuman, seperti hotel, restoran, dan cafe,” ujarnya dalam diskusi yang bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama tentang Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Selanjutnya ada UMKM dan kantin, imbuhnya, serta industri pertambangan. Ada juga pedagang kaki lima gorengan dalam penanganan sampah ampas penggorengannya, dan kerupuk/keripik yang kadaluwarsa.

Upaya memanfaatkan jelantah untuk energi terbarukan tak selalu berjalan mulus.

Matias menyampaikan berbagai tantangannya, seperti belum adanya regulasi sehingga dia dianggap melakukan penyalahgunaan. Ketidakpastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri dan pelaku usaha yang tidak terorganisasi dan ilegal.

“Untuk mengatasinya, kami memiliki strategi pengumpulan dengan melahirkan pelaku usaha yang teredukasi dan terorganisasi dari desa sampai provinsi.”

“Meningkatkan kegiatan sosialisasi kepada masyarakat, merangkul dan bersinergi dengan komunitas, organisasi masyarakat, Badan Usaha Milik Desa (Bumdes) atau daerah.

Clint Hardy, Daviess County’s extension agent for agriculture and natural resources, said a Phase One agreement in 2020 promised renewed Chinese purchases of American farm goods, but those commitments largely fell short, likely complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and broader diplomatic tensions.

According to the Associated Press, the U.S. Trade Representative’s office completed a review of Section 301 tariffs on China, recommending both keeping current tariffs and increasing some — including agricultural goods. China responded with threats of new retaliatory tariffs on American imports like soybeans, pork, and vehicles.

The trade war has intensified in recent weeks, with the Trump administration maintaining and in some cases increasing tariffs on Chinese goods, according to the Associated Press. Some rates on strategic products have risen sharply, and China has responded with retaliatory tariffs on American agricultural products. The standoff has disrupted supply chains and fueled concerns about a broader economic slowdown, the AP reports.

As of Thursday, the American Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers Association, and other groups had issued cautious statements urging the administration to avoid using farmers as bargaining chips in trade disputes.

In a state where agriculture plays a critical role in the economy, farmers say the impact could be severe.

Kentucky farmers, officials react

Caleb Ragland, a LaRue County farmer and president of the American Soybean Association, said soybeans are Kentucky’s top agricultural product by gross sales, and any disruption in global markets has far-reaching consequences.

“Soybeans were the largest grossing ag product produced in Kentucky last year,” Ragland said. “About 50% of U.S. soybeans are exported, and until the first trade war in 2018, China purchased more than half of those exports.”

Though exports rebounded somewhat in recent years, Ragland said the U.S. has never fully recovered its market share lost to Brazil and Argentina.

“At the worst of the trade war, U.S. soybean exports to China dropped to about 11%,” he said. “Even today, we’ve only regained about 25% — and we’ve lost a lot of ground we may never fully recover.”

Ripple effects beyond the farm

The consequences, Ragland said, stretch far beyond farms.

“A dollar earned in agriculture usually circulates six to eight times in a local economy,” he said. “It affects local businesses, restaurants, hardware stores, schools, churches — it touches everything.”

Hardy echoed those concerns. Hardy said tariffs don’t just affect commodities like soybeans and corn, but also raise the cost of critical supplies such as fertilizer, herbicides, and machinery parts, many of which are imported.

“When tariffs are placed on imported products farmers need, those extra costs are passed down,” Hardy said. “It raises the cost of production at the same time prices for their crops are falling.”

Farmers are already operating on razor-thin margins. According to Hardy, many made little to no profit in 2023, and expectations for 2025 remain bleak.

“There’s an underlying optimism about growing a good crop,” Hardy said. “But economically, there’s very little optimism about turning a profit.”

Stability in question

Agriculture Commissioner Jonathan Shell said that while the short-term situation is challenging, the current negotiations could ultimately lead to stronger and fairer global trade policies.

“There’s definitely opportunity for short-term pain,” Shell said, “but if we can realign ourselves with strong allies like India, Vietnam, and Australia, we’ll build more stable, long-term markets for our farmers.”

Shell said discussions are ongoing at the federal level about potential support for farmers, but no new subsidy programs tied directly to the China tariffs have been announced. He predicted that more market stability could emerge by this summer if new deals come together.

Still, Ragland urged caution about banking on distant promises.

“The farm economy isn’t strong right now,” he said. “Soybean prices are down about 40% from three years ago, while the cost of production continues to rise. We can’t wait two or three years for a solution — we need action now.”

Farmers are already seeing signs of strain, Ragland added, with some in the state either exiting the business or significantly downsizing.

“We’ve had folks auction off equipment or semi-retire because they can’t cash flow anymore,” he said. “Higher input costs, lower revenue — it’s a bad combination.”

Challenges ahead

While some officials hope to expand domestic consumption through biofuels like ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel, Ragland said those initiatives will take years — and billions of dollars of investment — to materialize.

“You don’t just snap your fingers and double the demand for corn and soybeans domestically,” he said.

Hardy agreed, noting that while domestic demand programs are essential, they can’t fully replace lost export markets overnight.

“We’ve got to figure out how to use more of what we grow here, but it will take time,” Hardy said.

Meanwhile, the immediate threat of widespread asset liquidation looms. Shell said losing more farmland at a faster rate is a real risk if prices don’t improve soon.

“If we don’t stabilize markets, farmers will be forced to sell land or go out of business,” Shell said. “And once farmland is sold, it’s hard to get back.”

He added that it’s a two-pronged strategy at work: rebalancing trade partnerships abroad while investing heavily to grow domestic consumption of agricultural products.

“We have to start consuming more here domestically, whether that be in biofuels, feeding more livestock, or increasing what we do with soybeans and canolas,” Shell said. “The Trump administration is trying to ignite that American consumption spirit, and that’s happening through new programs and investments.”

Hardy said farmers must continue adapting as best they can, but volatility is likely to remain.

“It’s really difficult to make decisions right now,” he said. “Commodity prices, input costs, interest rates—they’re all moving targets.”

Ragland said he remains hopeful — but realistic.

“We need a trade deal, and we need it soon,” he said. “Otherwise, there won’t be many farmers left to benefit from it.”",https://cdn.owensborotimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/OT-China-Trade-War-AG-1024x536.png,N,,2025-04-19 01:56:25.477918

In this video, Rosie Barnes discusses the state of the aviation industry and its challenges related to carbon emissions, particularly focusing on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The aviation sector contributes to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, but its climate warming impact is approximately 4% when accounting for non-CO2 factors, such as contrails. The current aviation fuel, refined kerosene, has remained unchanged for decades. The necessity for an alternative fuel that can be used with existing aircraft engines is crucial for achieving net-zero emissions in aviation.

SAF, produced from renewable biomass, offers an approach that can directly replace fossil fuels without requiring new aircraft designs. The HEFA process, which utilizes waste oils and fats, is currently the leading method for SAF production, providing significant yields while facing challenges in scaling due to increased feedstock demand.

""I wouldn't have gone. Too environmentally selfish,"" one commenter wrote. Another added, ""Say it to all private jet owners.""

According to PBS, the aviation industry contributes 4% of global carbon pollution. The heat-trapping gases generated by private jets, which jumped 46% from 2019 to 2023, accounts for nearly half of the aviation industry's total. Flying private takes a big toll on the environment.

Those who fly privately include influencers, CEOs, and world leaders, all of whom deliberately choose private flights despite the environmental costs.

However, one study revealed that flights with few or even no passengers do happen because planes need to return to their home bases. That might be what happened here.

Alternative methods of travel that are less wasteful than flying privately — or flying in general — include carpooling, electric vehicles, and public transportation. This helps reduce heat-trapping gas pollution. In the case of EVs, they produce zero tailpipe emissions.

If you must fly, opt for airlines that actively incorporate sustainable aviation fuel and choose direct, nonstop flights to minimize your environmental impact.

Salah satu strategi utama untuk mewujudkannya adalah melalui transisi dari bahan bakar fosil (avtur) ke Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—bahan bakar terbarukan yang lebih ramah lingkungan.

SAF diprediksi mampu mengurangi emisi karbon dioksida (CO₂) hingga 718 Mega Ton pada 2050, sekaligus memenuhi permintaan global yang diperkirakan mencapai 449 Miliar Liter per tahun.

Indonesia, dengan potensi bahan baku terbarukan yang melimpah, memiliki peluang besar untuk menjadi pemain utama dalam pengembangan SAF.

Peta Jalan SAF Indonesia: Tiga Pilar Utama

Pemerintah Indonesia telah menyusun strategi pengembangan SAF dengan tiga tujuan utama:

Dekarbonisasi Sektor Penerbangan

SAF diharapkan menjadi solusi utama dalam mengurangi emisi karbon industri aviasi, mendukung komitmen nasional dan global dalam penurunan emisi gas rumah kaca.

Kedaulatan Energi

Dengan memanfaatkan bahan baku domestik seperti minyak sawit, minyak jelantah, dan limbah pertanian, Indonesia dapat mengurangi ketergantungan pada impor bahan bakar fosil sekaligus memperkuat kemandirian energi.

Penciptaan Nilai Ekonomi

Pengembangan SAF tidak hanya mendukung lingkungan, tetapi juga membuka peluang ekonomi melalui hilirisasi bahan baku, ekspor, dan peningkatan investasi di sektor energi terbarukan.

Tantangan dalam Produksi SAF di Indonesia

Meski potensinya besar, produksi SAF di Indonesia masih menghadapi sejumlah kendala. Metode utama yang digunakan saat ini adalah Hydro-processed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), dengan bahan baku Palm Kernel Oil (PKO) yang masih menimbulkan kontroversi terkait dampak lingkungan.

Oleh karena itu, penelitian dan pengembangan (R&D) untuk menemukan bahan baku alternatif yang lebih berkelanjutan terus dilakukan.

Dua bahan baku potensial yang sedang dikembangkan adalah Used Cooking Oil (UCO) atau minyak jelantah—limbah rumah tangga dan industri yang dapat didaur ulang—serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD), produk sampingan dari industri kelapa sawit.

Keberlanjutan dalam Produksi SAF

Produksi SAF tidak hanya berfokus pada pengurangan emisi, tetapi juga harus memenuhi prinsip keberlanjutan.

Beberapa manfaat utamanya meliputi pengurangan emisi gas rumah kaca, penurunan ketergantungan pada bahan bakar fosil, penerapan ekonomi sirkular, peningkatan kualitas udara lokal, dukungan terhadap pembangunan berkelanjutan, serta pemenuhan regulasi dan tuntutan pasar global.

Untuk memastikan produksi SAF benar-benar ramah lingkungan, diperlukan pendekatan komprehensif seperti Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Metode ini mengevaluasi dampak lingkungan dari suatu produk atau proses, mulai dari ekstraksi bahan baku hingga pembuangan akhir.

Manfaat dan Tantangan Penerapan LCA

LCA membantu mengidentifikasi dampak lingkungan di setiap tahap produksi, meningkatkan efisiensi penggunaan sumber daya, memastikan kepatuhan terhadap regulasi lingkungan, serta memberikan dasar ilmiah untuk pengambilan keputusan strategis terkait investasi dan kebijakan.

Meski manfaatnya besar, penerapan LCA masih terkendala oleh ketersediaan data yang akurat, kompleksitas rantai pasok bahan baku, biaya dan waktu analisis yang tinggi, serta belum adanya standar dan regulasi yang.

Masa Depan SAF dengan Pendekatan LCA

LCA memberikan kerangka kerja penting untuk memastikan produksi SAF berjalan secara berkelanjutan. Dengan pendekatan ini, industri penerbangan dapat mengidentifikasi metode produksi yang paling efisien dan ramah lingkungan.

Hasil kajian LCA juga menjadi dasar bagi pemerintah dan pelaku industri dalam menyusun kebijakan, menarik investasi, dan mengembangkan inovasi teknologi.

Seperti disampaikan oleh Arif Rahman (Postdoc BRIN 2023-2025), integrasi LCA dalam pengambilan keputusan akan memastikan industri penerbangan bergerak menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.

Dengan komitmen kuat dan kolaborasi antar pemangku kepentingan, Indonesia dapat menjadi pemain kunci dalam pasar SAF global sekaligus berkontribusi pada target Net Zero Emission 2050.

Namun, siapa sangka, Indonesia justru memiliki potensi jelantah terbaik di dunia yang bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai bahan baku energi terbarukan, seperti Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Hal ini diungkapkan oleh Ketua Asosiasi Pengumpul Jelantah untuk Energi Baru Terbarukan Indonesia (APJETI), Matias Tumanggor, dalam Workshop Rantai Pasok Minyak Jelantah Berkelanjutan untuk SAF yang digelar di Gedung BJ Habibie, Jakarta, Rabu, 16 April 2025, seperti dilansir dari laman resmi BRIN.

Menurut Matias, kualitas jelantah Indonesia menempati peringkat pertama dunia berkat bahan bakunya yang sebagian besar berasal dari minyak nabati, yang digunakan oleh sektor hotel, restoran, dan kafe di dalam negeri. “Karena mengikuti asas halal, 95% bahan yang digunakan berasal dari minyak nabati. Ini juga yang diakui oleh mitra luar negeri,” ujarnya.

Sayangnya, meskipun potensinya sangat besar, pemanfaatan jelantah di dalam negeri masih minim. Sebagian besar jelantah hanya dimanfaatkan untuk produk lokal seperti lilin dan sabun. Padahal bahan ini bisa menjadi komoditas strategis untuk bahan bakar ramah lingkungan. APJETI sendiri telah menginisiasi pengumpulan jelantah sejak 2010. Semakin hari, produksi maupun kesadaran masyarakat terus meningkat.

Matias menyoroti absennya regulasi nasional yang mengatur secara khusus tentang tata kelola minyak jelantah. Ini menyebabkan kegiatan pengumpulan masih dianggap ilegal atau menyalahgunakan bahan limbah. Padahal pengelolaan yang baik berpotensi menyelamatkan lingkungan sekaligus menjadi sumber energi bersih.

“Kami ingin dilibatkan dalam penyusunan regulasi karena ini menyangkut kesehatan, lingkungan, dan masa depan energi,” katanya.

Matias menjelaskan bahwa pengumpulan jelantah dilakukan dari berbagai sektor, mulai dari rumah tangga (melalui bank sampah atau sistem door-to-door), usaha makanan-minuman seperti hotel dan restoran, hingga UMKM, kantin, pedagang kaki lima, serta industri pertambangan. Bahkan, mereka juga menangani limbah penggorengan dari gorengan hingga kerupuk kadaluarsa.

Namun begitu, tantangan yang dihadapi tidak sedikit. Mulai dari tidak adanya kepastian pemanfaatan dalam negeri, belum adanya pembinaan kepada pelaku usaha kecil, hingga masih maraknya pengumpulan oleh pihak yang tidak terorganisir secara legal.

Untuk menjawab tantangan tersebut, APJETI telah menyiapkan sejumlah strategi: mendorong lahirnya pelaku usaha teredukasi dari desa hingga provinsi, melakukan sosialisasi masif ke masyarakat, bekerja sama dengan komunitas dan organisasi lokal, serta menggandeng BUMDes dan pemerintah daerah dalam memperluas wilayah pengumpulan hingga ke pelosok desa.

Workshop ini digelar oleh BRIN melalui Pusat Riset Sistem Produksi Berkelanjutan dan Penilaian Daur Hidup (PRSPBPDH), bekerja sama dengan PT Noovoleum Indonesia Investama, dengan pendekatan analisis Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).

Melalui kegiatan ini, diharapkan lahir sinergi antara pemangku kepentingan untuk membangun rantai pasok minyak jelantah yang berkelanjutan dan efisien.

This now means that all Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites around the world are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

During the course of 2025, all Airbus commercial aircraft delivery centers around the world will offer SAF to customers for ferry flights. This year alone, in 2025, over 600,000 litres of SAF with a 30% blend are expected to be used at the Airbus Mirabel site resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 400 metric tons.

Benoît Schultz, CEO Airbus Canada said, “On average, SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. This substantial reduction is crucial to the industry’s progress towards decarbonisation by 2050. It’s a big milestone to now have our Mirabel site in Canada, as SAF capable as our other Airbus sites. It not only means we can test our A220 aircraft using SAF, but we will also be able to deliver them to our customers with SAF too.”

In 2024, 18% of Airbus global fuel mix for the year was SAF. That’s more than 16 million litres of neat SAF. Alongside this, 75% of our aircraft worldwide were delivered with SAF, representing also the importance our customers are placing on decarbonisation.

Management of SAF in Mirabel will be done using the mass balance principle. Once the SAF has been transported and delivered to Airbus Canada, it is blended with the conventional aviation fuel (CAF) also known as Jet-A1 in the Mirabel site’s fuel farm. The dilution of CAF and SAF in the fuel tanks is allowed through established standards and auditable bookkeeping. Airbus Canada has the ambition to deliver SAF Proof of Sustainability (PoS) to A220 customers receiving their aircraft from Mirabel in 2025. SAF has been used in A220 aircraft delivered from our A220 Mobile Final Assembly Line since 2016.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A220 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be capable of operating with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

The Airbus site in Mirabel is over 1.5 million square feet and includes, among others, a pre-final assembly line (pre-FAL), two final assembly lines (FAL), a customer response centre (CRC), a flight and integration test centre (FITC), and a brand new delivery centre. Over 3,500 Airbus employees work at this location.

Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.
The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits.
“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.","Research from The Nature Conservancy found current clean energy tax credits, if kept in place through 2032 would add more than $238 million in annual economic value to Iowa.

Some folks fear the tax credits will be slashed by congressional leaders as they stare down hefty budget cuts and eye Biden-era environmental policies, but advocates of the clean energy credits say they are essential to reaching American energy dominance.

The study looked at clean energy tax credits impacting transportation, power generation, industry and buildings. Those categories comprise sectors from renewable vehicle fuels, to carbon sequestration, to home solar installations and electric vehicles.

Amber Markham, director of external affairs and climate for The Nature Conservancy, said most of these tax credits were established with bipartisan support, but are under attack by Republican officials because they were extended by the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act.

“Rather than just lumping them all together and throwing them out, because somehow it seems like it’s an environmental thing … we need to really, take not a sledgehammer approach, but a scalpel approach, and go in and look at each of them and their impact and what makes the most sense to keep and support.”

According to the study, the tax credits in the power category, followed by the industry category, account for the greatest share of annual economic value added to Iowa.

Markham said cutting the tax credits now would be like “pulling the rug out from under” the individuals, business owners and industries that have already invested in this technology with the expectation of the tax credits.

Monte Shaw, executive director of Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, said this is true for ethanol facilities in Iowa, which he said have invested “tens of millions of dollars” to be able to receive 45z tax credits for manufacturing sustainable aviation fuel.

“That is why we’re fighting so hard to push back against the people who (want to) rip it out,” Shaw said. “These facilities made good faith investments based on the law of the land.”

Conversely, opponents of the carbon pipeline projects in Iowa are gathering signatures on a petition, specifically urging Senators Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley to cut the 45Q tax credits, which incentivize the carbon sequestration pipelines.

IRFA and other commodity groups associated with the ethanol industry have been pushing for final guidance on the 45z program, which Shaw said would said is “the best tool” to “maximize the Midwest contribution to American energy dominance.”

A comment period for 45z guidance closed April 10. Shaw said the association asked for a long term extension of the program and for the inclusion of the climate smart agriculture practices. He said the climate smart agriculture practices program would help the ethanol facilities meet the low emission standards it needs to qualify for 45z, and it would allow farmers to compete in a global market by quantifying the carbon impacts of regenerative farming practices.

Shaw said it seems like the president doesn’t care about the impacts these tax credits have on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but he should care about the economic benefits they represent to the country.

“If you want to get to American energy dominance, this is a tool that’s right here, in law, that can be implemented aggressively, that will achieve your American energy dominance goals,” Shaw said, speaking specifically about 45z.

Another study, released by the Clean Energy Buyers Association, found that residential energy prices in the U.S. would increase by nearly 7% in 2026 if the tax credits were done away with.

Markham with TNC said renewable energy needs to be in the mix to meet American energy demand, which is expected to increase by at least 2% each year in 2025 and 2026.

“We know that more energy is needed across our nation, so it’s not an either or, it’s an all of the above approach that we need to be taking,” Markham said.

U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa is one of a group of GOP lawmakers advocating for the energy tax credits. Miller-Meeks testified in favor of the credits, in the House Ways and Means Committee, urging her colleagues to develop an “any of the above” strategy to meet energy demands.

“Our energy sector faces significant challenges that demand bold action,” Miller-Meeks said.

She noted the Inflation Reduction Act of the previous administration created some “important energy tax credits that are already driving transformative investments across the U.S. energy sector.”

Miller-Meeks, along with 20 other Republican lawmakers wrote to the House Ways and Means Committee Chair, Rep. Jason Smith, R-MO, asking that any changes to energy tax credits be done in a “pragmatic fashion” without “undoing” programs that are already promoting energy innovation and lowering utility costs.

Markham said the environmental group was grateful for the support of the Iowa representative.

“We need more Republicans to stand up and support these clean energy tax credits, specifically because they are bipartisan, they always have been, until now,” Markham said.

The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a budget resolution April 10, just before leaving for a spring recess, that will allow both chambers to work on a reconciliation package upon their return. Per the adopted resolution, Congress must make $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/solar-panels.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 19:57:01.090305

Let’s not sugar-coat it. Decarbonising aviation is like retrofitting a B777 mid-flight. With IATA pledging net zero by 2050 and passengers increasingly judging airlines by their sustainability credentials, we all know the target. The question is how to get there while keeping fleets profitable, passengers happy, and regulators at bay.

There are five main aviation decarbonisation levers in play. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and realities. None will work alone. But together, they form the foundation for the sector’s transformation.

Here’s how it breaks down for those of us who live and breathe aviation.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Ready-Now Solution

SAF is the most immediate decarbonisation lever available. Drop-in compatible, no need to redesign engines or build new aircraft. It reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 80 percent. The catch is supply and price. Production volumes are low and prices are high, but ReFuelEU mandates are creating a new market dynamic.

Hemp is emerging as an unexpected but serious SAF feedstock. It grows fast, thrives on marginal land, and delivers high oil yields for conversion. Some airports are already evaluating local SAF loops using hemp grown on-site. It’s not science fiction, it’s supply chain resilience.

Electrification: Ideal for Short-Haul, Not Quite There for Long-Haul

Electric aircraft are progressing fast, but energy density remains the bottleneck. They will soon serve short regional routes, offering zero-emission alternatives where infrastructure allows. The potential impact on noise and air quality is massive, especially for airports near urban centres.

However, don’t bet the long-haul strategy on batteries just yet. The technology curve is steep and promising, but physics still matters. Expect hybrid electric systems to play a bridging role in the near term.

Hydrogen: Huge Promise, Huge Infrastructure Challenge

Hydrogen propulsion is a gamechanger in theory. It delivers high energy per kilogram and emits only water. In practice, it requires entirely new aircraft designs and airport infrastructure. From cryogenic storage to fuelling logistics, it is a ground-up rebuild.

Still, OEMs like Airbus are putting real capital into hydrogen concepts. If renewables power the hydrogen production, the emissions savings are unbeatable. But the commercial rollout is likely closer to 2040 than 2030.

Operational Efficiencies: The Underrated Powerhouse

This is the decarbonisation lever with the most immediate impact and the least risk. Better flight planning, optimised climb and descent profiles, single-engine taxiing, and improved ATC coordination all reduce emissions without touching the aircraft design.

New data platforms are enhancing operational decisions in real time. One approach is to use predictive analytics and AI-driven dashboards to constantly identify fuel-saving opportunities. Think fewer delays, less holding, and smarter routings. It is a win for emissions, passengers, and the bottom line.

Carbon Removals: The Necessary Clean-Up Crew

Even in the most optimistic scenario, residual emissions will remain. This is where carbon removal enters the flight path. The key is using removal rather than avoidance. Nature-based solutions like hemp carbon capture can sequester emissions and lock them into biomass and infrastructure materials.

Passengers are starting to expect credible offsetting options. The challenge is to integrate removals seamlessly into their experience without compromising trust or transparency. Platforms now exist to embed this into the booking flow and loyalty systems, offering verifiable removals without greenwashing.

Pulling It Together: From Aspirational to Operational Aviation Decarbonisation Levers

These aviation decarbonisation levers are not hypothetical. They are deployable today in varying degrees. The trick is in combining them strategically. Think SAF adoption supported by data-driven operational efficiency. Think hydrogen development paired with airport infrastructure planning. Think real-time carbon removal embedded into customer engagement.

At Tao Climate, we support this integrated approach. Through tools that enhance operational performance, provide access to scalable SAF feedstock, and build trust in carbon removals, we help aviation stakeholders align with both climate targets and commercial realities.

There is no silver bullet. But there is a clear flight path to net zero. With collaboration, smart investment, and a willingness to innovate, the industry can continue to connect the world without overheating it.

One Last Thought

Decarbonisation is not a marketing exercise. It is a systems challenge that rewards precision and punishes delay. By leveraging these aviation decarbonisation levers in the right order, aviation can lead on climate—not just comply.

The resolution, passed during the Thirty-third Legislative Session, outlines Hawaii’s commitment to sustainable development by endorsing legally binding international efforts that address the full life cycle of plastics, from design and production to disposal and reuse. It also signals a growing alignment between Pacific Island jurisdictions and the broader global environmental governance landscape.

Addressing the Triple Planetary Crisis

The resolution explicitly recognizes the urgency of the “triple planetary crisis” as defined by the United Nations: climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. As a state uniquely vulnerable to climate-induced sea-level rise and marine degradation, Hawaii is reinforcing its leadership role in the Pacific by promoting sustainable, culturally relevant, and science-based solutions.

Lawmakers emphasized the ecological, cultural, and economic value of the Pacific Ocean—Moananuiākea—to indigenous communities and future generations. The resolution acknowledges the central role of indigenous knowledge, local leadership, women, and youth in ocean stewardship and climate resilience.

Alignment with the United Nations Global Plastics Treaty

The United Nations Global Plastics Treaty, currently under development, seeks to establish global standards for plastic production, consumption, and waste management. The Hawaii resolution affirms the need for binding commitments that:

Phase out high-risk plastic products, including single-use items and unnecessary packaging;

Standardize plastic product design to reduce consumption and facilitate reuse;

Improve chemical transparency, traceability, and hazard regulation across the plastic value chain;

Support a circular economy, prioritizing non-toxic reuse systems;

And ensure a just transition for workers and communities affected by systemic changes in the plastics economy.

Notably, the treaty’s benchmarks include a 30% reduction in plastic packaging over a 12-year period, beginning with an initial 10% reduction by 2027—standards that Hawaii aims to mirror through local regulatory and incentive-based strategies.

Supporting the Rapa Nui Summit Declaration

The resolution also references the Rapa Nui Pacific Leaders Summit Declaration, which emerged from a regional summit held on Easter Island. The declaration identifies key priorities for reducing plastic and microplastic pollution across the Pacific and emphasizes the integration of indigenous wisdom with scientific research.

Operationalizing the Resolution: Local Implications

The resolution outlines a series of goals and policy considerations for Hawaii, including:

Establishing economic incentives aligned with the Zero Waste Hierarchy;

Advancing chemical monitoring and quality control measures;

Promoting extended producer responsibility (EPR) frameworks;

And safeguarding waste pickers and vulnerable workers through inclusive, rights-based transition mechanisms.

Further, the resolution calls for Hawaii to increase participation in UN-led climate, development, and human rights processes, reinforcing the state’s commitment to environmental governance that prioritizes both planetary and human health.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250417-093326-eca-Beautiful%20Picture%20of%20Hawaii%20.jpg,N,,2025-04-18 16:56:37.309148
