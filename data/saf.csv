The dream of a cleaner, more sustainable aviation sector is fast becoming a reality with the growing adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—particularly those derived from used cooking oil (UCO). SAF represents a crucial innovation in the global effort to reduce the aviation industry’s environmental impact.

SAF is a biofuel that can be blended with conventional jet fuel, offering a significantly lower carbon footprint without requiring any major modifications to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. Depending on the feedstock and production method, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel.

Recognizing aviation’s contribution to global emissions—2.5% of the world’s energy-related CO₂ emissions in 2023—the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and national governments are pushing for broader SAF adoption. The European Union and the UK, for instance, have begun requiring that jet fuel contains at least 2% SAF starting in 2025, with that number set to rise gradually over the next 15 years.

One of the most promising feedstocks for SAF is waste oil, especially UCO. When compared to biofuels made from agricultural commodities like soy or palm oil, UCO-based SAF avoids competition with food crops and helps prevent deforestation, making it a truly circular and responsible solution.

Countries like Malaysia, one of the world’s largest producers of UCO and virgin palm oil, are playing a key role in this green transition. A recent initiative there rewards volunteers with up to $21 per litre for turning in used cooking oil. Companies like Evergreen Oil & Feed, which operates UCO collection centers, are supplying this crucial feedstock to European SAF producers such as Spain’s Repsol, UK-based Shell, and Finland’s Neste.

Major airline groups like the International Airlines Group (IAG)—parent company of British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and LEVEL—are already purchasing SAF with green certification from jet fuel suppliers, signaling a strong commitment to low-carbon aviation.

Despite its potential, SAF still faces hurdles: primarily in terms of production scale and cost. However, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF is expected to contribute to 65% of emissions reductions needed for the aviation sector to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

The journey toward greener air travel has taken off—and with collective action from governments, industries, and individuals, SAF could be the fuel that powers a cleaner future for aviation.",https://indianpsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/British-Airway.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:04:43.124115

The Trough of Disillusionment

The Gartner Hype Cycle tracks the five key phases of a technology’s life cycle. Following the ‘Technology Trigger’ with significant media interest and the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’ which sees scores of failures, the sector moves into the ‘Trough of Disillusionment’ where interest wanes. Later, following investment in promising ideas, the industry reaches the ‘Slope of Enlightenment’ and the ‘Plateau of Productivity.’ (Wayne J Davis/RAeS)

The Gartner Hype Cycle might have its detractors, but its memorable descriptors often resonate as we follow the progress of technologies towards commercial success.

Aviation sustainability, while not a technology as such, has certainly followed a familiar path in recent years and, therefore, when Mark Westwood, Professor of Aeronautics at Cranfield University, says he thinks we are heading into Gartner’s ‘Trough of Disillusionment’, it is not hard to see what is driving that view.

Westwood is, however, keen to emphasise that he does not actually feel disillusioned. “It’s a part of the technology development life cycle,” he explains, “what you see playing out is the enthusiasm of engineers and scientists hitting the cold, hard facts of physics and economics.”

As the aviation industry started to recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, there was an acceleration of interest in developing new technologies and strategies to enable the sector to meet net zero 2050. More radical technologies, such as hydrogen-fuelled aircraft enabling true zero emissions flight, buoyed by government investment, went from being principally hypothetical case studies happening in academia to industry-led research programmes firmly focused on practical implementation.

Projects developing hydrogen-fuelled propulsion technologies over the last few years have ranged from start-ups and small companies focused on powertrains initially suitable for retrofit into existing small aircraft to the Airbus ZEROe programme with the ambition to develop new airliners. However, since their inception around 2020, many of these projects have struck headwinds – Universal Hydrogen shut down in 2024 after failing to find adequate funding and Project Fresson and ZeroAvia have both seen delays to planned key milestones.

Hydrogen hold-ups

Is future flight powered by hydrogen? (Lufthansa Technik)

A further blow to the industry’s hydrogen ambitions came in February this year, when Airbus announced that its previous plan to launch a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in 2035 would be pushed back by five to ten years. Airbus’ announcement also drew attention to the required infrastructure and ecosystem required to support hydrogen aircraft, which is possibly a bigger challenge than the aircraft technology itself, and is not wholly within the aerospace sector’s control.

Nonetheless, Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, believes that hydrogen will play a significant role in aviation. “It’s probably been pushed a little bit to the right,” he explains, “but I would expect it to play a part to 2050 and to expand significantly beyond then.”

The harsh realities of these delays to the introduction of hydrogen aircraft, particularly those of a larger size, is that the technology is likely to offer only a minimal contribution towards net zero before 2050.

In commercial aviation, regional and smaller aircraft account for less than 10% of emissions, with the rest coming from single-aisle and widebody aircraft. However, based on recent news, hydrogen-fuelled versions of these larger aircraft do not seem likely to come into service at all before 2050. Of the small proportion of emissions which might be addressed by first-generation regional hydrogen aircraft before 2050, it will only be feasible to address a fraction of them due to the slow timeline of fleet replacement in aviation.

According to Cirium data, in 2024, only 34% of the global fleet was comprised of the latest generation of aircraft (Airbus A320neo family, A350, Boeing 737 MAX and 787). These aircraft first came into service between 2011 and 2017, yet still represent only just over a third of the fleet, clearly demonstrating the limited impact that yet-to-be-developed new hydrogen aircraft could have before 2050. Furthermore, the environmental benefit of resolving supply chain issues and accelerating deliveries of current state-of-the-art aircraft, which are typically 10-20% more efficient than the aircraft they replace, should not be underestimated.

The SAF dilemma

SAF has the potential to provide a fast route to decarbonisation but its production at scale has problems, regardless of the source of the fuel. (ATR)

Thankfully, decarbonising aviation is not solely reliant on radical new aircraft technologies and the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a major contributor to reaching net zero for the sector in all potential roadmaps. SAF certainly has the potential to provide a faster route to decarbonisation than anything that relies on the introduction of new aircraft, given that it can be used in the existing fleet, albeit as a blend or with some additives to make it a drop-in fuel.

However, although SAF is an effective means of reducing emissions from aviation, its production at scale seems to give rise to controversy, regardless of the source of the fuel. For Tony Henley, Chair of the RAeS Environmental Sustainability Co-ordination Group, considering SAF derived from waste, the challenge is the availability of the feedstock in sufficient quantities. “Waste-derived SAF will give you a few percent of what you need, but it isn’t going to solve the problem,” he explains, adding that a lot of waste is currently used elsewhere in other industries and diverting it to aviation will serve only to transfer the problem to different sectors.

When it comes to plant-based SAF, “you’re either taking agricultural land which is already in short supply (and climate change is making it scarcer still)… so you’re immediately threatening people’s food supplies. If you don’t use agricultural land…then you’re turning vast uncultivated areas into monocultures, so you’re massively denting biodiversity”. Henley also flags the cost and effort of using this marginal land which is typically unused due to the difficulty of cultivation.

This leaves Power-to-Liquid SAF, where captured carbon is combined with green hydrogen to form synthetic kerosene. On paper it has the potential to reduce the net emissions more than the other options but, as Henley explains, “the only problem is that you need a massive amount of energy to get those raw materials and then combine them into a usable fuel.” He continues: “That’s got to be the way to go … but unless we massively increase the amount of green electricity, it’s not viable.”

However, despite these challenges, McCourt is optimistic about the ability of industry to scale up SAF production, “where there’s a will and a commercial interest to do so.”

The need for green energy

Despite flying a demonstrator aircraft, Universal Hydrogen failed to find adequate funding and closed in 2024. (Universal Hydrogen)

It is notable that both Henley and Westwood, when asked what they see as the biggest barriers to reaching net zero 2050 for aviation, identify the reliance on cheap renewable energy as a significant risk. Increasing the supply of green energy is not something which falls within the purview of the aerospace sector and will be heavily reliant on government policy if it is to be achieved. In recent months, however, UK politicians across the parties have seemingly been pulling back from the commitment to reaching net zero by 2050. Although it currently remains government policy, it does not seem inconceivable that the current policy may be diluted or delayed. This will have knock-on impacts on all the industries reliant on developments such as renewable energy or greenhouse gas removals and require national and global coordination and support. It is also yet to be determined how the recent US move away from climate action might affect global efforts to address the issue. Furthermore, Westwood suggests that the current geopolitical landscape is likely to drive increased defence spending in many countries, putting pressure on budgets, potentially at the cost of spending on environmental initiatives.

There is also the growing realisation that net zero is an expensive objective, not least for aviation, and one that consumers seem reluctant to pay for. Recent research by the RAeS into public attitudes to decarbonisation (see ‘Would you pay more to decarbonise your flight?’ AEROSPACE April 2025) suggested only a little over a third of passengers might be willing to pay more for a greener flight and, as Westwood says, “It’s very difficult to see how alternatives to kerosene will be cheaper.”

With the aerospace sector seeming unlikely to branch out into renewable energy generation (except perhaps on a small scale at airports to support ground operations), SAF petrochemical processes or greenhouse gas removal technology, their role in the development and scale-up of these out-of-sector enablers for aviation net zero seems best suited to that of an intelligent customer – clearly articulating the demand, opportunities and implications but not acting directly.

Ever more efficient

Recent cuts to NASA’s budget have contributed to Boeing’s decision to pause work on the joint Transonic Truss-Braced Wing demonstrator project. (NASA)

Where then should industry be focusing its internal efforts? Accepting that the best fuel is the fuel you do not use, should we be concentrating on developing the next generation of conventional aircraft, pursuing further efficiency improvements for SAF-fuelled aircraft to lighten the demand on renewable energy for SAF production?

Westwood thinks this is an important element of industry’s drive towards net zero: “I’d like to see both of those companies [Airbus and Boeing] focusing really heavily on what’s the absolute best we could do with the technologies we’ve got. Maybe it flies slightly slower, it’s lighter, it’s got even better aerodynamic performance or optimised structures – what’s the best that we could possibly do if these high-risk technologies don’t come off?”

Research from the UK’s Aerospace Technology Institute suggests that the next generation of single-aisle and widebody aircraft, using only relatively mature technology improvements could see a 15-20% reduction in fuel burn, compared to current aircraft.

It certainly seems as though the technology exists for a new highly efficient aircraft, which could contribute significantly to net zero, even if the idea does not generate the levels of hype and enthusiasm that new fuels and radical aircraft designs do. Furthermore, both aircraft and engine OEMs are working on more ambitious developments, such as extremely high-aspect ratio wings and open rotor engine configurations. However, the recent announcement of a draft budget for NASA which eliminates all “green aviation” programmes must be bad news for Boeing, which has already paused work on its X-66 Sustainable Flight Demonstrator project.

However, neither Airbus nor Boeing seem particularly inclined to launch new aircraft development programmes imminently. Indications a few years ago were that they might target a new single-aisle aircraft entering service in the mid-2030s with a larger aircraft following later but, as previously explored, waiting that long will mean the impact before 2050 is much reduced due to the slow rate of fleet replacement, which is unlikely to change due to the economics for airlines.

It is economics, or rather the business case, which seems to be lacking in terms of encouraging the airframers to act sooner. At the end of 2024, Airbus had an order backlog of 8,658 aircraft, while Boeing’s backlog stood at 5,595. Having such a solid order book with their existing production aircraft, the investment required to develop a new aircraft and the inherent risk associated with it, must seem both unnecessary and unappealing, even if it might bring environmental benefits. “I think we’re being naïve if we think they’re going to have environmental sustainability as their primary focus,” says Westwood. “I have no doubt both organisations are well-intentioned but they’ve got businesses to run.”

Is net zero by 2050 achievable?

The future of airline flight? (Airbus)

With delays to radical new technologies, the replacement of the fleet with more efficient conventional aircraft seeming likely to take decades and SAF and greenhouse gas removals reliant on uncertain global government action, is 2050 an achievable timeline for reaching net zero for the sector? Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, certainly seems not to think so, having recently stated that he believes the industry will need to review its targets.

“My view would be that we should not focus on 2050,” says Westwood. “It’s just a line in the sand. The best solution [for aviation] might not be the one that gives you the most reduction in emissions at the 2050 point.”

McCourt, however, favours continuing to target net zero 2050 and believes it is an achievable goal. “The balance of various technologies that deliver net zero will probably change beyond 2050, but I still think it’s right that we have a target.”

Henley has a similar perspective: “Net zero in 2050 might not be possible, but getting a lot closer to net zero by 2050 than we are at the moment is worth having.”

Despite challenges, there seems to be no hesitation over the importance of pushing towards net zero, even if the target of 2050 is in question. However, with the challenges and uncertainties that exist, and which are becoming more apparent, it does not seem too much of a stretch to say that we are indeed on the downward slope to the Trough of Disillusionment – both in relation to the novel technologies that remain a key component to emission-free flight but also for aviation sustainability as a whole.

Catchy labels aside, as Westwood says: “You can convince yourself it is all impossible, but it doesn’t really mean we should divert from what we’re doing. The drivers, the reasons for doing it, haven’t gone away. It’s just recognising that it is more difficult, but the direction [we are moving in] is the right direction.”",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26872/zeroe-demonstrator.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 07:05:06.177985

US President Donald J. Trump swept into office on a mission to throttle back activity in the nation’s booming renewable energy industries, but the hits just keep on coming. The latest development involves the massive new Project Roadrunner e-fuels facility in Reeves County, Texas, near Pecos. The developer, US-based Infinium, aims to replace conventional jet fuel with a new concoction formulated from green hydrogen and captured carbon.

Follow The Money To E-Fuels

If you’re wondering why Texas is a good location for an SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) operation, that’s a good question. After all, Texas is a longstanding epicenter of US oil and gas production. However, Texas has also become a leading wind and solar producer in the US, and thus a suitable environment for green hydrogen producers. Unlike conventional hydrogen extracted from natural gas, green hydrogen is jolted loose from water in electrolysis systems powered by renewable energy.

With its copious footprint in various industrial operations, Texas also produces a large amount of capture-able carbon, along with the infrastructure needed to transport fuels from one place to another. As described by its developer, the US firm Infinium, Project Roadrunner will deploy captured emissions from local operations that currently vent CO2 to the air. The renewable energy will come from purpose-built wind and solar farms in West Texas.

CleanTechnica has been following the e-fuels project since 2023, when American Airlines and the Breakthrough Energy Catalyst Fund got involved. Last year, Brookfield Asset Management put up $200 million to claim the role of strategic funding partner for the project, along with another $850 million earmarked for distributing e-fuels including sustainable aviation fuel from Project Roadrunner.

In the latest development, on June 24, the leading global financial firm HSBC provided additional, substantial support in the form of a project-based credit arrangement. “The financing marks a significant step forward for the Roadrunner Project, which will produce approximately 23,000 tonnes per year (7.6 million gallons) of synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) and other low-carbon eFuel products using renewable electricity and captured carbon dioxide,” Infinium explained in a press statement.

What’s In It For HSBC?

So … interesting! While US financial institutions and other leading corporate citizens have busied themselves currying favor with the malevolently incompetent Commander-in-Chief who occupies the White House, HSBC is a UK-based firm that follows a different drummer to the beat of global decarbonization. The firm is determined to deepen its mark on the US market, which explains its interest in a high-profile e-fuels project.

HSBC doubled down on its US footprint last year, highlighted by the unveiling of a new headquarters in New York City’s super-trendy Hudson Yards district in Midtown Manhattan.

“Our new U.S. headquarters in the heart of one of the world’s financial capitals symbolizes our commitment to our clients and to this critical market,” enthused HSBC Group Chairman Mark Tucker in a press release celebrating the new HQ dated May 23, 2024.

“We remain focused on connecting our clients in the US to opportunities overseas, and those around the world to the US,” HSBC emphasized.

Apparently, the abrupt shift in federal energy policy since May of 2024 has not deterred HSBC from its decarbonization mission. Referring to the newly announced credit arrangement in support of Project Roadrunner, HSBC’s CEO for Infrastructure Finance and Sustainability Danny Alexander explained that the transaction “represents HSBC’s commitment to support emerging decarbonisation technology, crucial to accelerating the transition.”

“The construction of Roadrunner is a first-of-a-kind facility and marks a huge achievement for Infinium and for the fuel industry,” Alexander added.

E-Fuels Really Are Coming For Your Fossil Fuels

With its green hydrogen connection and American Airlines among the offtakers already in its pocket, Project Roadrunner validates the opinion of analysts at BloombergNEF. At a recent energy conference in New York City, BNEF opined that green hydrogen is not ready for prime time yet, except in optimal market conditions such as those offered by Texas.

For the record, Project Roadrunner is Infinium’s second e-fuels venture in Texas, following the commissioning of its Project Pathfinder facility in 2024.

California is another state determined to have a hand in the US e-fuels industry. In March, the Texas-based firm HIF Global announced that it has earned Tier II Design Pathway Certification for its e-fuels process from the California Air Resource Board, through the agency’s Low Carbon Fuels Standard division.

“This LCFS certification underscores the growing demand for e-Fuels in the U.S. and globally, which could reach more than 250 mtpa by 20351, providing opportunity for over $1 trillion in potential capital investment in new facilities to produce the fuels, including HIF Global’s 1.4 mtpa e-Fuels project,” noted HIF Global Board Executive Director Meg Gentle.

Somewhat ironically, that particular project is not located in California. The site is Matagorda County, Texas. Even more ironically, when HIF Global announced Matagorda as the location for its first e-fuels project in the US, Texas Governor Gregg Abbot enthusiastically endorsed the idea.

“With plans to make a $6 billion capital investment, HIF will create more than 125 permanent operating jobs as well as thousands of other direct and indirect jobs in the region,” the Office of the Governor noted in a press release dated April 18, 2022.

Abbott and his fellow Republican elected officials in Texas are not particularly known for their affection for renewable energy, but money talks and Abbott added his two cents to the celebration.

“As the leader in the future of eFuels, HIF will be an excellent addition to the Texas economic juggernaut,” Abbott cheered. “This investment is great news for Texans in Matagorda County and the Coastal Bend, with more jobs, opportunity, and enhanced technology coming to the Lone Star State.”

Next Steps For E-Fuels In The US

Meanwhile, not to splash cold water on the Matagorda project — but they did anyways — on May 29 BBC News reported that the final investment decision has yet to be nailed down. The company is “waiting to see what the Republican-led Congress does to clean energy tax credits, in particular the one for clean hydrogen production,” observed BBC reporter Zoe Corbyn.

If the Republicans make the tax credits for green hydrogen go buh-bye, perhaps HIF can dial up HSBC for a loan. Better yet, perhaps e-fuels cheerleader Abbott can prod the Republican members of the Texas delegation to Congress for some relief. After all, he’s the one who said that “Texas is proud to be the energy capital of the world, and I look forward to a continued partnership with HIF to keep our state the energy leader.”

There were some positives and negatives for Canada’s canola industry, said the executive director of the Canadian Oilseed Processors Association.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its proposed rule for the Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume obligations (RVOs).

The biomass-based diesel mandate, which includes biodiesel, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, was set at 5.61 billion gallons for 2026 and 5.86 billion gallons for 2027.

That is a massive increase from the 3.35 billion gallon mandate for 2025 and is even higher than the 5.25 billion gallons that a coalition of oil and biofuel groups had been lobbying for.

That is good news for Canada’s crushers and canola farmers.

The bad news is that the EPA also proposed that foreign biofuels and feedstocks would only generate 50 per cent of the Renewable Identification Numbers (RIN) credit value relative to U.S. biofuels and feedstocks.

“That’s unfortunate,” said Vervaet.

“They’re proposing a 50 per cent haircut, if you will.”

The American Soybean Association was thrilled with the “new concept.”

“As soybean farmers struggle to maintain biofuel feedstock market share amid the rapidly growing flood of cheap, foreign feedstocks like used cooking oil, this proposal would once again give U.S. agriculture a competitive edge in the biofuel value chain,” the association said in a press release.

Vervaet is puzzled that the EPA chose to penalize Canadian canola-based biofuels since elsewhere in the proposed rule it praised canola oil as a predictable and plentiful feedstock.

He said that new proposal could seriously restrict the flow of Canadian canola oil to the U.S. market.

“With that type of a haircut on credit values, we’re going to be challenged to compete with other feedstocks. There’s no doubt about it,” he said.

However, he is hopeful that the EPA will come to its senses in time for the final rule, which is expected later this year.

“We have to remember this is a proposed rule. There is still time to influence some of the final content in this rule,” he said.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate Finance Committee released its draft of the One Big Beautiful Bill, which includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit.

Vervaet said there were some pluses and minuses with that legislative proposal as well.

He was pleased to see that the credit, which pays up to US$1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel, would be extended through the end of 2031, just like the House version of the bill.

More importantly, both the Senate and House reconciliation bills exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. That means canola-based fuels would be eligible for the credit.

However, the Senate version of the bill differs from the House version in one crucial area.

The House version limits the availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada.

The Senate version says the feedstock can be produced anywhere, but the credit would be reduced by 20 per cent for fuel produced from feedstocks grown outside the U.S. effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Vervaet said the Senate version penalizes Canadian canola oil, while the House version creates a “ringfence” for North American feedstock, which he thinks makes sense.

“Our markets are so integrated already, where you have millions of dollars of feedstock and finished fuels crisscrossing our border,” he said.

He is hopeful that the House will prevail in that aspect of the ongoing budget bill battle.

Ian Thomson, past president of Advanced Biofuels Canada, said the glass is definitely half empty when it comes to how Canada’s biofuel producers view the new U.S. policy proposals.

“We’re worse off than we were before,” he said.

The biomass-based diesel industry was “delighted” with the EPA’s new mandates for 2026 and 2027.

But Canadian biofuels would not be competitive in the U.S. market if they can’t get the same RIN values and tax credits as American biofuels.

Thomson is pleased with the removal of the ILUC factor in calculating greenhouse gas emissions, but it is a hollow victory because soybean oil renewable diesel would receive a $0.53 per gallon credit under the new rules, while canola oil renewable diesel would get a $0.22 credit.

“You’re still way under water versus the U.S.,” he said.

Thomson said U.S. biofuel policy is shifting to a made-in-the-U.S. approach, rather than the open border concept that existed for years.

Canada may have to follow their lead and promote made-in-Canada biofuels, he said.

Ottawa is aware of the problem and is well briefed on what needs to happen to keep Canada’s biofuel sector whole.

“They understand there is urgency,” said Thomson.

“This is not something that can grind through iterations of how Canada will respond.”

British Columbia recently made changes to its Low Carbon Fuels Act, doubling the renewable fuel mandate for diesel to eight per cent and requiring that the renewable content must be produced in Canada.

“Could Canada do likewise?” said Thomson.

“It could.”",https://ukragroconsult.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/biotoplivo.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 00:58:57.305693

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

London, 24 June (Argus) — The Dutch government's updated draft legislation to transpose the EU's revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) notably proposes abolishing double-counting renewable energy contributions from Annex IX feedstocks. The draft introduces a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction mandate for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping, but excludes aviation — which was included in a previous draft . The RED III mandate will take effect in 2026. Obligated parties have to fulfil the mandate by surrendering a sufficient amount of so-called emission reduction units (EREs) in each sector. The mandate's flexible credit allowance allows EREs generated in the land sector to be used to partly meet emission reduction obligations in inland and maritime shipping ( see table ), but EREs from inland and maritime shipping cannot be used by land sector suppliers to fulfil their compliance requirements. Fuel suppliers with overall consumption of more than 500,000 l/yr will need to incorporate a 14.4pc share of renewable fuels in their annual deliveries in 2026. This increases linearly, to reach 27.1pc in 2030. The amount of crop-based biofuels in the land sector will be limited to 1.4pc of the overall energy content of total consumption until 2030, and will not be accepted towards targets in maritime and inland shipping and aviation. The amount of Annex IX Part B biofuels — such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — that can be counted towards the mandate will be limited to 4.29pc in the land sector and 11.07pc in inland shipping. Obligated parties will be unable to claim EREs from Annex IX Part B fuels used in maritime shipping. The draft also introduces a minimum share of emission reductions that have to be achieved by Annex IX Part A and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), for all sectors. RED III mandates that 5.5pc of all fuels supplied must be advanced biofuels, including at least 1pc RFNBOs by 2030. The Netherlands' draft decouples these targets, to reduce investment uncertainty ( see table ). Refineries that use renewable hydrogen in their production process can claim refinery reduction units — or RAREs — which can be used by a supplier to meet an RFNBO sub-target in various sectors. Correction factor delay The ministry will delay its plans to apply a ""correction factor"" of 0.4 to its ""refinery route"" stimulus for hydrogen demand, in order to ensure the measure does not undermine direct use of hydrogen in transport. The correction factor means the value of emissions reductions credits generated through the use of renewable hydrogen for transport fuel production would be limited to a certain percentage of those generated through direct use of renewable hydrogen or derivatives in transport. The government leaves the option open to impose a correction factor from 2030. Although the EU Fuel Quality Directive increases the maximum share of bio-based components to 10pc in diesel, the Dutch government said fuel suppliers must continue to offer B7 — diesel with up to 7pc biodiesel — as a protection grade, because of the large number of cars incompatible with B10. Companies will be able to carry forward any excess EREs to the next compliance year. Companies with an annual obligation can carry forward up to 10pc of the total amount of EREs needed to fulfil their obligation in a year, with registering companies allowed to carry forward 4pc. Dutch renewable fuel tickets (HBEs) carried into 2026 will be converted into EREs on 1 April 2026, the government said.

Erex to start Vietnam biomass co-firing tests in August

Tokyo, 24 June (Argus) — Japanese renewable energy developer Erex plans to start coal and biomass co-firing test runs at thermal power plants in Vietnam from August. Co-firing test runs will start at the 110MW Na Duong plant in August and at the 115MW Cao Ngan plant in September, Erex said on 20 June. Both plants are owned and operated by Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries (Vinacomin). The Japanese company announced in April that it was planning co-firing test runs at the two plants , but had not previously disclosed when the tests would start. The trial operations are expected to last for several months and burn locally produced wood chips, starting from 5pc co-firing and gradually increasing to 20pc. The two companies will renovate the plants in 2026-27 after the trial operations and start commercial co-firing operations around 2027-28, Erex said. Erex said it also plans to conduct co-firing test runs at Vinacomin's 670MW Cam Pha plant in 2027-28 and start commercial operations around 2029-30. The company aims to carry out co-firing at six Vinacomin plants with a combined capacity of 1,585MW, including Na Duong, Cao Ngan, and Cam Pha. The co-firing projects are part of Vietnam's net zero strategy. Erex is eyeing carbon credits from the plants once commercial co-firing begins. The company aims to sell some of the carbon credits in Japan and is currently negotiating with Vietnamese government on this. Erex is expanding its renewable energy business in Vietnam and southeast Asia. In addition to co-firing projects, the company aims to operate a total of 19 biomass-fired power plants in Vietnam. The first of these, the 20MW Hau Giang plant, started commercial operations in April. Erex also plans to build up to five biomass-fired power plants in Cambodia. The company projects that profits from Vietnam and Cambodia will account for more than half of its overall earnings by around 2030, from nearly negligible levels in 2024.

Ontario weighs domestic biomass-based diesel quota

New York, 23 June (Argus) — Ontario is considering requiring that domestically produced renewable fuels make up 3pc of the province's diesel pool, an effort to help biodiesel producers struggling to adapt to policy changes in the US. Ontario late last week requested input on a proposal to supplement existing provincial biofuel blend requirements with a new mandate for Canadian production, similar to a domestic content rule that took force in British Columbia this year. Ontario already requires that renewables like biodiesel and renewable diesel make up 4pc of diesel consumption each year, but this proposal would require that three-fourths of that mandated volume come from biofuels produced in Canada. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks says the proposal is in response to a new clean fuel tax credit that took effect in the US this year, which can only be claimed by US producers. A US Department of Agriculture report late last year said that there were six remaining operational biodiesel plants in Canada and that the industry has historically sent almost all its fuel into the US, which up until this year treated foreign biodiesel as eligible for a federal tax credit. At the same time, US biofuels have increasingly entered Canada to meet demand from low-carbon fuel standards federally and in British Columbia. In those programs, higher-carbon fuels that exceed annual carbon intensity limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from approved lower-carbon alternatives. The Canadian biofuel industry has pushed officials to respond. British Columbia as a result began requiring this year that renewables make up a minimum 8pc of diesel fuels supplied in the province, up from 4pc, and that this mandated volume must come from Canadian producers starting in April. British Columbia-based renewable diesel producer Tidewater Renewables has also unsuccessfully pushed Canada to impose duties on US product. The Ontario environment ministry said the domestic mandate, if finalized, would be a ""temporary, time-limited measure"" that would last as long as US subsidies ""threaten Ontario's biodiesel industry."" The new US tax credit that excludes foreign refiners is currently set to lapse after 2027, but Republican lawmakers have floated using a massive budget bill they want to pass in the coming weeks to extend the incentive through 2031. While full regulatory text is not available, as is typical for this early stage of the Ontario rulemaking process, it appears the proposal would otherwise keep intact the general structure of the province's biofuel mandate. The program offers more credit to lower-carbon fuels, which led to a slightly lower than 4pc biofuel blend rate for the diesel pool in 2023, according to a report from trade group Advanced Biofuels Canada. The domestic content proposal would also not affect a separate mandate that biofuels make up increasing amounts of the gasoline pool through 2030.

Commercial aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonise. Airlines burn fossil fuels at high altitudes with few viable alternatives. The result is over 1.1 billion tonnes of CO₂ emissions per year, a figure projected to rise with global demand. The goal is to reach net zero by 2050.

But what if nature already offered us the solution? Here’s how how hemp can eliminate aviation emissions.

The hemp advantage

Hemp is a fast-growing industrial crop that captures CO₂ from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Its long fibres and woody stalks can be used in construction, biofuels and bioplastics.

Tao Climate focuses on two climate applications of hemp:

Carbon removal

When processed into building materials like hempcrete, the carbon captured by hemp during growth is locked away for decades. Each tonne of hemp can remove around 1.6 tonnes of CO₂ from the atmosphere.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Hemp biomass can be fermented into ethanol and refined into drop-in SAF through the alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) process. SAF made this way can cut lifecycle emissions by 75 percent compared to fossil jet fuel.

Our model to reach net zero aviation by 2050

We modelled the land and biomass scale-up required for hemp to deliver aviation decarbonisation on a planetary scale. In this scenario, global hemp biomass increases from 300,000 tonnes in 2020 to around 3.9 billion tonnes by 2050. Each year, 20 percent of the biomass is permanently sequestered in infrastructure, while 80 percent is processed into SAF.

Only the correct carbon benefits are counted:

CO₂ removed into hemp used for SAF is not counted, as that carbon is re-emitted in combustion.

CO₂ avoided by SAF is counted, based on lifecycle emissions savings.

CO₂ removed into hempcrete or other long-term use is counted, as that carbon stays locked away.

What the chart shows

This chart illustrates how the total climate impact grows over time, split between CO₂ removal via permanent storage and avoided emissions via SAF. By 2050, the combined impact meets or exceeds 1.1 gigatonnes per year, neutralising aviation’s carbon footprint.

Land area required

At full scale, this model would require about 650 million tonnes of hemp biomass per year stored and 2.6 billion tonnes processed into SAF. Assuming average yields of 6 tonnes per hectare, this translates to approximately 650 million hectares under hemp cultivation globally. While ambitious, this represents less than 5 percent of global agricultural land and is achievable through international cooperation, innovation and the use of marginal lands.

Contributed by Adam Klauber

Government policy can be instrumental in advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), especially when market forces alone are slow to drive adoption. SAF, which can significantly reduce aviation emissions, currently accounts for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel. Cost, feedstock availability, and infrastructure timelines are major barriers to demand and supply. Many governments around the world are stepping in with policies to accelerate SAF production and adoption.

These SAF policies reflect different governmental systems and priorities. Comparing them can help producers, developers, and investors make decisions for the near term and try to influence future government actions. This chart summarizes some key SAF policies around the world. You’ll find more details below, with some of the most interesting aspects of these policies highlighted.

United Kingdom: Mandates + Revenue Certainty

For a small country, the United Kingdom has a very strong policy, combining incentives — in the form of high credits for carbon reduction — with mandates for SAF reaching 10% of forecasted jet fuel consumption by 2030. This is an ambitious target, given that the UK’s current SAF supply is near zero. The timeline aligns with the time needed to build SAF plants, hopefully encouraging rapid project development.

The UK is especially interesting because it is also developing a revenue certainty model. If airlines can’t afford SAF due to market conditions, the government can provide financial support to cover the price premium. Having a government backstop to cover the price premium of SAF is unique to the UK right now.

The UK is also trying to support new SAF feedstock technologies such as electrofuels by scaling down the percentage of HEFA SAF (the most mature SAF production pathway today) that can be used to meet mandates. The HEFA process can account for 100% of SAF through 2026, after which the allowed share progressively drops to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040. Regardless of production pathway, SAF must meet a 40% carbon reduction threshold compared to fossil jet fuel to qualify under the mandate.

More on UK SAF policy can be found here.

European Union: Blending Mandate + Subsidies

The ReFuelEU blending mandate obligates fuel suppliers to blend increasing amounts of SAF into jet fuel. It started modestly at 2% in 2025 but rises to 34% by 2040 and ultimately 70% by 2050. The EU uses percentage-based blending targets tied to actual fuel usage, which demands detailed data calculations that may make it harder to implement.

Eligible SAF must meet a wide set of feedstock and emissions reduction requirements set out in the Renewable Energy Directive (RED). EU SAF must achieve emissions reductions of at least 65% compared to fossil fuel, with carbon intensity values to decrease over time.

The EU recently announced a subsidy program to help airlines afford SAF. They can receive subsidies of up to €6 per liter for electrofuels and €0.5 per liter for biofuels. In addition to offering higher subsidies, EU policy aims to advance newer technologies like electrofuels and alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel with a specific prohibition on recognizing imports of HEFA. But the EU needs to rely on outside supply to reach its targets due to the realities of how much feedstock can be grown or obtained from the region, so the policy may have to allow for Book & Claim contracts to satisfy requirements.

More on EU SAF policy can be found here.

United States: Incentives

The United States bears extra attention due to its status as a leading supplier of SAF and its unique policy profile. Rather than using mandates, the United States relies on tax incentives and voluntary programs to stimulate domestic production of SAF. Although specifics are currently in flux, the 45Z producers tax credit now in place offers up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF, depending on feedstock emissions profiles.

In the United States and elsewhere, Scope 3 customers — typically corporations seeking to reduce Scope 3 aviation emissions — are increasingly entering the SAF market, helping to cover costs and drive demand and investment. With SAF certificate insets, these companies can buy the environmental attributes of SAF and apply them against their aviation emissions, while the fuel itself goes into the supply chain. The Book & Claim chain-of-custody model tracks these transactions and ensures integrity.

Although US policy uncertainty is a challenge at the moment, it’s important to recognize the existing federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) has no expiration. In fact, recent EPA proposals have better aligned RFS obligations and targets with real-world production capacity. That’s a strong signal to producers that some form of market-sensitive government incentive will exist over the duration of their investment. SAF must deliver at least 50% life-cycle GHG reductions to qualify.

Several states also offer SAF incentives. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) is opt-in and voluntary, rewarding low-carbon fuel production with tax credits without mandating the use of specific fuels. States like Washington, Oregon, New Mexico, Illinois, and Iowa have also introduced SAF-specific tax benefits.

The US incentive model can avoid economic distortions that sometimes accompany mandates, when the penalty for noncompliance can easily become the price of the product, regardless of what it costs to produce. This can stifle demand and put producers out of business.

In an incentive market, risk comes in times of volatility or high prices, when it can be difficult for customers or producers to manage the costs. But overall, the price of incentive-driven SAF is closer to the real cost of producing it, which is more efficient for buyers.

Brazil: Emissions-Based Targets + Book & Claim

Brazil’s Fuel of the Future policy takes a pragmatic approach to aviation decarbonization. First, it focuses on GHG reductions, not SAF volume. Airlines must reduce domestic aviation emissions by 3% by 2030 and 10% by 2037 based on a full life-cycle analysis. This approach incentivizes the use of technologies or feedstocks with lower carbon intensities and the continual improvement of SAF over time.

Second, Brazil is the only country explicitly allowing Book & Claim for SAF. Airlines may be able to meet emissions targets by purchasing SAF attributes tied to fuel used elsewhere. For some period of time, that may be the way they can comply because there isn’t yet commercial SAF supply in Brazil.

India: Mandate

India targets 1% SAF on international flights by 2027, rising to 2% in 2028, with domestic SAF targets expected later. It’s one of the few developing countries with such a policy. India is attracting considerable interest from investors, especially in the alcohol-to-jet and ethanol conversion technologies, which can be supported by an array of local feedstocks, including bamboo and sugarcane. Some SAF production plants are in the pilot or ramp-up stage, including ethanol producer Praj and state-controlled refiner IOC, which has projected 1% SAF production on its own by fall 2025.

However, it’s not yet clear whether the domestic demand from airlines and corporations will be sufficient to cover the price premium. This challenge may lead some SAF producers to sell their physical supply to more developed markets, where there is a higher willingness to pay.

Japan: Preparing for a 2030 Mandate

Japan mandates that refiners replace 10% of fossil jet fuel with SAF by 2030. Though the mandate is not yet in force, preparations to comply are underway. Government subsidies of up to ¥30 per liter ($0.78 per gallon) are available for producers and are already being awarded. Some airlines are signing offtake agreements. And one refinery began delivering SAF domestically in early 2025, although its production volumes are unclear.

More on Japan SAF policy can be found here.

Singapore: Mandate + Passenger Fee

Beginning in 2026, flights departing Singapore must use 1% SAF, ramping to 3%–5% by 2030. The mandate will be supported by a centralized SAF procurement system and a levy on ticket prices, shifting the cost burden from fuel producers to passengers. The levy varies by target volumes of SAF, its cost, and the distance and class of travel.

The policy is intriguing because it allows for the influence of market forces. Money collected from the levy will purchase fuel at competitive prices, which avoids market distortions and shields airlines.

One short-term issue in Asia is limited regional demand, given the delayed mandate timeframe. For example, Singapore currently exports SAF to the UK. A global Book & Claim system could allow SAF certificates to fulfill international mandates without physically transporting fuel — minimizing emissions and costs.

Conclusion: The Need for Long-Term Policy Certainty

Government policies worldwide are providing material support and signaling confidence in future SAF development. This article is by no means an exhaustive list, and additional SAF policies are continually coming into play. But regardless of where SAF programs are enacted, the question of policy certainty stands out.

Giving private investors and entrepreneurs confidence that government frameworks that exist today will exist well into the future is probably the number one way to unlock new supply. Financial institutions ignore short-term policy for capital investment decisions and weigh permanent measures like the US Renewal Fuel Standard most favorably when determining policy risk and commercial viability.

Policy stability, ideally aligned with investment timelines, is a key goal for the SAF industry and its supporters to pursue in the interest of decarbonizing aviation while meeting the enduring demand for flight.",https://worldenergy.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Plane-on-map-iStock-1309940493-Cropped.jpg,N,,2025-06-25 00:59:39.508600

Speaking ahead of the launch of the Climate Change Committee’s 2025 progress report, Prof Piers Forster, the CCC’s interim chair, told journalists it would be “possible” to meet the UK’s 2030 international climate goal, as well as its 2050 target to cut emissions to net-zero.

Moreover, Forster responded to attacks on climate policy from opposition parties, the Conservatives and Reform UK, by saying that reaching net-zero would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”.

It says that 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target are now backed by “credible” policies, up from 25% two years earlier.

However, it says “significant risks” remain – and its top recommendation is for government action to reduce electricity prices, which would support the electrification of heat, transport and industry.

Change of tone

This is the first progress report from the CCC to assess climate policy and action under the new Labour government, which took office in July 2024.

Last year’s edition had said that “urgent action is needed” and that the UK was “not on track” for its 2030 international climate goal, namely, a 68% reduction in emissions relative to 1990 levels.

In contrast, the 2025 report says: “This target is within reach, provided the government stays the course.”

Speaking at a pre-launch press briefing, CCC interim chair Prof Piers Forster said: “[This is] an optimistic report, [showing] that it is possible for the country to meet its climate commitments.”

Moreover, in comments aligned with the shift in language since last year, he said that the report was “more optimistic” than the 2024 edition. Forster explained:

“We are not a political organisation and our job as a committee is just to look at the evidence, but, in terms of looking at the evidence, we are more optimistic than we were this time last year.”

The reasons for this were a mixture of policies from the previous government starting to deliver and the impact of decisions taken by the new administration, he said.

While the tone is relatively optimistic, the latest progress report uses less prescriptive language than previous editions, according to Carbon Brief analysis shown in the figure below.

For example, the word “must” occurs once every 10 pages in this year’s report, down from seven times in 2021. Similarly, the word “should” only occurs four times per 10 pages, down from 13.

This shift in language appears to be a continuation of the approach taken by the committee in its advice on the UK’s seventh “carbon budget”, published in February.

(Under the Climate Change Act 2008, the government has until June 2026 to legislate for this budget, which is a legally binding emissions limit for the five-year period from 2038 to 2042.)

The committee has faced inaccurate criticism from some opponents of climate action, who have argued that it was, in effect, setting government policy.

Pushing back on this, Forster had reiterated in February: “[O]ur core responsibility…is to give…the very best non-partisan advice possible…It’s not up to us to make the policy, it’s up to government.”

Beyond the overall tone of the latest progress report, it also puts a stronger emphasis than last year’s on the need for action to reduce emissions.

It sets out the rationale for the world reaching net-zero carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to stop global warming, but also asserts the benefits this would bring to the UK in terms of energy security, a more efficient economy and lower bills:

“[C]ontinued reliance on fossil fuels undermines UK energy security…[A] fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports, and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

In language that could be interpreted as pushback against the leader of the opposition, the Conservative’s Kemi Badenoch, who recently falsely claimed that reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 was both “impossible” and only possible “by bankrupting us”, the CCC report states:

“The science is unambiguous. Only by achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, with deep reductions in other greenhouse gases, can the UK stop contributing to an ever-warmer climate…The 2050 net-zero target for the UK remains deliverable and affordable, with whole-economy costs estimated at an annual average of 0.2% of GDP.”

Asked directly if he agreed that the net-zero by 2050 target was “impossible” and would come with “catastrophic” costs – as Badenoch has asserted – Forster said that on the contrary, it was “possible” and would, “ultimately, be good for the UK economy”. He told journalists:

“We think that, provided there is further government policy, it is possible both to reach our [2030 target], our carbon budgets and then, ultimately, get to net-zero…[and that] while the benefit doesn’t come instantly…it will, ultimately, be good for the UK economy.”

The report also makes the point that the UK is far from alone in its efforts, with global investments in clean-energy technologies reaching $2tn last year, double the sum going to fossil fuels. It adds:

“Most of the world is investing heavily in low-carbon technologies, driven by falling costs, energy security concerns and a realisation of the need to respond to rising climate impacts.”

(This is despite the Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and a “period of uncertainty” in international relations since the US election, the report notes.)

Back to top

Overall progress

Last year’s report, published just days after Labour’s “landslide” election victory, had set the scene for the new administration, saying that it needed to “make up lost ground” to get back on track.

That report had called on the new government to “limit the damage” from Conservative climate policy rollbacks, which had been implemented ahead of the election.

This year’s report looks at how things have progressed since then, based on three sets of metrics:

First, it looks at changes to the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions over the past year.

Second, it looks at indicators of progress on the ground, such as the uptake of electric vehicles (EVs), the rollout of electric heat pumps and the rate of tree-planting.

Third, it looks at policy changes introduced over the past year by the new government.

The assessment includes policy changes introduced up until 23 May 2025, meaning that it does not consider the June spending review or the industrial strategy published earlier this week.

Greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, with a 50.4% reduction, making the UK “one of the leading economies in the world”, Forster said. The report adds:

“The UK should…be proud of its place among a leading group of economies demonstrating consistent and sustained decarbonisation.”

It says that UK emissions fell again during 2024, with a 2.5% reduction marking the tenth year of steady decline, excluding the Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent rebound.

Echoing Carbon Brief analysis published in March, the CCC says that the latest drop in emissions was due to the power sector, industry and transport, where EVs are starting to have an impact.

However, the report emphasises once again that progress to date has largely come in the electricity sector, where the UK became the first country in the G7 to phase out coal power in 2024.

Indeed, the CCC says that electricity supply is now only the UK’s sixth-largest source of emissions, after surface transport, buildings, industry, agriculture and aviation, as shown in the figure below.

In order to continue cutting emissions to meet UK climate goals, the CCC says that reductions will be needed across a broader range of sectors, including transport, buildings, industry and land-use.

The pace of emissions cuts outside the power sector – an average of 8m tonnes of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year since 2008 – is roughly on track for the fourth carbon budget covering 2023-27.

However, the report says this pace will need to “more than double” toward the end of the decade, hitting 19MtCO2e per year, in order to hit the UK’s NDC and sixth carbon budget.

Turning to the indicators of progress on the ground, the CCC says that there are some “clear signs” of such shifts starting to take place, in areas such as transport, buildings and land-use.

For example, the report points to “significant increases” in the rates of heat-pump rollout (up 56% year-on-year in 2024), tree-planting (+59%) and peatland restoration (+47%).

(See the sections below for further detail on policies and progress in each sector.)

Back to top

Policy gaps

Turning to its assessment of government climate policy, the CCC report says there has also been some “positive progress” since Labour came to office last year.

Specifically, it points to the removal of planning barriers for onshore wind and heat pumps, as well as implementation of the “clean heat market mechanism” to drive heat-pump sales, reinstatement of the 2030 combustion car ban and publication of the 2030 clean-power action plan.

As a result, the CCC says that there are now “credible policies” in place to make 38% of the emissions cuts needed to hit the UK’s 2030 target, up from 25% in 2023 and 32% last year.

At the same time, the share of emissions savings subject to policies facing “some” or “significant risks” has fallen from 53% in 2023 and 50% in 2024, down to 43% in the latest report.

These improvements are illustrated in the figure below, which shows that the credibility of UK climate policies towards the 2030 target has been steadily increasing.

Nevertheless, there are still “insufficient plans” to make 14% of the cuts needed by 2030, the same share as last year. The biggest policy gaps are around heat-pump rollout, the report says.

The CCC says: “With 39% of policies and plans needed to hit the 2030 NDC rated as having significant risks, or insufficient or unquantified plans, the government must act swiftly.”

The figure below illustrates the implications of falling to “act swiftly” more clearly.

If only the most “credible” policies actually deliver emissions savings (solid dark blue line) then the UK would miss its international targets for 2030 and 2035 (black circles) by significant margins.

The UK would get somewhat closer to its goals, if emissions cuts are successfully achieved as a result of policies subject to “some” (light blue) or “significant” delivery risks (grey line).

At the pre-launch briefing, Dr Emily Nurse, head of net-zero at the CCC, told journalists that further action was needed to get on track for the 2030 target. She said:

“Around three-fifths of what’s needed is covered by either credible plans or [those] having some risks…The UK can hit its upcoming emissions reduction targets and remain on track for net-zero, but only with further policy action.”

The government has the chance to fill these policy gaps when it publishes its updated “carbon budget delivery plan”, which has a deadline of 29 October this year.

This plan must set out how the government intends to meet the UK’s legally binding climate goals, after the previous administration’s plan was ruled unlawful by the High Court.

While there has been “good or moderate progress” on 20 of the 35 policy recommendations made last year, the CCC says there has been “no progress” on its top recommendation to make electricity cheaper.

The report says this remains its top recommendation for the second year in a row.

The reason for emphasising this, it says, is that electrification of transport, heat and industry will be the key to making required emissions cuts over the next decade, according to the CCC, with these shifts being facilitated by the expansion and continued decarbonisation of the power sector.

CCC chief executive Emma Pinchbeck told journalists that making progress in lowering electricity prices was “absolutely critical”, particularly relative to the price of gas. She said:

“The reason we keep banging on about [this], very simply, [is] that the evidence from every other country that’s had a successful rollout of electric technologies – particularly for heat – is that you need a three-to-one electricity-to-gas price ratio.”

(At present, domestic electricity prices are roughly four times higher than gas prices.)

Pinchbeck reiterated the committee’s call for the government to remove policy “levies” from electricity bills, adding that failing to do so would mean “slowing down” the transition. She said:

“If you’re effectively taxing your future fuel, you’re slowing down your energy transition, when the economy is going to become more and more dependent on electricity…It is just sensible economic policy to have cheap fuel going into your economy.”

While Pinchbeck welcomed plans in the government’s just-published industrial strategy to cut levies on industrial electricity bills, she said that it should do the same for households.

Road transport

Road-transport emissions fell for a second consecutive year in 2024, says the report.

The number of electric vehicles (EVs) on UK roads is roughly doubling every two years.

If this trend continues, the road-transport sector will produce the emissions savings required for its contribution to the UK’s 2030 climate target, the CCC says (see below).

EVs made up 19.6% of new car sales in 2024, compared to 16.1% the previous year, according to the report. In the first quarter of 2025, this figure rose to 20.7%.

This represents “strong growth”, but is below the headline targets of the zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) mandate, a government regulation that requires car manufacturers to sell an increasing percentage of zero-emission vehicles each year, the CCC says.

The mandate targets a 22% market share for 2024 and a 28% share for 2025, according to the CCC.

The CCC notes that lower-cost EVs are becoming increasingly available. It adds that “price parity with petrol cars has already been reached in parts of the second-hand market”, with this milestone set to arrive for new cars by between 2026 and 2028.

Overall, there has been a “small improvement” in the UK’s policy efforts to decarbonise road transport since last year’s report, it says.

This is largely down to Labour’s decision to reinstate a 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, which was weakened to 2035 under Conservative prime minister Rishi Sunak, explains the report.

The CCC describes the move as a “welcome market signal to accelerate the transition to EVs”.

As well as reinstating the 2030 ban, the government announced changes to the ZEV mandate.

The government essentially weakened the mandate by extending flexibilities and allowing the sale of hybrid vehicles between 2030 and 2035.

Ministers said this move was in response to import tariffs announced by Donald Trump.

The CCC says the changes “risk allowing existing planned plugin hybrid vehicle sales to slightly reduce the emissions savings from EVs”, adding:

“It is also possible that manufacturers could divert investment towards [hybrids], diluting the consumer offer for EVs – we currently think that this risk is minimal due to progress in scaling up the EV market to date, but it is something that we will monitor closely.”

It adds that “for the transition to accelerate, further reductions in the cost of purchasing EVs, as well as improved access to, and reduced costs of, local public charging, are needed”.

Buildings

Heat pump installations increased by 56% in 2024 compared to the year before, the report says. Some 98,000 heat pumps were installed.

A total of 23,000 heat pumps were installed under the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, which allows homeowners to claim grants for replacing fossil-fuel boilers. This is an increase of 83% on 2023 levels, says the CCC.

However, the speed at which heat pumps are rolled out remains one of the “biggest risks” to the UK meeting its 2030 climate target, it adds.

The UK’s heat pump market share is around 4%, much lower than comparable countries, such as Ireland (30%) and the Netherlands (31%), the CCC says.

The government has taken steps to “remove planning barriers” for heat pumps. This includes amending the planning policy in England to remove the requirement for planning permission for heat pumps located less than 1m from a property boundary.

However, the government has “not yet provided clarity on whether [it] will continue with the proposed phase-out of new fossil fuel boiler installations from 2035”, or “make alternative plans to ensure that low-carbon heating reaches the installation rates required”, the CCC says.

The report adds that the ratio of residential electricity to gas prices is “significantly off track”.

The ratio is important because it underpins the “underlying cost savings of switching to electric technologies are reflected in the bills paid by households and businesses”, the CCC says, continuing:

“Action has not been taken to remove policy costs from electricity prices which would address this, despite it being our first recommendation last year…Currently, a typical household with a heat pump is paying around £490 per year in policy costs, which inflate their bills above the underlying cost of the additional electricity used.”

Data from other nations suggests that the “market share of heat pump installations are correlated with more favourable electricity-to-gas price ratios”, says the CCC (see chart below).

Forster told the press briefing that the CCC’s “biggest recommendation” to government remains reducing the price of electricity in relation to gas:

“By far the most important recommendation we have for the government is to reduce the cost of electricity, both for households and for businesses and industry as well…If we want the country to benefit from the transition to electrification, we have to see it reflected in utility bills.”

The report adds that, on efforts to increase the energy efficiency of residential buildings, the “proportion of homes with insulated cavity walls has steadily increased over recent years, but this will need to accelerate later in the decade” to be in line with net-zero.

Industry

Industry emissions decreased by 4.7MtCO2e in 2024, compared to the year before, the CCC says. Emissions are now 48% lower than 2008 levels.

From 2023-24, annual emissions dropped quickly due to the removal of blast furnaces at Port Talbot steelworks in 2024. They are due to be replaced by electric arc furnaces by 2027, with the move leading to 2,500 job losses.

The government should have developed a “more proactive and decisive transition plan” for Port Talbot and the report describes the UK’s upcoming steel strategy as “an opportunity to set out plans for the low-carbon transition at Scunthorpe steelworks and other UK steel production”.

To deliver the emissions savings needed to meet the UK’s 2030 climate goal, companies will “increasingly need to switch to electric alternatives to fossil-fuelled technology”, the report says, adding:

“A high ratio of [industrial] electricity-to-gas prices currently presents a barrier to this.”

It adds that, currently, “there is now no major source of government support for manufacturers to invest in electrification”.

The CCC notes that the government did not launch the latest round of the Industrial Energy Transformation Fund, which was due in December 2024. It has “not clarified whether this or similar funding will continue”.

On 23 June, the UK government announced a 10-year industrial strategy, including measures to slash the price of electricity for energy-intensive businesses from 2027 by exempting them from green levies.

In the press briefing, Pinchbeck described the move as “good”, but urged the government to introduce similar measures for household electricity bills, too. (See: Buildings.)

On efforts to introduce carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to UK industries, the report says progress “is not on track to be deployed at the pace required” by government plans to reach net-zero.

Fossil fuels and hydrogen

The report says that the UK’s “continued reliance on fossil fuels undermines energy security”, continuing:

“Household energy bills rose sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and have remained high since. It is the price of gas that has driven up both gas and electricity bills.”

(See Carbon Brief’s factcheck on what is causing high electricity bills in the UK.)

The report does not directly address the Labour government’s policies on oil and gas production in the North Sea.

Labour has ruled out new oil and gas licences. However, the government has indicated it might approve new projects that already have a licence, if they can pass a new environmental impact assessment that will consider the emissions from burning the oil and gas produced.

In regards to the North Sea, the report says:

“With North Sea resources largely used up, a fossil-fuelled future would leave the UK increasingly dependent on imports and energy bills would remain subject to volatile fossil fuel prices.”

The CCC adds that the “main progress in the fuel-supply sector in the past year has been around low-carbon hydrogen production”.

In the 2024 autumn budget, the government confirmed support for 11 “electrolytic”

hydrogen production projects, which are expected to start operating by the end of 2026. (These projects use electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen.)

Back to top

Electricity

The UK’s transition away from fossil fuels to renewable energy in its electricity supply continued to drive the bulk of emissions reductions in 2024, the CCC says. It accounted for 41% of the total in-year reduction in emissions.

From the 1990s until 2024, the power sector has transformed from the largest source of emissions to only the sixth largest, behind aviation. (See: Overall progress.)

The UK’s last coal-fired power plant, Ratcliffe-on-Soar, closed in October 2024. (See Carbon Brief’s detailed explainer on how the UK became the first G7 nation to phase out coal.)

Coal emissions from electricity generation were 99% lower in 2024 than in 2008 and will reach zero in 2025, the CCC says. It describes this as a “major milestone on the UK’s path to a decarbonised power system”.

Falling gas generation accounted for 72% of emissions reductions in the power sector in 2024, the CCC says.

The electricity supplied by gas fell by 15% in 2024, compared to the previous year. This was “made up with roughly equal proportions of imports and low-carbon generation”.

The rollout of wind and solar capacity in 2024 was larger than in any of the previous six years, the report says.

But to achieve the government’s goal of “clean power” by 2030, total renewable capacity will need to more than double.

Based on projects in the pipeline, both offshore and onshore wind “appear on track” for the government’s goal, according to the CCC.

However, “roll-out of solar is significantly off track and will need to improve to deliver its contribution to a decarbonised electricity system”.

The report says that, overall, “positive policy progress has been made in decarbonising electricity supply over the past year”.

It continues that “concrete steps have been made to remove barriers and support the deployment of low-carbon technology”.

These steps include removing barriers facing onshore wind developments, “streamlin[ing]” the approval of nationally significant infrastructure, including renewable projects and introducing reforms to speed up connecting projects to the grid.

However, the CCC adds that there are “remaining uncertainties on the future electricity market arrangements and further challenges to deploying infrastructure to overcome”.

Back to top

Agriculture and land

There was a “significant increase” in both tree-planting and peatland restoration in 2024, the report says.

Some 20,700 hectares of new trees were planted, an increase of 59% on the year before and the highest rate in 20 years, it adds, as shown in the chart below.

Over the same period, the restoration of peatlands increased by 47%.

This “demonstrates that a rapid increase in rates is feasible” for the land-use sector, the CCC says.

However, woodland creation remains “slightly off track”. (Carbon Brief reported last year that successive UK governments have fallen so far short of their tree-planting targets since 2020 that they have failed to plant an area of forest nearly equivalent to the size of Birmingham.)

In addition, Scotland accounted for 73% of the total trees planted from 2023-24 and the CCC has “concerns that recent reductions in funding for woodland creation in Scotland could reverse this trend”.

A target to have 35,000 hectares of peat under restoration in England by 2025 is also “expected to be missed”.

Livestock numbers continued to fall in 2024, the report says.

Meat eating has declined steeply over the past couple of years. The average amount of meat eaten per person each week dropped by around 100g from 2020-22, according to CCC data.

Pinchbeck told the press briefing that meat-eating in the UK is now lower than what the CCC had anticipated in its central pathway for meeting net-zero:

“There’s lots of factors behind that, including the cost of living crisis. So we are not necessarily saying that trend will increase. Farming is facing a number of pressures, outside having to deal with a changing climate, reduced crop yields [and] difficulty making farms sustainable.”

Both the reduction in livestock and meat eating are “key to freeing up land required to increase tree-planting and peatland restoration”, the report says.

The government’s progress on addressing land-use sector emissions with policies has been “mixed” over the past year, according to the CCC.

The government is expected to produce a long-awaited land-use framework by the end of this year, but it “remains unclear how this framework will drive change on the ground”, the advisers say.

The government paused the sustainable farming incentive, part of the environmental land management (ELM) schemes, in March 2025.

This was due to all of the funding being allocated, which is “positive”, says the CCC. However, the decision has left a “gap in delivery grants for on-farm actions”.

The Nature for Climate Fund has been extended by one year, but is “unclear” what will happen to this scheme in the long term, it adds.

Aviation and shipping

Emissions in the aviation sector increased by 9% year-on-year in 2024, “marking a return to pre-pandemic levels”, the report says.

In government and CCC scenarios for net-zero, emissions stay flat and start slowly decreasing over the rest of the decade, the report says, adding:

“Aviation emissions will likely exceed the trajectories assumed in all [these] pathways if they continue to increase, posing a risk to the UK’s emissions targets.”

The biggest driver of aviation emissions since 1990 has been “rising demand for international flights, particularly leisure”, it continues.

Aviation now causes more emissions than the UK’s entire power grid. In 1990, aviation emissions were 10 times lower than those from electricity, according to the report.

The CCC “recommends that the government should develop and implement policy that ensures the aviation sector takes responsibility for mitigating its emissions and, ultimately, achieving net-zero”, adding:

“This includes paying for permanent engineered removals to balance out all remaining emissions. Robust contingencies should also be in place to address any delays in decarbonisation, including through managing the forecasted increase in aviation demand.”

The share of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as a proportion of all jet fuel rose from 0.7% to 2.1% from 2023-24, the CCC says.

It notes that the SAF mandate came into force in January 2025 and the sustainable aviation fuel bill was introduced to parliament in May.

Achieving the government’s target of 10% of jet fuel from SAF by 2030 “remains uncertain as different types of SAF will need to scale up”, it adds.

There are currently no operational UK SAF plants, but some are under construction.

On shipping, the report notes that the UK has set out a maritime decarbonisation strategy, with an aim to reduce the domestic maritime sector’s fuel lifecycle emissions to zero by 2050 and interim goals of cutting pollution by 30% by 2030 and 80% by 2040, compared to 2008.

The targets are “broadly aligned” with government plans for net-zero, the CCC says.

Back to top

Other sectors

Another sector tracked by the CCC is “engineered removals”, technologies that suck CO2 out of the atmosphere.

Aside from small experiments, there is no deployment of such technologies in the UK. However, the government’s pathway for net-zero expects such methods to remove 6MtCO2e from the atmosphere by 2030, the report says, adding:

“This sector will need to develop and scale up notably over the coming five years.”

One of the CCC’s “top 10” priority actions is for the government to “finalise business models for large-scale deployment of engineered removals”.

On this, the advisers say:

“There has been little progress…This puts the contribution of engineered removals to the UK’s 2030 NDC at increasing risk.”

Another issue assessed by the CCC is waste, which produced 26.7MtCO2e in 2024, making it the eighth most polluting sector.

The report says there has been “some progress” on waste policy, but notes the government is “yet to confirm its intention to prevent biodegradable waste from going to landfill, a key measure to reduce emissions from waste”.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/3BJ19MA.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 21:00:22.095109

Hosted annually by Grain Trade Australia and the Australian Oilseeds Federation and being held at Melbourne’s Crown Promenade on July 30-31, its theme this year is Driving Forward – Sowing Success.

GTA chief executive officer Pat O’Shannassy said the program has been designed to provide grain market participants and service providers with the latest insights into developments locally and globally.

“We’ve lined up speakers from a diverse range of backgrounds that highlight the scope ofmarkets AGIC delegates work across in these changing times,” Mr O’Shannassy said.

Global market insights will come from US-based analyst Emily French, who started with Cargill in 1996 before joining the US Grains Council and then World Perspectives, and in investment banking in the US and Australia, prior to founding Global Ag Protein.

Speaking about global trade impacts and facilitating trade is UK-based Grain and Feed Trade Association director general and Federation of Commodity Associations chair Jaine Chisholm Caunt.

“Both these speakers are leaders in their field, and as we come to terms with global unrest that is changing our trading environment, their insights will be invaluable.”

As always, domestic markets and their interface with international pricing are prominent in the AGIC program, and will look at everything from bread, courtesy of Bakers Delights founders Lesley and Roger Gillespie, to sustainable aviation fuel in the remit of Neste general manager James Williamson.

“Every tonne of grain processed locally, whether it’s for human consumption, feed, or biofuels, can add value to Australian economy.”

“To dive into what we are doing currently, and further opportunities that exist, our value-adding panel has a representative from each sector.”

Joining Mr Williamson on that panel will be Mauri head of commodity Michael Schmidt and Patrick Hutchinson, who has vast experience in the meat industry and is now principal of Gibraltar Strategic Advisory.

As concerns about climate change and air pollution continue to grow, the US aviation sector is embracing sustainable practices and technologies to mitigate its effects. In this article, we'll explore the future of sustainable aviation in the US, from emerging technologies to evolving regulations and industry trends.

Emerging Technologies

The US aviation industry is witnessing significant advancements in sustainable technologies, transforming the way we travel by air. Some of the key emerging technologies include:

Advances in Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Production and Adoption

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are made from renewable resources, such as waste biomass, agricultural residues, or algae. SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels[^1](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/sustainable-aviation-fuels/). The production of SAF is gaining momentum in the US, with several companies investing in large-scale production facilities.

For instance, in 2020, the US Department of Energy announced a $4 million funding opportunity for research and development of SAF production technologies[^2](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/articles/us-department-energy-announces-4-million-funding-opportunity-sustainable). This investment is expected to drive innovation and reduce the costs associated with SAF production.

Electric and Hybrid-Electric Propulsion Systems: Overcoming Technical Challenges

Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems are being developed to reduce emissions and operating costs. These systems use electric motors powered by batteries or hybrid-electric systems that combine traditional fossil-fuel engines with electric motors.

However, there are significant technical challenges to overcome, including:

Energy storage and battery technology limitations

Weight and efficiency constraints

Certification and regulatory hurdles

Despite these challenges, several companies, such as Eviation and Joby Aviation, are making significant progress in developing electric and hybrid-electric aircraft[^3](https://www.eviation.co/).

Urban Air Mobility and Its Potential to Transform Short-Distance Travel

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) refers to the use of aircraft, such as eVTOLs (electric vertical takeoff and landing), to transport people and cargo within urban areas. UAM has the potential to revolutionize short-distance travel, reducing congestion and emissions.

Several companies, including Uber and Lilium, are investing heavily in UAM technologies[^4](https://www.uber.com/us/en/elevate/). However, regulatory frameworks and infrastructure development will be crucial to the success of UAM.

Regulatory Developments

Regulatory developments play a crucial role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation in the US. Some key regulatory developments include:

Evolving FAA Regulations and Their Impact on Sustainable Aviation Practices

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is updating regulations to support the growth of sustainable aviation. For example, the FAA has established a task force to develop guidelines for the certification of eVTOLs[^5](https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94873).

The FAA is also working to develop new regulations for SAF, including standards for production and use[^6](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/sustainable_aviation_fuels).

International Cooperation and Agreements Driving Global Sustainability Standards

International cooperation is essential for developing global sustainability standards in aviation. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established a Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) to reduce emissions from international aviation[^7](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/CORSIA.aspx).

The US is a signatory to CORSIA and is working with other countries to implement the agreement.

State and Local Initiatives Supporting the Growth of Sustainable Aviation

State and local governments are also playing a crucial role in supporting the growth of sustainable aviation. For example, California has established a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which includes provisions for SAF[^8](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/low-carbon-fuel-standard).

Other states, such as Washington and Colorado, are also investing in sustainable aviation initiatives, including SAF production and UAM infrastructure development.

Industry Trends and Opportunities

The US sustainable aviation industry is experiencing significant growth, driven by increasing demand for sustainable air travel options. Some key industry trends and opportunities include:

Growing Demand for Sustainable Air Travel Options and Its Impact on the Industry

Consumers are increasingly demanding more sustainable air travel options, driving airlines to invest in SAF and more efficient aircraft. A survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that 74% of passengers consider the environmental impact of their travel when making travel decisions[^9](https://www.iata.org/en/pressroom/press-releases/2020-03-04-01/).

The Role of Sustainable Aviation in Shaping the Future of Air Travel

Sustainable aviation is expected to play a critical role in shaping the future of air travel. As demand for air travel continues to grow, the industry will need to adopt more sustainable practices to reduce its environmental impact.

Opportunities for Innovation in Sustainable Aviation Technologies

There are significant opportunities for innovation in sustainable aviation technologies, including:

Advanced SAF production technologies

Electric and hybrid-electric propulsion systems

UAM infrastructure development

The graph below illustrates the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the adoption of sustainable aviation technologies.

However, this growth comes with significant environmental costs, including greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. To mitigate these impacts, the industry is turning to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as a key solution. In this article, we will explore the role of SAF in minimizing the environmental impact of air travel and the steps being taken to increase their adoption.

Production and Types of Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Sustainable aviation fuels are made from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste materials, or synthetic fuels produced using renewable energy. The production process for SAF involves several steps, including feedstock collection, conversion, and refining.

Overview of SAF Production Processes

There are several production pathways for SAF, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common pathways include:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis: This process involves converting biomass or waste materials into a synthetic gas, which is then converted into a liquid fuel using the FT process.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This process involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into a hydrocarbon fuel through hydroprocessing.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): This process involves converting alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol, into a jet fuel using a catalytic conversion process.

The following flowchart illustrates the different SAF production pathways:

Feedstock Collection

Conversion

Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids

Refining

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Types of Feedstocks Used in SAF Production

The feedstocks used in SAF production can vary widely, depending on the production pathway. Some common feedstocks include:

Biomass: Agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae are all potential biomass feedstocks.

Waste materials: Municipal solid waste, waste cooking oil, and other waste materials can be used to produce SAF.

Synthetic fuels: Fuels produced using renewable energy, such as solar or wind power, can be used to produce SAF.

Comparison of Different SAF Production Pathways

Each SAF production pathway has its own advantages and disadvantages, including differences in cost, energy efficiency, and greenhouse gas emissions. The following table compares the different pathways:

Production Pathway Feedstock Energy Efficiency Greenhouse Gas Emissions Fischer-Tropsch Biomass or waste 40-60% 50-80% reduction HEFA Vegetable oils or animal fats 80-90% 50-80% reduction ATJ Alcohols 60-80% 50-80% reduction

Benefits and Challenges of SAF Implementation

The adoption of SAF has several benefits, including reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. However, there are also challenges associated with scaling up SAF production.

Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels. This is because SAF is made from renewable resources, which absorb CO2 during their growth cycle. The following equation illustrates the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions:

GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)×100 \text{GHG reduction} = \frac{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)} - \text{GHG emissions (SAF)}}{\text{GHG emissions (fossil fuel)}} \times 100 GHG reduction=GHG emissions (fossil fuel)GHG emissions (fossil fuel)−GHG emissions (SAF)​×100

For example, a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation found that SAF produced using the FT pathway can reduce GHG emissions by up to 75% compared to traditional fossil fuels 1.

Air Quality Improvements

SAF can also improve air quality by reducing emissions of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide. A study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found that SAF produced using the HEFA pathway can reduce particulate matter emissions by up to 90% compared to traditional fossil fuels 2.

Challenges in Scaling Up SAF Production

Despite the benefits of SAF, there are several challenges associated with scaling up production. These include:

High production costs: SAF is currently more expensive than traditional fossil fuels, making it challenging to compete in the market.

Limited availability of feedstocks: The availability of feedstocks, such as biomass or waste materials, can be limited in certain regions.

Infrastructure constraints: The existing infrastructure for fuel production and distribution may not be suitable for SAF.

The following mind map illustrates the challenges associated with scaling up SAF production:

Policy and Regulatory Frameworks for SAF Adoption

To support the adoption of SAF, governments and regulatory bodies are implementing policies and regulations. These include:

Existing Policies and Regulations Supporting SAF Adoption

Renewable Fuel Standard: The Renewable Fuel Standard in the United States requires airlines to use a certain percentage of renewable fuels, including SAF.

EU Renewable Energy Directive: The EU Renewable Energy Directive sets a target for the use of renewable energy in transportation, including aviation.

Incentives for SAF Production and Use

To encourage the production and use of SAF, governments are offering incentives, such as:

Tax credits: Tax credits can help reduce the production costs of SAF.

Grants and funding: Governments are providing grants and funding for SAF production projects.

Low-interest loans: Low-interest loans can help reduce the financial risks associated with SAF production.

Future Directions for SAF Policy and Regulation

As the demand for SAF continues to grow, governments and regulatory bodies will need to continue to evolve their policies and regulations to support the industry. This may include:

Setting SAF-specific targets: Governments can set targets for the use of SAF in aviation.

Developing SAF standards: Regulatory bodies can develop standards for SAF production and use.

Increasing funding for SAF research and development: Governments can provide funding for research and development in SAF production and use.

Conclusion

Sustainable aviation fuels have the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of air travel. While there are challenges associated with scaling up SAF production, governments and regulatory bodies are implementing policies and regulations to support the industry. As the demand for SAF continues to grow, it is likely that the industry will continue to evolve and improve.

In the past six months, only one SAF project globally reached the stage of final investment decision (FID).
But with fewer than 15 SAF projects globally reaching FID each year, the pace is well below what’s needed.
With government support and the right policies, the region could become a leader in the global aviation fuel market.
But success will require moving beyond pilot projects and setting up the financial, legal, and commercial foundations needed to turn plans into large-scale fuel production.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), long seen as aviation’s best path to cutting emissions, is beginning to take shape globally. As of June 2025, the Mission Possible Partnership’s Global Project Tracker reports 22 SAF plants in operation and a pipeline of 144 more projects. This puts aviation ahead of many sectors in the shift to cleaner industrial practices, with the industry accounting for one-fifth of all clean industrial project announcements worldwide, reports Aviation Business.

Despite this growth in planned projects, actual development is lagging. In the past six months, only one SAF project globally reached the stage of final investment decision (FID). To meet global climate goals, the pace of SAF production needs to rise sharply.

Governments are beginning to push the transition. Europe has introduced binding targets through its ReFuelEU policy, requiring 2% SAF blending by 2025 and 6% by 2030. In the U.S., a mix of national and state-level programs—including tax breaks and funding for research—has started to boost interest. Still, progress is slow. Of the 144 projects on record, just seven have reached FID. Many others face difficulties such as high feedstock costs and trouble securing long-term buyers.

Currently, most SAF is made from bio-based sources like used cooking oil and plant fats (a process known as HEFA). However, more advanced synthetic fuels made using renewable electricity and green hydrogen remain too costly for large-scale use.

Amid these global challenges, the Middle East and North Africa region is emerging as a promising new hub for SAF production. Countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Egypt are investing heavily in green hydrogen, a key ingredient for synthetic SAF. With strong solar energy potential, existing infrastructure, and strategies aimed at international exports, these countries are well placed to support future fuel demand.

However, several challenges remain. While these countries have the resources to lead, national SAF policies are still underdeveloped, and there is little domestic demand to support early production. Without clear rules or incentives for airlines, large-scale plants may be hard to justify unless strong export contracts are secured. This uncertainty has already led to delays and cancellations of SAF projects elsewhere.

Even so, the potential impact of these efforts is significant. If all current SAF projects are completed, they could produce up to 48 million tonnes of fuel per year—more than enough to cover all expected EU airport fuel needs by 2030. But with fewer than 15 SAF projects globally reaching FID each year, the pace is well below what’s needed.

For the Middle East, the next five years are crucial. With government support and the right policies, the region could become a leader in the global aviation fuel market. But success will require moving beyond pilot projects and setting up the financial, legal, and commercial foundations needed to turn plans into large-scale fuel production.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-15.png,N,,2025-06-24 18:07:28.698251

Amid rising air travel, IATA highlighted on Sunday that India has substantial capacity to produce SAF, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions.

In 2023, SAF production in India was around 0.5 million tonnes, but this needs to increase significantly by 2050.

The SAF Registry, set to be established by IATA, aims to boost the adoption of SAF by accurately tracking and reporting emissions reductions from its use.

Little to no ethanol will qualify for US aviation fuel credit

LITTLE to no ethanol will qualify for US sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) subsidies under a new pilot programme by President Joe Biden’s administration, which recently tightened climate requirements, reports Reuters.

This development could negatively impact the biofuel industry, which views SAF as ethanol’s most promising growth opportunity, especially as electric cars reduce its demand as a gasoline additive.

It could also impede Biden’s goal of producing 30 billion gallons of SAF by 2030, despite his earlier promise that 95 per cent of SAF – a biofuel that can be made from oils, waste, or grains-would come from farmers.

The specifics of how little ethanol will qualify for the subsidies under the pilot programme and the last-minute increase in requirements have not been previously reported.

Central to the issue is a US$1.25/gallon production tax credit included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, designated for SAF that achieves a 50 per cent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Why aviation chiefs fear net zero could cripple air travel

WHEN airlines committed to reducing carbon emissions in 2021, executives were confident that, having survived Covid crisis, they could also navigate the energy transition, reports London’s Daily Telegraph.

However, three years later, concerns are mounting among industry leaders.

Progress towards the goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 has been sluggish, with the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) falling significantly short of the required levels.

Last year, Virgin Atlantic conducted the world’s first 100 per cent SAF-powered flight across the Atlantic to showcase the fuel’s potential.

Despite this Virgin vice president Holly Boyd-Boland stated that as things stand, there is not going to be enough SAF to meet their goal of Net Zero 2050.

The scarcity of SAF and potential solutions will be key topics at IATA’s annual meeting in Dubai.

The event will gather hundreds of airline executives, as well as representatives from Airbus, Boeing, and other manufacturers.

Currently, SAF – a refined blend of waste oils, animal fats, and corn-derived ethanol-accounts for just 0.2 per cent of jet fuel use. UK carriers are mandated to increase this to ten per cent by the end of the decade to meet government requirements.

Thank you POTUS and Secretary Rollins for continuing to roll back unnecessary regulations that stifle economic activity and send opportunity overseas.”

Governor Greg Gianforte (MT): “Under this outdated rule, nearly 58% of forest service land in Montana was restricted from road development and unable to be properly managed for fire risk. Thank you, Secretary Rollins and President Trump, for restoring common sense to active forest management.”

Senator Dan Sullivan (AK): “I welcome the decision by Secretary Rollins and President Trump to rescind the Roadless Rule and allow for proper management of US Forest System lands in Alaska. Since 2001, this rule has hindered Alaskans' ability to responsibly harvest timber, develop minerals, connect communities, or build energy projects at lower costs — including renewable energy projects like hydropower, which are especially critical to economic opportunities in Southeast Alaska surrounded by the Tongass National Forest. I am grateful that the Trump administration has once again rescinded this rule to put Alaskans back in the driver’s seat to make a living, support our families, and connect our communities while protecting our lands and growing our economy.”

Senator Steve Daines (MT): “Huge win for Montana, forest management, and wildfire mitigation. Thanks to the Trump administration and USDA for being committed to Montana-First priorities.”

Senator John Barrasso (WY): “Thank you Sec. Rollins for rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule. For years, this overreaching regulation made it harder to treat our national forests and prevent catastrophic wildfires. Eliminating this misguided rule paves the way for the Forest Service to responsibly and proactively manage our forests for the better.”

Senator Cynthia Lummis (WY): “I applaud Sec. Rollins' move to restore commonsense resource management and remove prohibitions on road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvest, allowing for fire prevention and responsible timber production.”

House Committee on Natural Resources Chairman Bruce Westerman (AR): ""This week's decision by Secretary Rollins is a massive win for restoring the health and resiliency of our federal forests, preventing catastrophic wildfire, and restoring access for the public and wildland firefighters. It acknowledges that we cannot lock up our forests and throw away the key – we need to actively manage and conserve our forests for cleaner air and water, better wildlife habitat, and safer communities. I thank Secretary Rollins and the Trump administration for repealing burdensome, overreaching federal regulations like this one.""

Representative Harriet Hageman (WY): “I commend Sec. Rollins and POTUS for taking decisive action to repeal the 2001 Roadless Rule. This outdated policy has long hindered effective forest management. I look forward to working with the USDA and local stakeholders to ensure our forests are managed responsibly, creating jobs, and preserving the resources that are vital to our way of life.”

Representative Pete Stauber (MN): “I applaud Sec. Rollins for rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule, a harmful regulation that blocked responsible forest management and timber production, increasing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. This decision marks a significant victory for MN and for communities across the nation!”

Representative Doug LaMalfa (CA): “The Forest Service is finally beginning the process to repeal the 2001 Roadless Rule—a policy that’s done more harm than good in the West. As Secretary Rollins made clear, the rule has blocked responsible forest management for over two decades, preventing thinning, logging, and the ability to build roads that are critical for wildfire response and public safety. This was a Clinton-era regulation pushed through in the final days of that administration, backed by environmental activists with no stake in what actually happens on the ground. The result was more overgrown forests, more catastrophic wildfires, and fewer jobs in rural counties that rely on active forest work to sustain their economies. Repealing the Roadless Rule won’t fix everything overnight, but it’s a major step toward restoring common-sense forest management and giving local experts the ability to do their jobs.”

Representative Nick Begich (AK): “Today’s decision by the USDA to rescind the deeply flawed and outdated Roadless Rule is yet another a major victory for Alaska. Alaska’s forests are one of our state’s greatest natural assets and the 'Roadless Rule' has long stifled responsible forest management, blocked access to critical resources, and halted economic opportunity particularly in Alaska, where 92% of the Tongass National Forest was off-limits. The Roadless Rule was never about responsible conservation; it was about bureaucratic overreach that undermined the ability of local forest managers and communities to effectively manage their lands. I commend Secretary Rollins and President Trump for their leadership in advancing this commonsense reform. By removing these blanket prohibitions, the Administration is restoring the authority of local leaders to manage our forests correctly.”

Representative Ryan Zinke (MT): “The rescission of the outdated Roadless Rule is a victory for Montana, public lands, and forest management everywhere. As I've long maintained, one of the biggest obstacles to proper forest management and wildfire prevention has been unnecessary and overbearing regulations like this one. If you can't build a road, you can't fight fires, you can't cut trees, and you can't properly take care of our national heritage held in our public lands. I applaud the President and Secretary Rollins for their initiative to allow real and needed work to be done on our national forest land.”

Representative Troy Downing (MT): “Long overdue! The USDA's move to rescind the Roadless Rule is a critical step toward responsible forest management that will help reduce wildfire risk, protect watersheds, and support rural economies.”

Representative Eli Crane (AZ): “Smart. Thank you, Sec. Rollins!”

Forest Service Chief Tom Schultz: “The forests we see today are not the same as the forests of 2001. They are dangerously overstocked and increasingly threatened by drought, insect-born disease, and wildfire. Currently, nearly half of our roadless acres – over 28 million – are at high or very high risk of catastrophic wildfire and are in desperate need of treatment. I applaud Secretary Rollins for taking decisive action to provide us with the tools and decision space we need to truly care for our forests and, in turn, protect the people and communities we serve.”

American Forest Resource Council: “The Clinton-era Roadless Rule is a relic of the past—a 25-year-old policy that has failed to protect our forests and communities from the growing threats of wildfire, insects, disease, and climate change. Since the rule was imposed, an estimated 36 million acres of National Forest System lands have burned. It’s important to remember: the Roadless Rule is a rule, not a law passed or ratified by Congress, despite a quarter-century to do so. It has often undermined Congress’s intent to actively manage federal forests and reduce risks to public lands and nearby communities. Rescinding the rule does not upend environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act or the Endangered Species Act. While we are closely reviewing the details of this proposed recission, we are supportive of reforms that modernize stewardship and give public land managers the tools they need to implement their forest plans and restore the health and resilience of these forests before we lose more of them.”

Scott Jones, CEO, Forest Landowners Association: ""The Forest Landowners Association (FLA) applauds Secretary Rollins and the Trump Administration for rescinding the Roadless Rule—an important step in eliminating regulatory barriers that hinder forest management on public lands. This action will help reduce wildfire risk and promote healthier, more resilient forests through active, science-based management. We look forward to working with Secretary Rollins to advance policies that strengthen forest markets and keep working forests productive across all ownerships. Improved management on our national forests—many of which border private lands—will reduce the spread of pests, disease, and catastrophic fire, benefitting forests nationwide. FLA remains committed to partnering with the Trump Administration to ensure family forest owners have the certainty they need through enhanced disaster recovery tools and access to emerging markets, including woody biomass, mass timber, and sustainable aviation fuel. Together, we can sustain America’s forest legacy and strengthen the nation’s wood supply for generations to come.”

American Forest Resource Council: “Yesterday Sec. Rollins announced the rescission of the 'Roadless Rule,' a de-facto prohibition on road construction, reconstruction, and timber harvest on nearly 59 million acres of the National Forest System. We welcome urgent action to address the nation's wildfire crisis.”

American Stewards of Liberty: “The roadless rule has strangled the West. No more. Thank you Sec. Rollins.”

Resource Development Council for Alaska: “Good news coming out of the USDA today regarding rescinding the 2001 Roadless Rule!”

The gross export potential could range from $4 billion to $8 billion annually,"" Wagner added.
While Indonesia's domestic market has yet to support premium pricing for renewable fuels, international mechanisms provide strong incentives.
“The question is, how Indonesia can build production facilities to profit from these incentives elsewhere with sustainable production in Indonesia,” Wagner said.
Earlier this month, Indonesia and Singapore signed several memorandums of understanding on cross-border renewable energy trade and sustainable industrial zones in the Riau Islands.","Jakarta. Indonesia has the potential to generate up to $8 billion in annual export revenue from low-carbon fuels, leveraging its vast natural resources and strategic location, according to an energy expert speaking at the Jakarta Geopolitical Forum on Tuesday.

Thomas Wagner, head of the Energy Working Group at the European Business Chamber of Commerce (Eurocham) in Indonesia, said the country should begin developing its low-carbon fuel capacity now -- rather than waiting for ideal market prices or political conditions -- as the opportunity lies in growing global demand and regulatory incentives.

""Renewable resources are not limited, so there is no reason to wait until it gets the right price or the right political situation,"" Wagner said during a forum session livestreamed by the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry.

Export Potential in Biofuels and Low-Carbon Petrochemicals

Indonesia’s export prospects in the low-carbon energy space include sustainable aviation fuel, e-ammonia, bio-LNG, biomethanol, biomethane, and other products derived from renewable electricity. These are increasingly in demand in global markets seeking to cut emissions and meet climate targets.

Wagner pointed to Indonesia’s palm oil industry as a major untapped source of biomass. “The theoretical potential is about 280 million MMBTU a year if we include biomethane from empty fruit bunches, not only affluent biomass. That's equivalent to 8 million tons of biomethanol or 4-5 million tons of bio-LNG,” he said.

""These are massive figures. The gross export potential could range from $4 billion to $8 billion annually,"" Wagner added.

While Indonesia may not be the most cost-effective location for e-ammonia production -- with countries like Australia and the Middle East offering cheaper hydrogen -- it remains highly competitive in other low-carbon fuel categories.

Strategic Advantages and Infrastructure

Wagner noted that Indonesia already has the infrastructure to support such exports, including LNG terminals in Bontang, East Kalimantan, and methanol production facilities.

He also highlighted the geographic advantage of Indonesia’s proximity to the Strait of Malacca, one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes and the largest maritime refueling hub.

“International Maritime Organization (IMO) and EU emission targets can be met by refueling with low-carbon fuels in the Strait of Malacca, for example in Dumai if the fuel is there,” he said.

Indonesia could also deliver biomethane via pipeline to nearby markets such as Singapore, taking advantage of biomass availability in Sumatra.

However, Indonesia is not alone in this opportunity. Malaysia, on the other side of the Strait of Malacca with similar access to biomass in Sabah and Sarawak, and comparable export facilities, is also well-positioned to tap into the same regional and global markets.

While Indonesia's domestic market has yet to support premium pricing for renewable fuels, international mechanisms provide strong incentives. Wagner cited the IMO's net-zero program and the EU's maritime emissions regulations, which impose steep penalties on non-compliant fuels.

He also pointed to Japan's plan to replace up to 90 percent of its natural gas with renewable gas, and South Korea's open tenders for low-carbon hydrogen, which offer significant incentives.

“The question is, how Indonesia can build production facilities to profit from these incentives elsewhere with sustainable production in Indonesia,” Wagner said.

He stressed that exporting clean energy is not a new concept. Earlier this month, Indonesia and Singapore signed several memorandums of understanding on cross-border renewable energy trade and sustainable industrial zones in the Riau Islands.

“The longer we wait, the more we miss out. Use the resources to generate exportable goods, use internationally available incentives to get a premium price on these renewable goods, and then have all that infrastructure and production facility available as soon as there is demand domestically,” Wagner said.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a type of fuel that is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or synthetic sources.","Introduction to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The aviation industry is under increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, with greenhouse gas emissions being a significant concern. One promising solution is the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which has the potential to significantly reduce the industry's carbon footprint. In this comprehensive guide, we will explore the SAF supply chain, its implications on Aviation Environmental Law, and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

Overview of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a type of fuel that is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass, waste, or synthetic sources. SAF is designed to be a drop-in replacement for conventional fossil-based jet fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines without modification. The production of SAF involves converting feedstocks into a fuel that meets the stringent standards required for aviation fuel.

Importance of SAF in reducing aviation emissions

The aviation industry is responsible for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, and this number is expected to grow as air travel continues to increase. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The use of SAF can help airlines meet their emissions reduction targets and contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry.

Brief history of SAF development

The development of SAF began in the early 2000s, with the first commercial flights using SAF taking place in 2011. Since then, there has been significant progress in the production and adoption of SAF, with several airlines and airports committing to using SAF in their operations. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has set a target of 2% of global aviation fuel being SAF by 2025.

SAF Production and Supply Chain

The production and supply chain of SAF is complex and involves several stages, from feedstock sourcing to fuel distribution.

Overview of SAF production processes

There are several production pathways for SAF, including:

Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis: This process involves converting biomass or waste into a synthetic gas, which is then converted into a liquid fuel.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): This process involves converting vegetable oils or animal fats into a fuel that meets aviation standards.

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): This process involves converting alcohols, such as ethanol or butanol, into a jet fuel.

Feedstock options for SAF production

The choice of feedstock is critical in determining the sustainability and cost of SAF. Some common feedstocks include:

Biomass: Agricultural waste, forestry residues, and algae are all potential biomass feedstocks.

Waste: Municipal solid waste, waste cooking oil, and other waste materials can be used to produce SAF.

Synthetic sources: Power-to-liquid and other synthetic production pathways are being developed.

Logistics and distribution of SAF

The logistics and distribution of SAF are similar to those of conventional jet fuel, with some additional considerations. SAF must be stored and transported separately from conventional fuel to avoid contamination. The fuel must also meet strict quality standards to ensure safe use in aircraft.

The following flowchart illustrates the SAF supply chain:

Aviation Environmental Law and SAF

Aviation Environmental Law is a complex and evolving field, with various regulations and policies aimed at reducing the environmental impact of aviation.

Overview of Aviation Environmental Law

Aviation Environmental Law encompasses a range of issues, including greenhouse gas emissions, noise pollution, and air quality. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is the primary international body responsible for developing standards and recommended practices for aviation environmental protection.

Regulations and policies supporting SAF adoption

Several regulations and policies are supporting the adoption of SAF, including:

ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA): This scheme allows airlines to offset their emissions by using SAF.

The European Union's Renewable Energy Directive (RED): This directive sets targets for the use of renewable energy in transportation, including aviation.

The United States' Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS): This standard sets targets for the use of renewable fuels, including SAF.

Challenges and opportunities for SAF in Aviation Environmental Law

While there are several regulations and policies supporting the adoption of SAF, there are also challenges to be addressed. These include:

Ensuring the sustainability of SAF feedstocks

Developing consistent standards for SAF production and use

Addressing the higher cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel

The following table summarizes some of the key regulations and policies supporting SAF adoption:

Regulation/Policy Description CORSIA Allows airlines to offset emissions by using SAF RED Sets targets for renewable energy use in transportation RFS Sets targets for renewable fuel use

Challenges and Future Directions

While SAF has the potential to significantly reduce aviation emissions, there are several challenges to be addressed.

Technical challenges in SAF production and use

Some of the technical challenges in SAF production and use include:

Ensuring the quality and consistency of SAF

Developing more efficient production pathways

Addressing the compatibility of SAF with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure

Economic and policy challenges for SAF adoption

The higher cost of SAF compared to conventional jet fuel is a significant challenge to adoption. Policy measures, such as tax incentives or subsidies, may be needed to support the development of the SAF industry.

Future directions for SAF research and development

Research and development are ongoing to improve the production and use of SAF. Some areas of focus include:

Developing new feedstocks and production pathways

Improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of SAF production

Investigating the use of SAF in different aircraft engines and applications

The following equation represents the lifecycle emissions reduction potential of SAF:

Emissions reduction=Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel−Lifecycle emissions of SAFLifecycle emissions of conventional fuel×100\text{Emissions reduction} = \frac{\text{Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel} - \text{Lifecycle emissions of SAF}}{\text{Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel}} \times 100Emissions reduction=Lifecycle emissions of conventional fuelLifecycle emissions of conventional fuel−Lifecycle emissions of SAF​×100

For example, if the lifecycle emissions of conventional fuel are 100 gCO2e/MJ and the lifecycle emissions of SAF are 20 gCO2e/MJ, the emissions reduction potential of SAF would be:

Emissions reduction=100−20100×100=80\text{Emissions reduction} = \frac{100 - 20}{100} \times 100 = 80%Emissions reduction=100100−20​×100=80

Conclusion

Sustainable Aviation Fuel has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental impact of aviation. Understanding the SAF supply chain and its implications on Aviation Environmental Law is crucial for supporting the adoption of SAF. While there are challenges to be addressed, ongoing research and development are helping to improve the production and use of SAF.

As a trusted partner, ENGIE will help us significantly reduce energy consumption and industrial emissions at our European sites by 2030,” Julie Kitcher, Airbus chief sustainability officer, said in a statement. “The combination of Airbus's on-the-ground expertise and ENGIE's technical expertise will be a winning formula for achieving our goals.”

Among the key strategies being pursued by Airbus and ENGIE include decarbonization of heat production, which will include installation of electric heat pumps and biomass boilers. The facilities also will be fitted with energy-efficiency technologies such as low-energy-consumption lamps and smart metering systems, while solar panels will be installed on shade structures, roofs and open grounds.

ENGIE will operate and maintain the new energy infrastructure assets with commissioning schedule no later than 2029.

Airbus, which has headquarters in France and the Netherlands, manufacturers its airplanes across multiple countries. The company delivered nearly 650 aircraft units in 2024, according to reports.","https://img.energytech.com/files/base/ebm/energytech/image/2025/06/685ac44af61007a5d135fcd1-airbus_manufacturing.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-24 13:10:36.758630

Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.
SAF can power our economy, provide us with a vital diplomatic and international trade tool, and advance American energy dominance.
It’s time for Congress to provide the durable policy support that SAF producers need to secure America’s energy leadership.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has moved from the margins of energy policy to the forefront of America’s energy future. Once viewed as a long-shot innovation, SAF is now a commercially viable, rapidly scaling solution to power our aviation sector while revitalizing rural economies and advancing our national goals for energy dominance. As SAF production accelerates, Congress and the Trump administration have an opportunity to cement America’s leadership in aviation fuel innovations by extending long-term tax credits that support domestic SAF production.

This sector’s momentum is undeniable. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently reported that SAF production in the U.S. surged from 2,000 barrels per day at the end of 2024 to 25,000 barrels per day by February 2025. As of May, production capacity stands at roughly 30,000 barrels daily, and industry projections suggest we could approach 500,000 barrels per year by the end of 2025.

SAF’s explosive growth is a direct response to policy certainty and strategic investment—but we are only getting started. I recently spoke with Alison Graab, Executive Director of the SAF Coalition, about this issue. She rightly noted, “The biggest barrier we hear from our coalition members is the need for a longer-term market signal for SAF investment.” Without it, this American success story and the promise it offers to our country’s economy risks being outsourced.

That’s because SAF, at its heart, is an innovation and jobs engine. The entire SAF value chain—from feedstock cultivation to production and refining—offers new economic lifelines to American farmers and rural communities. These fuels are derived from a wide variety of sources, including agricultural residues, waste oils, and even woody biomass. SAF development creates stable demand for these materials, opening new revenue streams for growers and foresters. During our conversation, Graab concurred about the significant potential offered by SAF, “There are so many additional benefits that really offer a lot of opportunities to this administration and Congress.” Put simply, SAF can transform America’s heartland into an energy innovation engine.

Global demand for SAF is projected to soar as countries implement mandates and incentives to power their aviation sectors. As I spoke with Graab, she highlighted how the United States is well-positioned to lead, with more production facilities online than any other nation. “We can see the U.S. continue to grow that by helping to export and fulfill what other countries need in addition to the U.S.,” Graab emphasized. This growth offers America an important energy diplomacy tool and a new source of revenue through SAF exports. At a time when many nations are competing to develop cutting edge energy technologies, America’s ability to scale SAF production is a geopolitical advantage we cannot afford to squander.

Fortunately, Congress is awake to this challenge and has already taken an encouraging step in the right direction. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by the U.S. House of Representatives includes an extension of the 45Z clean fuels production tax credit through December 2031. This is exactly the kind of long-term policy signal investors need to deploy capital into SAF projects. Extending this credit is a critical win, but more must follow. We must ensure the SAF-specific tax credit structure remains robust, technology- and feedstock-neutral, and predictable over the next decade.

To deliver on SAF’s promise, policymakers must act boldly. Long-term certainty around 45Z and related credits is the clearest path forward. Equally important is for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to modernize its regulatory treatment of feedstocks like woody biomass to unlock hundreds of millions of gallons of potential fuels. The American SAF industry knows how to scale. We have the infrastructure, we have the feedstocks, and we have the know-how. Now we need Washington to follow through to unleash this potential to advance our American energy dominance agenda.

The opportunity before us is historic. SAF can power our economy, provide us with a vital diplomatic and international trade tool, and advance American energy dominance.

Justin Smith, Astrika Adams",,,,,https://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/renewables/1639808/epa-proposes-new-renewable-fuel-standards,"The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a landmark rule revising the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program.
Companies that produce or import gasoline or diesel fuel used in the United States must blend renewable fuels or purchase credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet annual targets set by EPA.
These annual targets, referred to as Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), specify the quantity of each category that must be used.
eRIN Program Overhaul: EPA proposes eliminating electricity generated from biogas used in electric vehicles (eRINs) as a qualifying fuel under the RFS program.
The Agency structured the proposal to ensure that if it decides to grant these exemptions, the result will not be to reduce the overall renewable fuel obligation, as has occurred in the past.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a landmark rule revising the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program. This proposal – termed the ""Set 2"" Rule - marks the 20th anniversary of the RFS program and reflects a major policy pivot toward bolstering domestic renewable fuels production and exports and supporting U.S. agricultural producers. At the same time, the Set 2 Rule would eliminate the eRIN program in its current form.

RFS Program Background

The RFS program was established through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, as amended by the Energy Independent and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, to mandate a minimum volume of renewable fuel (e.g., ethanol, biodiesel, and advanced biofuels) to be blended into transportation fuel used in the United States. Companies that produce or import gasoline or diesel fuel used in the United States must blend renewable fuels or purchase credits known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) to meet annual targets set by EPA. These annual targets, referred to as Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs), specify the quantity of each category that must be used.

Key Takeaways for Clients

Highest-Ever Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs): Trade associations representing both renewable fuels and the oil and gas sectors had jointly written to the EPA Administrator asking EPA to adopt ""strong, steady volumes"" under the RFS, citing investments in the industry and ""increasing demand in new markets such as marine, rail and aviation."" If finalized, the 2026-2027 requirements would establish the most ambitious RVOs in the program's history, aiming to significantly expand U.S. production of biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel; the Rule could also boost production of sustainable aviation fuel. The proposal maintains current volumes for ethanol and slightly reduces RVOs for cellulosic biofuel due to limited supply and production capacity.

Differentiation between Domestic and Foreign Fuels: The proposal introduces a new two-tier structure for RIN valuation, granting domestic biofuels and feedstocks full credit while assigning only 50% RIN value to foreign equivalents. This framework is designed to favor U.S. producers and limit the RFS compliance value for imports.

eRIN Program Overhaul: EPA proposes eliminating electricity generated from biogas used in electric vehicles (eRINs) as a qualifying fuel under the RFS program. This move signals a reorientation of the RFS away from supporting the electronic vehicle market and reinforces a focus on liquid biofuels.

Small Refinery Exemptions. There are over 150 petitions for small refinery exemptions currently pending before EPA. EPA states that it anticipates deciding its approach to the 2026-27 exemptions by the time the proposal is finalized. The Agency structured the proposal to ensure that if it decides to grant these exemptions, the result will not be to reduce the overall renewable fuel obligation, as has occurred in the past.

Energy Security Impacts: EPA estimates the proposal would reduce U.S. oil imports by approximately 150,000 barrels per day over 2026-2027. The U.S. is already a net exporter of petroleum products; the Set 2 Rule would further reinforce the nation's status as a net exporter of petroleum products.

Trade Implications: The Rule aligns with recent U.S. trade policy developments, including a new zero-tariff ethanol agreement with the U.K., reinforcing efforts to expand global markets for American-grown biofuels.

Next Steps

EPA will accept public comments until August 8, 2025, on the proposal following its publication in the Federal Register. EPA will host a public hearing on July 8 and July 9. Register for either hearing by emailing RFS-Hearing@epa.gov. We anticipate a final rulemaking later this year.

They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating Sustainable Aviation Fuels, starting in the German domestic market. We are confident that such ‘Sustainable Corporate Value Fare’ is going to be successful across the Business Travel ecosystem.”

Customized options for more sustainable flying with SAF

The Lufthansa Group offers several special fares for corporate customers: With the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare”, business customers can offset up to 30 percent of the CO₂ emissions calculated for their individual flight through the use of SAF in flight operations. The Lufthansa Group also offers companies the opportunity to invest in larger quantities of SAF through SAF bulk deals.

Background: The use of SAF in the Lufthansa Group

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called “drop-in” fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be blended with it without any problems. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is blended with fossil jet fuel or produced in a process known as co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with fossil oil) and then fed into the airport infrastructure. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group’s flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire life cycle, the SAF from biogenic residues used by the Lufthansa Group has a CO2 footprint that is around 80 percent lower than that of conventional kerosene made from fossil crude oil.",https://www.breakingtravelnews.com/images/sized/images/uploads/airline/Screenshot_2025-06-24_at_08.54.51-700x438.png,N,,2025-06-24 11:18:40.287899

You can’t call that jet fuel sustainable if you do it using fresh oil.
“Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).” In Malaysia the gap is even wider because the government subsidizes fresh cooking oil.
Restaurants can buy cooking oil on the cheap for 60 cents, use it a bit, and resell it for a dollar.
Buy the fresh oil for 60 cents, don’t use it, and sell it for $1.","I’ve written about how ESG adventures of airlines have gone bad. It usually involves fraud. Delta got caught up in a scandal ‘ESG but evil’.

They claimed to be carbon neutral. They’re an airline burning jet fuel but they were buying carbon credits. The carbon credits turned out to be not so good. The money disappeared. The carbon credits were fake. Deforestation benchmarks were completely fabricated. And they sold the same credits multiple times. The forest’s owner went on the record, to the New Yorker, “I don’t know what you’re going to report on this, and I hope to God it’s not all of it, because I probably will go to jail.”

But what if sustainable aviation fuel was actually causing more deforestation, and turned out not to be re-using oils?

Bloomberg‘s Matt Levine writes about the arbitrage where – thanks to subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel – used deep fryer oil costs more than fresh oil.

You can make jet fuel out of palm oil.

You can’t call that jet fuel sustainable if you do it using fresh oil. If you give used cooking oil a second life, that’s sustainable.

Airlines are pushing the narrative that this is the future of low emissions aviation – pivoting from fossil fuels and reusing resources – and getting governments to step up and pay for it.

So used oil is sold at a premium.

Restaurants use oil, and resell it at a profit!

You can take palm oil, put it in a deep fryer, use it to make french fries, reuse it again and again until it becomes gross and the fries taste bad, and then take the used oil and sell it to a refiner to make jet fuel. Also works with olive oil, soybean oil, lots of cooking oils. This is a very nice fact about the world!

Since used cooking oil can be marketed as sustainable to airlines and governments, it commands a premium – even though the energy content of both is the same. “Fresh cooking oil is more useful to cooks than used cooking oil (it tastes better), but it is less useful to refiners and airlines than used cooking oil (it doesn’t reduce their carbon impact).”

In Malaysia the gap is even wider because the government subsidizes fresh cooking oil. Restaurants can buy cooking oil on the cheap for 60 cents, use it a bit, and resell it for a dollar.

If you don’t run a restaurant the trade is even better? Buy the fresh oil for 60 cents, don’t use it, and sell it for $1. “The refiner probably isn’t going to taste it” to know that it hasn’t been sitting in a deep fryer.

This trade actually increases the demand for palm oil and the resulting deforestation, rather than re-using palm oil. It turns out that’s what’s happening, “incidents of fraud is very high.”

Even without fraud, homes and restaurants in Malaysia now replace cooking oil after a single use in order to generate more ‘used’ oil to sell, rather than re-using it 3-5 times the way they’ve always done. And now you know why deep fried foods in Malaysia are so fresh!",https://viewfromthewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/upscalemedia-transformed.webp,N,,2025-06-24 11:19:19.447902

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

Netherlands publishes RED III biofuels draft

London, 24 June (Argus) — The Dutch government's updated draft legislation to transpose the EU's revised Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) notably proposes abolishing double-counting renewable energy contributions from Annex IX feedstocks. The draft introduces a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction mandate for land, inland shipping and maritime shipping, but excludes aviation — which was included in a previous draft . The RED III mandate will take effect in 2026. Obligated parties have to fulfil the mandate by surrendering a sufficient amount of so-called emission reduction units (EREs) in each sector. The mandate's flexible credit allowance allows EREs generated in the land sector to be used to partly meet emission reduction obligations in inland and maritime shipping ( see table ), but EREs from inland and maritime shipping cannot be used by land sector suppliers to fulfil their compliance requirements. Fuel suppliers with overall consumption of more than 500,000 l/yr will need to incorporate a 14.4pc share of renewable fuels in their annual deliveries in 2026. This increases linearly, to reach 27.1pc in 2030. The amount of crop-based biofuels in the land sector will be limited to 1.4pc of the overall energy content of total consumption until 2030, and will not be accepted towards targets in maritime and inland shipping and aviation. The amount of Annex IX Part B biofuels — such as used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — that can be counted towards the mandate will be limited to 4.29pc in the land sector and 11.07pc in inland shipping. Obligated parties will be unable to claim EREs from Annex IX Part B fuels used in maritime shipping. The draft also introduces a minimum share of emission reductions that have to be achieved by Annex IX Part A and renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO), for all sectors. RED III mandates that 5.5pc of all fuels supplied must be advanced biofuels, including at least 1pc RFNBOs by 2030. The Netherlands' draft decouples these targets, to reduce investment uncertainty ( see table ). Refineries that use renewable hydrogen in their production process can claim refinery reduction units — or RAREs — which can be used by a supplier to meet an RFNBO sub-target in various sectors. Correction factor delay The ministry will delay its plans to apply a ""correction factor"" of 0.4 to its ""refinery route"" stimulus for hydrogen demand, in order to ensure the measure does not undermine direct use of hydrogen in transport. The correction factor means the value of emissions reductions credits generated through the use of renewable hydrogen for transport fuel production would be limited to a certain percentage of those generated through direct use of renewable hydrogen or derivatives in transport. The government leaves the option open to impose a correction factor from 2030. Although the EU Fuel Quality Directive increases the maximum share of bio-based components to 10pc in diesel, the Dutch government said fuel suppliers must continue to offer B7 — diesel with up to 7pc biodiesel — as a protection grade, because of the large number of cars incompatible with B10. Companies will be able to carry forward any excess EREs to the next compliance year. Companies with an annual obligation can carry forward up to 10pc of the total amount of EREs needed to fulfil their obligation in a year, with registering companies allowed to carry forward 4pc. Dutch renewable fuel tickets (HBEs) carried into 2026 will be converted into EREs on 1 April 2026, the government said.

Following the introduction of the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate, which came into force on 1 January, 2025 Alfanar, is signaling its broader commitment to scaling SAF production and investment in the UK. The Saudi engineering and construction firm has opened its new UK headquarters in central London.

“With the third largest aviation network in the world and a third of Europe’s carbon storage capacity, the UK is perfectly positioned to be a world leader in SAF production and a future hub for our European green fuel’s operation,” said Alfanar Chief Investment Officer, Mishal Al Mutlaq.

UK SAF mandate

As from the start of this year, the UK’s SAF mandate outlines that at least 2 per cent of jet fuel used on flights departing the UK must be SAF. This figure rises incrementally to 10 per cent by 2030 and 22 per cent by 2040, where it will remain pending future supply security. Alfanar is currently developing a waste-to-SAF production plant in Teesside to help meet this demand.

Alfanar’s new office in the UK capital will be home to its project development business, including the global hub for their transport decarbonisation business. Alfanar currently employs around 120 people across the UK.

Waste-to-SAF production plant in Teesside

Alfanar’s GBP 2 billion waste-to-SAF production facility in Teesside, known as Lighthouse Green fuels, is currently going through the Development Consent Order planning process and is slated for completion in 2029. The facility will be essential to decarbonising the UK’s aviation sector, producing 180m litres of SAF each year. That’s enough to power 27,000 short-haul flights.

With the UK currently processing its SAF revenue certainty mechanism bill through Parliament, the opening of Alfanar’s new base in the capital coincides with this development which will assure investors of the potential to deliver future SAF projects in the UK.

Vote of confidence

Minister for Investment, Baroness Poppy Gustafsson CBE, attended the opening, where she said Alfanar’s investment in the UK is a “major vote of confidence in not only our economy but this country’s green investment environment.”

She also noted that the UK is “serious about fostering the benefits of net zero, that’s why we’ve identified clean energy as a key growth sector in our upcoming modern Industrial Strategy.”

Meanwhile, Al Mutlaq welcomed the British Government’s steps to help deliver the assurances required to develop a UK SAF market. “With continued support, our Lighthouse Green Fuels project will cut aviation emissions whilst establishing a new British green industry in Teesside and attracting significant inward investment to the region and the UK,” he said.",https://www.regionalgateway.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Alfanar-opens-London-HQ-with-Baroness-Poppy-Gustafsson-CBE.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 11:19:27.968328

Until now.

Tax credits for wind and solar helped launch an upheaval in America’s utility sector, reduced the cost of renewables, fueled a surge in wind and solar installations, and drove a sustained decline in climate pollution from U.S. power plants.

Now they’re on the congressional chopping block.

Republican lawmakers are debating a mass repeal of clean energy tax credits that were passed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Eliminating the credits would be the most significant climate rollback by President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who already have scrapped carbon dioxide limits on power plants, repealed California’s authority to set tailpipe standards, and halted permitting for new wind projects on federal lands or waters.

But in targeting tax credits for wind and solar, Republicans would end one of the few clean energy policies that historically enjoyed bipartisan support.

“There isn’t much that has been consistent or durable beyond those tax credits,” said Barry Rabe, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and longtime scholar of U.S. climate policy.

Initially conceived as a response to the 1970s oil crises, the credits have evolved over the decades from a means of reducing the costs of alternative energy technologies to America’s carbon-cutting tool of choice. They have been effective in transforming wind and solar from bit players into power-sector workhorses.

Wind and solar collectively generated about 16 percent of the country’s electricity last year, exceeding the output from coal for the first time. The rise of renewables has coincided with a sustained drop in American power plants carbon dioxide emissions, which have fallen 38 percent since 2005. Natural gas and improved energy efficiency also have played a key role in reducing coal generation and lowering emissions.

The success of wind and solar tax credits stand in contrast to other U.S. attempts to curtail planet warming pollution. Attempts to establish a national carbon price effectively ended with the demise of a 2009 cap-and-trade bill, which passed the House but failed in the Senate. Efforts to regulate power plant emissions have never been fully implemented. Rules for tailpipe emissions have gotten tougher, but their stringency frequently seesaws between Democratic and Republican presidential administrations.

Republicans have targeted the credits before, arguing they distort markets and drive up energy costs. But those efforts notably encountered resistance from Republicans or were used as a bargaining chip between the two parties. In 2015, Republicans and Democrats struck a deal to lift a decades-old ban on oil exports in exchange for an extension of renewable credits.

When Democrats took power in 2021, they focused on expanding the credits. Part of the reason was simple politics: Democrats at the time held only a narrow majority in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is needed to pass nonbudgetary bills. But the effort also reflected a belief that tax credits could drive down the cost of clean energy technologies, boost domestic clean energy manufacturing and create jobs.

The Inflation Reduction Act expanded the tax credits from wind and solar to everything from nuclear and geothermal to sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen. It enhanced existing credits for electric vehicles and carbon capture and sequestration. And it added bonuses for companies that bought American-made components, hired union labor and built in communities with fossil-fuel-based economies.

“Part of the premise of the IRA is politically you couldn’t do a price because public support wasn’t going to be there. You couldn’t do regulation because you couldn’t put it in the reconciliation in the Senate,” Rabe said. “But you could use subsidies and incentives and build a political constituency that would underpin support against any backlash. That so far doesn’t seem to be holding.”

It remains to be seen how far Republicans will go in repealing the credits. There are notable differences between the Senate and House bills thus far. Draft budget language released last week by the Senate Finance Committee would preserve credits for resources such as geothermal and nuclear, which can generate zero-carbon electricity around the clock, as well as subsidies for batteries. The House bill went further in eliminating those subsidies.

The bills also differ in how they would treat wind and solar. The Senate Finance Committee would phase out the credits by the end of 2028. The House version would require projects to begin construction 60 days after the bill’s passage and enter operation by 2028 to receive the money.

Critics of the credits argue they are wasteful, particularly given the precipitous drops in wind and solar prices over recent decades. Renewables are among the most cost-effective sources of new power generation, even without the subsidies.

But supporters maintain the federal assistance is still necessary to drive the rapid deployment of renewables that’s needed to cut emissions in time to avoid the worst impacts of a warming planet. Many advocates have couched their arguments in economic terms at a time when climate has fallen down lawmakers’ list of priorities, saying wind and solar are the best placed to help meet a rapid rise in electricity demand because they can be built faster than other energy resources.

“If you take away the PTC [production tax credit] and the ITC [investment tax credit] on deployment, energy bills will go up because 90 percent of what we built last year was solar and batteries,” said Leah Stokes, a prominent climate activist and professor who studies energy policy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

The PTC and the ITC are the two primary subsidies enjoyed by renewable projects.

Most analysts agree that renewable development will continue without the subsidies, but at a slower pace. Exactly how much slower remains an open question. A range of government institutions and research organizations have sought to compare the rate of clean energy deployments with and without the Inflation Reduction Act credits. Their findings vary, depending on the assumptions they make about a series of external factors, ranging from interest rates and natural gas prices to trade policy and grid interconnection rules.

A March study by the Electric Power Research Institute, which compared 10 models produced by different organizations, found that the credits remain a cost-effective tool for cutting emissions. It estimated the credits abatement cost at $96 per ton of carbon dioxide, lower than social cost of carbon estimates that range from $100 to $360 per ton of CO2.

“The carbon benefits of tax credits are lower than the cost by quite a large margin,” said John Bistline, a senior program manager at EPRI who authored the study. “What we see is that when you look at the average across models, the Inflation Reduction Act incentives tend to roughly double the amount of clean electricity capacity deployment over the next decade.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2e/8b/4e3e2711449e831aa7ce865df122/climate-wind-energy-71969.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 12:12:49.639695

New York, 23 June (Argus) — Ontario is considering requiring that domestically produced renewable fuels make up 3pc of the province's diesel pool, an effort to help biodiesel producers struggling to adapt to policy changes in the US. Ontario late last week requested input on a proposal to supplement existing provincial biofuel blend requirements with a new mandate for Canadian production, similar to a domestic content rule that took force in British Columbia this year. Ontario already requires that renewables like biodiesel and renewable diesel make up 4pc of diesel consumption each year, but this proposal would require that three-fourths of that mandated volume come from biofuels produced in Canada. The Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks says the proposal is in response to a new clean fuel tax credit that took effect in the US this year, which can only be claimed by US producers. A US Department of Agriculture report late last year said that there were six remaining operational biodiesel plants in Canada and that the industry has historically sent almost all its fuel into the US, which up until this year treated foreign biodiesel as eligible for a federal tax credit. At the same time, US biofuels have increasingly entered Canada to meet demand from low-carbon fuel standards federally and in British Columbia. In those programs, higher-carbon fuels that exceed annual carbon intensity limits incur deficits that suppliers must offset with credits generated from approved lower-carbon alternatives. The Canadian biofuel industry has pushed officials to respond. British Columbia as a result began requiring this year that renewables make up a minimum 8pc of diesel fuels supplied in the province, up from 4pc, and that this mandated volume must come from Canadian producers starting in April. British Columbia-based renewable diesel producer Tidewater Renewables has also unsuccessfully pushed Canada to impose duties on US product. The Ontario environment ministry said the domestic mandate, if finalized, would be a ""temporary, time-limited measure"" that would last as long as US subsidies ""threaten Ontario's biodiesel industry."" The new US tax credit that excludes foreign refiners is currently set to lapse after 2027, but Republican lawmakers have floated using a massive budget bill they want to pass in the coming weeks to extend the incentive through 2031. While full regulatory text is not available, as is typical for this early stage of the Ontario rulemaking process, it appears the proposal would otherwise keep intact the general structure of the province's biofuel mandate. The program offers more credit to lower-carbon fuels, which led to a slightly lower than 4pc biofuel blend rate for the diesel pool in 2023, according to a report from trade group Advanced Biofuels Canada. The domestic content proposal would also not affect a separate mandate that biofuels make up increasing amounts of the gasoline pool through 2030.

Raft of issues impacting Spanish biodiesel industry

Barcelona, 23 June (Argus) — Fraud, uncertainty, competition from hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), changes to US biofuel regulations, technical issues and stubbornly weak margins are combining to negatively impact the Spanish biodiesel industry. Spanish producers continue to complain about weak margins, with widespread talk of low production levels and units halting completely. These sentiments have continued all this year. Some uncertainty over the EU's sustainability verification process, and its accreditation body the ISCC are also mentioned by companies. One producer said ""everyone is waiting, for the ISCC to take action to remove certificates."" Some of these certificates concern imports of feedstock such as used cooking oil (UCO) but also cargoes of HVO from the Asia-Pacific region. Competition between biodiesel and HVO for blending into diesel is not new, has previously been the subject of ire in France and appears likely to remain problematic in Spain. Fraud cases in excess of €500mn ($576mn) from 2023 remain outstanding, the end to the US' blenders tax credit — which has halted exports to the US — and operational issues with Spain's SICBIOS accounting system, are not helping the industry. The energy ministry this month extended the application for provisional tickets for the first half of the year to 31 August, as ""technical issues with the system have prevented the correct functioning of the SICBIOS software."" Spanish biodiesel imports have increased this year, pushing the country to being a net importer, which is rare. According to customs data, imports rose by 45pc on the year to 270,000t in January-April. The main increases came from the Netherlands, now Spain's largest supplier, which provided 105,000t, up from 70,000t on the year. Malaysia, Italy, Belgium and Malta all boosted supplies, shipping 25,000-40,000t. Cargoes labelled as Maltese are unusual and not supported by Argus tracking or Kpler data. Exports continued to drop sharply — to 190,000t in January-April, lower by 67pc year on year and a 10-year low for the period (see chart) . Spain has long acted as a distribution hub for imports from outside the EU, re-exporting cargoes to regional buyers, but these have all but halted. Exports of over 50,000t in April were the third lowest for any month since November 2017 — only January and March this year were lower. Such low exports are in line with apparent weak production — assessed by Argus using import, export, demand and stocks data. This fell by 53pc on the year to 435,000t in the first four months of this year.

It positions the state, and its sugar sector, at the forefront of India’s next-generation biofuel revolution.","Uttar Pradesh is preparing to take a bold step toward redefining India’s bioenergy future by

unveiling its vision of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Manufacturing Promotion Policy 2025, the first of its kind in the country. The vision of the policy was unveiled by UP Government’s Chief Secretary, Manoj Kumar Singh during a roundtable at Invest UP. During the roundtable, key investors, policy experts, and senior government officials came together to explore SAF manufacturing opportunities, underscoring the state’s intent to position itself as a leading hub for green energy innovation.

The envisioned policy holds the potential to drive meaningful transformation, not only in India’s clean energy trajectory but also in the fortunes of UP’s sugar industry. By enabling the integration of agricultural waste into the SAF value chain, the policy aims to align environmental responsibility with rural economic revival. This initiative aligns with the state’s vision of becoming a $1 trillion economy and a leader in sustainable industrial growth.

From Ethanol to Aviation Fuel: The Next Logical Step

Ethanol and Sustainable Aviation Fuel: Complementary Pillars of Clean Energy

India’s sugar industry has played a central role in driving the ethanol blending programme, enabling the country to make significant progress toward its E20 target. This shift has delivered multiple benefits: a steady revenue stream for sugar mills, reduced sugar surplus, improved payment cycles for farmers, and greater energy security. While the ethanol ecosystem continues to scale and evolve, it is equally important to explore parallel opportunities that can further strengthen the green energy transition and expand value creation for the sugar sector.

One such opportunity lies in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With global aviation facing increasing pressure to decarbonise, SAF is emerging as a high-potential, low-emissions alternative to conventional jet fuel. Much like ethanol opened up a second vertical for sugar mills, SAF can serve as a complementary third, unlocking even greater value from existing agricultural and industrial ecosystems while advancing India’s broader clean energy goals.

Policy Provisions with Transformational Potential

The proposed policy outlines an ambitious roadmap for SAF production in Uttar Pradesh, with a strong focus on agri-residues as feedstock. Notably, it includes byproducts from sugarcane processing, such as molasses and bagasse, as viable inputs for SAF, which could be a game-changer for the sugar sector.

To attract investment and spur adoption, the policy proposes a suite of incentives: capital subsidies, interest subventions, stamp duty waivers, and significant support for land acquisition. Developers setting up units in eastern UP and Bundelkhand would be eligible for up to 80% land subsidy, while those in central and western regions could avail 75%. These incentives have already drawn investor interest, with commitments worth over ₹3,000 crore under discussion, an encouraging sign for a policy still in its draft stage.

Opportunities for Sugar Mills and Farmers Alike

The policy’s inclusion of sugar sector residues marks a pivotal moment. It offers mills a chance to diversify revenue streams, strengthen margins, and reduce reliance on sugar prices. More importantly, if SAF production becomes a viable commercial vertical, it could further stabilise mill operations, resulting in more predictable, timely payments to sugarcane farmers.

The ripple effect would be felt across rural Uttar Pradesh. Biorefineries co-located near sugar mills could create skilled and semi-skilled employment and stimulate ancillary industries. For farmers, this represents not just better prices but a more integrated, future-ready agricultural value chain.

Challenges That Need Strategic Attention

Despite its promise, the upcoming policy’s success will depend on overcoming significant challenges. SAF production from lignocellulosic material such as bagasse involves complex biochemical or thermochemical processes that are still capital-intensive and commercially nascent. Moreover, SAF remains considerably costlier than traditional jet fuel, potentially slowing adoption unless supported by long-term financial mechanisms or carbon pricing frameworks.

Logistics present another hurdle. Efficient collection, aggregation, and transport of

biomass, especially from smallholder farms, require infrastructure that does not yet exist at scale. Additionally, for the policy to achieve its intended impact, it must integrate seamlessly with national biofuel mandates, aviation sector regulations, and India’s net-zero commitments.

Collaboration is key

Realising the potential of this upcoming policy will require robust collaboration between

Government, industry, and the farming community. Public-private partnerships can play a crucial role in accelerating infrastructure development, while targeted R&D investments will be essential to reduce the cost and complexity of SAF production. At the same time, farmer outreach—through education, fair pricing models, and consistent engagement—will be key to ensuring reliable, long- term supply of biomass feedstock.

At Triveni Engineering & Industries Ltd., we see this policy as a positive move overall. If implemented effectively, it could give Uttar Pradesh an early advantage in this sector and provide additional momentum to the sugar industry. With a strong presence across UP’s sugar belt and extensive experience in sugar, ethanol, and co-generation, Triveni is uniquely positioned to support the SAF transition. We have state-of-the-art distilleries spread across Muzaffarnagar (MZN) – 2 facilities, Sabitgarh (SBT), Milak Narayanpur (MNP) and Rani Nangal (RNG) in Uttar Pradesh with cumulative distillation capacity of 860 KLPD. These facilities have the capability to produce Ethanol, Extra Neutral Alcohol (ENA), Rectified Spirit (RS) and Denatured Spirit (SDS). The Company utilises a mix of sugarcane-based feedstocks as well as grain.

We have also consistently championed the diversification of the sugar sector into renewable energy solutions. As SAF approaches policy-supported adoption, we at Triveni Engineering are in a strong position to capitalize on emerging trends and drive profitable growth in the future.

Overall, Uttar Pradesh’s SAF policy could be more than a regulatory document; it is a signal of intent. It positions the state, and its sugar sector, at the forefront of India’s next-generation biofuel revolution. By building on the ethanol ecosystem, the policy can help unlock a cleaner, more diversified, and economically resilient energy future.",https://www.chinimandi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/SAF-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-5.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 05:00:27.276281

Today, the vision is beginning to materialise. According to the June 2025 Global Project Tracker by the Mission Possible Partnership, there are now 22 SAF plants in operation globally, with a promising pipeline of 144 projects. This makes aviation one of the most advanced sectors in the global clean industrial transition, accounting for 20% of all clean industrial project announcements to date.

However, while the number of proposed plants is rising, the sector faces a hard reality: progress from announcement to actual construction remains slow. In the past six months, only one aviation project globally reached final investment decision (FID). That’s far from the pace required to meet decarbonisation targets. For aviation to align with net-zero pathways, SAF production must scale dramatically—and quickly.

Policy support takes the lead

Globally, momentum is building thanks to a growing chorus of mandates and incentives. In Europe, the ReFuelEU initiative has set binding SAF blending mandates of 2% by 2025 and 6% by 2030. The United States, meanwhile, is backing SAF with a patchwork of federal and state-level incentives, including tax credits and research funding. This policy support is beginning to move the needle—but only just. Of the 144 projects in the aviation pipeline, only seven have reached FID, and many are still struggling to lock in buyers or secure affordable feedstock.

The majority of SAF today still comes from biomass pathways such as HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), while advanced e-fuels produced through Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes remain expensive and immature.

Against this backdrop, the Middle East is emerging as a potential game-changer. The Mission Possible Partnership identifies a “New Industrial Sunbelt” of countries with abundant solar energy and favourable production conditions. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman, and Egypt are all included in this emerging group. These countries are not only investing in green hydrogen—the base ingredient for synthetic SAF—but are also developing strong infrastructure, competitive energy prices, and export-oriented strategies. The MENAT region already accounts for 20% of the global ammonia project pipeline, much of it green, signalling strong alignment with future aviation fuel supply chains.

Challenges on the ground

Yet, the opportunity is not without its risks. While the region boasts natural advantages, policy frameworks remain fragmented, and domestic demand for SAF is still in its infancy. Without clear national blending mandates or incentives for airlines to adopt SAF locally, the Middle East may struggle to justify large-scale production purely for export.

Moreover, without long-term offtake agreements, many projects will remain stuck in planning, vulnerable to the same setbacks that have delayed or cancelled SAF facilities in Australia and Europe.

Still, the sector’s potential remains immense. If all announced SAF projects worldwide are completed, they would generate 48 million tonnes annually—enough to meet over 100% of projected EU airport fuel needs by 2030. But that is a big if. The current pace of less than 15 FIDs per year is far too slow. For SAF to truly take off, the industry needs a surge in financing, greater policy clarity, and, above all, demand certainty.

Middle East can be first mover

There is a window to act. The next five years will define whether aviation becomes a decarbonisation leader or a late mover.

For countries in the Middle East, the stakes are even higher. With abundant solar potential, vast land availability, and significant state-backed infrastructure investments, the region could position itself as a global hub for SAF production.

But to do so, governments and industry players must move beyond announcements and pilot projects. They must create the conditions—regulatory, financial, and commercial—for the first wave of SAF to become a mainstream fuel alternative, not just a niche solution.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/06/24/bornil-amin-dVFp_nt-OO4-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-24 05:00:35.203190

Adding to this structural imbalance are additional costs that undermine the competitiveness of African airlines.
This is not the case for African airlines, which for the most part do not generate profits.
On the African continent, airplane tickets remain among the most expensive globally, particularly on intra-African routes.","While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum globally, Africa is lagging behind. Prohibitive costs, a lack of infrastructure, and a reliance on European standards threaten to leave the continent sidelined in aviation's green transition. Will sustainable flight, too, become a privilege reserved for the Global North?

As international air transport aims to accelerate its shift to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Africa appears notably absent from this green movement. The continent has only five recorded SAF projects and a projected production capacity of 0.6 million tonnes by 2030. This places Africa on the sidelines of a transition considered vital for global aviation's future.

While the aviation sector accounted for just 2.4% of global CO2 emissions in 2020, according to a study in Atmospheric Environment, its trajectory is concerning. A more recent study revealed that business aviation emissions increased by 46% worldwide between 2019 and 2023. This trend intensifies pressure on airlines to adopt alternative fuels and, by implication, highlights Africa's struggle to keep pace, given it accounts for only 2% to 3% of global air traffic.

Sky-high Costs

Despite these challenges, projections for African air traffic growth are substantial. In 2024, 175 million passengers traveled through the continent's airports, up from 95 million a decade prior. This number is expected to double to 345 million by 2043, an annual growth rate of 3.7%. However, this boom remains largely underexploited. Eighty percent of passengers travel internationally, and over three-quarters fly with non-African carriers. Intra-African connections, crucial for regional economic integration, remain infrequent, uncompetitive, and poorly served. The Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), intended to accelerate progress, seems hindered by sovereignist movements.

Adding to this structural imbalance are additional costs that undermine the competitiveness of African airlines. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), jet fuel averages 17% more expensive in Africa than elsewhere. Taxes and fees are 12% to 15% higher, while insurance and maintenance costs exceed the global average by 6% to 10%. Financing is also about 30% more expensive than in other regions. In this environment, introducing SAF, which currently costs two to three times more than fossil fuel, seems initially inconceivable.

""Even if we adhere to these climate goals, it must be recalled that the cost of SAF is extremely high,"" Abderahmane Berthé, Secretary General of the African Airlines Association (AFRAA), told Ecofin Agency at IATA's 81st General Assembly in New Delhi in June 2025. ""European or American airlines, which are profitable, can afford this transition. This is not the case for African airlines, which for the most part do not generate profits. They will not be able to adopt SAF without solid financial support.""

Of the $32.4 billion in net profit generated by the global aviation sector in 2024, a 3.4% margin, Africa accounted for only $200 million, less than 0.6%. This marks the first time since the COVID-19 crisis that African IATA member airlines, generally the larger ones, have reached this level of profitability. Another indicator illustrates the disparity. In 2024, African airlines earned on average barely one dollar per passenger carried, compared with over $27 in the Middle East and a global average of $7.2. This significant gap reveals the sector's structural constraints on the continent.

Not an Isolated Case

Africa's situation is not entirely unique. In India, where the domestic market is booming, SAF also remains out of reach. ""Our customers will not pay ten dollars more per ticket to fly green,"" Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo, summarized during a high-level panel at the same assembly. His observation, though made in an Asian context, directly echoes African realities, where price sensitivity is even more pronounced.

On the African continent, airplane tickets remain among the most expensive globally, particularly on intra-African routes. According to AFRAA, taxes, fees, and airport charges can account for up to 40% of a ticket’s price in some countries. Operational costs remain abnormally high, and low traffic density severely limits economies of scale.

Abundant Resources, But Little Industrialization

Under these conditions, introducing SAF would only complicate an already untenable equation for African airlines. Price reductions, let alone large-scale adoption, are impossible without massive support.

Yet, resources are abundant. Sub-Saharan Africa has ample agricultural residues, forest biomass, and municipal waste that could form a sustainable and competitive basis for SAF production. However, the exploitation of these resources remains embryonic. Of approximately 60 Power-to-Liquid (PtL) projects planned worldwide by 2030, only 10 are currently under construction, primarily in Europe and North America. None are on the African continent.

This finding is especially concerning given that global efforts remain marginal. According to Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, while ""it is encouraging to note that SAF production is expected to double to reach 2 million tonnes in 2025, that represents only 0.7% of total aviation fuel needs. And even that relatively low quantity would raise the global fuel bill by $4.4 billion.""

Marie Owens Thomsen, Chief Economist at IATA, believes the problem is not a lack of raw materials but the capacity to industrialize processes quickly. ""There is enough sustainable biomass to meet climate objectives. It is not a resource problem, but a technological deployment problem,"" she explained. Preeti Jain, head of the IATA Net Zero program, shared a similar sentiment, stating, ""Government support is essential to accelerate the scaling up of SAF technologies.""

AFRAA's appeals echo this observation. In its 2024 report, the association highlighted the absence of a clear regulatory framework, a lack of fiscal incentives, and the near non-existence of production infrastructure on the continent. AFRAA believes only a strategic alliance among governments, multilateral donors, and private actors will allow Africa to participate in this energy transition rather than remain a spectator.

Barriers to Lift

Even where conditions are more favorable, the technological hurdle remains formidable. The deployment of these fuels currently relies on technologies, most of which are still experimental. According to Gauri Jauhar, Executive Director at S&P Global, 70% of the technologies expected to play a key role by 2050 have not yet reached commercial maturity. In Asia, pilot projects leverage algae or municipal waste, as Boeing recently announced in Japan. However, these initiatives remain isolated and struggle to achieve profitability without a coherent industrial policy.

Another widely discussed stumbling block during the annual assembly is taxation. Christof Rühl, an economist at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, advocates for a system based on price signals rather than outcome requirements. ""If carbon emission remains free, nothing will change,"" he believes. He noted that while energy efficiency improves by 2% annually worldwide, carbon intensity stagnates due to a lack of financial incentive.

In practice, SAF mandates adopted in Europe or the UK risk having adverse effects, industry players warn. IATA estimates an immediate additional cost of $1.2 billion resulting from the SAF blending requirement from January 1, 2025, and $1.7 billion in indirect costs due to ""implicit premiums.""

""For the million tonnes of SAF we plan to purchase to meet European obligations by 2025, the market-price estimate is $1.2 billion. Added to that are $1.7 billion in compliance costs, a total surcharge that could have reduced 3.5 million tonnes of CO2,"" IATA, which represents over 80% of the global industry, stated in a press release. Airlines complain that ""Instead of encouraging SAF use, European mandates have made it five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.""

African Exclusion on the Rise?

This observation is not trivial for Africa. Several African airlines already fly to Europe or plan to expand their network there. However, this new reality may hinder those prospects. For African carriers flying to Europe, these requirements translate into massive additional charges, likely exacerbating inequalities of access to global skies in a market already dominated by Northern players.

Among major operators, skepticism prevails. Joanna Geraghty, CEO of JetBlue, worries about increasing administrative complexity related to green taxation, especially in a context of regulatory fragmentation. ""There is a risk of double taxation, administrative surcharges, and growing pressure on tax departments, which must now sit at the table in strategic decisions,"" she warned.

For Adrian Neuhauser, CEO of Abra Group, the key lies in educating public decision-makers. ""Many still ignore the major economic contributions of the aviation sector. There needs to be an explanatory effort, notably at the level of dossier handlers within administrations,"" he believes.

Rare initiatives, such as FedEx integrating SAF into its cargo operations, also face cost issues. ""We terminated a pilot program because it was three times more expensive than conventional fuel,"" revealed Richard Smith, CEO of the group’s Express division

Stay Grounded or Take Off with the Others?

Given this situation, the temptation is strong to revert to more immediate solutions such as fleet renewal, flight-plan optimization, and improved ground procedures. ""The technology is not there yet, volumes neither. What is needed is a realistic approach, based on what is feasible in the short term,"" Richard Smith concluded.

One certainty remains: if current conditions persist, Africa will be unable to finance its own aviation energy transition. Inclusion of the continent in climate finance mechanisms, implementation of incentive policies, and more direct support from multilateral donors are indispensable for SAF not to become a luxury reserved for wealthy countries.

While today’s business leaders meet in many venues across the Twin Cities, George’s key point about acceptance and belonging still resonates in 2025.
The Itasca Project has been an initiative convening business and other community leaders to make the Twin Cities a better place.
“The CEO job is far tougher than when I was a CEO,” George said.
He talked about the importance of business leaders and government officials building stronger and better relationships, so they will more fully understand the business climate, economic, and social challenges that exist.","Political polarization, activist investors, and increasing time demands on public company CEOs could be used as excuses for corporate executives to limit their involvement in civic affairs.

But they are reasons that were rejected by three well-known business leaders who took part in a panel discussion June 2 at the Minneapolis Club, which was a follow-up to TCB’s February article “Are CEOs Walking Away from Civic Leadership?” The event was hosted by the Harvard Club of Minnesota.

“We will only have thriving communities if we have thriving companies. We need each other,” said Christophe Beck, chairman and CEO of St. Paul-based Ecolab.

“We are at a time where we need CEO engagement the most,” Beck said. But he added that it’s challenging for many top executives to follow through and share their time, expertise, and resources in the communities where their companies are located.

“It’s almost an impossible task to be engaged in the community,” he said. “The world is getting more complicated by the day. How many quarters can a CEO afford to miss [financial projections]? Is it two? Is it three?”

Beck was joined on the panel by Bill George, former Medtronic CEO and executive fellow at the Harvard Business School, and Tim Welsh, former vice chair of consumer and business banking at U.S. Bank and the new president of Chicago-based CCC Intelligent Solutions, Inc.

The three panelists identified why CEOs must make the time to affect civic affairs, but they also stressed that top corporate executives need to foster company cultures that encourage community involvement by employees below the CEO level.

Leader relationships drive involvement

At its core, civic engagement flows from the relationships that corporate executives have internally at their companies and with their peers at other businesses. The civic ethos is transferred and broadened when senior executives and CEOs mentor younger businesspeople and welcome them to the civic arena.

George isn’t a Minnesota native, and he could have moved to Boston after he left the Medtronic CEO role. From 2004 to 2022, George was a professor of management practice and senior fellow at the Harvard Business School where he taught leadership courses. He chose to keep his primary residence in Minnesota, and he often flew from the Twin Cities to Boston to teach his courses.

“It would be naïve to suggest you’re not influenced by the people you work with and see every day and influenced by your community,” George said. When he was a young executive and serving on a United Way panel, he recalled that James McFarland, former General Mills CEO and chairman, told him that he wanted to propose that George become a member of the Minneapolis Club. It was the place where the community’s movers and shakers held their meetings. When George accepted a job at Honeywell instead of Dayton Hudson, he said that former CEO Ken Dayton told him that he was glad he was remaining in the Twin Cities.

While today’s business leaders meet in many venues across the Twin Cities, George’s key point about acceptance and belonging still resonates in 2025. George said that it’s critical for newly promoted executives and those new to the Twin Cities to have the “feeling that you’re really part of something greater than yourself and feeling like you are welcome in the community.”

George and his wife Penny decided to be longtime residents of the Twin Cities and created a family foundation. They support health, leadership, environmental, and other programs. “We love this community,” he said.

Welsh, who joined CCC Intelligent Solutions in March, divides his time between the Twin Cities and Chicago and prioritizes civic involvement in both communities.

Welsh, who spent more than 26 years at McKinsey & Co., was part of the birthing process for the Itasca Project that came into being about two decades ago. The Itasca Project has been an initiative convening business and other community leaders to make the Twin Cities a better place.

It serves as the “dining room table” where “people from government, business, and nonprofits have come together to get to know each other,” Welsh said. He emphasized the need for those gatherings to be continuous, if business leaders are going to be sufficiently plugged in to social and economic needs as well as form civic partnerships.

“Think about how many CEOs change, how many nonprofit leaders change, how many government leaders change,” Welsh said. “Unless we as a community are intentionally in the process of relationship building and relationship renewal, we can’t get anything done civically because we won’t know each other.”

Welsh is referring to in-person meetings, not simply Zoom or Teams virtual meetings. “If we don’t know each other, then we don’t trust each other,” Welsh said. “Then good things won’t happen.”

When the CEO gets involved

Beck chairs Greater MSP, which promotes economic development in the metro region. He elected to spend some of his CEO time to help establish Minnesota as a hub for sustainable aviation fuel, a project that receives Greater MSP staff support.

When he assesses where to allocate civic involvement time, Beck asks himself where “my time can actually make a difference.”

Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian reached out to Beck and enlisted his help on the aviation fuel issue. “Those are projects that are really hard to get off the ground because these models do not exist,” Beck said. “There’s not a company that’s producing sustainable aviation fuel, which is fuel coming from a crop, basically.”

For this initiative to succeed, it requires participation from many partners. “You need to have agriculture, you need to have chemistry, you need a refinery, you need to have an airline, you need to have an airport,” Beck said. “How do you bring those constituencies, those stakeholders together? There is no framework whatsoever for it. That was a perfect example where the CEOs had to be involved.”

Based on business-related time demands, Welsh said that CEO time for specific civic affairs projects could be quite limited. “If we can only get a few hours of CEO time, what is the best use of that time?” Welsh asked. “How can we align that time with the interests of the business and the interests of the community? The answer is generally not going to be sitting on the governance committee of your favorite nonprofit.”

Welsh is a strong advocate of involving people at multiple levels of a business in civic projects. He recently took part in a University of Minnesota event for the Minnesota Young American Leaders Program. “It brings together people from all over the state, in their 30s and 40s, who want to be civically engaged,” Welsh said. “We need to remember that we are part of a decades-long tradition in this community where business leaders, government leaders, and nonprofits have all built relationships and come together, and we need to nurture this.”

While George embraces the participation of mid-level and senior leadership executives in civic endeavors, he stresses the importance of CEO involvement in civic affairs as well as making public statements on important issues.

“The CEO job is far tougher than when I was a CEO,” George said. In the current political environment, there’s “the temptation [for CEOs and companies] to be pulled away from their purpose and their values,” he said. A former Target board member, George expressed concern about the diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) retrenchment that Target did early this year.

Downtown St. Paul trio

Successful companies often are approached to move to other cities, states, and countries.

“We’re heading for very difficult times,” Beck said, noting the recruitment “competition that we have in Minnesota with other states, other countries that are coming here.” He said that Singapore has established an office in Chicago that’s charged with enticing U.S. companies to locate in Singapore.

“We’re not in a great place right now, so the risk that companies go out is way bigger than companies coming in,” Beck said. He talked about the importance of business leaders and government officials building stronger and better relationships, so they will more fully understand the business climate, economic, and social challenges that exist.

“We have everything we need to win,” Beck said. “So, if we get organized, if we trust each other, if we do [things] the right way, there is zero doubt in my mind that we will get to the right place.”

As part of his civic engagement, Beck serves on the Saint Paul Downtown Alliance board with Securian CEO Chris Hilger. Beck, Hilger, and Minnesota Wild owner Craig Leipold have become a band of brothers for revitalizing downtown St. Paul.

“We’ve become such close friends,” Beck said. They’ve pledged to each other to remain in St. Paul, despite the struggles downtown has faced in the post-Covid period. “It’s this friendship, this relationship, the trust, the commitment,” he said, which propels him to keep focusing on progress.

The Saint Paul Downtown Alliance wants to lead a rejuvenation of the business sector. But it also addresses homelessness and public safety—controversial topics that some executives might want to avoid.

A few years ago, when many citizens were criticizing local police, Beck remembers being invited to a police gala by Todd Axtell, former chief of the St. Paul Police Department. “I decided to go with Nadine, my wife,” Beck said. He remembers thinking: “We need to go there. This is important. We can’t complain about public safety in town and not be there.”

Beck characterized the police social event as “remarkable,” and another opportunity for building relationships among people with very different roles. But he stressed that a CEO needs to choose issues where he or she can have a substantive and positive effect on the community.

“I don’t think it’s right to speak up on everything all the time,” Beck said.

The aviation industry is one of the significant contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for around 2.5% of global CO2 emissions[^1](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/climate-change/). Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as a crucial component in reducing the aviation sector's carbon footprint. SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional fossil fuels, made from renewable resources such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and algae.

Overview of SAF and its Environmental Benefits

SAF offers several environmental benefits, including:

Reduced greenhouse gas emissions: SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel[^2](https://www.safug.org/benefits-of-saf/).

Lower sulfur emissions: SAF produces fewer sulfur emissions, contributing less to air pollution.

Improved air quality: The use of SAF can lead to a decrease in particulate matter and other pollutants.

Current State of SAF Adoption in the Aviation Industry

Despite its benefits, SAF adoption remains limited due to high production costs and limited availability. Currently, SAF accounts for less than 1% of global aviation fuel consumption[^3](https://www.iea.org/reports/aviation). However, many airlines, airports, and governments are investing in SAF production and infrastructure to increase its adoption.

Importance of SAF in Reducing Aviation's Carbon Footprint

The aviation industry has committed to reducing its carbon emissions, with the goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050[^4](https://www.iata.org/en/programs/environment/climate-change/carbon-offsetting/). SAF is expected to play a vital role in achieving this goal, with estimates suggesting that it could contribute up to 65% of the industry's emissions reductions[^5](https://www.safug.org/benefits-of-saf/).

Incentives Under Aviation Environmental Law

To encourage the adoption of SAF, governments and regulatory bodies have introduced various incentives under Aviation Environmental Law. These incentives aim to reduce the costs associated with SAF production and use, making it more competitive with conventional jet fuel.

Tax Credits for SAF Production and Use

Tax credits are a significant incentive for SAF production and use. In the United States, the Blender's Tax Credit provides a credit of up to $1.50 per gallon of SAF blended with conventional jet fuel[^6](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-aviation-fuel-tax-credits). Similarly, the European Union's ReFuelEU initiative proposes a tax exemption for SAF[^7](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12374-ReFuelEU-Aviation-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuels_en).

Subsidies and Grants for SAF Research and Development

Subsidies and grants are also available to support SAF research and development. The U.S. Department of Energy's Bioenergy Technologies Office provides funding for SAF research and development projects[^8](https://www.energy.gov/eere/bioenergy/sustainable-aviation-fuels). The European Union's Horizon Europe program also provides grants for SAF research and innovation[^9](https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/funding/funding-opportunities/horizon-europe_en).

Regulatory Measures Supporting SAF Adoption

Regulatory measures are also being implemented to support SAF adoption. For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has established a global SAF mandate, encouraging countries to adopt policies supporting SAF use[^10](https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/SAF.aspx). The European Union's ReFuelEU initiative also proposes a mandate for SAF use in EU airports[^11](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regulation/have-your-say/initiatives/12374-ReFuelEU-Aviation-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuels_en).

Future Prospects and Challenges

While SAF has made significant progress in recent years, there are still challenges to be addressed to achieve widespread adoption.

Emerging Trends in SAF Technology and Production

Emerging trends in SAF technology and production include:

Advanced feedstocks: New feedstocks such as algae, agricultural residues, and municipal waste are being explored for SAF production.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) technology: PtL technology involves converting renewable electricity into liquid fuels, offering a promising pathway for SAF production.

Waste-to-Jet: Waste-to-Jet technology involves converting waste materials into SAF, reducing waste disposal costs and generating revenue.

Challenges in Scaling Up SAF Production and Use

Despite the progress made in SAF technology and production, several challenges remain, including:

High production costs: SAF production costs are currently higher than conventional jet fuel, making it challenging to achieve economies of scale.

Limited availability: SAF is not widely available, and infrastructure investments are needed to support its adoption.

Regulatory frameworks: Regulatory frameworks supporting SAF adoption are still evolving and need to be harmonized globally.

Future Regulatory Developments and Their Implications

Future regulatory developments are expected to play a crucial role in shaping the SAF market. The ICAO's global SAF mandate and the European Union's ReFuelEU initiative are expected to drive SAF adoption. Additionally, countries such as the United States and Singapore are implementing policies to support SAF production and use.

The following equation represents the potential emissions reduction from SAF adoption: Emissions Reduction=∑i=1n(SAF Productioni×Emissions Factori) \text{Emissions Reduction} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\text{SAF Production}_i \times \text{Emissions Factor}_i) Emissions Reduction=i=1∑n​(SAF Productioni​×Emissions Factori​) where nnn is the number of SAF production pathways, SAF Productioni\text{SAF Production}_iSAF Productioni​ is the amount of SAF produced through pathway iii, and Emissions Factori\text{Emissions Factor}_iEmissions Factori​ is the emissions reduction factor associated with pathway iii.

Conclusion

Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as a critical component in reducing the aviation industry's carbon footprint. Incentives under Aviation Environmental Law, including tax credits, subsidies, and regulatory measures, are supporting SAF adoption. While challenges remain, emerging trends in SAF technology and production, along with future regulatory developments, are expected to drive the growth of the SAF market.

“With class and dignity, Fred Smith created an enduring business and industry that has touched the lives of billions,” Bolen said.","The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) today marked the passing of former FedEx CEO Fred Smith, the company’s world-renowned founder and a tireless business aviation advocate throughout his pioneering career.

“Fred Smith changed the world with his creation of the cargo airline industry, but he always credited business aviation with helping make FedEx the company it is today,” NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen said. “NBAA is proud that FedEx has been a member company since 1983, because the company has continually represented the values and professionalism NBAA has promoted since its inception.”

FedEx began its operations utilizing Dassault Falcon 20 aircraft, one of which is today displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum’s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia. Over time, FedEx operated the world’s largest fleet of Cessna Caravans.

In 2012, NBAA recognized Smith with its Al Ueltschi Humanitarian Award for his contributions to the international nonprofit ORBIS, which operates a “Flying Eye Hospital” and training center credited with restoring sight to more than 23 million individuals around the world.

Smith, a prominent spokesperson for NBAA’s No Plane No Gain program highlighting business aviation’s value, was featured in the advocacy campaign’s Business Leaders on Business Aviation publication. A statement he made for the publication, which today is proudly displayed in the lobby of the company’s Memphis, TN headquarters reads:

“Business aviation has been an integral part of FedEx’s success since the day we were founded. The military calls it a ‘force multiplier,’ and that’s what business aircraft have been for FedEx. They’ve given us the capability to fight above our weight, and with the enormous global network we have in place today, they allow our people to move around the world in a much more efficient and productive fashion than would have been the case had we not operated with business aircraft!”

Smith, a champion for all forms of innovation in the aviation sector, was an early advocate for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In a March 2021 hearing of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Smith highlighted the work of FedEx with “industry, government agencies, academia and alternative fuel suppliers” to pursue the production and use of the fuel.

In addition to being recognized as one of the country’s great business leaders, Smith was a patriot. He joined the U.S. Marines and served two tours of duty during the Vietnam War. He was also a tremendous philanthropist whose hard work and generous donations reflected his passion for aviation and the military.

“With class and dignity, Fred Smith created an enduring business and industry that has touched the lives of billions,” Bolen said. “He made our country and the world better. We will miss him greatly.”","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/06/6859cea9913f347082499363-nbaa_logo.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-06-23 19:02:38.578072

SãO PAULO, BRAZIL, June 23, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The acceleration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) sits at the intersection of commercial urgency, technological maturity, and international coordination. The Society for Low Carbon Technologies (SFLCT) operates at this nexus, bridging policy, industry, governments, and early-stage project development, with its own members and related entities actively moving sustainable fuel projects forward. Prior to the passage of Brazil’s 2024 watershed Fuel of the Future law, SFLCT’s Chairman of the Board, Fernando C. Hernandez, engaged in a formative SAF initiative—anticipating legislation mirroring the U.K., where SAF advancement became a legal mandate. This positioning was guided by SFLCT’s role in helping shape the law’s carbon capture component and its active presence across both nations. The company behind this initiative—now a milestone—would later sign Brazil’s first SAF-from-biogas agreement, a development covered in detail below.

Another milestone includes the $6 billion clean fuels project in Uruguay, where SFLCT served as a convening platform between ANCAP (Uruguay’s national energy company) and HIF Global, helping catalyze the agreement. SFLCT then hosted a U.S. event titled “How CO₂ and Hydrogen Storage Create Sustainable Chemicals and Fuels.” There, Syzygy Plasmonics outlined a trajectory toward what is now recognized as an industry-first SAF plant in Uruguay, approved in June for development. Arcadia eFuels did the same for its first planned commercial site in Denmark. Ahead of the event, Hernandez met with Amy Hebert, CEO of Arcadia eFuels and Co-Chair of Project SkyPower, a CEO-led SAF coalition, to discuss cross-sector movement through the Project SkyPower platform.

Hernandez states, “This decade is pivotal to unlocking SAF globally. Our organization remains at the forefront of convening and backing projects, aligned with the cross-sector ambition embodied by Project SkyPower.”

In Brazil in 2024, Hernandez met with Alessandro Gardemann, Founder and CEO of Geo Biogas & Carbon, a leading biogas innovator in the country, along with the company’s engineering team. He conducted a site review at one of their biomethane facilities that harnesses and valorizes ethanol waste, recognizing its viability for conversion into SAF. That trajectory culminated in Geo Biogas signing Brazil’s first SAF-from-biogas agreement, marking a new chapter for a nation long recognized for its biofuel leadership.

Three of the four projects above are now reflected within SFLCT through Giovanni Fiori Tini (New Technologies & Advanced Fuels, Geo Biogas), Cecilia Romeu (Energy Transition Engineer, ANCAP), and Murtuza Marfani (SVP Development, Syzygy), who serve on SFLCT’s advisory board, reinforcing global momentum and expanding the organization’s international reach. Hernandez emphasizes that SFLCT’s infrastructure provides a neutral, trusted anchor for sustained engagement. It supports multinational policy alignment, institutional cooperation, and platform-wide scale—ensuring that SAF progress is systemic and not episodic.

This model extends to Global North and Global South government engagements. The former is reflected through Hernandez and Chris Thomson, then Minister Counsellor of the Scottish Government in the U.S., meeting in 2023 at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., to discuss sustainable fuels and Scotland’s energy transition. More recently, Hernandez engaged with Panama’s Secretary of Energy, proposing that sustainable fuels serve not only aviation but also maritime transport, helping decarbonize vessels transiting the Panama Canal. He expanded on this vision during his keynote at the 17th International Gas & Energy Forum (IGEF), led by SFLCT advisory board member and IGEF CEO Miguel Zabala-Bishop.

Hernandez concludes by stating that SAF-powered aircraft transcend being fixed assets such as carbon capture plants. They are net-zero engines in motion, embedded across global fleets. They cross borders, unify skies, and form the living infrastructure of a low-carbon future. They require no retrofit and are drop-in ready, fully compliant with existing aviation standards.

In an open letter to European ministers, companies including Airbus, Boeing, Air France-KLM, IAG and easyJet said investment in SAF production is being held back because “existing public support mechanisms are not sufficient to address ... two critical market failures,” with these being lack for revenue certainty for producers and price risk for offtakers.

In this article, we will explore FedEx's recent initiative to incorporate Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at one of the busiest airports in the world. We'll break down why this matters, what it means for FedEx's operations, and how it fits into the broader movement for greener skies and other airlines.

With aviation accounting for roughly 2-3% of global carbon emissions, the shift toward sustainable fuel alternatives is more urgent than ever. FedEx, one of the world's largest cargo airlines, has announced its first major US SAF deployment at LAX, marking a significant milestone in the carrier's journey toward carbon-neutral operations. This guide will analyze the details of this initiative, explore its potential impact, and examine why sustainable fuels are a key component of aviation's future.

The FedEx SAF Initiative At LAX

FedEx's decision to introduce Sustainable Aviation Fuel at LAX marks a significant milestone for both the company and the broader cargo aviation sector. Partnering with renewable fuel producer Neste, FedEx has secured 3 million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to be supplied at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), setting a precedent for future sustainability efforts across its network.

The SAF, made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials such as used cooking oil and biomass, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, according to Neste. FedEx's fleet at LAX includes Boeing 777Fs, 767-300Fs, and MD-11Fs, all of which can use SAF without any modifications. This makes the transition beneficial not only environmentally but also operationally.

The delivery of 3 million gallons is expected to fuel FedEx's LAX operations for a year, marking the company's first major SAF deployment in the United States. This aligns with FedEx's broader goal of achieving carbon-neutral operations globally by 2040, a target announced by the company in March 2021 and mentioned in the press release. The move also sets a benchmark for other cargo operators to consider SAF as a viable option for reducing aviation emissions.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is increasingly viewed as one of the most promising tools for reducing aviation's carbon footprint in the near term. Unlike electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft, SAF can be utilized today with existing aircraft, making it a vital bridge solution until new technologies are developed.

According to CarbonClick, SAF not only reduces CO2 emissions but also cuts other pollutants, such as sulfur oxides and particulate matter, thereby improving air quality around airports. The Port of Seattle explains that the economic ripple effect of SAF is equally significant, as it creates jobs across the supply chain, from farmers growing feedstocks to processors converting waste into fuel.

You can watch a detailed video from Neste that explains what SAF is and how it works below:

Transport & Environment review provides some interesting statistics that help us understand a broader picture of global SAF supply and usage. While SAF (including e-kerosene and biofuel) currently accounts for less than 0.1% of total aviation fuel consumption worldwide, initiatives like FedEx's LAX project may help accelerate demand and investment in SAF, particularly in the United States, where less than 25% of airports offer SAF.

As more airlines and cargo carriers adopt SAF, economies of scale can drive down production costs, making it more accessible across the industry. Currently, the world-leading SAF user is the European Union, including extra-EU countries such as the UK and Turkey, with over 60% of airports having either introduced or are in the process of making SAF available for aircraft refueling. However, the use of this sustainable fuel is a relatively recent implementation, and only time will tell if this experiment is successful on such a large scale.

The Role Of FedEx's Fleet In The Sustainability Shift

FedEx operates one of the largest cargo fleets in the world, with over 400 planes in active service. The company's aircraft play a central role in achieving its sustainability goals. Understanding the makeup and scale of this fleet helps put the LAX SAF deployment into perspective.

According to Planespotters.net, FedEx's fleet consists of 473 different aircraft, including both jets and turboprops, ranging from the small turboprop ATR-42/72 to the largest two-engine plane in the world, the Boeing 777, as well as some older models such as McDonnell Douglas MD-11s and Airbus A300s. While newer aircraft are more fuel-efficient, the ability to use SAF in both new and old aircraft types amplifies its environmental benefits. The LAX deployment involves some of FedEx's most fuel-thirsty routes, making the SAF switch even more impactful. Here is the list of the most common FedEx aircraft flying from LAX:

FedEx's use of SAF at LAX also sends a message to the global aviation sector: large-scale cargo operations can incorporate greener solutions without compromising performance or reliability. As older aircraft remain in the fleet for years to come, SAF provides an immediate pathway to emissions reductions while the industry works toward fleet modernization.

Challenges And Opportunities In Scaling SAF

Despite its apparent environmental benefits, SAF faces notable challenges, including limited supply, high production costs, and logistical barriers. These hurdles make FedEx's LAX deployment all the more significant.

Producing SAF at scale requires a reliable supply of feedstocks and strong refining capacity. Sustainable feedstocks must be carefully sourced to prevent competition with the food supply and avoid indirect land-use change. Currently, SAF is two to five times more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, making long-term contracts and partnerships crucial for driving growth.

By committing to a large SAF order, FedEx helps signal demand, encouraging further investment in production and distribution infrastructure. As more cargo and passenger carriers follow suit, the industry can move closer to making SAF a mainstream fuel source, reducing its reliance on fossil fuels.

Global And Industry Implications Of FedEx's LAX Move

Many may wonder: How does FedEx's SAF use at LAX fit into the global push for aviation decarbonization? The answer lies in both symbolism and substance.

FedEx's move is more than a local operational shift; it marks one of the largest SAF commitments by a cargo airline in the US. According to ESG Today, this not only advances FedEx's own emissions goals but also aligns with global initiatives, such as the International Air Transport Association's (IATA) target of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Here is another video, this time from the Wall Street Journal, that explains whether it is possible and how to achieve such a bold goal:

FedEx's LAX initiative helps normalize the adoption of SAF in cargo operations, a sector often overlooked in sustainability discussions. As cargo carriers account for a significant share of global flights, their participation is crucial to achieving aviation-wide climate targets.

Looking Ahead: FedEx's Sustainability Roadmap

FedEx's LAX SAF deployment is just one piece of its broader sustainability strategy. The company is also investing in electric ground vehicles, energy-efficient sorting facilities, and route optimization technologies to reduce overall emissions.

Looking ahead, FedEx plans to continue expanding the use of SAF across its global network, taking into consideration lessons learned from the LAX project. The success of this initiative could pave the way for similar deployments at other major hubs, both in the USA and abroad. Time will show us the viability of this project.

Experts suggest that while SAF is a critical piece of the puzzle, it must be combined with broader systemic changes, such as policy support, cross-industry partnerships, and technological innovation, to achieve full decarbonization of aviation. FedEx's leadership at LAX offers a glimpse into how large logistics players can help shape a more sustainable future for air transport.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reduction.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 17:04:11.757678

Quite the opposite.

This mosaic of existing and emerging economic activities was compiled in a pioneering analysis by two institutes: Arapyaú and Itaúsa. The report gives substance to the oft-repeated claim that Brazil is a provider of climate and nature-based solutions—with the private sector as the driving force.

Titled “Soluções em Clima e Natureza do Brasil” (Brazil’s Climate and Nature Solutions), the report was launched last week in Brazil and will be re-released later this week in London during the London Climate Week. It presents real-world examples aligned with what Brazil’s COP30 presidency—set for November in Belém—calls the “action agenda.”

The findings are based on 66 expert interviews and map out mature, growing, and promising technologies across Brazil’s key economic sectors.

The report offers a snapshot of how the private sector is decarbonizing and making advances in agriculture and livestock, forests, energy, and the circular economy—the sectors most responsible for emissions in Brazil’s greenhouse gas inventory.

Marcelo Furtado, head of sustainability at Itaúsa and executive director of the Instituto Itaúsa, wore a T-shirt made of cellulose to the interview. “This is an example of both energy and material transition,” he said, “as we’re producing fabric from cellulose instead of relying on petroleum-based materials.”

In the forestry sector, the cultivation of native species is seen as a promising avenue that could reshape the timber and carbon credit markets while also contributing to Atlantic Forest restoration.

“Environmental restoration, which ten years ago was seen as something for ‘tree huggers,’ now attracts funds and major investors looking for business opportunities,” wrote businessman Pedro Wongtschowski in one of the essays included in the report.

Another contributor, Roberto Waack—board member of Instituto Arapyaú, MRBF Global Foods, and Wise/Braskem Plásticos—said that “in today’s context of weakened multilateralism, a hyper-complex geopolitical environment, growing polarization, and domestic political fragility, the Brazilian private sector has no choice but to assume global leadership in this agenda.”

Renata Piazzon, executive director of Instituto Arapyaú, highlighted an issue that often goes unmentioned. “Organized crime, illegal land grabbing, illegal mining—these things are all working very well,” she said pointedly. “This report, in a way, is a counterpoint to that. We need to make what’s right actually work.” She added: “That means giving visibility to existing solutions—and making sure they’re not isolated cases.”

In the energy sector, the report classifies ethanol—Brazil’s most widely used biofuel—as a mature technology. Biogas and biomethane are considered emerging solutions, while advanced biofuels and green hydrogen are labeled as promising.

Coldplay’s Music of the Spheres World Tour is proving that live music can be low-carbon and still totally epic. Since 2021, they’ve cut direct CO2 emissions by 59% compared to their last big tour in 2016–2017. That’s beyond the 50% goal they set. And these numbers are verified by MIT’s Environmental Solutions Initiative.

Sustainability Highlights That Deserve a Standing Ovation

Here’s how Coldplay is making concert-going better for the planet. They planted seven million trees, one per ticket, across 24 countries. Each show generated 17 kWh of clean energy using solar panels, power bikes, and kinetic dance floors.

By flying with sustainable aviation fuel, they cut over 3,000 tonnes of CO2. They also reused 86 percent of LED wristbands and diverted 72 percent of waste from landfills. Impressively, 18 shows ran entirely on recycled BMW i3 batteries.

To reduce plastic, they set up free water refill stations at every venue. Additionally, they donated over 9,600 meals and 90 kilograms of toiletries, and teamed up with 23 green travel providers to lower fan travel emissions.

Giving Back to the Planet

The band has supported groups like The Ocean Cleanup, ClientEarth, Climeworks, Project Seagrass, and more. Their donations help clean oceans, protect biodiversity, and support sustainable food systems.

Coldplay says this is just the beginning of sustainable music tours. In a personal message, they thanked fans for biking to shows, dancing on energy-generating floors, bringing refillable bottles, and returning wristbands. The band is also working closely with sustainability experts like Hope Solutions, Live Nation, and MIT to keep improving and set new standards for green touring.

Music That Feels Good—and Does Good

Coldplay has a long-term deal with Warner Music Group and has continued the partnership with Parlophone in the UK. The band is proving that music and sustainability can go hand in hand.

The complex and pressing requirements tied to meeting the energy needs of today while remaking the energy system for the future call for breakthrough technologies, novel business models, efficient execution, supportive policy and more.

None of this can happen without tapping the full power of human ingenuity.

“I’m incredibly competitive,” Courtney Heard says with a smile. A fierce athlete and strategic thinker, she accepted a management position in Chevron’s shale and tight operations — which unearths oil and gas trapped in low permeability rock — after a succession of internships with the company during college. “I didn’t have it all figured out, but majoring in petroleum engineering seemed like a good way to get a job at the time,” she explains.

Turns out, West Texas was exactly where Heard was meant to be. For over 100 years, Chevron has operated in the Permian Basin straddling Texas and New Mexico, and the area is so important to the company’s financial success that it’s mentioned in every earnings call. “We wanted to be the best, and that resonated with me personally,” she says.

Working on a team in the Permian Basin, the country’s largest oil field, comes with high expectations. In the Permian, that means producing nearly a million barrels of oil equivalent per day while limiting emissions to one-third the global average. It’s all about efficiency.

One of Heard’s early challenges was coming up with new ways to lower price-per-barrel production costs. She and her colleagues achieved their goal by radically rethinking well stimulation and production, and she credits a company culture that encourages questioning how things have always been done.

That culture will be crucial as Chevron continues to explore ways to reduce the carbon intensity of its oil and gas operations while developing and commercializing lower-carbon energy solutions — including hydrogen, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), renewable natural gas and sustainable aviation fuel.

The company’s efforts to pursue lower carbon intensity businesses are continuing as it undertakes a global restructuring. Between 2021 and 2028, Chevron has allocated a total of $10 billion in lower carbon investments. For her part, Heard believes how Chevron seeks to scale new business lines and improve operational efficiency will determine its long-term success. “Because if you’re not winning the right way,” she says, “you’re not going to be winning for long.”

Balancing the need to meet growing energy demand while developing new lower carbon sources is a challenge. Each year there are record deployments of renewable energy, but the gap between demand and supplies of renewable energy remains wide. Globally, renewables accounted for only about 13 percent of final energy consumption in 2023 and are forecast to reach 20 percent in 2030. So even an aggressive energy transition has fossil fuels in the mix.

Societies can’t turn off their existing supply until there’s something to replace it, and problem solvers like Zoe Zhang are working on solutions to all of the above.

Zoe Zhang, who grew up in rural China, embodies the energy transition on several levels. Her family burned coal indoors until they were connected to a natural gas grid, and she worked in Chevron’s conventional business before pivoting to renewable fuels. “I’m a firm believer that energy is essential to humanity,” she says, explaining that access to reliable energy helps people pursue their dreams and a better quality of life.

Zhang, who has a Ph.D. in computational geophysics and a master’s degree in systems engineering, builds machine learning models to identify where to put Chevron’s compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling stations. Placing CNG stations where demand is high helps scale the use of a transportation fuel that has lower carbon emissions than traditional diesel or gasoline.

She’s also working to make the CNG Chevron produces even more attractive to corporate customers eager to further reduce emissions intensity from their vehicle fleets by taking into consideration the renewable natural gas (RNG) that Chevron produces into that CNG. This involves capturing methane from farm manure to make RNG, which is then piped into the national gas grid.

Zhang assumed that her current job would be totally different from her previous role applying data analytics, machine learning and subsurface expertise to pinpoint the best locations to drill wells. Instead, she has found the same skills help her succeed now. “It’s all about location, location, location,” she says, “and using data to find the best location to do our business.”

Jack Pollard shares the belief in the transformative power of energy access. After joining Chevron, Pollard, who began his career as a civil/structural engineer, worked in post-civil war Angola and saw for himself the high stakes of energy access. “In some locations, an electric pump may be providing water from a well,” he says. “If there’s no access to reliable energy sources to power the pumps, it can very much be a life-or-death situation.”

Pollard’s experience working in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the U.S. has taught him something else: There is no single solution to providing energy that applies everywhere. Some locations, he says, have abundant sun or wind for energy sources, while others are more conducive to geothermal or conventional oil and natural gas. “There’s no silver bullet for the energy transition. It has to be an integrated system of existing, emerging and breakthrough energy sources yet to be developed,” he says.

In many places, the energy transition is slower because of a lack of infrastructure, while others benefit from increasing investments and international partnerships. “This is how we get started and then we advance and satisfy those energy needs with increasingly lower carbon sources of energy,” he says.

Pollard’s global lessons motivate and guide him in his work to improve the efficiency of Chevron’s deepwater business. The large scale of deepwater wells and facilities targets larger volumes and production rates, which helps reduce carbon emissions intensity because they need less energy to extract each barrel of oil.

But Pollard also embraces an incremental approach to reducing carbon intensity by using remote operations capabilities, using technology to minimize flaring and venting, and electrifying equipment where possible.

As a descendant of one of the key engineers who designed the Galveston seawall after the devastating 1900 storm, Pollard takes cross-functional collaboration seriously and prioritizes long-term solutions. “That lineage set me on this path,” he explains.

One of McLemore’s projects tested the performance of a carbon capture filter that could capture emissions more cost effectively compared to previous generations of carbon capture and removal technologies. Another project is exploring the market for lower carbon intensity hydrogen as a transportation fuel in California. “We have a solar field that can power this facility. We have land that we already own and we have water that we can treat and use to generate hydrogen,” he explains.

Working on lower carbon intensity energy projects appeals to McLemore’s desire to tackle new engineering challenges. And they’re also personally satisfying. “I feel proud that my kids may drive a car powered by hydrogen, and I’m helping build one of the first facilities in the state designed to produce hydrogen using solar power,” he says. “Knowing that I'm working on making that happen, that's pretty cool.”

“About 70 percent of the Central Valley is cropland, so naturally, much of the suitable area overlaps with agriculture,” Kang said.
To help restore balance, water agencies in the valley are looking for places to replenish groundwater using excess surface water available during wet years.
Now, anyone can use it for groundwater recharge planning.","The rich, fertile soil of California’s Central Valley is one of the most productive agricultural regions on the planet, producing about a quarter of the nation’s food supply annually. Much of that productivity relies on groundwater.

During an average year, 43 percent of the freshwater used for domestic and irrigational purposes in the Central Valley comes from groundwater, rising to 70 percent in drought years, according to the United States Geological Survey. The Central Valley contains 75 percent of the irrigated land in California and 17 percent of all the irrigated land in the U.S. Because of overuse, groundwater levels declined significantly over the last century. Now, the region's cropland may be critical for refilling groundwater reservoir, according to a new report by Stanford University scientists.

“When surface water supplies run low during droughts, people turn to pumping groundwater,” Seogi Kang, a post-doctoral fellow at Stanford and co-author of the report, told TriplePundit. “The problem is groundwater is finite. We’ve been over-pumping it for decades, and natural recharge from precipitation can’t keep up.”

To determine the Central Valley’s groundwater recharge potential, the Stanford team analyzed electromagnetic data collected by a helicopter-borne sensor that surveyed over 12,000 miles of the region. The sensor creates a magnetic field, which induces an electrical current in the ground, Kang said. The current behaves differently depending on the soil and sediment below, allowing the researchers to map it.

“Clay conducts electricity well, while sand and gravel resist it,” Kang said. “So we can build a 3D model of the subsurface, which helps us understand where water can infiltrate or be stored.”

They found that as much as 13 million acres of the Central Valley may be suitable for groundwater recharge. The largest portion of which is agricultural land, especially orchards, crop fields and vineyards.

“About 70 percent of the Central Valley is cropland, so naturally, much of the suitable area overlaps with agriculture,” Kang said. “If you want to recharge groundwater at scale, it makes sense to start with the land that dominates the region.”

The concept of replenishing groundwater is called managed aquifer recharge. Water left sitting on the surface during periods of excess, such as after rainstorms or snowmelt, is diverted to an area where it can seep underground. When moved to a more absorbent area, the water travels down through connected pathways of sand and gravel, eventually reaching natural underground reservoirs called aquifers.

Diverting water away from areas where it's not absorbed it is also essential to avoid damaging crops. “Farmers won’t want to participate if their crops are at risk,"" Kang said. ""Also, soil types matter. If the surface contains a lot of clay, water might pond and not infiltrate.""

To help restore balance, water agencies in the valley are looking for places to replenish groundwater using excess surface water available during wet years.

“Instead of letting that water run off or evaporate, you direct it to recharge zones where it can infiltrate the ground and replenish the aquifer,” Kang said. “The challenge is knowing when and where that excess water is available and identifying the best places for it to percolate underground.”

Recharging groundwater is much slower than pumping it to use above ground because recharging relies on gravity and the water naturally seeping from the surface through the ground to the aquifer, which can be up to 50 meters deep in the Central Valley.

“Once water reaches the aquifer, it still needs time to spread out and fill available pore space,” Kang said. “Injection wells can speed things up, but they’re expensive and require permits, so scaling that method is limited.”

Stanford’s Sustainability Accelerator program developed an online tool called Fastpath to make the data publicly accessible. Now, anyone can use it for groundwater recharge planning.

“We worked closely with local and federal agencies to make sure it met their needs. Users can go to the website, select a region — like a sub-basin — and view available data such as well locations or geophysical survey coverage,” Kang said. “If they don’t have any data in an area, it’s probably not useful. But if data exists, they can run analytics to identify recharge potential.”

Moving forward, Kang is optimistic about using geophysical data like this in other helpful ways.

“One motivation for this project was seeing that a lot of publicly funded geophysical data just sits unused after it’s collected. Our goal was to show that you can take that data and turn it into something useful,” Kang said. “I’ve already seen similar efforts emerging, so I think we’ve helped spark new ways of thinking in the research community.”

The United States is preparing to object to a recommendation by a United Nations aviation body, citing concerns that it would unfairly benefit Brazilian corn ethanol producers.

The issue centres around criteria developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) technical panel for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which the U.S. believes may put American farmers at a disadvantage.

Global airlines are under pressure to replace fossil fuels with low-emission alternatives, such as SAF, to meet net zero targets by 2050. However, these fuels currently make up less than 1% of jet fuel use.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the transition could cost the industry around $4.7 trillion.

The U.S. claims the recommendation favours Brazil by awarding a lower carbon score to multicropping—growing more than one crop on the same land—a method common in Brazil.

While it might not seem surprising that banning or taxing plastic bags would reduce litter, Oremus said the results were more robust than she had expected.
“It’s great to see a policy that works in such a clearly measurable way.” Around roughly one-third of Americans are living in an area with some sort of plastic bag policy in place.
Another finding was that the bag bans and fees were most effective in places where the plastic bag litter problem was more severe to begin with.
That is because plastic pollution is growing in general, and bag policies can only mitigate some of its impacts.","Scientists have calculated that policies designed to reduce the proliferation of plastic bags across the US have led to decreases of up to 47% on shorelines.

Plastic bags, which have low recycling rates, are among the biggest culprits of pollution in the ocean and often become litter when they blow away in the wind. Once there, they can entangle animals and break down into harmful microplastics.

More than 100 countries have now instituted bans or fees on plastic bags in a bid to reduce their environment impact.

The study from the University of Delaware and Columbia University found that plastic bag policies led to a 25% to 47% decrease in related pollution as a share of total items collected in shoreline clean-ups relative to areas without policies. This decrease grows in magnitude over time, with no evidence of the rates rebounding.

Prior to the study, volunteers at coastal beach clean-ups in Delaware were using an app called Clean Swell to track the litter collected. The data goes into the Ocean Conservancy’s Trash Information and Data for Education and Solutions (TIDES) database, which keeps crowdsourced records from thousands of clean-ups around the world each year.

“When we found the database that had information on different shoreline clean-ups, we realised we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,” said researcher Kimberly Oremus. “And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy.”

The team analysed tens of thousands of shoreline clean-ups and hundreds of local policies to determine how the policies worked in terms of reducing plastic litter in the environment. They focused on the US because it has no federal plastic bag policy, allowing them to compare the effects of different types of policies at the town, county and state level within a single country.

While it might not seem surprising that banning or taxing plastic bags would reduce litter, Oremus said the results were more robust than she had expected.

“There are so many pathways a bag can take from the checkout line at the store,” Oremus said. “It’s great to see a policy that works in such a clearly measurable way.”

Around roughly one-third of Americans are living in an area with some sort of plastic bag policy in place.

“It was interesting to quantify the reach of the policies,” said lead author Anna Papp. “We compiled over 600 policies for 2007-2023, with a lot of variation in their scope and geographic scale.”

The study also found that some types of policies seemed to be more effective than others in reducing plastic litter. For instance, they found more robust impacts from state-level policies than town-level policies, with fees appearing to reduce litter even more than bans, though more study is needed to understand why. Another finding was that the bag bans and fees were most effective in places where the plastic bag litter problem was more severe to begin with.

An important caveat of the research is that despite these policies working to reduce the percentage of plastic bags on the shorelines, their proliferation is still increasing in both places with and without the policies – it is just increasing less in places with these policies than those without. That is because plastic pollution is growing in general, and bag policies can only mitigate some of its impacts.",https://cdn2.eandtmagazine.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2024-07/web_plastic-bags-littering-pebble-beach-brighton_Credit_Melanie-Hobson_shutterstock_1136369702_1600x900.jpg?itok=_fUaQlWQ,N,,2025-06-23 20:02:16.644926

The plant is anticipated to be a multi-billion dollar investment.

Phelps County Development Director Ron Tillery said they’re still in the beginning stages but making excellent progress.

“We couldn’t be more pleased. We’re moving fast in Nebraska with this huge project than the other projects in Louisiana and Minnesota that have been started by the company and that’s a testament to the quality of people that are in Nebraska,” Tillery said.

“We just put our heads down and get things done and the company has responded to that,” he said.

Tillery said DG Fuels has already sold 25 year off-take contracts for 100 percent of the product they’ll produce.

He said there’s a lot of work to be done – permitting, engineering, and related work.

“We’re also talking to farmers who will provide the feedstock for the project. We need about one million, 1.2 million tons of stover a year to fuel the plant and at this point we probably got maybe 30 percent of that committed with farmers,” Tillery said.

Unlike ethanol, this process will use corn stover. Tillery said the stover is gasified to separate the chemical compounds. He said the company uses tried and true methods along with proprietary technology.

Tillery reflected on what ethanol has meant for rural economic development and believes the demand for aviation fuel will provide a strong market for years to come, and could have generational impact.

“The aviation industry needs to respond to the pressure to decarbonize its fleet. There’s just not a plausible expectation to convert to all-electric airplanes. Sustainable aviation fuel is the answer,” Tillery said.

He said all the major airlines have committed to transition to SAF over the next five years and that the plans in development now will supply a fraction of that demand.

Tillery said it also fits into Gov. Jim Pillen’s plans for the bioeconomy. Tillery said Pillen has “played a vital role” in developing the bioeconomy.

“DG Fuels is in Nebraska largely because of his interest and his early work when he was first elected to attract that kind of activity to Nebraska so we’re indebted to Gov. Pillen,” Tillery said.

Tillery said Phelps County has a pair of additional ag-related projects in the works. The county is seeing work on a new fertilizer plant. There are also plans for a sunflower processing plant too.

The Power Pack Bundle offered by Octopus Energy and BYD includes a leased V2G-ready BYD Dolphin EV, a bi-directional Zaptec Pro charger and access to a smart tariff that offers free home charging. The bundle is priced at 299 Euros per month (US$344) and will be available before the end of this year.

“Bi-directional charging is the game-changer for drivers and the grid,” Greg Jackson, founder of Octopus Energy Group, said in a statement announcing the Power Pack Bundle. “By using some of the battery’s spare capacity to help balance the grid, we can offer free driving. V2G is going to revolutionize our energy system and help drive costs down.”

Octopus announced the collaboration with BYD at its Energy Tech Summit this week in London. The power generation firm has more than six million customers across all of its territories.

BYD’s Dolphin model is a sub-compact EV which has close to 265 miles in battery range, 201 horsepower and can accelerate from 0 to 62 miles per hour in about seven seconds, according to the company. It is priced under $20,000 in U.S. dollars, although it’s not available in America yet and may not be for a while due to the trade war between U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration and China.

BYD Auto has been producing the hatchback Dolphin since 2021 and achieved pricing well below U.S. electric models. It is currently exported to markets in Europe, Australia, South America and southwest Asia.

Bidirectional and V2G technologies enable EVs to become “mobile microgrids” and create available distributed energy potential throughout power grids. BYD and Octopus Energy are partnering with Motability Operations, which is UK leasing company making the technology available to disabled people across the country.

“We’re thrilled to officially launch our V2G project with Octopus Energy and Kraken,” Stella Li, executive vice president of BYD, said. “Together with Octopus Energy, we’re enabling EV owners to play an active role in the energy ecosystem, reducing costs and increasing the resilience of renewable power systems.”

The United Kingdom has close to 1.2 million battery electric vehicles on its roads and adoption is growing there. EV sales have grown in the U.S., though recent moves to curtail incentives by the Trump Administration could impact that momentum.

Globally, EV adoption is rising throughout the world, with one in five automobiles sold being electric, according to the International Energy Agency’s Global EV Outlook. Chinese consumers are pushing EVs up to half of their vehicle transactions, while Norway is more than 90%, the IEA says.

The least expensive EVs in the U.S. include the Nissan Leaf, which starts at $29,000, according to Car and Driver. The most popular EVs in the U.S., according to US News and World Report, include the Tesla Models Y and 3, both of which are in the early $40,000 range.

Securing commercial offtake is a key milestone in establishing the bankability of future Sora Fuel plants.","Future Energy Global, a pioneer in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market scaling, and Sora Fuel Corp., a company producing SAF and other e-fuels, have signed a letter of intent to negotiate an offtake agreement.

The collaboration envisions FEG reserving offtake of the environmental attributes of the first 10 million gal. of Sora’s future e-SAF production, with an option for FEG and Sora to increase the offtake at a later date. These SAF Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes will enable airlines and corporates all over the world to reduce their CO2 emissions using Book and Claim.

The aviation industry has committed to reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two-thirds of the necessary emissions reduction. To achieve this, SAF’s production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold, while its production cost needs to be driven down to economically viable levels.

The Book and Claim system, already well established in other energy markets such as renewable electricity, addresses this challenge by enabling the environmental attributes of the fuel to be traded separately from the underlying fuel. Unbundling the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical commodity allows SAF to be produced where it is most cost effective to do so, while reducing carbon emissions associated with fuel transportation and storage. This provides a global, cost-effective SAF solution to airlines and corporates who are working to reduce their carbon footprints.

Future Energy Global specialises in accelerating SAF through an innovative financial ecosystem that facilitates collaboration between all participants in the value chain. FEG enters into long-term offtake agreements with SAF producers, provides cost-effective SAF solutions for airlines, and enables investors and corporate stakeholders to accelerate the scale-up of SAF production. By addressing the critical need to scale SAF production, FEG plays a pivotal role in aviation’s path to net-zero emissions.

Sora Fuel offers an entirely new path for producing SAF and other e-fuels using just air, water, and electricity as feedstocks. Sora’s core technology breakthrough is the ability to capture atmospheric CO2 below US$50 per t. Sora then electrolytically converts the captured carbon dioxide and water directly into syngas, and ultimately into ASTM approved fuels. The approach unlocks production of e-fuels wherever clean energy is cheapest and most abundant. Fuel produced by Sora is expected to enable reduction of carbon intensity of up to ~90% versus conventional jet fuel. Sora Fuel was conceived within Engine Ventures based on research from the Berlinguette Research Group at the University of British Columbia.

“Our goal is to drive SAF market growth and help reduce aviation emissions,” commented Natasha Mann, CEO and Co-Founder of Future Energy Global. “To do that, we need to support innovative SAF producers like Sora Fuel to scale up their production and drive down the cost of sustainable fuels.”

Gareth Ross, CEO and Co-Founder of Sora, said: “We are thrilled to be in discussions with an innovative market leader like Future Energy Global and see this partnership as one that can grow substantially through time. Securing commercial offtake is a key milestone in establishing the bankability of future Sora Fuel plants. This important market signal validates the promise of our technology, which is to take advantage of the lowest clean energy prices on earth to strengthen the business case for e-SAF and drive more rapid adoption.”",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/aeroplane-02.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 13:11:25.201342

The coming years will favor players who move early to secure scalable low-CI feedstock supply, and UCO is the most viable path forward in that race.
Volatility was a defining feature of the UCO market in both 2024 and early 2025.
Given these dynamics, stakeholders should actively leverage comprehensive market intelligence and strategic foresight to ensure a robust and resilient SAF supply chain.","Used Cooking Oil (UCO) has rapidly emerged as a critical feedstock for biofuels, especially as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) becomes the primary growth driver for the biofuels market over the coming years. Both US and European biofuel policies increasingly favor non-food-based feedstocks, positioning UCO prominently within efforts to reduce fuel-pool carbon intensity and dependency on agricultural commodities.

The UCO supply chain begins locally at restaurants, hotels, and food processors, where specialized recyclers collect and transport waste oil to facilities that clean and refine it into SAF and other biofuels. Yet, surging SAF demand has reshaped global supply flows: the United States, once a net exporter, became a net importer of UCO after 2021 to meet rising domestic consumption driven by aviation-sector sustainability targets.

As supply chains globalize, American SAF producers have increasingly relied on international sources, notably China, to bridge emerging feedstock gaps. However, this dependency amplifies exposure to geopolitical risks, notably disruptions due to escalating trade tensions. The ongoing US-China trade war, along with policy frictions such as the early-2025 imposition of a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels (excluding SAF), has rattled investor confidence and highlighted the vulnerability of cross-border UCO flows. These uncertainties underline the critical importance of accurate forecasting and strategic planning to mitigate supply risks and sustain stable feedstock access for SAF production.

In June 2025, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) introduced a final rule that will exclude RIN (Renewable Identification Number) generation for biofuels produced with imported feedstocks as of October 1, 2025. This rule marks a turning point for the SAF and renewable diesel industries, reshaping sourcing strategies, cost structures, and investment priorities.

For those trading in the biofuels and feedstocks market, we capture pricing across the complex marketplace, including biodiesel, glycerin, renewable identification numbers (RINs), California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and related certificate markets in Europe. Learn more.

Demand–supply dynamics

Strong policy support for biofuels derived from low-carbon feedstocks has substantially elevated UCO’s strategic value. Policies promoting renewable fuels increasingly emphasize feedstocks with lower carbon intensity profiles over traditional, food-based oils. Consequently, US demand for UCO has soared, driven by policies incentivizing renewable diesel and other biofuel production. Fastmarkets estimates total UCO usage in the US in 2024 at 8.4 billion pounds, an increase of 42% over the year, underscoring the importance of supportive regulatory frameworks in accelerating demand for sustainable feedstocks.

However, UCO collection infrastructure struggles to match soaring demand. Fastmarkets estimates UCO collection to be at 3.3 billion pounds in 2024, which is insufficient to meet the US biofuel industry’s demand for 5.7 billion pounds of feedstock in the year. The Biden Administration’s ambitious SAF targets of 3 billion gallons by 2030 amplify concerns about potential feedstock shortages.

China has become the dominant supplier of US UCO for biofuel production. In 2024, the US imported approximately 2.8 billion pounds of UCO from China, making it by far the most significant external source of this key low-carbon feedstock. This dependence exposes the US biofuels sector to significant geopolitical risk. Trade tensions, such as the imposition of high US tariffs on Chinese UCO, or broader diplomatic frictions, could abruptly disrupt supply flows.

Additionally, early-2025 guidance on Section 45Z (the Clean Fuel Production Credit) disqualified imported feedstocks—including Chinese UCO—from generating tax credits under the program. With UCO imports ineligible for 45Z credits, the incentive to source foreign oils weakened, contributing to a sharp plunge in US import volumes in April 2025.

Replacing China as a supplier is not a simple task. While countries like Canada, Malaysia, and members of the European Union also export UCO to the US, the scale is significantly smaller. In 2024, Canada exported around 613 million pounds, while all EU member states combined accounted for just over 440 million pounds. Malaysia and the United Kingdom contributed 335 million and 221 million pounds, respectively. These figures pale in comparison to China’s 2.8 billion pounds. Building alternative supply chains of this magnitude would require years of investment in UCO collection infrastructure and trade logistics. With limited global availability and rising demand, few suppliers can match China’s volume and cost efficiency in the near term, putting other low-ci feedstocks on the table as substitutes. Replacing Chinese UCO in the context of the current Trade War depends not only on UCO availability, but also the suppliers’ diplomatic relations with the US.

Among low-carbon-intensity feedstocks, UCO stands out as the only one with significant potential for scalable supply growth. Unlike tallow or other animal fats, which are byproducts limited by livestock production and thus structurally constrained, no one raises cattle to produce tallow; its availability is capped by meat demand. In contrast, UCO production is a function of how much UCO collecting infrastructure there is[MC1] .

Global UCO supply is expected to grow in the following years, fueled by strong policy incentives and increasing demand from SAF and renewable diesel producers. This growth is expected to come from improved collection efficiency, the formalization of previously untapped sources, and investments by biofuel producers integrating upstream into the waste oil value chain. Companies like Neste have already moved to secure feedstock through acquisitions and partnerships with collectors, recognizing UCO’s central role in SAF economics.

Still, even with ambitious growth projections, global UCO volumes may fall short of meeting total biofuel demand. That’s why stakeholders must treat UCO as both a strategic opportunity and a bottleneck risk, optimizing its use while developing complementary feedstocks. The coming years will favor players who move early to secure scalable low-CI feedstock supply, and UCO is the most viable path forward in that race.

UCO price dynamics and forecast

Fastmarkets’ price assessment of UCO in the US Gulf has shown a strong upward trend since 2020, reflecting tightening supply and rising demand from renewable fuel producers. In early 2020, prices hovered in the mid-20 cents per pound range. By late 2022, they had moved into the mid-30s, and by the end of 2023, prices consistently reached the 40s. In 2024, this trend accelerated further, with prices climbing above 50 cents per pound by the end of the year and remaining elevated through early 2025. This sustained price strength highlights the combination of expanding SAF production capacity, robust policy incentives for low-carbon fuels, and limited availability of alternative low-CI feedstocks.

Volatility was a defining feature of the UCO market in both 2024 and early 2025. Monthly spreads between the highest and lowest reported prices regularly exceeded 8 cents per pound, with some months approaching a 14-cent range. These sharp swings reflect a market that is highly sensitive to shifts in policy, trade disruptions, and speculative movements. In 2024, for instance, fluctuations in Chinese export volumes, investigations into UCO origin verification[MC2] , and shifting expectations around SAF tax credits all contributed to abrupt pricing changes. In 2025, the continuation of this volatility has been fueled by ongoing uncertainty about the future of biofuel policy in the US, including the potential revision of SAF tax credits[MC3] , and geopolitical friction affecting UCO trade flows.

Looking ahead, Fastmarkets forecasts prices for the rest of 2025 to remain in the low to mid-50s cents per pound range[MC4] , with a brief dip projected mid-year before a gradual recovery into early 2026. However, these forecasts are highly sensitive to policy direction and trade conditions. If the proposed changes to the 45Z credit are approved, allowing crop-based oilseed feedstocks to generate credits on par with low-CI alternatives, it could significantly reduce demand for low-CI feedstocks in the US, potentially putting downward pressure on UCO prices in the coming year.

In this context, price volatility is likely to persist, and stakeholders across the SAF value chain will need to closely monitor political developments and maintain flexible procurement and pricing strategies to manage feedstock risk effectively.

UCO global market outlook and strategic implications

The evolving policy environment, industry commitments to decarbonization, and competition for feedstocks are reshaping the UCO market landscape. Government mandates and sustainability targets have effectively created a stable demand floor for UCO-based renewable fuels. However, inherent limits on UCO availability mean that the market faces structural constraints, necessitating strategic diversification of feedstocks and intensified investment in alternative technologies.

SAF producers and aviation stakeholders must increasingly treat UCO as a strategic resource, securing stable supplies through long-term agreements, vertical integration, and partnerships. They should also engage proactively with policy development to foster supportive frameworks. Additionally, exploring complementary feedstocks and innovative technologies will be essential for long-term viability.

Conclusion

UCO has transitioned from a simple waste byproduct to a critical component of the aviation sector’s decarbonization efforts. The next few years will further highlight the strategic importance and inherent challenges of relying on UCO. Supply constraints, logistical complexities, price volatility, and evolving sustainability standards are significant factors that industry stakeholders must manage effectively.

Accurate forecasting and strategic planning will be crucial for navigating this complex landscape. Fastmarkets’ market insights and price forecasts offer essential tools for stakeholders, providing clarity on emerging supply bottlenecks, pricing trends, and regulatory impacts. Utilizing such data enables airlines and biofuel producers to make informed procurement and investment decisions, optimizing their strategies to secure cost-effective and sustainable SAF supplies.

Given these dynamics, stakeholders should actively leverage comprehensive market intelligence and strategic foresight to ensure a robust and resilient SAF supply chain.

The similar complexities in the division of responsibilities for what is needed to provide effective adaptation to climate change are not discussed here and the aim is to give an overview of the general picture, not a comprehensive or fully detailed account.

These blogs have been produced by Professor Colin Reid, Emeritus Professor of Environmental Law, University of Dundee and current Adviser on environmental standards and regulation in a post-Brexit context to the Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee, with contributions from the relevant SPICe researchers. As with all guest blogs, what follows are the views of the author and not those of SPICe, or of the Scottish Parliament.

Energy and electricity

Energy matters are notoriously complex from a devolution perspective, with a mix of powers that are reserved (e.g. offshore oil and gas) and devolved (most planning matters), areas where the two combine (e.g. planning controls (devolved) over potential sites for nuclear activity (reserved)) and topics within reserved matters where powers have been delegated to Scottish Ministers (e.g. consent for many individual projects under the Electricity Act 1989). The overall structure of the energy markets for suppliers and consumers, a significant factor for both energy projects and fuel poverty, is in the hands of the UK authorities.

The position has been summarised by the Scottish Ministers as:

“Certain aspects, such as energy efficiency and fuel poverty initiatives, and our positions with respect to granting consent and planning permission for nuclear power and unconventional oil and gas, are matters for the Scottish Government and Parliament, while others – such as market support for different forms of power generation, and regulation of the gas and electricity grids – are reserved to the UK Government.”

On many issues such as the expansion of electricity generation from renewables and the development of hydrogen systems the Scottish Government’s ambition is higher than that of the UK Government.

Marine projects are significant for energy supplies from both renewable and fossil fuel sources. Any subject-based reserved/devolved division still applies but the general position is that the UK Parliament legislates for Scotland’s offshore waters (i.e. more than 12 nautical miles from the shore or baseline), although certain matters in this area not involving oil and gas, defence or pollution from ships have been devolved. Marine planning matters in Scotland’s inshore waters (up to 12 nautical miles from the shore or baseline) are governed by the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, an Act of the Scottish Parliament, and in its offshore waters by the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, an Act of the UK Parliament.

Electricity

Electricity is a reserved matter, including control of the grid and the structure of the electricity market and consumer pricing controls. Nevertheless, the UK Government has delegated power to issue consents for onshore generating projects and transmission lines to planning authorities (under 50 megawatts) and the Scottish Ministers (over 50 megawatts). Changes to the current approval procedures for infrastructure projects and related matters are included in the Planning and Infrastructure Bill currently being considered at Westminster.

Oil and Gas

The licensing and consent arrangements for oil and gas projects and pipelines are primarily reserved. Standards for the gas grid are also a reserved matter. The main powers over offshore developments lie with UK authorities, although elements of the land-based infrastructure are subject to devolved requirements for planning permission and environmental authorisations. The Scottish Government has devolved powers over onshore oil and gas (both conventional and unconventional) and the National Planning Framework 4 states that: “Development proposals that seek to explore, develop, and produce fossil fuels (excluding unconventional oil and gas) will not be supported other than in exceptional circumstances” and that “The Scottish Government does not support the development of unconventional oil and gas in Scotland.”

Nuclear

The regulation of nuclear power is a matter reserved for the UK Government, but since planning permission for any sites falls under devolved control, the Scottish Ministers have a de facto veto over any new developments and their current policy is against the development of any new nuclear stations. Environmental controls likewise fall under devolved authority.

Hydrogen

In the Draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan the Scottish Government states that its plans “to accelerate the hydrogen economy in Scotland will require the Scottish Government and its agencies, working with industry and with the UK Government, to apply both devolved and reserved powers in alignment.” As with other energy sources, most of the direct regulatory controls on standards, network regulations etc. fall under reserved powers, but planning controls and elements of financial support are in the hands of devolved authorities, with the Hydrogen Action Plan noting the need for Scottish and UK Governments to work together.

Buildings

Energy Efficiency

Regulation of Energy Performance Certificates for residential and commercial buildings is devolved and proposals have been made for reforms in the near future, providing more information on energy efficiency and heating costs. It is envisaged, however, that aspects of this work will progress in line with developments south of the border, e.g. producing a Home Energy Model (HEM) calculation methodology and a new register that can interface with the UK Government’s systems.

New Buildings

Planning and building standards are matters mostly decided in Scotland. Most individual planning decisions are in the hands of local authorities, but Scottish Ministers can exercise considerable control through the National Planning Framework and their appeal and call-in powers. In terms of the construction process, the UK Government’s control over health and safety and product standards may be relevant at times, as is the fixed-term VAT relief for energy-saving supplies and works.

Heating

Heating of buildings is a major contributor to climate emissions and largely within Scottish Ministers’ control. There are already rules preventing the use in new buildings of heating systems producing high levels of emissions but more far-reaching plans for the Heat in Buildings Bill to ensure the presence of low-carbon heating systems when the ownership of existing buildings changes have been put on hold because of concerns over their effect on tackling fuel poverty. The Bill announced in the Programme for Government 2025-26 will set targets for installing clean heating systems by 2045.

There are some critical pieces of the heat decarbonisation puzzle which are not under the control of the Scottish Government, with the main stated obstacle to the initial proposals for the Heat in Buildings Bill being the economics of low carbon heat. As noted above, the design of the electricity and gas markets is controlled by the UK Government and GB-wide regulators, whilst the United Kingdom Internal Market Act may affect the effectiveness of any restrictions on the supply of particular sorts of heating equipment. In the recent statement to Parliament from the Acting Minister for Climate Action, on the Heat in Buildings Bill, ‘clarity on the future of the gas grid’, the ‘rebalancing of policy costs between gas and electricity’ and ‘reform of the electricity market’ were identified as three, crucial, reserved policy areas.

Heat networks

Legislation has been passed by the Scottish Parliament to establish a framework for regulating and encouraging heat networks, but this has to operate in conjunction with UK legislation.

Transport

Traffic and demand management

Road traffic is a major contributor to greenhouses gas emissions; domestic transport accounts for 28% of Scotland’s domestic emissions. The UK Government is in control of several key levers in relation to emissions from traffic, including fuel duty, vehicle excise duty, construction and use standards for vehicles and the rules limiting the future sales of petrol and diesel vehicles. Nevertheless, a wide range of tools to influence traffic and the demand between modes of transport is available in Scotland, although often requiring collaboration between the Scottish Government and local authorities. Support for public transport (e.g. concessionary travel on buses for various groups and the removal of peak fares on ScotRail services) shows how funding can be deployed to influence the demand for public transport.

The devolved planning system has a major part to play in reducing travel demand (e.g. the idea of 20-minute neighbourhoods) as does the location of health and educational services. More direct measures such as road pricing and the Workplace Parking Licensing schemes are available but have not been used to date. Scottish Ministers are responsible for national speed limits, and through Transport Scotland, for setting speed limits on individual trunk roads. Local authorities are responsible for setting speed limits on public roads within their area.

Electric vehicles

The construction and use standards for vehicles and the requirements for an increasing proportion of new vehicles to be electric are in the hands of UK authorities. Nevertheless, many of the planning, building standards and other controls relevant to the development of an effective network of charging points, a key factor in encouraging drivers to switch, are devolved and could be deployed to speed the enhancement of the network. The same applies for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Railways

ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper are, through Scottish Rail Holdings, owned and financially supported by Scottish Ministers. The strategic direction of Network Rail in Scotland is set and funded by Scottish Ministers through the ‘periodic review’ process. The UK Government is responsible for all daytime cross border passenger rail operators and retains control of rail related legislation. This is being updated to bring all British passenger railway operators into public ownership and to establish Great British Railways, which will own Britain’s mainline rail infrastructure and act as ‘a single guiding mind’ for the railway. The experiment with the abolition of peak-time fares shows how financial support can be used directly to promote lower carbon travel.

Aviation

The devolution of Air Departure Tax gives the Scottish Government a tool to influence demand for air travel (although of limited power given the risk of simply diverting traffic to English airports). At present, though, Scotland continues to participate in the GB-wide Air Passenger Duty system, due to concerns about the continuation under any new system of the current opt-out for services using Highlands and Islands Airports. Key developments on sustainable aviation fuel and the approval of aircraft design are subject to reserved powers and international coordination.

Shipping

The Scottish Government has effective control over Clyde and Hebrides and Northern Isles ferry service contracts within Scotland and has wide powers over ports, with plans in place to procure zero or lower emission vessels on these routes in the coming years. However, an industry-wide move towards low emissions vessels depends on international standards and the availability of suitable refuelling infrastructure at ports beyond Scotland and ultimately on the decisions of largely multinational shipping corporations. Even within Scotland, grid and fuel storage issues may affect refuelling possibilities.

Industry

Direct environmental controls on emissions fall largely within the scope of devolved power (in future falling under the Environmental Authorisations Regulations), but the regulation of important sectors such as chemicals is more complicated. Some matters such as product standards are largely reserved and for other areas, such as the regulation of chemicals under UK REACH, co-ordination across the UK is required, including to meet international obligations (e.g. the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants).

Emissions reporting

Whereas the obligations on the public sector to report on their emissions and other activities relevant to climate change are determined by Scottish legislation, reporting by private companies falls within the reserved area of business associations and thus is governed by UK legislation.

Waste and circular economy

Waste management activities are regulated under Scottish provisions (scheduled to become integrated into the Environmental Authorisations Regulations), with planning controls on waste sites also being significant. The Circular Economy (Scotland) Act 2024 requires a strategy and targets in building towards a circular economy, but many of the powers, e.g. in relation to the disposal of unsold consumer goods, raise questions over the interaction with the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020.

Landfill and incineration

Planning and regulatory controls for landfill and incineration are devolved, with a ban on the landfill of municipal biodegradable waste due to take effect (after several delays) at the start of 2026; the possibility of extending this to other sources of waste is under consideration. The role of incineration is affected by developments at UK level in relation to its inclusion within the UK Emissions Trading Scheme and support for, and treatment of, carbon capture, utilisation and storage at waste to energy plants. The Landfill Tax is now a devolved tax but any significant divergence in the tax rates from those south of the border risks encouraging environmentally undesirable cross-border “waste tourism”, with waste being transported across the border to benefit from lower rates on its disposal.

Recycling

Although matters such as local collections and waste management are governed under Scottish powers, including the imposition of charges on single-use items, key elements such as the design and sale of products, e.g. banning single-use items or imposing requirements to make them easy to recycle, are largely affected by UK powers or the practical effects of the single market across the UK. Product design and trade descriptions are reserved whilst the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020 plays a major role in limiting the practical effectiveness of Scotland-only measures unless an exemption is agreed allowing divergence.

Initiatives have been able to progress either with special rules (e.g. for single-use plastics pending broad alignment across Great Britain) or through inter-governmental co-ordination (e.g. for single-use vapes), whilst the prolonged history of the deposit and return scheme for drinks containers highlights the complexities involved. Extended producer responsibility for products and packaging is an area largely of shared responsibility, with the power to legislate being in the hands of both Scottish Ministers and the UK Secretary of State (with the consent of Scottish Ministers).

Agriculture, forestry and land use

Most aspects of agriculture, forestry and land-use fall within devolved powers. Nevertheless, attempts to attract large-scale investment in natural capital projects (e.g. peatland restoration) and establish carbon markets based on land-uses are affected by the fact that many of the legal and financial vehicles for such investment are shaped by the reserved powers on financial services, markets and pension schemes.

Agriculture

The Scottish Government is working towards its vision for agriculture. As part of this, the Agriculture and Rural Communities (Scotland) Act 2024 will facilitate the move from Common Agricultural Policy style payments, to a four-tier payment structure. The aims of the Act include sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices, on-farm nature restoration, climate mitigation and adaptation amongst others.

The shape and extent of the changes to financial support for agriculture are gradually becoming clearer as part of the Scottish Government’s Agricultural Reform Route Map. These changes represent a more gradual transition away from the EU frameworks than in England. However, Scottish policies must operate within the limits of national and international subsidy controls and in the context of wider market conditions, which are affected by policy in other parts of the UK and potentially by the terms of international trade agreements made by the UK Government.

Forestry

Forestry is a devolved matter, overseen by Scottish Forestry and Forestry and Land Scotland, with the latter managing the substantial area of forestry in public ownership. The relevant regulatory powers (including the existing and forthcoming controls on deer numbers which affect the establishment of woodland in many areas) are in the hands of Scottish authorities, although forestry standards are endorsed by all the governments across the UK.

The Scottish authorities have considerable ability to devote financial support to forestry, although some measures with international aspects, e.g. import controls aimed at preventing the arrival of non-native pests and diseases, are a shared responsibility. The UK role in the regulation of financial markets and taxes is significant for the range of investment vehicles that can make the long-term investment in forestry attractive.

Peatland restoration

The capacity of healthy peatlands to capture and store carbon, and the emissions from degraded peatland, are significant factors in reaching Net Zero. The relevant regulatory powers are in the hands of Scottish Ministers (e.g. controls on muirburn). Finance has been allocated towards peatland restoration, but progress has not been as fast as hoped, for reasons linked to both the uptake of various schemes and capacity to implement them, including skills to undertake the necessary work. Despite being proposed by UK and Scottish governments several years ago, a ban on the sale of horticultural peat has not yet been introduced, with Internal Market implications being a consideration.

Biodiversity

Healthy natural habitats play a part in ensuring carbon storage and resilience in the face of climate threats. The relevant powers in relation to the designation and protection of specific sites for biodiversity are devolved as are those in relation to many of the main drivers of both degradation and restoration (e.g. development, agriculture, forestry).

Emissions trading

Many significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions are subject to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (estimated at 28% of emissions in Scotland), requiring operators to acquire allowances that match the volume of emissions produced. The detailed rules are made by the UK Government, subject to consultation with Scottish Ministers. The success of this scheme in encouraging operators to reduce their emissions will have a major impact on the contribution that these operators make to overall emissions and hence what has to be achieved in other sectors to reach Net Zero overall. The recent UK-EU summit has proposed further work on linking the UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes.

Negative Emissions Technologies

Since some greenhouse gas emissions are inevitable for the foreseeable future (often falling into the “hard to abate” category in climate reporting), in order to achieve Net Zero there will have to be actions taken to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Much of the contribution here can be expected to come from changes to land use (discussed above), with forestry, grassland and peatland already contributing as carbon sinks, but there is also scope for more direct approaches. Industrial plants aiming to make use of carbon capture and the proposed Acorn carbon transport and storage project, will be subject to devolved controls on planning and industrial emissions.

Although there is a desire to push ahead with such carbon capture, utilisation and storage projects, notably the Acorn project, the Scottish Government cannot proceed alone. The intellectual property, corporate taxation, elements of financial support and any offshore consents (e.g. where underground storage making use of exhausted offshore oil and gas reservoirs is contemplated) are all reserved matters. Developments may also be affected by the availability of significant financial support from the UK Government (under the “Track-2 process”).

Just Transition

The desire to seek a Just Transition towards Net Zero and away from industries dependent on fossil fuels engages governmental actions across the devolved/reserved boundary and financial commitments that likewise fall within Scottish and UK budgets. The Scottish Government is more advanced than other parts of the UK in its Just Transition thinking, with a draft Energy Strategy and Just Transition Plan and the activities of the Just Transition Commission, and the lack of equivalent high-level work in other parts of the UK can be viewed as a hindrance. Actions within devolved power which have been claimed as supporting the Just Transition include wider policy initiatives on energy and buildings; support for reskilling; concessionary bus travel; progress on heat policy; agricultural support measures; and partnerships to assist with the consequences of closures at Grangemouth.

The United States is preparing to object to a recommendation by a United Nations aviation body, citing concerns that it would unfairly benefit Brazilian corn ethanol producers.

The issue centres around criteria developed by the International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) technical panel for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which the U.S. believes may put American farmers at a disadvantage.

Global airlines are under pressure to replace fossil fuels with low-emission alternatives, such as SAF, to meet net zero targets by 2050. However, these fuels currently make up less than 1% of jet fuel use.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the transition could cost the industry around $4.7 trillion.

The U.S. claims the recommendation favours Brazil by awarding a lower carbon score to multicropping—growing more than one crop on the same land—a method common in Brazil.

With corn production exceeding domestic demand, U.S. ethanol producers are pushing to reduce emissions by using technologies like carbon capture to compete in the growing green fuel market.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association has warned that Brazil’s ethanol already carries a lower carbon score than U.S. corn ethanol, potentially giving Brazilian exporters an edge in meeting international SAF standards.

The ICAO Council, comprising 36 members, will review the proposal ahead of the UN agency’s major assembly later this year. While ICAO does not set binding rules, its standards often guide national policies.

“Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system,” said Bruno Alves of Brazil’s UNEM.

The U.S. State Department has raised concerns but declined public comment. Brazil’s agriculture ministry also did not respond.

Marathon Petroleum, one of the largest US independent refiners, is spending millions to increase jet fuel capacity at its 253,000 b/d Robinson refinery in Illinois. The project will increase the refinery's flexibility to optimise jet output to meet growing demand, chief executive Maryann Mannen says. The company plans to spend $150mn on the project this year and another $50mn in 2026. Marathon would not disclose the planned jet capacity at the refinery but says the project will be ready by the end of 2026.

Another independent refiner, CVR Energy, is increasing jet capacity at its Coffeyville, Kansas, refinery. The company is installing piping and revamping storage tanks at the 132,000 b/d facility to enable 9,000 b/d of jet output by the end of the third quarter, chief executive David Lamp says. Jet production is not subject to a Renewable Volume Obligation, which means that CVR would not need to blend biofuels into it or purchase renewable identification number (RIN) credits as it would if producing diesel. Shifting production from diesel to jet will reduce CVR's annual RINs requirements, Lamp says.

At the same time, the opportunity to sell products to markets further west, where two major refineries are set to close, will continue to grow over the next few years, with jet being an important part of the mix, he says. Phillips 66 plans to shut its 139,000 b/d Los Angeles refinery by October, while independent Valero aims to close or repurpose its 145,000 b/d Benicia, California, refinery by April 2026. CVR has the capability to move products from the midcontinent to California but would need to weigh the potential benefits against the political, regulatory and cost environment in the state and, as a result, may favour other locations, it tells Argus. CVR at present produces jet at its 74,500 b/d Wynnewood, Oklahoma, refinery, shipping it primarily by truck or pipeline to midcontinent locations, but it can also move jet by rail.

Another independent, Delek, has upgraded its 83,000 b/d El Dorado, Arkansas, refinery to produce jet as part of a plan to boost profitability. The company did not disclose how much jet the refinery can produce.

The investments come after US refineries produced a record share of jet in 2024, reflecting higher demand relative to other transport fuels, according to the EIA. The EIA in its most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook forecasts that US jet demand will average 1.71mn b/d in 2025 and 1.73mn b/d in 2026, up from 1.7mn b/d last year. But US airlines are signalling an uncertain outlook for jet demand, with most withdrawing full-year 2025 financial guidance when reporting first-quarter earnings, as President Donald Trump's evolving tariff plans have made it difficult to predict how travel activity will develop.

SAF conduct

Refiners nevertheless appear bullish on aviation fuels, including renewables. Specialty refiner Calumet will expand sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) output at its Montana plant sooner than expected — reaching 120mn-150mn USG/yr by the second quarter of 2026, with plans to boost capacity to 300mn USG/yr by 2028.

SAF margins have remained ""stable and attractive"", as the introduction of national mandates around the world compliment an already growing base of voluntary demand, chief executive Todd Borgmann says.

US independent Par Pacific's planned $90mn renewable fuels facility at its 94,000 b/d Kapolei, Hawaii, refinery, is near completion. The project will produce SAF and other products, and is expected to start up in the second half of 2025.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-06-23 09:01:22.260510

These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth.
“After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands.","The government believes that electric technologies can be much more efficient than fossil fuels, while also reducing the need for fossil fuel imports, which in turn will also make the country more resilient to supply and price volatility on international energy markets. The government’s Invest 2035 consultation found that energy prices and grid connection delays are competitive industrial activity and increased electrification, while the prevalence of gas in the energy mix makes it harder for businesses to plan and invest.

To resolve this situation, the government is offering price relief through its British Industry Supercharger for the most energy intensive businesses and resolving grid connection challenges for energy generation and demand projects.

The Clean Energy Superpower Mission entails a long-term plan to increase energy security and reduce electricity bills by investing in clean energy and improving UK connections to the EU energy market.

Sector Plans will set out how sectors can work in partnership with the government to exploit growth opportunities, for example by scaling net zero transport through battery innovation and EV manufacturing, production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), embedding sustainability across the economy by supporting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), investing in creative industries that are investing in net zero – such as Liverpool’s innovative MusicFutures R&D Cluster and introducing smart data reforms to enable data-driven innovation.

The government is planning to use smart technology to boost grid flexibility thus further adapting the grid to the influx of more renewable energy, while also making the grid more resilient and driving down costs. It is also focused on turning the country into a global clean energy and climate champion, driving the energy transition and opening up markets for British clean energy and low-carbon goods and services.

The UK is leading the Global Clean Power Alliance, a forum that aims to address supply chain challenges. Part of its role is to identify critical changes needed to diversify clean energy supply chains, including driving investment and addressing bottlenecks.

The UK is already working with Japan, since March this year, in an Industrial Strategy Partnership focused on collaboration in offshore wind.

Great British Energy (GBE) will work with the National Wealth Fund to provide strong development and finance support as developer and bank, with an initial £300 million already identified for investment into domestic offshore wind supply.

A new Workforce Strategy will be published by the Office for Clean Energy Jobs this year, utilising Britain’s existing energy workforce to create more good jobs across the country. A new regional skills pilot in Clean Energy Industries in Aberdeen will fund skills support.

The strategy is particularly focused on onshore wind and fixed bottom and floating offshore wind, carbon capture usage and storage, hydrogen and heat pumps. The government’s interventions, to this end, will include a new £1 billion Clean Energy Supply Chain Fund, under the direction of Great British Energy (GBE), particularly focused on offshore wind supply chains, and a £544 million Clean Industry Bonus for offshore wind developers. The government has also confirmed £13.2 billion of funding for its Warm Homes Plan and it will shortly launch a further round of the Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition, which provides grants to manufacturers investing in new heat pump capacity.

These are just a selection of a wider range of measures to be introduced under the strategy to further support UK clean energy growth. You can view the full Industrial Strategy document here.

“This is a landmark moment” said Laith Whitwham, Senior Policy Advisor at the climate think tank E3G. “After years of delay, the government has stepped up with a serious industrial strategy that backs clean energy and our industrial heartlands. This strategy cuts the sky-high electricity prices driven by gas dependency and gives British industry the shot in the arm it needs to lead the charge to a clean economy.”

“As a UK manufacturer at the heart of the electricity supply chain, it’s a huge confidence boost to see a firm commitment to strengthening the sector that keeps the country powered” added Jon Hiscock, CEO of UK electrical equipment manufacturer Fundamentals. “This is a vital industry, central to economic growth, energy security and decarbonisation. We’re encouraged by the roll out of the Connections Accelerator Service. Speeding up grid access for strategically important projects is exactly what our industry needs to drive innovation and modernise the grid. However the UK's ageing electricity network was never designed to handle the kind of power flows that come from decarbonisation. Turning ambition into delivery will be the real test. We’re also optimistic about the direction of wider electricity‑market reforms, including a final decision on zonal pricing. This could be a promising step toward smarter, fairer power markets. And the Growth & Skills Levy is a smart move. It’s how we turn ambition into the practical skills industry desperately needs. What will make this a success is ensuring these opportunities reach every young person and help fill critical gaps in engineering and the clean energy economy.”

Built by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), the clean-energy arm of Adani Enterprises, this 5 MW facility is fully powered by solar energy and incorporates an integrated Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), enabling entirely off-grid operation.

At the heart of the plant is a fully automated, closed-loop electrolyser system engineered to dynamically adjust to fluctuating renewable energy inputs. This capability enhances operational flexibility and efficiency, while maintaining top safety and performance standards.

This kind of real-time responsiveness marks a new era in decentralised hydrogen production, especially valuable in areas where grid power is unreliable or unavailable.

Adani describes the facility as a milestone in India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, setting a benchmark for clean-tech in emissions-intensive industries like fertilisers, refining, and heavy transport.

As a proof-of-concept ahead of the proposed larger Green Hydrogen Hub at Mundra, this plant showcases the group’s ambition to scale hydrogen production and derivatives—such as green ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel—both domestically and for export.

The United States is expected to oppose a UN aviation council recommendation that it says gives an unfair carbon rating advantage to Brazilian corn ethanol over American alternatives.

The debate focuses on rules proposed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) for certifying Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a cleaner jet fuel alternative.

Airlines worldwide are being pushed to adopt SAF to meet net zero emissions goals by 2050. These fuels, made from waste or renewable materials like cooking oil or corn, currently represent less than 1% of total jet fuel use.

The U.S. argues that Brazil’s common practice of multicropping—growing crops like corn and soy on the same land—would be rewarded with lower carbon scores under ICAO’s proposed guidelines.

In contrast, U.S. ethanol producers, particularly in the Midwest, are investing in carbon capture to improve sustainability.

ICAO’s council, which includes 36 nations, will review the SAF certification proposal ahead of its fall assembly. While ICAO’s guidelines are not legally binding, they influence national decisions.

Bruno Alves, director at Brazil’s UNEM, responded to the dispute by saying, “Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system.”

ACI EUROPE urges the EU to reset aviation policy, warning of competitiveness decline and major risks to decarbonisation progress.

Speaking at ACI EUROPE’s 35th Annual Congress, Armando Brunini, ACI EUROPE President and CEO of SEA Milan Airports, issued a stark warning about the EU aviation sector’s declining competitiveness and its ability to meet decarbonisation targets. Highlighting the need for a comprehensive aviation policy reset, Brunini criticised the EU’s current approach, urging immediate action to align aviation with the bloc’s broader Competitiveness Compass and Roadmap.

Four key challenges to aviation competitiveness and decarbonisation

Brunini identified four major challenges undermining the sector:

Unbalanced climate policy:

He reaffirmed the sector’s commitment to decarbonisation, stating, “Our commitment to decarbonisation remains unwavering… But if we need the sticks… we also need the carrots.” He called for financial support and flexibility to manage the €1.3 trillion investment required to reach net zero, warning that no other global region imposes similar costs on aviation.

Punitive taxation:

Brunini criticised ongoing aviation taxes imposed by EU member states and the UK, pointing out that revenues are not reinvested in decarbonisation efforts. He noted a direct link between aviation taxes and reduced air connectivity, describing Europe as “an exception” globally.

Airport capacity constraints:

Europe already hosts half of the world’s most congested airports, yet governments are hesitant to support capacity expansion. Brunini warned this reluctance limits economic development opportunities, while global competitors are actively increasing capacity.

Regulatory barriers to innovation:

He argued that excessive EU regulation hinders airport innovation in security, safety, and the passenger experience, further weakening the region’s competitiveness.

Call for a new EU Aviation Strategy

Brunini stressed that the absence of a cohesive EU aviation strategy places the sector at risk of becoming “the next automotive sector” due to policy-driven decline. “It is difficult to understand why the European Commission is de facto sidelining our sector while actively working on a maritime strategy, a rail strategy and a tourism strategy,” he stated.

Putting aviation back on track

To futureproof the sector, Brunini outlined several key recommendations:

Prioritise capacity development:

He called for urgent revision of the outdated EU Airport Slot Regulation, strict enforcement of the EU Noise Balanced Approach, and changes to the European Investment Bank’s Climate Bank Roadmap to enable funding for airport capacity expansion. Brunini also highlighted the need for regulatory stability, especially around airport charges, to support long-term investments.

Support for SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel):

The forthcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan must include funding mechanisms for SAF, including earmarked ETS proceeds, post-2030 allowances, and financial institution backing. “Such inclusion will clearly condition our ability to deliver on our net zero Destination 2050 roadmap,” Brunini stated.

Sustain regional air connectivity:

He urged continued operating aid for smaller airports beyond 2027 to preserve regional cohesion under the EU State aid Guidelines.

Promote innovation and resilience:

Brunini emphasised the importance of ongoing support for SESAR R&D and deployment to enhance airport capacity and performance. He also called for a unified EU testing and certification framework for aviation security equipment and simplified procedures to support green technology rollouts.

Brunini concluded with a clear message: the EU must act swiftly to reset its aviation policy. Without this, Europe risks eroding not only the aviation sector’s competitiveness but also its own global standing and economic resilience.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2194199535-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:01:43.027878

*******************************************************************

​Following is the speech by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, at Greenway 2025 - Accelerating Changes today (June 23):

Your Excellency Ambassador Harvey Rouse (Ambassador and Head of Office of the European Union to Hong Kong), Mr Iñaki Amate (Chair of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong), consuls-general, heads of chambers, ladies and gentlemen,

Good afternoon. It is a great pleasure to join you, once again, at the Greenway forum, the fourth edition, this year under the theme of ""Accelerating Changes"". And, as before, it's organised by the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao, and the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong.

The European Union (EU) has long been one of Hong Kong's long-standing business partners. Hong Kong takes pride in being home to 1 640 EU (European Union) companies, which makes the EU the largest foreign business community in Hong Kong. Thank you and welcome indeed.

Alongside business, we come together in so many others areas of mutual interest, from education and cultural exchange to innovation and technology pursuits. And, yes, to the environment - to global warming and all the complexities it entails.

Because climate change affects us all, it must involve us all. Each and every one of us.

The World Meteorological Organization's latest report, published last month, notes that there is a 70 per cent chance that the five-year average warming, for 2025 to 2029, will exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius. That's up significantly from the 47 per cent chance forecast in its report last year. So from a 47 per cent chance the forecast jumped to 70 per cent.

Allow me, for the next few minutes, to tell you what Hong Kong is doing to work against the universal threat of climate change, and to achieve climate neutrality.

Since Hong Kong reached its carbon peak, in 2014, our carbon emissions have dropped by about a quarter. In 2023, our per capita carbon emissions were about 4.58 tonnes. To put that in perspective, it is 60 per cent of the EU's emissions, so we aren't doing too badly, and only one quarter of that of the United States.

Hong Kong is well on its way to cutting its carbon emissions in half by 2035, achieving carbon neutrality before 2050, which is our stated goal.

Last week, we welcomed the news that Hong Kong is once again one of the world's top three most-competitive economies. We are dedicated to decarbonising this international financial, shipping and trade centre while keeping up with our competitiveness. And we do that by engineering green transformation through innovation.

Hong Kong's prowess in financial services places us, favourably, in becoming Asia's premier hub for green and sustainable finance. With our financing platforms, we could help to mobilise the capital for climate solutions, while ensuring robust integrity within our financial markets.

Last year, the total green and sustainable debts issued in Hong Kong exceeded US$84 billion. And the volume of green and sustainable bonds arranged here amounted to US$43 billion. That places us first in the Asian market for seven years in a row, capturing 45 per cent of the region's total.

Our regulatory framework is fundamental to creating a sustainable finance ecosystem. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority published the Hong Kong Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance last year, aligning our taxonomy with the two mainstream taxonomies of the Mainland and the European Union. Encompassing economic activities in power generation, transportation, construction, and water and waste management, it will facilitate green finance flows and promote sustainable development.

Like our economy, Hong Kong's resolve to green transformation goes beyond finance. Consider green transport, a transformation moving into the fast lane on our roads. The adoption of electric vehicles has been remarkable.

Just five years ago, Hong Kong was home to about 14 000 electric vehicles. By the end of last year, that number had surged to about 110 000, that's seven times more.

Today, seven out of every 10 newly registered private cars in our city are electric. That, ladies and gentlemen, is among the highest growth rates in the world.

Vehicles, of course, are only one part of a complex equation. An extensive and convenient charging network is the backbone of any electric vehicle revolution.

Our strategy is people-centric, recognising that the best place to charge is at home or at the workplace. Through our EV-charging at Home Subsidy Scheme, we expect to see charging infrastructure installed in about 140 000 parking spaces in private residential buildings by the 2027-28 financial year. That will enable a smooth and non-disruptive electric vehicle transition for thousands of households.

As for our world-class public transport system, we have unveiled a clear Green Transformation Roadmap for public buses and taxis.

Through targeted subsidy schemes, that will fast-track the introduction of about 600 electric buses and 3 000 electric taxis. We are managing the transition in an orderly manner, using incentives rather than penalties, to ensure that our green ambitions don't translate into additional costs for passengers.

Our vision for green mobility goes well beyond the road. As one of the world's premier aviation hubs, we're looking to the skies, too, to chart the green way to our transport future.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is critical to the long-term future of air travel. It's also essential to ensuring Hong Kong's continuing leadership in aviation.

SAF has the potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by more than 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel. The Hong Kong SAR (Special Administrative Region) Government is working closely with the Airport Authority to set a clear target for SAF consumption.

Globally, SAF supply is limited, and the cost remains high. And we see this as an opportunity for Hong Kong to innovate and lead.

We are exploring a range of supply options, including collaborations with enterprises in the Mainland and internationally. Our goal is to establish a stable and competitive regional supply chain for SAF, taking advantage of our unique position within the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area. It will accelerate the decarbonisation of our aviation industry and provide greener travel options.

Our green ambitions also extend to the iconic Victoria Harbour, a vital artery for our city. Our Pilot Scheme for Electric Ferries will shape the future of maritime transport.

With a commitment of HK$350 million, the Government is subsidising the construction of new electric ferries and their charging infrastructure, allowing operators to test the new green technology in local waters with full support.

The first two of these pioneering vessels are already navigating Victoria Harbour, following rigorous testing.

Beyond the local waters, we are greening the vast shipping lanes that connect Hong Kong to the world. Hong Kong is already a top 10 port for vessel refuelling.

To build on this, we launched an Action Plan on Green Maritime Fuel Bunkering late last year, with the goal of transforming Hong Kong into a leading international centre for green maritime fuel bunkering.

Industry response has been overwhelmingly positive, with key partners worldwide expressing strong interest in developing the services here. Hong Kong will spearhead the global effort in decarbonising shipping and, in doing so, create new economic opportunities. Something my good friend has already said: ""Green actually means business.""

When it comes to environmental connectivity, I'm pleased to note that EU companies play an important role in Hong Kong’s waste management and recycling facilities.

And I look forward to the expertise and support of EU companies in the Northern Metropolis, our new engine for growth dedicated to green living, and the area's long-term green development.

Ladies and gentlemen, Hong Kong has an iconic skyline. It also holds a treasure of having some 40 per cent of its land pulsing as the city's green lungs, with country parks breathing life into our metropolis, conservation areas cradling biodiversity little seen in other global financial hubs.

This is Hong Kong's defining paradox: where business and ecology coexist in symphony. For us, economic dynamism and environmental stewardship aren't just compatible - they're dual engines propelling our future. We balance development with sustainability. And we will do all we can to work with other places, the EU very much included, on the green way forward.

I look forward to building strong ties with the EU, to finding solutions to climate change, to creating far-reaching opportunities for us all.

My thanks to the organisers, the European Union Office to Hong Kong and Macao and the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. I'm grateful, too, to today's supporting organisations - the Business Environment Council, the Consulate General of Sweden and the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.

I am certain you will enjoy today's Greenway forum, and I look forward to our continuing, rewarding, co-operation in the years to come. Thank you.

RYAM and Verso's project in Jesup combines three key elements: 1.
Biogenic CO₂ Capture: RYAM's existing Georgia plant produces biogenic CO₂—a carbon-neutral byproduct of its cellulose manufacturing—as well as biomass.
Yet e-SAF plants like Jesup remain scarce, with only Infinium's Project Roadrunner nearing final investment decisions (FIDs).
### Final Thought: A Test of Decarbonization's Viability The Jesup project isn't just about fuel—it's a stress test for whether green energy can be profitable without heavy subsidies.","The race to decarbonize aviation is heating up, and one project in Jesup, Georgia, is positioning itself as a leader in the global shift toward sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Rayonier Advanced Materials (NASDAQ: RYAM) and Verso Energy's collaboration to build an e-SAF facility could be a breakthrough—not just for reducing carbon emissions but for proving that green fuel production can turn a profit. Let's dive into this strategic partnership and why it's worth watching closely.

### Why This Project Matters: Decarbonization Meets Profit Potential

The aviation industry is under immense pressure to slash emissions, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) targeting net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Enter e-SAF, a synthetic fuel produced using renewable energy, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂. Unlike traditional SAF, which relies on agricultural waste, e-SAF can be scaled without competing with food production—a critical edge in a world facing climate and resource crises.

RYAM and Verso's project in Jesup combines three key elements:

1. Biogenic CO₂ Capture: RYAM's existing Georgia plant produces biogenic CO₂—a carbon-neutral byproduct of its cellulose manufacturing—as well as biomass.

2. Renewable Hydrogen: The facility will use solar or wind energy to split water into hydrogen.

3. e-Fuel Production: These inputs will be converted into e-SAF via Power-to-Liquid technology, a process that could reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to jet fuel.

This synergy is a masterstroke. RYAM gets a new revenue stream from its CO₂ waste, while Verso Energy gains access to a strategic U.S. site to test a replicable model. The result? A facility that's both environmentally and financially sustainable.

### The Numbers: A High-Risk, High-Reward Gamble

The project's success hinges on securing €1–2 billion in funding, a daunting hurdle for any green energy venture. But Verso Energy isn't going it alone. Their partnership with Rely—a joint venture of Technip Energies and John Cockerill—aims to standardize e-Fuel production, slashing costs through modular designs and advanced carbon capture tech (like Shell's CANSOLV system).

The U.S. market is ripe for growth: SAF capacity has doubled since 2023, hitting 30,000 barrels per day by early 2025. Yet e-SAF plants like Jesup remain scarce, with only Infinium's Project Roadrunner nearing final investment decisions (FIDs). If the Jesup feasibility study (due within 18–24 months) delivers, this could be one of the first U.S. e-SAF plants to break ground—a major win for RYAM's stock.

### Risks? Absolutely—But the Odds Are Improving

- Capital Costs: The €1–2 billion price tag is a barrier, but RYAM's existing infrastructure lowers upfront expenses.

- Policy Support: The EU's ReFuelEU mandate and U.S. tax incentives (like the Renewable Fuel Standard) are pushing airlines to buy SAF.

- Technical Hurdles: Scaling up CO₂ capture and hydrogen production is unproven at this level—but Rely's engineering expertise mitigates this risk.

### Cramer's Bottom Line: Buy RYAM If This Works

This isn't a “buy now” play. Wait for the feasibility study results. If they're positive, RYAM's stock could surge as investors bet on its role in a $100+ billion global e-SAF market. But if the project hits delays or cost overruns, this could be a cautionary tale.

Historical data shows that positive announcements like this have historically driven an average return of 6.3% over 60 trading days, though investors should note a maximum drawdown of 12.5% during that period. This suggests that while volatility is inherent, the strategy has delivered gains in past similar events—bolstering the case for patience ahead of the Jesup feasibility outcome.

Investment Takeaway:

- Bull Case: Successful FID by early 2027 → RYAM's stock climbs 50–100% as it monetizes CO₂ waste.

- Bear Case: Funding gaps or regulatory hurdles → RYAM's shares stagnate or drop as the project stalls.

### Final Thought: A Test of Decarbonization's Viability

The Jesup project isn't just about fuel—it's a stress test for whether green energy can be profitable without heavy subsidies. If RYAM and Verso crack this code, they'll set a template for industries worldwide. For investors, this is a high-risk bet, but one that could pay off handsomely if the world finally gets serious about decarbonization. Keep your eyes on that feasibility study—this is one to watch closely.",,N,,2025-06-23 12:15:54.786958

Unlike many of the others, though, this one does not plan to make a vertical take-off and landing aircraft, nor a supersonic one.
The EL9 is equipped with eight electric motors and an equal number of propellers, four on each side.
It only needs a distance of just 150 feet (46 meters) to become airborne, and that makes it something truly special.
Taking advantage of the event in the French capital, Electra tied the knot even further with defense contractor Lockheed Martin.","Electra is a Virginia-based aviation company, one of many that have popped up in recent years. Unlike many of the others, though, this one does not plan to make a vertical take-off and landing aircraft, nor a supersonic one.

Instead, Electra focuses on designing a small plane that can take off and land from pretty much everywhere, including (or especially) on and from unprepared surfaces – kind of like a helicopter, without actually being one. This should make it ideal to reach remote locations where no prepared runways are available.

At its core, the EL9 is a hybrid aircraft that makes use of a turbogenerator that can run exclusively on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), or if need be on upcoming eFuels and even hydrogen, and an undisclosed number of battery packs that are there to power the aircraft's motors. The packs will be capable of recharging both on the ground, in the usual fashion, and in the air by using the turbogenerator.

We don't have the full details on this setup yet, but Electra says the motors meant to spin the propellers will work together with blown lift to allow it to take off at very low speeds and over very short distances. But let's take this one step at a time.

The EL9 is equipped with eight electric motors and an equal number of propellers, four on each side. They are installed along the leading edge of the plane's wings and are accompanied by a series of large flaps.

This configuration allows the air to be blown by the propellers over the wings and the flaps, improving the aircraft's low-speed operation and delivering a ""dramatic improvement in aerodynamic performance.""

That's possible thanks to the accelerated airflow over the wing, which forms a thick jet sheet on the trailing edge and effectively makes the wing larger than it actually is, for aerodynamic purposes. A triple redundant, fly-by-wire system is also on deck to coordinate the actuation of the flight control surfaces and the eight electric motors.

According to Electra, this design should allow the EL9 to lift off the ground at speeds of just 40 mph (65 kph). It only needs a distance of just 150 feet (46 meters) to become airborne, and that makes it something truly special. When in climb and cruise mode, the blowing is reduced and the flaps are stowed away.

Now, the aircraft is not particularly large, as it will only be able to carry up to nine passengers and up to 3,000 pounds (1,361 kg) of cargo. It takes off (and lands) using the electric component of its powertrain, it uses the turbogenerator to cruise, and should be capable of traveling to distances of up to 1,266 miles (2,037 km) from its departure point.

The above are not impressive numbers, by any measure, but the capabilities of the plane when it comes to taking off and landing have already captured the attention of the military and defense contractors. Until last week, however, when the 2025 Paris Air Show took place, we didn't know exactly what this attention translates into.

Taking advantage of the event in the French capital, Electra tied the knot even further with defense contractor Lockheed Martin. More specifically, the behemoth's Skunk Works division will get involved in the development of the plane by having a say in its digital engineering, manufacturing, supply chain, sustainment and global business development.

Lockheed has been an investor in Electra since 2022, but it is only now that the company is taking a more active role in the creation of the EL9. Aside from all of the above, the company will tie the aircraft into the defense industry, as it will ""assess opportunities for potential programs of record with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and global customers.""

It's not yet clear when the revolutionary flying machine will be ready. Not long ago Electra said we should see it flying operationally soon, as no less than 2,200 pre-orders have been placed for it, valued at a total of nearly $9 billion. Most of these orders come from regional operators like Akansel, Dieng & Co Engineering, or Caverton Helicopters.

As per Lockheed, though, the EL9 ""will transform commercial and military aviation for applications including last mile logistics, mobile power generation and emergency response."" Not only thanks to its capabilities, but also on account of the fact that it promises to be 100 times quieter and 70 times cheaper to operate than a conventional rotorcraft of similar capabilities.

We will keep an eye on the EL9, but also on some other of the projects Electra has in the works, some of which are being developed with help from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Michigan, and others.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/hybrid-aircraft-that-needs-just-150-feet-of-runway-to-take-off-is-now-part-skunk-works-253332_1.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:02:31.712795

Conclusion Lufthansa Group’s collaboration with Airbus to create a customised SAF fare represents a major milestone in the airline industry’s efforts to reduce emissions from business travel.","In a significant move towards sustainability, Lufthansa Group and Airbus have partnered to introduce a customised version of the “Sustainable Corporate Value Fare” designed to reduce carbon emissions from business travel. The collaboration aims to tackle one of the most pressing issues in the aviation sector: emissions from corporate flights. By offering this new fare, Lufthansa allows companies to offset up to 30% of the CO2 emissions associated with business travel through the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a clean alternative to conventional jet fuel.

The new corporate fare was introduced in June 2025 and has already been used by Airbus employees for all their domestic flights within Germany. The fare aims to provide a scalable solution for companies seeking to reduce their carbon footprint while maintaining the convenience and flexibility associated with business air travel. The move is part of the broader effort to integrate sustainability into corporate travel decisions, as companies increasingly recognize the need to address their environmental impact.

A Groundbreaking Partnership in the Aviation Industry

This partnership between Lufthansa Group and Airbus is a landmark in the aviation industry’s ongoing efforts to adopt sustainable practices and reduce its environmental impact. Airlines have long been under pressure to address their contribution to global carbon emissions, and SAF has emerged as one of the most promising solutions for making air travel more sustainable. Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources and can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle when compared to traditional kerosene-based fuels.

Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer at Lufthansa Group, expressed his satisfaction with the collaboration, stating, “I am particularly pleased and thankful that our longstanding partner Airbus has opted for a corporate fare with SAF, demonstrating its leading role also in the field of sustainability.” Vranckx emphasized the growing importance of sustainability in business travel, noting that more and more companies are factoring environmental impact into their travel decisions.

This partnership is a direct response to the increasing demand from companies for sustainable travel solutions. As global attention on climate change and carbon emissions intensifies, many businesses are under pressure to reduce their environmental impact, especially in areas like corporate travel, which is a significant contributor to global emissions.

How the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare Works

The new customised Sustainable Corporate Value Fare allows businesses and employees to offset the CO2 emissions from their flights by using SAF on Lufthansa flights. This fare is designed specifically for corporate customers who are looking to make their air travel more sustainable without compromising on the convenience of traditional business-class services.

For Airbus, this new fare provides an opportunity to integrate sustainability into its travel operations. As part of the arrangement, Airbus employees now have the ability to reduce their carbon footprint by choosing flights that use SAF. The fare allows the offsetting of up to 30% of the CO2 emissions from a flight through the use of SAF, helping Airbus make significant strides toward meeting its sustainability goals.

“We have been working in close co-operation with Lufthansa Group since early 2024 to customise their Sustainable Corporate Value Fare to meet the specific needs of Airbus travellers,” said Raphael Duflos, Vice President of Corporate Services Procurement at Airbus. “They have helped us to create a meaningful offer incorporating sustainable aviation fuels, starting in the German domestic market.”

The fare is currently being applied to Lufthansa’s domestic routes within Germany, but both companies have expressed interest in expanding the initiative to include international flights in the future. The partnership demonstrates how the aviation sector can leverage innovation and sustainability to meet the growing demand for environmentally responsible travel solutions.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Aviation

Sustainable aviation fuel is seen as a key solution for reducing emissions in the aviation industry, which is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions globally. Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable resources such as plant-based oils, agricultural waste, or even carbon captured from the air. SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines, which makes it a versatile solution for reducing emissions without requiring significant changes to airport infrastructure or fleet technology.

SAF has the potential to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% over the lifecycle of the fuel, making it one of the most promising tools in the aviation industry’s quest to reduce its environmental impact. However, the widespread adoption of SAF is still in its early stages. Currently, SAF is produced in limited quantities and is more expensive than traditional jet fuel. The collaboration between Lufthansa and Airbus represents an important step toward increasing the availability and affordability of SAF, as well as demonstrating its viability as a sustainable fuel for corporate air travel.

Airbus is also working with other major airlines, such as easyJet, to explore and stimulate the use of SAF in commercial aviation. The goal is to make SAF more accessible and cost-effective, ultimately enabling airlines to reduce their carbon emissions and contribute to global sustainability efforts.

Benefits for Corporate Customers

The introduction of the Sustainable Corporate Value Fare provides several key benefits for corporate customers. First and foremost, it allows companies to reduce the carbon emissions associated with business travel, helping them meet sustainability targets and demonstrate their commitment to environmental responsibility. The fare is also flexible and customizable, offering businesses a way to integrate sustainability into their travel programs without compromising on service or convenience.

In addition, Lufthansa offers several other special fares for corporate clients, including the option for companies to invest in larger quantities of SAF through bulk deals. This provides businesses with an opportunity to offset their emissions more effectively and at scale. As more companies adopt sustainable travel practices, the demand for such fares and SAF options is expected to grow, encouraging other airlines to follow suit.

A Model for the Future of Aviation Sustainability

The partnership between Lufthansa and Airbus serves as a model for how the aviation industry can drive sustainability through innovation and collaboration. By leveraging SAF, both companies are helping to pave the way for a more sustainable future in air travel. As more airlines and corporate customers adopt SAF and similar initiatives, the aviation industry’s carbon footprint will be significantly reduced, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.

The launch of the customised SAF fare is just one example of how the aviation sector is evolving to meet the demands of the modern traveler, who is increasingly conscious of the environmental impact of their travel decisions. As the industry continues to innovate and embrace sustainable practices, it is likely that more airlines will follow Lufthansa’s lead, offering similar solutions to corporate customers seeking to reduce their environmental impact.

Conclusion

Lufthansa Group’s collaboration with Airbus to create a customised SAF fare represents a major milestone in the airline industry’s efforts to reduce emissions from business travel. By offering the option to offset up to 30% of CO2 emissions through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, the two companies are setting a new standard for sustainability in corporate travel. As more businesses and airlines adopt similar initiatives, SAF has the potential to play a crucial role in making air travel more sustainable and contributing to global climate goals.

Hong Kong, he added, has made great strides in its efforts to be environmentally friendly, from green financing to turning to greener modes of transport.","Chief Executive John Lee said on Monday that Hong Kong is doing better in terms of lowering carbon emissions compared with the European Union and the United States.

He made the comment at Greenway 2025, an event hosted by the EU's office in the SAR and the European Chamber of Commerce.

Lee said Hong Kong has cut around a quarter of carbon emissions from its peak recorded in 2014.

""In 2023, our per capita carbon emissions were about 4.58 tonnes,"" he said in a speech.

""To put that in perspective, it is 60 percent of the EU's emissions, so we aren't doing too badly, and only one quarter of that of the United States.""

Lee said the SAR is well on its way to cutting its emissions in half by 2035 as it tried to reach its goal of achieving carbon neutrality before 2050.

Hong Kong, he added, has made great strides in its efforts to be environmentally friendly, from green financing to turning to greener modes of transport.

For example, he noted, some 110,000 electric vehicles were on the streets of Hong Kong by the end of last year, around seven times more than the figure five years ago.

Subsidy programmes, Lee said, have also helped bus, taxi and ferry companies to go electric.

The government is also working with the Airport Authority to set a target for using sustainable aviation fuel, which he said is much more environmentally friendly compared to conventional jet fuel.

Lee went on to say that Hong Kong's country parks and biodiversity are very much part of the SAR's uniqueness, which is seen in few places globally.

""This is Hong Kong's defining paradox, where business and ecology co-exist in symphony,"" he said.

""For us, economic dynamism and environmental stewardship aren't just compatible.

""They are dual engines propelling our future. We balance development with sustainability.""

Lee stressed that Hong Kong arranged 45 percent of the Asian market's green and sustainable bonds last year, marking the seventh consecutive year that the SAR was the biggest market in the region.",https://newsstatic.rthk.hk/images/mfile_1810260_1_L_20250623155837.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 09:03:00.896892

Adani New Industries Ltd. has commissioned India's first off-grid 5 MW Green Hydrogen Pilot Plant in Kutch, Gujarat. Powered by solar energy and a Battery Energy Storage System, the plant operates independently, marking a breakthrough in decentralized hydrogen production. This project demonstrates the feasibility of renewable hydrogen production at scale, aligning with India's green energy goals.

The Adani Group has announced the successful commissioning of India's first off-grid 5 megawatt green hydrogen pilot plant in Kutch, Gujarat. Developed by Adani New Industries Limited (ANIL), the clean energy arm of Adani Enterprises Ltd., the plant represents a significant advancement in the country's pursuit of clean and self-reliant energy solutions.

An off-grid green hydrogen plant generates hydrogen through electrolysis powered solely by renewable energy—such as solar or wind—without any connection to the conventional power grid. This means the plant operates independently, relying fully on its own renewable energy infrastructure.

Describing the development as a key milestone supporting India’s National Green Hydrogen Mission, the Adani Group said the project establishes technical feasibility and sets new standards for off-grid, renewable-powered applications of green hydrogen in high-emission sectors.

""The state-of-the-art plant is 100 per cent green-powered by solar energy and integrated with a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), enabling it to operate completely off-grid. This represents a new paradigm in decentralised, renewable-powered hydrogen production,"" the company said in a statement.

Hydrogen, the most abundant element in the universe, is also one of the cleanest fuels—emitting only water vapour when used. Its environmental impact varies based on production methods. Hydrogen made from fossil fuels is classified as grey, while green hydrogen is produced using electricity from renewable sources to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.

Live Events

ANIL is building an end-to-end ecosystem for large-scale green hydrogen production and its derivatives. This includes green ammonia, green methanol, sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the manufacturing of solar cells, ingots and wafers, solar modules, wind turbine generators, and electrolysers at its facility in Mundra, Gujarat, aimed at meeting both domestic and global demand.

The Kutch-based pilot facility is also India’s first of its kind to feature a fully automated, closed-loop electrolyser system that adjusts dynamically to real-time renewable energy inputs. This allows for enhanced operational flexibility to address the inherent variability in solar power generation while ensuring safety, efficiency, and high performance.

""This breakthrough reinforces the Adani Group's commitment to innovation, sustainability, and leadership in the emerging green hydrogen economy. It supports India's ambition to become a global hub for green hydrogen production and sets a benchmark for renewable-powered industrial applications across hard-to-abate sectors,"" the statement added.

The pilot plant also acts as a proof of concept for ANIL’s upcoming Green Hydrogen Hub in Mundra—an ambitious project expected to significantly contribute to India’s low-carbon transition. Green hydrogen is seen as a critical tool for decarbonising challenging sectors such as fertilisers, oil refining, and heavy transport, and plays a central role in achieving global net-zero targets.

Global SAF output last year totalled 1.3bn litres, according to airline industry association IATA.

The EU has allocated revenue from the sale of 20M carbon emissions permits to help airlines cover the price gap between conventional kerosene and more expensive SAF on flights within Europe, according to the report.

Reuters calculations showed these subsidies would cover purchases of up to 216M litres of e-fuels – synthetic fuels produced using captured CO₂ emissions – or up to 2.6bn litres of biofuels.

The EU subsidies cover up to €6 (US$6.89)/litre for e-fuels and €0.5 (US$0.575)/litre for biofuels.

Aviation is one the hardest sectors to decarbonise, with zero-emission aircraft not expected this decade, according to the Reuters report.

Although sustainable fuels could help to reduce air travel’s carbon footprint in the near term, SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply, the report said.

Against this backdrop, airlines have warned that EU targets to use more SAF were impossible to meet, according to the report.

The sector is investing only 1%-3% of revenue or budget allocation in SAF, according to a report this year by Boston Consulting Group.

Este documento proporciona un análisis integral del estado actual de la aviación global y traza el camino hacia un futuro más seguro, sostenible y eficiente.

Bajo la dirección de Willie Walsh, Director General de IATA, este reporte destaca los logros, desafíos y oportunidades que enfrenta el sector tras su recuperación de los efectos de la pandemia.

Seguridad: La Máxima Prioridad

Sin lugar a dudas, la seguridad sigue siendo el pilar fundamental de la aviación y un tema central en la agenda de IATA. El reporte destaca que, en 2024, la industria registró algunas estadísticas que son clave:

7 accidentes fatales en 40.6 millones de vuelos, un aumento respecto a 2023, pero con una tasa de accidentes (1.13 por millón de vuelos) aún mejor que el promedio de los últimos cinco años (1.25), con un total de 244 fallecimientos entre 4.8 mil millones de pasajeros.

Si bien, estos números reflejan una industria segura, el objetivo continúa siendo un futuro con cero accidentes y cero fatalidades.

Las aerolíneas registradas en el programa IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) demostraron un desempeño significativamente mejor, una tasa de 92 accidentes por millón de vuelos, casi la mitad de la registrada por aerolíneas no certificadas (1.70 accidentes por millón de vuelos).

En 2024 se realizaron más de 100 auditoria basadas en el Programa IOSA. El Programa IOSA está basado en riesgos, mediante un enfoque basado en datos para identificar normas y practicas recomendadas, lo que contribuye directamente a la mejora de la seguridad operacional. En promedio en 2024, las auditorias identificaron 3 veces más incumplimientos que las auditorias convencionales, y el enfoque incluye nuevos métodos de auditoria como la evaluación de la madurez del sistema de la gestión de la seguridad operacional (SMS).

El sistema Global Aviation Data Management (GADM) recopiló en 2024:

Datos de más de 8 millones de vuelos, estas cifras me vuelan la cabeza, ya que con la ayuda de la inteligencia artificial (IA) procesar esta data es crucial para la toma de decisiones estratégicas para la industria.

Información sobre 500,000 incidentes y $11 mil millones en costos de mantenimiento.

El uso de inteligencia artificial para analizar esta información maximiza la capacidad de identificar y mitigar riesgos emergentes, mejorando continuamente la seguridad de los vuelos.

Un dato que me dejo pensando, fue el aumento de las interferencias y bloqueos en los Sistemas Globales de Navegación por Satélite (GNSS), incluidas interrupciones de la señal, interferencias y suplantación de identidad, especialmente cerca de zonas de conflicto, representa un riesgo creciente para la aviación. IATA subraya la importancia de mantener sistemas de navegación terrestres como respaldo crítico.

IATA hace un llamado a los Gobiernos para Implementar medidas para prevenir interferencias en los sistemas de navegación que comprometan la seguridad de los vuelos.

Otro dato que me llamó la atención fue que el análisis sobre las investigaciones de accidentes entre 2018 y 2023 revelan el acceso limitado a informes de accidentes, tan solo un poco más del 50% de los informes de accidentes se publicaron conforme a lo que exige el Anexo 13 de la OACI, lo que limita el aprendizaje colectivo y que podría mejorar la seguridad aérea.

IATA subraya la importancia de compartir datos y mejorar la colaboración entre gobiernos y aerolíneas para mantener los estándares de seguridad más altos.

La sostenibilidad ocupa un lugar central en la agenda de la industria aérea. Aunque la aviación mantiene su compromiso de lograr cero emisiones netas de carbono para 2050, el progreso en 2024 fue más lento de lo esperado, y es debido a diversos retos y desafíos que a continuación señalo:

a) Combustibles de Aviación Sostenible (SAF):

La producción de Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) se duplicó en 2024 en comparación con 2023, alcanzando 1 millón de toneladas, pero esto solo representa el 0.3% del combustible total utilizado por la industria, cada tonelada se vendió a un promedio de 2,316 dólares la tonelada, un precio 3.1 veces superior al valor del combustible de aviación convencional. Se prevé que SAF cubra el 65% de las necesidades de mitigación de carbono para 2050, pero su alto costo como ya vimos en comparación del combustible de aviación convencional sigue siendo un obstáculo.

La transición hacia emisiones netas cero requerirá $4.7 billones para 2050, incluyendo $128 mil millones anuales en inversión en biorefinerías.

b) Iniciativas clave para la sostenibilidad:

IATA lanzó el “SAF REGISTRY” y lo transfirió a la Organización de Descarbonización de la Aviación Civil (CADO) este es un registro global de SAF en 2025 que permite a las aerolíneas rastrear y reclamar los atributos ambientales de los combustibles sostenibles adquiridos. Este enfoque de registro y reclamación se basa en la Metodología de Contabilidad e Informes de SAF de la IATA.

También si impulso a los gobiernos deben reforzar su apoyo a programas como CORSIA y evitar impuestos ambientales que no contribuyen directamente a la descarbonización.

c) Desafíos regulatorios:

La normativa “ReFuelEU Aviation”, que entro en vigor el 1 de enero de 2025, y exige un suministro mínimo del 2% SAF en aeropuertos europeos, esta acción ha elevado los precios del SAF gracias a que sus proveedores explotan su posición dominante en el mercado y han dificultando su adopción voluntaria por parte de las aerolíneas.

En su primera etapa, la normativa exige como ya mencionamos al menos 2% del combustible para aviación disponible en los aeropuertos de la UE sea SAF a partir de 2025, pero este porcentaje aumentará gradualmente, alcanzando el 6% para 2030, el 20% para 2035, y el 70% para 2050.

Transformación Digital: Hacia una Aviación Más Eficiente e Innovadora

La parte de la digitalización y la inteligencia artificial (IA) me parece super interesante ya que están revolucionando la industria aérea. IATA está impulsando la adopción de tecnologías que mejoren la eficiencia operativa, la experiencia del pasajero y la sostenibilidad.

Puntos clave:

a) Identidad Digital:

Pruebas exitosas de credenciales digitales en rutas entre Hong Kong y Tokio permiten que los pasajeros pasen controles de seguridad y embarque sin documentos físicos, por el uso del reconocimiento biométrico.

La iniciativa One ID de IATA promueve estándares globales de identidad digital para un viaje más fluido y seguro.

También se alinea con los esfuerzos gubernamentales para adoptar credenciales de viaje digitales basadas en estándares de la OACI.

b) ONE Record:

Este estándar de intercambio de datos para la carga aérea elimina procesos manuales y mejora la transparencia en toda la cadena logística. Proporciona un registro único en los envíos, prevé una cadena de suministro digital integral para la logística de transporte. Por lo que ONE Record eliminará la duplicidad, ayuda a cerrar los puntos ciegos de los datos y refuerza los cumplimientos regulatorios.

El transporte de carga aérea está en camino de alcanzar el 100 % de la capacidad de las aerolíneas con ONE Record para enero de 2026.

c) Uso de datos y ciberseguridad:

La primera Cumbre Mundial de Datos de IATA en 2025 priorizó el uso intensivo de IA y la protección contra amenazas cibernéticas. Como sabemos, los datos son fundamentales para definir el futuro de la aviación, y el tema de seguridad de los datos, gracias a los avances en IA y análisis predictivo, los datos impulsan mejoras en seguridad, eficiencia, experiencia del pasajero y sostenibilidad, entre otros.

La IATA apoya los avances relacionados con los datos mediante una estrategia formal, esta estrategia se basa en el principio de “dar para recibir”, donde las aerolíneas aportan datos a cambio de análisis comparativos anónimos que mejoran la seguridad, sostenibilidad y eficiencia del transporte aéreo.

Perspectivas Regionales: La Resiliencia de la Aviación Global

El informe Anual de IATA destaca un desempeño económico sólido, con un beneficio neto de $32,000 millones en 2024 y un margen neto de 3.4%. El tráfico aéreo internacional global aumento en 2024 un 13.7% Sin embargo, las regiones enfrentan desafíos específicos:

Asia-Pacífico: Lideró el crecimiento del tráfico internacional con un aumento del 26.6% en RPK (Revenue Passenger Kilometers), contribuyendo con casi la mitad del crecimiento global.

América Latina y África: Aunque sus contribuciones financieras son modestas, muestran una mejora constante en rentabilidad.

Europa y América del Norte: Si bien generan la mayor parte de las ganancias netas, enfrentan costos crecientes debido a impuestos, restricciones operativas y problemas en la cadena de suministro.

El informe de IATA enfatiza que la aviación es más segura y accesible que nunca, pero enfrenta retos significativos en sostenibilidad, infraestructura y rentabilidad. Willie Walsh, Director General de IATA, destaca algunos puntos para liberar el potencial completo de la aviación, que se requieren realizar en los siguientes años:

Infraestructura más inteligente: Inversiones estratégicas para aumentar la capacidad aeroportuaria y reducir cuellos de botella.

Colaboración más sólida: Entre gobiernos, fabricantes, aerolíneas y proveedores de SAF para acelerar la descarbonización.

Uso estratégico de datos: Para optimizar la eficiencia operativa y mejorar la experiencia del pasajero.

A medida que la industria evoluciona, este informe de IATA sirve como una hoja de ruta para un futuro donde la aviación pueda equilibrar la sostenibilidad, la seguridad y la rentabilidad, consolidándose como un motor clave del desarrollo económico global.

This strategic collaboration marks a key production milestone as Otto Aviation advances toward credible rate-ready manufacturing for its high-efficiency aircraft.","Otto Aviation, a pioneering force in sustainable aviation, held a press briefing at the 2025 Paris Air Show where CEO Paul Touw announced the company would achieve net-zero carbon emissions with its Phantom 3500 aircraft when it enters service around 2030 – two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goal.

The aviation industry has set a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and supported by organizations including the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aims to mitigate the industry's impact on climate change by balancing CO2 emissions with equivalent amounts sequestered or offset.

With an AI-supported clean sheet design, transonic super-laminar flow architecture, and cutting-edge aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 is a lightweight, ultra-low-drag aircraft that burns 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets and reduces emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

Otto Aviation has selected the FJ44-4 QPM turbofan engine from Williams International as the powerplant for its Phantom 3500 aircraft. The QPM (Quiet Power Mode) variant integrates auxiliary power unit (APU) functionality, allowing for independent ground operations and streamlined support infrastructure.

“Williams International is proud to partner with Otto Aviation on this groundbreaking program,” said John Sordyl, EVP of Customer Experience at Williams International. “The FJ44-4 QPM was designed to meet the next generation of aviation requirements, and the Phantom 3500 is an ideal platform to showcase its capabilities.”

Otto Aviation is choosing the Garmin G700 TXi flight display to equip its initial Phantom 3500 flight test vehicle,

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” Touw said during his remarks. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations – Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

On the inside, the Phantom 3500 provides space for nine passengers and has a cabin height of 6.5ft. In place of traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, the Phantom 3500 includes high-definition digital displays called Super Natural Vision, which provides passengers with views of the sky and scenery while also enjoying increased efficiency thanks to the streamlined design.

Otto Aviation plans to manufacture the Phantom 3500 at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, according to an announcement made a day earlier at the Paris Air Show by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The company will invest approximately $430 million and move its headquarters to the city. Otto’s plan is to establish initial operations in an available hangar, then build a new plant to manufacture the Phantom 3500 on land at the airfield. The company plans to begin flight tests by early 2027 and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

Given the US’ high stakes in these commodities – and the geopolitical imperative to find a sizeable alternative market to China – there’s significant pressure on India to remove restrictions on their imports.

But any such opening up in the India-US trade deal could encounter resistance from the two well-established agro-processing industries.

What sugar millers fear

The ethanol-blended petrol programme has been a success story of the Narendra Modi-led government.

Chart 1 shows that the average blending of ethanol in petrol sold by oil marketing companies (OMC) has risen from just 1.5% in 2013-14 to 14.6% in 2023-24. In the current supply year, from November 2024 till May 2025, the cumulative all-India average blending ratio was 18.8%, close to the target of 20% by 2025-26.

Story continues below this ad

But the industry’s concerns are over the feedstock used for ethanol production.

Till 2017-18, the entire ethanol for blending in petrol came from molasses, the leftover dark syrup after extraction of sugar crystals from cane juice. From 2018-19, the mills-cum-distilleries also began using cereal grains (mainly broken or old rice unfit for human consumption) as feedstock. Since 2023-24, the ethanol supplies from grain-based feedstock, particularly maize, has overtaken that from sugarcane molasses and whole juice (Chart 2).

For the 2024-25 supply year, a total 1,047.9 crore litres of ethanol have been contracted or made available to OMCs. Out of that, 710.4 crore litres or nearly 68% is from grain-based feedstock, including 483.9 crore litres from maize, 119 crore litres from the Food Corporation of India’s surplus rice and 107.5 crore litres from damaged/broken grains. Only the balance 337.5 crore litres are from molasses (144.7 crore litres) and sugarcane juice (192.8 crore litres).

“As it is, sugarcane is being marginalised as a feedstock. It would be worse with imports of maize or even ethanol itself,” says a miller from Uttar Pradesh.

According to him, the industry was already facing the prospect of stagnant, if not declining, domestic sugar consumption: “Our future isn’t sugar, but energy. Today, it is 20% ethanol-blended petrol. Tomorrow, it may be 5% blending in diesel or ethanol being converted through additional processing into sustainable aviation fuel producing lower carbon emissions compared to petroleum jet fuel”.

Story continues below this ad

Ethanol from sugarcane, the miller claims, will not create any major “fuel versus food and feed” dilemma. “Sugar consumption won’t increase much in India, unlike milk, egg and chicken that need maize as the key feed ingredient. The diversion of maize for biofuel will cause huge demand-supply imbalances and shortage of grain for livestock and poultry,” he adds.

The US exported a record 1,914 million gallons (724.5 crore litres) of ethanol, valued at $4.3 billion, in 2024. India was its third largest market (after Canada and the United Kingdom), at 187 million gallons (70.8 crore litres) worth $441.3 million. India permits import of ethanol only under licence for industrial (non-fuel) purposes and restricted to “actual users”: Imports can be for manufacture of alcohol-based chemicals, but not for blending in petrol or diesel.

A recent NITI Aayog working paper has suggested that India import GM maize as a feedstock for ethanol production. The protein-rich byproduct from it – DDGS or distiller’s dried grains with solubles – may be entirely exported without getting consumed as a GM feed ingredient within the country.

“US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India’s biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,” the paper – authored by NITI Aayog member, Ramesh Chand, and senior adviser, Raka Saxena – has stated.

Soyabean industry’s misgivings

The NITI Aayog paper has also called for exploring the option of importing soyabean, with the oil extracted from it being sold in the domestic market and the residual de-oiled cake or meal (which contains GM protein matter) exported to other countries.

SOPA’s executive director, DN Pathak, counters this proposal. “Most of our solvent extraction plants are in the interiors (especially Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra) where the crop is grown. It’s not feasible for them to bring imported soyabean from the ports, process it and then take back the meal for exports. The freight cost economics will simply not work. And what will happen to the 7 million-odd farmers cultivating soyabean here?,” he asks.

Indian processors crush 11-12 million tonnes (mt) of soyabean annually to produce 9-9.5 mt of meal. Out of that, 7-7.5 mt is domestically consumed as feed and food ingredient and the rest 2 mt or so exported. This is way below the 105-110 mt that China crushes every year. Much of that soyabean is imported to meet the feed requirement of its humungous swine herd and poultry flock: China is home to roughly half of the world’s pig population and a fifth of its chickens.

“We don’t have this kind of domestic market for soyabean meal. Also, if the GM meal cannot be sold within the country, the processing plants will have to be nearer to the ports for exports. The ones more likely to put up these are the international commodity trading giants such as AWL Agri Business (formerly Adani Wilmar), Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus,” explained Pathak.

SOPA has also voiced concern at the Centre’s decision, on May 30, to slash the effective import tariff on crude soyabean, palm and sunflower oil from 27.5% to 16.5%. That will further squeeze the margins of domestic processors, “as they will have to compete with lower-priced imported oils, forcing them to operate below break-even capacity or shut down altogether”.

Soyabean is now trading in MP and Maharashtra’s mandis at Rs 4,300-4,350 per quintal, as against its official minimum support price of Rs 5,328. A surge in imports, whether of oil or seed, can lead to farmers switching acreage to other crops.

With an investment of over 3 billion yuan (approximately $417 million), this collaboration aims to go beyond autonomous vehicles, laying the foundation for a green, intelligent, and deeply integrated mobility ecosystem.

Founded in 2016 by Han Mei, Jiang Wei, Li Kaizhu, and Yang Lei, Hellobike—officially Hello TransTech—has rapidly evolved from a modest bike-sharing startup into a shared mobility powerhouse. Headquartered in Shanghai, the company initially caught attention with its focus on accessible and scalable bike services. Its acquisition by Youon Bike in 2017 didn’t slow its pace; instead, Hellobike expanded into e-bikes, carpooling, and ride-hailing—building the operational backbone that now supports its robotaxi ambitions.

So, what’s behind this high-octane trio?

Hellobike contributes its deep operational know-how and user-facing mobility infrastructure.

Ant Group injects cutting-edge digital technologies like AI, blockchain, and carbon credit tracking into the venture.

CATL, the battery titan, powers the vision with its advanced energy solutions—including sodium-ion batteries and battery-swap innovation.

Their combined goal is a smart “vehicle-battery-cloud” system aimed at slashing 150,000 tons of carbon emissions annually while increasing operational efficiency by 30%. The first phase includes deploying 100,000 electric vehicles and 500 intelligent battery-swap cabinets across 20 cities, including Shanghai and Chengdu.

This isn’t just another autonomous driving experiment—it’s a blueprint for how fintech, clean energy, and shared mobility can converge to create scalable solutions for 21st-century cities. For markets like India watching from afar, the Hellobike model might offer inspiration for how homegrown mobility players and tech giants could team up to catalyze similar change.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjeJFt6KZyjn5d7299nrBoIAgImgQgnaga2Zl0nxd7j1bf8rX2stw1y5H9b7wtw6HZS3aUjLw4RlnA7nhoTKv4lHRC3fKeymojDcn0gy3D0IxLnEk6VrOD2Z_EvSQPsZcQc7PBSN4K34Kf5vdm6J33OUtKN9yywtAv5JkmIIBbADWaobEC0kmM1EZBT56E/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/1000079708.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:00:26.350711

Vietnam Airlines Corporation has just been honored at the program ""Glory of Vietnam 2025"" - an event organized by the Vietnam General Confederation of Labor in coordination with Lao Dong Newspaper with the theme ""Pride and Aspiration"".

Entering its 21st year, the Vietnam Glory program has been constantly innovated, promoting the spirit of honoring outstanding groups and individuals, thereby spreading and inspiring the community.

Vietnam Airlines was selected from thousands of nominations and was honored to be on the list of 13 outstanding groups and 6 outstanding individuals this year, representing Vietnam's spirit of aspiration to reach high and far in the period of integration and development.

Vietnam Airlines Deputy General Director To Ngoc Giang affirmed: This title is a great source of pride and also a driving force for Vietnam Airlines to continue to pioneer in creating a green-digital-global aviation future.

With more than 30 years of establishment and development, Vietnam Airlines has continuously affirmed its role as a strategic driving force in three pillars: digital economy, green economy and aviation diplomacy .

As the first airline in the industry to achieve the “Digital Formation” level according to DBI 2023 assessment, Vietnam Airlines has applied big data and artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize flight operations and enhance customer experience, with a satisfaction index of over 4/5 in both domestic and international markets.

In its sustainable development strategy, Vietnam Airlines is the pioneer airline to operate the first commercial flight using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in May 2024. This is the first step in the roadmap to realize the commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

In parallel, the airline has promoted many environmental initiatives with practical impacts, such as the “Fly Lightly to Con Dao” campaign to reduce luggage weight, save fuel and aim to handle 85% of plastic waste generated locally; the “Contribute Leaves to Repair Forests” program, mobilizing the community to raise funds to restore 50-60 hectares of forest each year.

In addition, Vietnam Airlines has eliminated more than 62 million plastic bags each year, recycled more than 3 million meal boxes and operated the entire ground system according to ISO 14001 standards on environmental management, affirming its commitment to comprehensive green development in all activities.

Vietnam Airlines currently operates a wide flight network with more than 100 international and domestic routes, connecting Vietnam to Asia, Europe, Australia and North America, playing an important role as a bridge between the country and friends around the world.

As a member of the SkyTeam global airline alliance, Vietnam Airlines not only expands connectivity to more than 1,000 global destinations, but also enhances its competitiveness and ability to serve according to international standards.

Karanjit Singh Wadhwa, Chairman of ACFI, Event Management Task Pillar, and Director of the Grace Group, during the curtain-raiser event, revealed that this year’s conclave would address pertinent questions, such as how India intends to triple its air cargo capacity by 2030, explore ways to make air and cargo more innovative and resilient, and consider what global leadership in cargo would genuinely entail.

The conclave would focus on four key pillars that would capture the sector’s priorities and future direction.

The first of the four pillars will focus on Resilience Through Innovation, moderated by Ramesh Mamidala, Vice President of ACFI and Head of Cargo at Air India Ltd. Satish Lakkaraju, Chairman of the ACFI Regional Outreach and Partnership Task Pillar and CEO of NextGen Logistics Pvt Ltd, speaking on behalf of Mamidala, stated that air transportation is becoming increasingly tense due to various geopolitical skirmishes. Recent geopolitical events have presented opportunities for India to leverage volatility by strengthening regional cargo hubs and enhancing cargo coordination among private players, Customs, and regulators. The session will examine the structural reforms required for transhipment and discuss pre-trade agreements with various countries.

This session will discuss how technology can be leveraged to enhance cargo movement, improve visibility, and increase efficiency, as well as explore the deployment of X-ray machines in India for rapid cargo scanning. These measures would help in reducing the dwell time of cargo. There was a need to impress the shipper that air cargo was not an expensive mode of transport.

Satish Lakkaraju will moderate the discussions in the second pillar. The session will examine ‘Tech-Driven Cargo: Accelerating Express, E-Commerce, and Data-Led Operations. The discussions will be on how cargo efficiency and visibility can be enhanced, particularly in express e-commerce. India’s e-commerce industry is estimated to be worth Rs 85000 crores. How can AI be leveraged to tap into this market?

Green Corridors and Sustainable Trade Lanes: Air Cargo’s ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Imperative will be the focus of the third pillar, moderated by Keku Bomi Gazder, Managing Director and CEO of Aviapro Logistics Services Pvt Ltd. This session will explore ways to promote responsible environmental growth in air logistics that align with global climate goals. India’s air cargo expansion must go hand in hand with sustainability. There is a need to adopt more green solutions at airports and encourage low-emission transportation. The session will also examine Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for freighter aircraft, the electrification of ground handling equipment, and investment in energy-efficient warehouses.

The fourth pillar will focus on Securing India’s Cargo Future: Risk, Resilience, and Disaster Readiness. The moderator for this session will be Yashpal Sharma, Chairman and Managing Director of Skyways Group. This session will examine the mitigation of risks in cargo movement. As cargo volumes increase, compliance must be adhered to. There should be the adoption of AI-based screening, innovative X-Ray systems, and a block for tamper-proof documentation. The session will explore global best practices.

The theme will also address cybersecurity in logistics, including the protection of digital infrastructure and the management of cargo. It is essential to develop a security system that ensures the smooth flow of cargo. The key questions to be addressed will be: How can public and private stakeholders collaborate on cargo security? What training will be needed? How can data protection and privacy be maintained as logistics progressively digitize?",https://www.maritimegateway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Acfi-2-image.jpg,N,,2025-06-23 04:01:08.981172

As part of its wider expansion strategy, the airline is also bolstering its engine capacity with an additional 40 Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. These landmark agreements mark a significant step in Vietjet’s growth strategy as a multi-national aviation group, while also strengthening economic ties between Vietnam, France, and Europe.

The latest order builds on Vietjet’s commitment last month for 20 additional A330neo aircraft, bringing its total widebody aircraft on order to 40.

Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao said: “I have a vision and the determination to make Vietnam a regional aviation hub for passenger transportation, technical services, logistics, training, research, global supply chains, and aviation infrastructure. We will continue to develop a robust and modern fleet to support that goal. Today’s agreement with Airbus is more than a commercial contract — it is a significant milestone that marks the beginning of Vietjet’s new journey: a journey of global expansion, new growth drivers, enhanced connectivity, and the development of a sustainable aviation ecosystem powered by ambition and transformation.”

Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business Benoît de Saint-Exupéry said: “Our latest agreement comes just weeks after the airline placed an additional order for A330neo widebody aircraft. Together, the A321neo and A330neo will be perfect partners for Vietjet to continue to spread its wings, efficiently matching capacity more closely to demand across its network.”

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling A320neo Family, offering exceptional range and performance. Equipped with new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky.

As with all in-production aircraft, the A321neo can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to up to 100% SAF capability by 2030.

Vietjet also placed an order for 40 additional Rolls-Royce Trent 7000 engines. The deal reinforces Vietjet’s commitment to building a next-generation widebody fleet, doubling its total order to 80 following an initial agreement at the 2024 Singapore Airshow.

In an era where logistics resilience and regional diversification are paramount, Hong Kong serves as a real-time laboratory for change.
“We build our agenda around the topics of most relevance to the entire community, so we will focus on e-commerce, digitalisation, airport development, AI, innovation, sustainability, industry trends, and the overall outlook,” he said.
And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.” His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit?","Airfreight is navigating a year of intense disruption. With trade protectionism, regional conflicts, and fragile consumer sentiment shaping global flows, 2025 demands more than incremental thinking. TIACA’s choice to host its Executive Summit in Hong Kong sends a clear message about where the industry’s centre of gravity is shifting—and where the hard conversations need to happen.

Asia in focus

“We wanted the 2025 Summit to be in Asia as part of the TIACA board’s objective of ensuring our events are held in areas which ensure member accessibility, as well as being in locations which play a crucial role within the global airfreight industry,” said Glyn Hughes, TIACA’s director general. “Hong Kong fits these requirements perfectly, particularly when it comes to being the e-commerce gateway to the world. China accounts for 27 percent of global manufacturing output, and with ‘China plus one’ policies expected to lead to a greater amount of production elsewhere in Asia, it certainly illustrates that the region will be a crucial component of future airfreight industry success.”

The choice is strategic, not symbolic. In an era where logistics resilience and regional diversification are paramount, Hong Kong serves as a real-time laboratory for change. Hughes is clear that the summit is not a networking formality but a focused industry checkpoint.

“We build our agenda around the topics of most relevance to the entire community, so we will focus on e-commerce, digitalisation, airport development, AI, innovation, sustainability, industry trends, and the overall outlook,” he said. “We will have two industry leaders’ roundtable discussions, and as part of TIACA’s commitment to showcase leadership, we will have the finals of our Sustainability Awards, our 2025 Hall of Fame induction ceremony, and two new awards recognising inspirational leadership and a rising star of tomorrow.”

BlueSky: More than a dashboard

A cornerstone of that accountability is TIACA’s BlueSky programme, designed to benchmark and validate companies’ sustainability progress across a wide range of metrics. Yet industry adoption hasn’t been as widespread as expected.

“I have been a little surprised that more companies haven’t signed up for the BlueSky programme, as the feedback we receive from those who have gone through the programme is excellent,” Hughes said. “Not only does it provide a personalised dashboard reflecting how the company is performing across a range of sustainability topics, it also illustrates where they need to focus on going forward.”

The programme’s structure encourages internal reflection, but also collaborative action. “We have just completed the first BlueSky community, led by Air Cargo Belgium and Brussels Airport, which took a group of six leading companies through the programme together. In addition to individual company results, we were also able to highlight areas that were common to many, and this additional guidance will be used by Air Cargo Belgium to provide some new programmes for their members.”

Decarbonisation at a crossroads

When asked whether the sector is progressing fast enough on environmental goals, Hughes didn’t dodge the complexity.

“Overall, I think the airfreight industry is performing well across a number of sustainability topics, although there are a few areas where more needs to be done,” he said. “Reduced waste, including reduction of single-use plastic, is one very positive result of actions taken. Airlines are investing heavily in newer-generation, more fuel-efficient fleets, and forwarders and trucking companies are increasing the number of EVs in their ground fleets. Ground handlers are electrifying GSE, and some are even investigating the use of green hydrogen-based equipment.”

But he cautioned that decarbonisation hinges on more than industry alone. “Airfreight shippers are leading when it comes to committing to purchase sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), but overall there is a lack of SAF available in the market. Therefore, in order to meet the 2025 net zero target, it is crucial that fuel producers, governments, and the investment community look at how they can increase production capability.”

TIACA’s role: Measuring success

TIACA’s position, Hughes emphasised, is not just to observe industry progress but to facilitate it.

“We see the role of TIACA as threefold in this regard,” he said. “Firstly, we seek to work with legislators to help educate them on what the industry is doing and whether proposed changes to legislative requirements are workable. Next, we aim to help educate the industry as to what the regulatory requirements are. And thirdly, we seek to provide tools and practical measures to support the industry in attaining its sustainability goals.”

His one ask to regulators attending the Hong Kong summit? “That they consider incentive programmes to support the investments that are required to address decarbonisation strategies.”

What does success look like for TIACA by the end of 2025? It’s not headline numbers, but relevance.

“For TIACA it’s all about member satisfaction,” Hughes said. “We undertake an annual member survey and adjust our programmes thereafter to ensure we deliver what our members look for from their association.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/page-4-23--1080x660.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 20:00:56.727002

The milestone was celebrated during a site visit attended by Khaled Abbas, Chairperson of the Administrative Capital for Urban Development (ACUD), and Ahmed Fahmy, ACUD’s General Manager.

Abbas praised the high standards of execution and design at Midtown Solo, describing it as a reflection of the premium quality envisioned for the New Capital. He reaffirmed ACUD’s ongoing commitment to supporting serious developers and accelerating progress on this national megaproject, which stands as a pillar of Egypt’s “New Republic” vision.

Midtown Solo features fully serviced standalone villas, targeting a high-end clientele. Abbas confirmed that 95% of infrastructure works for the project’s first phase have been completed, with final utility connections pending developer compliance with technical specifications. He also noted that landscaping and main roadworks across the R7 district are progressing in phases and will be completed soon.

Fahmy highlighted that Midtown Solo is Better Home’s second project to be delivered in the New Capital, and lauded its architectural quality and integrated services. He stressed that such developments are key to drawing more residents and investors to the city.

To further support developers, Fahmy revealed that ACUD has introduced 4 to 5 facilitation packages, helping struggling companies resolve issues and expedite license issuance. He also acknowledged Better Home’s early and continued investment in the Capital, noting the company’s pivotal role in believing in the city’s long-term potential.

He added that investor interest remains strong, citing a recent electronic land offering in the R8 district that drew three times the available applications.

Ashraf Adel, General Manager of Better Home, emphasized the company’s pioneering role as the first private real estate developer to acquire land in the New Capital. He described Midtown Solo as a landmark development, and the only project in the Capital comprised entirely of standalone villas—390 in total—spanning 66 acres along the prominent South Bin Zayed Axis, near the Cathedral and Green River.

Adel highlighted the project’s low-density design, with 80% of the land devoted to greenery, landscaping, and lagoons, and only 20% for built structures—creating a tranquil and healthy living environment. Residents benefit from a full suite of amenities, including a clubhouse, swimming pools, restaurants, cafés, and pharmacies.

The development sold out in record time, reflecting strong market confidence in the Better Home brand. It also features a 30,000 sqm commercial hub made up of 14 standalone buildings (ground + 2 floors + rooftop + private basement).

This months-long investigation with co-partner Climate Home News focused on a key ingredient vital to making SAF: used cooking oil. Most people probably don't know that their cooking oil used for frying can be turned into jet fuel. Millions of tonnes are collected globally and it is turned into SAF and biodiesel. It's a wonder of modern chemistry. Repurposing used cooking oil, that would otherwise be tossed away, is a great recycling story and it also means less pressure on agricultural land and deforestation. But there's a dark side to this story: greed. The demand for SAF is growing because more and more governments are setting strict useage mandates at airports ( 2 pct SAF use at EU airports, which will rise to 6 pct by 2030). Because there is such demand, that means UCO demand is also growing fast. Our investigation into the trade of UCO between Malaysia and Spain shows there are significant opportunities for fraud: the mixing of virgin palm oil into UCO and adding barely used (fried once) cooking oil into UCO supplies. This can be lucrative for UCO traders and hard to catch by auditors. This illicit ""fattening up"" of UCO supplies risks undermining the whole sustainability credentials, and benefits, of SAF, a fuel that the industry can achieve deep emissions cuts over fossil fuel-derived aviation fuel. It is also a headache for the sustainability certification schemes, for refiners and for airlines, including #Singapore, which is emerging as a global hub for SAF production and use. And it's a headache for the EU, which bans the use of virgin palm oil or any feedstock that could be linked to the risk of deforestation, or labour abuses. How big is the problem and what's being done about it?

Illustration: Michael Hickmott

Key points

What's at stake: Kiwi-founded and US-based carbon recycling company LanzaTech needs shareholder approval for a rescue deal from US billionaire Vinod Khosla and his associated funds to get on a more even financial keel.

Background: LanzaTech's share price has dropped below the level where it can remain Nasdaq-listed unless it does a stock split following falling revenue, widening losses, and concerted shareholder pressure to become profitable. The deal will give Khosla control of the company again.

Main players: LanzaTech, Khosla Ventures, Guardians of NZ Superannuation, Carbon Direct Capital Management.

LanzaTech shareholders appear to have little choice other than to vote in favour at its upcoming annual general meeting of what amounts to a rescue deal from US venture capital firm Khosla Ventures.

This expansion aligns with the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 goals of boosting tourism and international connectivity while offering travelers increased access to one of the region’s most dynamic economies. By enhancing its travel network and leveraging codeshare partnerships, Air France aims to capture a larger share of both business and leisure travel, while promoting its hallmark French service and sustainability initiatives.

Air France Expands Gulf Operations with Ambitious Paris–Riyadh Daily Flight Plan Aligned to Saudi Market Growth

Air France is strengthening its footprint in the Middle East with the announcement of its planned daily service between Paris and Riyadh, signaling a new chapter in the airline’s regional expansion. This move comes shortly after the successful launch of its first direct connection between Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport and Riyadh’s King Khalid International Airport. The planned frequency increase reflects rising demand and reinforces Air France’s strategic interest in Saudi Arabia, a market witnessing dynamic transformation under its Vision 2030 blueprint.

A Renewed Commitment to the Saudi Market

The launch of this direct service underscores Air France’s determination to reassert its presence in the Kingdom. The airline views Saudi Arabia not only as a fast-emerging tourism and investment hub but also as a vital link in its global route network. According to senior airline executives, this expansion is a response to a significant increase in passenger demand—both from tourists and business travelers seeking easier access to the Kingdom’s evolving economy.

Saudi Arabia has been actively working to boost international connectivity as it diversifies away from oil dependency and attracts global businesses, tourists, and investors. Air France’s decision to operate daily flights comes as a strategic response to this surge in international interest.

Strategic Growth and Network Connectivity

Air France’s ambitions in the region are not limited to frequency increases. The carrier is actively forging new partnerships and reinforcing its regional network through codeshare agreements, particularly with local Gulf carriers. These collaborations are enabling Air France to offer seamless travel options to passengers flying beyond Riyadh to other cities within Saudi Arabia and across the broader Gulf region.

The expanded connectivity strengthens Air France’s overall offering, making it more competitive and accessible for global travelers wishing to fly into Saudi Arabia via Europe. The Paris–Riyadh link is expected to serve as a critical artery for trade, tourism, and diplomacy, enhancing cross-cultural exchange and business cooperation.

Leveraging the Allure of French Excellence

Air France is not only banking on convenience and strategic location—it is also leveraging its French heritage to appeal to discerning global travelers. The airline continues to promote its signature in-flight French culinary experience, luxury service, and refined aesthetics. These elements remain central to the Air France brand and play a key role in differentiating the airline in a competitive global market.

This emphasis on French elegance is particularly well-received in markets like the Middle East, where there is a strong appreciation for high-end service and unique travel experiences. From carefully curated menus featuring French cuisine to cabin interiors inspired by Parisian design, the airline offers a taste of France at 35,000 feet.

A Focus on Sustainable Growth

Air France is not just expanding routes—it is also prioritizing sustainability as a core component of its growth strategy. The airline continues to lead the aviation industry in the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), holding the distinction of being the world’s largest buyer of SAF among commercial airlines.

As part of its long-term decarbonization goals, the airline is incorporating new-generation aircraft that consume less fuel and emit fewer carbon emissions. The Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, both known for their operational efficiency and environmental advantages, are being increasingly integrated into Air France’s long-haul fleet.

Additionally, the airline’s sustainability efforts extend beyond fuel efficiency. Air France has implemented a series of operational changes, such as weight reduction initiatives, more direct routing for shorter flights, and waste reduction strategies onboard, all contributing to its ambitious environmental roadmap.

Technology-Driven Passenger Experience

Enhancing customer satisfaction remains a top priority for Air France. The airline is investing heavily in digital transformation to improve the travel experience from booking to baggage claim. Innovations such as AI-powered check-in kiosks, upgraded in-flight entertainment systems, and personalized services are being gradually rolled out across the airline’s long-haul network.

Frequent flyers can expect a more intuitive and streamlined journey, while occasional travelers benefit from a more customized and responsive service environment. This tech-forward approach is intended to meet the evolving expectations of a digitally-savvy passenger base, particularly in business and premium classes.

A Future-Focused Partnership with Saudi Arabia

Air France’s growing involvement in the Saudi market aligns with the Kingdom’s efforts to position itself as a global tourism and business destination. With mega-projects like NEOM, the Red Sea development, and Diriyah Gate driving tourism and investment interest, connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia has never been more important.

By scaling up its service to Riyadh, Air France is not only enhancing its own commercial prospects but also playing a vital role in facilitating Saudi Arabia’s ambitious transformation goals. The airline is expected to contribute significantly to inbound tourism from Europe while also providing Saudi travelers with greater access to global destinations via its Paris hub.

Conclusion

The planned daily Air France flights between Paris and Riyadh represent more than just a route expansion—they symbolize a broader commitment to fostering global connectivity, cultural exchange, and sustainable aviation. As Saudi Arabia continues its journey of rapid economic development, Air France is positioning itself as a key enabler, offering premium service, environmental leadership, and seamless travel options that support the region’s long-term aspirations.

Air France is launching daily flights between Paris and Riyadh to meet rising travel demand and strengthen its role in Saudi Arabia’s rapidly expanding aviation and tourism market. This move supports the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 and reinforces Air France’s Gulf expansion strategy.

With a renewed focus on strategic growth, deepened regional partnerships, and a dedication to sustainable practices, Air France is charting a clear course toward a more connected and environmentally responsible future—one flight at a time.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/freepik__the-style-is-candid-ima-100-3.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 14:02:12.241853

At present, the Kolkata metro railway operates 37 rakes with regenerative braking features.
Regenerative braking has reduced carbon emissions by 13,500 tonnes in the previous financial year, the official said.
In a study conducted by Metro Railway Kolkata, it has been observed that 17-20 per cent regeneration of electricity is possible, he said.
“The unique advanced 'Regenerative Braking System' technology reduces wear and tear of brake, wheel, brake disc as well as maintenance costs,” he said.","Kolkata: The Kolkata metro railway has started using a sustainable braking technology in its rakes, as part of its quest to reduce carbon emissions and save energy costs, an official said on Sunday.

All the new rakes that are being introduced in the city's rapid transit system feature ‘Regenerative Braking', he said.

“The technology allows a train's electric motors to operate in reverse (like a generator) during braking, leading to conversion of the train's kinetic energy back into electrical energy, rather than wasting it in the form of heating of wheels or brake shoes,” a Metro Railway Kolkata spokesperson said.

At present, the Kolkata metro railway operates 37 rakes with regenerative braking features.

“The total energy regenerated in the year 2024-25 – by usage of the system in 37 rakes – has been 1.08 crore units, which have saved around Rs 8.2 crore in energy cost,” he said.

Regenerative braking has reduced carbon emissions by 13,500 tonnes in the previous financial year, the official said.

In a study conducted by Metro Railway Kolkata, it has been observed that 17-20 per cent regeneration of electricity is possible, he said.

“This is a step forward for saving energy and reducing the use of fossil fuel. Urban metro systems like those in London, Tokyo and New York also use regenerative braking,” the spokesperson said.

“The unique advanced 'Regenerative Braking System' technology reduces wear and tear of brake, wheel, brake disc as well as maintenance costs,” he said.

In another green initiative, Metro Railway Kolkata has taken up the work of setting up a 4-MW ‘Advanced Chemical Cell (ACC)' battery storage system, “which is the first of its kind in Indian Railways”.

The batteries have arrived and the system is expected to be operational in the middle of July, 2025, he added.

The announcement follows the launch of the carrier’s first direct route between Paris-Charles de Gaulle and King Khalid International Airport.

Stefan Gumuseli, the airline’s general manager for India and the Middle East, outlined the importance of the new route for the Air France-KLM Group and said it reflects the airline’s ambition to reestablish its presence in the Saudi market.

The decision comes in response to growing demand from travelers and investors eager to access the Kingdom’s expanding economic opportunities.

The new route marks a strategic step for Air France as it expands operations in the region and aligns with the growing connectivity between Europe and Saudi Arabia.

Talking to Arab News, Gumuseli said: “We’re starting with three weekly flights in mid-June, then gradually increasing to five. Our first major goal is to move to a daily service.”

He added that the market is not only outward-looking; the airline is also responding to rising inbound demand for Saudi Arabia, noting that it is experiencing almost exponential year-on-year growth.

Gumuseli also pointed to the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which reflects a strong commitment to developing tourism, hospitality, and culture, supported by substantial ongoing investments. He said: “All these megaprojects are a clear sign that tourism is booming. We have a strong relationship with Saudi Arabia and are expanding our cooperation.”

His comments were echoed by Air France’s Senior Vice President for Benelux, Asia, India, the Middle East, and East Africa Bas Gerressen, who told Arab News: “Tourism is a very important factor, but we also need traffic, which has grown significantly over the past two years.

“The more connectivity there is between the two countries, the more economic exchange will flourish in both directions,” Gerressen added.

Air France-KLM has entered into codeshare agreements to strengthen its network connectivity.

“We also place our code on these flights. So, when you consider all that connectivity from both sides, demand can only grow,” Gerressen said.

He added: “I believe Saudi Arabia has many premium travelers, and we need to reach them in specific markets. We already have strong demand across our business, premium and economy classes.”

At the same time, the airline is leveraging its distinctive French identity.

‘We position ourselves as a truly French brand — luxury, elegance, sophistication ... The French Touch. You can feel it the moment you board,” said Gerressen.

High-end products, gourmet in-flight dining, La Premiere lounges, and exclusive cabin experiences all reinforce this premium positioning. “We offer one of the best cabins in the region with our new first class, featuring a seat with five windows and just four seats in the entire cabin. It’s a revolution in the industry,” Gerressen added.

He emphasized the cabin crew’s vital role in shaping the passenger experience, highlighting their attentiveness and approachable demeanor.

As part of its sustainability strategy, Air France is adopting a comprehensive approach across its operations.

“Each new generation of aircraft reduces CO₂ emissions by up to 25 percent. Today, 28 percent of our fleet consists of these new aircraft, and our goal is to increase this figure to 80 percent by 2030,” Gerressen said.

The airline is also the world’s leading buyer of sustainable aviation fuel.

Gumuseli said: “We account for nearly 16 percent of global SAF usage, despite representing only 3 percent of total global kerosene consumption.”

Air France is investing in technology to enhance the passenger experience.

“We’ve decided to install high-speed Wi-Fi on board. In the event of a delay, passengers will receive updates about their connecting flights directly on their screens. With data and technology, we can truly personalize the service,” Gumuseli said.

“Our target customers include expatriates living in Saudi Arabia and tourists wishing to travel to Europe, North America, South America or Africa. Businesses are also a key audience, given the strong commercial ties between France and Saudi Arabia. We aim to serve all these segments,” said Gumuseli.

“Religious tourism should not be overlooked. Pilgrims can now combine Umrah with a more tourist-oriented experience,” he added.

Gerressen stressed the importance of the eVisa: “It is crucial. Simplifying the visa process will be essential in convincing more people to visit Saudi Arabia.”

JEDDAH: Saudi Arabia plans to raise the cultural sector’s contribution to gross domestic product to 3 percent — or SR180 billion ($48 billion) — by 2030, up from under 1 percent, according to Minister of Culture Prince Badr bin Abdullah bin Farhan.

In an interview with Al-Eqtisadiah, the minister said the sector has already surpassed its previous 0.91 percent GDP share, with Vision 2030 targets being met ahead of schedule.

“Vision 2030 forms the foundation of the Ministry of Culture’s strategy and direction,” he said.

“By 2030, we envision a cultural environment that nurtures talent, encourages innovation both locally and internationally, and supports the flourishing of creative and cultural enterprises.” Prince Badr said in the interview.

“Ultimately, our goal is to increase the sector’s contribution to GDP to 3 percent, equivalent to SR180 billion,” he said. “This represents the core mission of the Ministry of Culture and its affiliated bodies in driving an ambitious cultural transformation.”

Since the ministry’s founding in 2018, employment in the sector has jumped 318 percent, while the number of cultural graduates reached 28,800 in 2024, up 79 percent from 2018. The ministry has also issued over 9,000 licenses, while cultural associations and amateur clubs surged from 28 to 993.

“One notable outcome is the increase in the percentage of citizens who believe culture is important—from under 70 percent to 92 percent,” Prince Badr said. The ministry also oversees national celebrations such as Founding Day and Flag Day and has documented 9,317 antiquities sites and 25,000 urban heritage locations.

Saudi Arabia has now met its Vision 2030 target of having eight UNESCO World Heritage sites, with Al-Faw joining the list in 2024. Cultural event attendance exceeded 23.5 million between 2021 and 2024, and major festivals such as the Red Sea Film Festival and Islamic Arts Biennale have become global draws.

The Cultural Scholarship Program has awarded scholarships to 1,222 students studying at over 120 institutions across countries, including the US, the UK, and France. The program’s flexible design — no age limit or required academic background — has broadened participation. “Today, scholarship recipients are pursuing degrees in fields such as music, theater, and visual arts,” the minister said.

Through the Cultural Development Fund, the ministry has disbursed SR377 million to more than 120 projects. “Key areas of growth include heritage, music, and fashion. More than 1,200 creatives and entrepreneurs have benefited from its development services,” he added.

“Globally, there is increasing recognition of culture’s role in sustainable economic value creation,” the minister said. “Our role is to preserve and promote cultural identity while making it accessible and economically valuable.”

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia welcomed 116 million tourists in 2024, exceeding its annual visitor target for the second year in a row, the official data showed.

According to the Ministry of Tourism’s latest annual statistical report, the figure includes 29.7 million inbound tourists, an 8 percent increase year on year, and 86.2 million domestic trips, up 5 percent from 2023.

The milestone reflects the continued acceleration of the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 strategy, which positions tourism as a central driver of economic diversification.

After surpassing its original 100 million visitor goal six years ahead of schedule in 2023, Saudi Arabia has revised its ambitions upward, now aiming to attract 150 million tourists annually by 2030. This figure is split between 70 million international and 80 million domestic visitors.

In a post on X, Minister of Tourism Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “The 2024 Annual Statistical Report showcases the sector’s remarkable growth and its role in enabling Saudi Vision2030, a record performance achieved with the support and guidance of the Kingdom’s visionary leadership.”

Total tourism spending in 2024 hit SR283.8 billion ($75.6 billion), with inbound tourists contributing SR168.5 billion, up 19 percent from 2023, while domestic tourist expenditure reached SR115.3 billion, a 1 percent rise.

“The tourism sector continued to achieve record growth, reaffirming its transformation into a key driver of economic development and a fundamental pillar in advancing and diversifying the national economy,” the minister said.

Inbound tourism also reached a record monthly peak in March with 3.2 million visitors. The average international tourist stayed 19 nights and spent SR5,669 per trip.

A standout development in 2024 was the continued rise in non-religious tourism, now representing 59 percent of inbound visits compared to 44 percent in 2019.

Leisure and holiday travel topped this category, with related spending reaching SR36.4 billion.

Makkah remained the top destination, drawing 17.4 million overnight visitors, and Egypt was the leading source market with 3.2 million arrivals.

Regional analysis revealed that Asia and the Pacific accounted for the largest share of inbound tourists, at 33 percent, followed by the Middle East and North Africa at 28 percent, and the Gulf Cooperation Council at 27 percent.

Europe contributed 8 percent, while both the Americas and Africa each made up 2 percent of total visitors.

The sustained growth reflects the Kingdom’s continued focus on developing its tourism infrastructure and global outreach.

The ministry noted that this report highlights the exceptional and accelerated growth achieved by the sector through targeted marketing campaigns and support programs, contributing to the sector’s record-breaking performance.

RIYADH: Oman’s insured non-oil exports reached 61.2 million Omani rials ($159 million) in the first quarter of 2025, marking a 6 percent increase from the same period last year, according to Credit Oman.

The sultanate’s export credit agency, which provides trade insurance and guarantees to support domestic and international exchange, cited growth in construction materials, petrochemicals, mining, and agriculture as key drivers, the Oman News Agency reported.

This comes as Oman’s broader non-oil exports grew 8.6 percent year on year to 1.61 billion rials, now making up 28.6 percent of total exports. The growth reflects ongoing efforts to boost non-oil trade, support domestic industries, attract foreign investment, localize development initiatives, and offer incentives to the private sector.

The ONA report stated: “Khalil bin Ahmed Al Harthy, CEO of Credit Oman, explained that the volume of insured export sales in the building and construction materials sector witnessed a growth of 24 percent, with a total value of 27.16 million rials.”

Exports in the petrochemicals and plastics sector climbed 45 percent to 9.2 million riyals.

The mining sector experienced the largest percentage growth, jumping 150 percent to 570,000 rials. Meanwhile, agricultural exports surged 96 percent to nearly 5 million rials, driven by increased demand and favorable market conditions.

Despite the overall growth, Al-Harthy noted setbacks in some sectors, including packaging, fisheries, and apparel, adding that the results still reflect the broader progress of the national economy and the government’s continued push for economic development.

“He pointed out that Credit Oman is making significant efforts to support Omani manufacturers and exporters, contributing to boosting their sales both locally and internationally by offering a range of insurance services and overcoming the challenges associated with Omani products entering global and new markets,” the OMA report added.

In its earlier outlook, Credit Oman projected strong growth potential for the country’s non-oil exports in 2025. The agency cited an estimated untapped export capacity of 5 billion rials, according to the International Trade Centre.

However, it emphasized that realizing this potential would depend on evolving global trade conditions, particularly the impact of emerging tariff and non-tariff barriers, geopolitical uncertainty, and shifts in global economic trends.

This growth comes after a challenging 2024, when Oman’s non-oil exports declined 16 percent due in part to a reclassification of high-value fuel-related goods into the oil and gas category.

The 2025 rebound suggests improved export diversification, aided by Credit Oman’s efforts and favorable conditions in sectors like agriculture and plastics.

LONDON: Most stock markets in the Gulf were trading higher on Sunday, relatively unscathed by escalating tension in the region following US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, as investors assessed the potential economic impact of the conflict.

US forces struck Iran’s three main nuclear sites late on Saturday, and President Donald Trump warned Tehran it would face more devastating attacks if it does not agree to peace.

By around 0915 GMT, Saudi Arabia’s benchmark index TASI had edged 0.4 percent higher, helped by a 0.7 percent rise in the country’s biggest lender, Saudi National Bank. Qatar’s benchmark index QSI had gained 0.2 percent, reversing slight early losses.

“It is admittedly a bit surprising to see regional equities shrugging off the US strikes on Iran with relative ease, with opening losses having pared relatively rapidly,” said Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist at Pepperstone.

Brown said that the markets had already discounted the probability of a US attack, and investors anticipated a swifter resolution to the conflict following the attacks.

The market is focused on whether the conflict spreads to other nations in the region, with there being no sign of that happening right now, he added.

Bahrain and Kuwait, home to US bases, made preparations on Sunday for the possibility of the conflict spreading to their territory, with Bahrain urging drivers to avoid main roads and Kuwait establishing shelters in a ministries complex.

Kuwait’s premier index reversed early losses to trade 0.3 percent higher by around the same time, while Bahrain’s main index was flat. The Omani share index MSX30 was up 0.5 percent.

Elsewhere in the Middle East, Egypt’s benchmark index EGX30 was trading 1.7 percent higher, while the main index in Tel Aviv was up around 1 percent to reach its all-time high.

RIYADH: Cement sales in Saudi Arabia climbed 6.4 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2025 to 13.4 million tonnes, driven by a construction surge tied to Vision 2030 megaprojects.

According to data from Al Yamama Cement covering the Kingdom’s 17 producers, local sales accounted for nearly 13 million tonnes, while exports edged up to 408,000 tonnes.

Al Yamama Cement led the domestic market with 1.68 million tonnes, followed by Saudi Cement at 1.33 million tonnes and Qassim Cement with 1.25 million tonnes.

Saudi Arabia is powering through the largest construction surge in its history, a pillar of the Vision 2030 diversification plan. A Bloomberg report this month valued the live roster of real estate and infrastructure schemes at roughly $1.3 trillion, ranging from Riyadh’s driverless metro grid and entertainment hubs like Qiddiya to the brand-new cities of NEOM on the Red Sea coast and New Murabba in the capital’s northwest.

Those giga-projects, along with heritage revamps such as Diriyah Gate and the Red Sea’s string of luxury resorts, have now moved well beyond site grading and piling.

Gulf Construction, a trade journal for the building and construction industries, noted in May that major project packages are entering the concrete-intensive vertical-build phase, where tower cores, bridge piers, and precast facades consume significantly more cement and clinker than earlier earthworks.

In short, the Kingdom’s transition from drawing board to steel-and-concrete reality is fueling an insatiable appetite for building materials — and cement producers are gearing up their kilns to meet it.

Momentum kept building after March. Domestic sales jumped 42.9 percent year on year to 4.18 million tonnes in April, while exports rose 26.9 percent to 703,000 tonnes, according to Al Jazira Capital’s latest dispatch survey. Contractors are pouring concrete early, keen to stay ahead of the summer heat and tighten project timelines.

Profits do not rise equally

Higher volumes did not translate into across-the-board gains. International Cement Review’s CemNet bulletin said in June that sector-wide net profit fell 16 percent in the first quarter to about SR648 million ($173 million) despite stronger turnover.

Yamama Cement posted about SR142 million in earnings — up 23 percent — while Saudi Cement slipped nearly 5 percent to SR108 million. Qassim Cement improved 27 percent to roughly SR94 million, but Al Jouf Cement stayed in the red at around SR15 million.

Producers faced an added challenge from Saudi Aramco’s fuel price revision, effective Jan. 1, which several companies warned would raise kiln fuel costs by around 10 percent.

Inventory cushions remain thick. Al Yamama figures show Yanbu holding 18.9 million tonnes of clinker at end-March, with Southern Province close behind on 18.1 million tonnes. Across the sector, stockpiles cover roughly nine months of normal domestic demand, allowing firms to throttle kilns if margins tighten.

Modern kilns slash fuel use

According to Global Cement’s April report, engineering firm Sinoma has finished erecting a new preheater tower as part of Yamama Cement’s relocation and upgrade project south of Riyadh.

The upgrade increases the former 10,000-tonne-per-day line to 12,500 tonnes, with Sinoma noting it had to dismantle, relocate, and integrate large equipment while installing the latest kiln technology.

Completion of the tower clears the way for commissioning and final handover of the higher-capacity, fuel-efficient plant.

The efficiency drive extends to the Red Sea coast, where Yanbu Cement’s 34 megawatts waste-heat-recovery system already supplies about a quarter of the plant’s electricity.

The upgrades are crucial because older kiln designs waste a great deal of fuel. According to the European Cement Association, long-dry kilns consume about one-third more energy than the latest preheater–pre-calciner models, while old wet kilns can burn up to 85 percent more.

By contrast, modern PH-PC lines require only about 3.3 gigajoules of heat to produce one tonne of clinker — roughly the energy contained in 30 litres of petrol. Transitioning from long-dry or wet kilns to PH-PC technology significantly reduces fuel consumption, lowers production costs, and cuts carbon emissions — all critical advantages as energy prices continue to rise.

With Saudi Aramco’s January fuel-tariff hike expected to raise kiln-energy bills by around 10 percent, plants that already sip less fuel will feel the pinch far less — and that cost edge is flowing straight into sharper export offers, reinforcing the Kingdom’s competitive position in nearby markets.",https://www.arabnews.pk/sites/default/files/styles/660x371_watermarkpakistan/public/main-image/2025/06/22/4614126-2087809185.jpeg?itok=r9TPFQY3,N,,2025-06-22 10:05:54.715990

The three aerospace companies plan to develop the future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine), a new 100% European engine for Europe’s next generation of military rotorcraft, scheduled to enter into service around 2040. At Paris Air Show, a long-term partnership agreement was signed to this effect.

The partners are convinced European armed forces need a new engine with advanced design maturity and affordable operating and maintenance costs. To tackle this challenge, workshare will be distributed equally between Safran, MTU and Avio Aero. The companies’ cooperation will form the core of an extended and long-term European partnership involving participants from other European nations.

This increased partnership underscores the strong progress made on the project over the past two years: Safran and MTU announced their collaboration on a new helicopter engine in 2023. Last year, the two companies established a 50/50 joint venture, EURA (EUropean Military Rotorcraft Engine Alliance), to develop the engine. Now, Avio Aero will contribute its expertise and capabilities in military helicopter engines.

Cédric Goubet, CEO of Safran Helicopter Engines, commented: “We are delighted to extend our cooperation in the field of future military helicopter engines with Avio Aero. The next step in this decisive cooperation to strengthen Europe’s autonomy in the field of defence and security will be to respond to the specific call for a future helicopter engine within the European Defence Fund, with the versatile European team of top European aerospace partners that has already been set up under the coordination of EURA.”

Michael Schreyögg, Chief Program Officer of MTU Aero Engines, commented: “Achieving breakthrough success requires a strong alliance of industry leaders from across the continent. The fact that Avio Aero, MTU and Safran have joined forces underlines the importance of this program in further reinforcing European sovereignty and strengthening the European supply chain. Together, we are starting the next chapter in Europe’s defence history and adding another success story to our record of cooperation. By maintaining strong relationships and involving partners across Europe, we are shaping the future.”

Riccardo Procacci, CEO of Avio Aero, commented: “We are proud to join forces with Safran Helicopter Engines and MTU Aero Engines to collaborate on the development of a European turboshaft engine that will power the next generation military rotorcraft. This agreement is a major opportunity for the aerospace industry to work together in support of Europe’s strategic autonomy and technological leadership. At Avio Aero, we are excited to play a key role in this collaboration, offering our industrial capabilities and expertise in turboshaft engine development to meet future needs of European armed forces.”

During the ceremony, Mr. Sean White, European Defence Agency’s Director for Industry, Synergies and Enablers, praised the signatories and highlighted the urgency and significance of cross-border industrial cooperation for reinforcing our continent’s sovereignty and supply chain security.

This partnership between Avio Aero, MTU and Safran Helicopter Engines will enhance the robustness and relevance of the proposal for the European Defence Fund’s specific call for a next-generation helicopter engine. The proposal will be coordinated by EURA and submitted to the European Commission in October 2025.

The future ENGHE (European Next Generation Helicopter Engine) will feature breakthrough technologies that will considerably increase its efficiency while reducing its operating and maintenance costs. It will be particularly well suited to the ENGRT (European Next Generation Rotorcraft Technologies) and NGRC (Next Generation Rotorcraft Capability) projects. ENGHE’s exceptional characteristics will provide these future helicopters with enhanced capabilities, such as greater range, higher speed, improved maneuverability and increased availability. In addition to these improvements, the engine will also feature reduced fuel burn, be 100% compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and incorporate enhanced electric hybridization.",https://www.edrmagazine.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ENGHE-European-Helicopter-Engine.jpg,N,,2025-06-22 10:06:00.548185
