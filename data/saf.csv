Singapore had no army, no natural resources, and no clear sovereign authority he could legally negotiate with. So Raffles did something more subtle. He elevated Tengku Hussein to the sultanate of Johor, manufacturing the legitimacy required to secure a foothold. What he was really buying was not territory, but position: control over a narrow maritime passage where East and West already passed each other by necessity.

Singapore was never meant to manufacture the world’s goods. It was meant to decide where they met.

That instinct — to intervene at chokepoints rather than chase volume — became Singapore’s enduring advantage. Over time, the port became a trading hub, the trading hub an energy hub, and the energy hub a financial center. More recently, Singapore has added another layer: advanced manufacturing, now accounting for roughly 20% of GDP. Not mass manufacturing, but precision systems designed to operate at high-value moments inside global supply chains.

That history matters, because aviation’s energy transition is quietly running into a chokepoint of its own.

The SAF Problem Everyone Sees — and the One They Don’t

Most discussion around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) focuses on production volumes, mandates, and feedstocks. How much can be made, where it will come from, and who will subsidize it. Those questions are real — but they are not where the system is currently binding.

Nearly every drop of aviation fuel used today is blended. Yet blending itself is treated as a solved problem, folded invisibly into refinery economics and upstream logistics. In practice, it is anything but.

Traditional SAF blending happens far from airports, embedded in supplier-controlled systems that airlines and airports cannot see or influence. The result is familiar to anyone who has watched an energy transition struggle: long procurement lead times, opaque pricing, embedded margins, and limited flexibility. The fuel exists, but it cannot move cleanly through the system.

In other words, the transition is failing not at production, but at the interface.

That is where FlyORO, a Singapore-based SAF solutions company, has chosen to operate.

Moving the Hinge

FlyORO’s core technology, AlphaLite, is a modular, containerized blending system designed for last-mile blending — relocating the blending step downstream, closer to airports and end users. The company describes it, modestly, as an “espresso machine” for jet fuel. But strategically, it functions more like a toll booth: it decides where fuel becomes usable, at what ratio, on whose terms.

AlphaLite is fuel-agnostic, compatible with all ASTM-certified SAF pathways, and digitally integrated for real-time monitoring and verification. It can be deployed within existing airport infrastructure, scaled to local demand, and operated without the massive capital investments traditionally associated with fuel blending facilities.

The implication is simple but powerful. Instead of purchasing pre-blended fuel at supplier-dictated prices, airports or airlines can import sustainable blending components and blend them on-site with kerosene they already own and store. What was once an upstream black box becomes visible, auditable infrastructure.

This is classic Singapore logic applied to aviation fuel: don’t own the resource, own the junction.

What Changes When Blending Moves Downstream

When blending shifts closer to the point of use, the economics change immediately.

Procurement timelines compress — in some cases by a factor of six — because operators are no longer tied to refinery schedules. Costs fall as intermediate logistics and embedded margins are stripped out. Airlines gain control over blend ratios rather than accepting fixed offerings. And as SAF mandates expand, digital verification moves from paperwork to real-time data, reducing compliance risk.

Just as importantly, last-mile blending lowers the barrier to participation. Airports and fuel suppliers no longer need to commit large upfront capital to experiment with SAF. FlyORO’s zero-CAPEX, leasing-based integration model allows operators to scale blending capacity as demand materializes, rather than betting ahead of it.

This is not a technology designed to win headlines. It is designed to make SAF workable inside real supply chains.

From Singapore to Australia: The Stress Test

If Singapore is the model, Australia is the proving ground.

Geographically vast, sparsely populated, and deeply reliant on aviation for national cohesion, Australia places unusual strain on aviation economics. Medium- and long-haul flights dominate. Distances are unforgiving. Infrastructure decisions matter more because mistakes are expensive.

That makes Australia an ideal stress test for last-mile blending.

FlyORO’s deployment with Wagner Sustainable Fuels at Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport represents the world’s first on-site SAF blending facility located directly at an airport. Not a refinery. Not a remote terminal. The apron itself.

Toowoomba is not an incidental choice. For more than a century, it has served as a gateway between coastal Queensland and the Darling Downs, a threshold between dense infrastructure and the vast interior. Nearby Winton, deep in the outback, is where Qantas was founded more than a hundred years ago, born of necessity to connect distances rail and road could not.

Today, that same geography is testing whether aviation can decarbonize without breaking.

As of early 2025, FlyORO has blended more than 380,000 liters of SAF across its deployments, with the Australian facility serving as a blueprint for regional airports facing similar constraints. The lesson emerging from Toowoomba is clear: decarbonization will not arrive everywhere at once, and it will not start only at megahubs. It will start where flexibility matters most.

The Long View

Singapore’s advantage has never been speed alone. It has been persistence — the ability to remain indispensable as systems evolve around it. From sail to steam, from coal to oil, from oil to finance and now to advanced manufacturing, Singapore has endured by mastering transitions rather than betting on abrupt replacements.

Aviation’s energy transition will follow the same pattern. SAF will scale, diversify, and expand — but fossil fuels and SAF will coexist for decades, bound together by certification limits, infrastructure realities, and economics that cannot be wished away. The future of flight will be blended long before it is fully transformed.

That is why technologies that operate at the interface matter most. FlyORO is not wagering on a clean break from the past. It is building infrastructure for a long overlap — one where persistence belongs not to the fuel with the loudest promise, but to the system that can adapt, verify, and endure while the transition unfolds.

Sometimes survival doesn’t come from choosing the future early. It comes from staying useful while the future takes shape.",,N,,2026-01-19 17:56:36.134467

Gov. Jim Pillen, while pressing the Nebraska Department of Economic Development in 2024 to tighten its belt, steered the state agency to award a $2.5 million no-bid emergency contract to a bioeconomy consultant and lobbyist he knew and had traveled with as part of state delegations.

State Auditor Mike Foley alleges the Economic Development Department, in carrying out that Pillen-picked contract, broke state law by not specifying in writing what emergency justified skipping the required step of bidding out contracts worth more than $50,000, a step meant to save taxpayers money.

In a Jan. 6 audit letter Foley shared with the Governor’s Office, which was obtained by the Examiner and authenticated by the auditor, Foley dinged the department for leaving blank a required section for explaining the emergency on the state’s “Procurement Exception/Deviation” form.

That’s where department personnel must explain the circumstances justifying seeking no bids. Foley criticized the agency for leaving the second page of the May 2024 form blank, writing that it “contained questions regarding the reasons for designating the contract as an emergency.”

Foley’s letter alleges that omitting this information meant the contract did not comply with “the legal requirement to specify the nature of the supposed exigency” under the Nebraska State Procurement Act in Nebraska Revised Statutes 73-815.

That section of state law requires the agency to provide the “justification of the emergency” and requires the state to “retain a copy of the justification with the contract in the state agency files.” Violating that law carries no criminal or civil penalty.

According to Foley, the designation of the contract “as an ‘emergency’ is unsupportable.” The absence of a bidding process, Foley alleged in the letter, resulted in a $2.5 million contract for Global Sustainability Developers LLC, “a company handpicked rather than selected through the ‘time-honored’ and legally required open, competitive process.”

“I think it’s critically important, because competitive bidding is a bedrock, foundational tenet of government operation,” Foley told the Examiner of his findings. “When you sidestep a foundational tenet, it’s just waving a huge red flag for any public auditor. It smacks of favoritism.”

Contracting with GSD

Nebraska awarded the $208,333-a-month, remote work contract in May 2024 to GSD, a Lincoln firm that at the time had a single employee — owner Julie Bushell, a lobbyist with agricultural and telecommunications connections who also leads Ethos Connected, an agribusiness firm using sensors to wirelessly connect farm and ranch infrastructure, including water.

The state contract with GSD called for Bushell’s firm to drum up more bioeconomy business in Nebraska, including by accessing more federal funds for such developments.

Nebraska’s contract with GSD was the Department of Economic Development’s largest emergency no-bid contract since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Examiner found and state officials confirmed.

It was far larger than a typical emergency no-bid contract, with some notable exceptions during the pandemic, based on a recent legislative performance audit of state handling of emergency contracts. The median emergency no-bid contract in Nebraska between 2014 and 2024 was about $350,000, it found.

The auditor’s report, as well as Examiner reporting, make plain that Pillen’s office recommended the contractor on behalf of the governor. Pillen’s chief of staff, Dave Lopez, was among staffers involved in the process, based on records and messages obtained by the Examiner. Chiefs of staff often communicate with state agency leaders.

DED leaders did not know firm

State correspondence indicates that top Economic Development Department leaders did not know the firm they were contracting with when the contract was awarded, based on the Auditor’s Office letter and backed by months of interviews, public records and reporting by the Examiner that started before learning of the auditor’s probe.

But Pillen knew Bushell’s work. She had joined Pillen on state trips to South Korea and Japan, records indicate. She also joined some state delegations when Pillen visited Washington, D.C. Both attended the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. A photo obtained by the Examiner shows Pillen and Bushell together at the 2024 Aksarben Ball, held by a charitable foundation of business leaders.

To the Examiner, the Governor’s Office denied playing favorites.

Foley said Pillen told him when they talked during the audit that he himself had recommended Bushell.

The auditor said the governor, in the same conversation, described the decision as a joint one between Pillen and the DED director at the time, K.C. Belitz.

Emails between then-DED leaders, including Belitz, show the Governor’s Office’s involvement in the contracting process. Belitz did not return calls or messages seeking comment, but his correspondence says the language of the contract was “vetted thru Julie [Bushell] and the Governor.”

Governors hire and fire the leaders of many state agency departments, including the Department of Economic Development.

Belitz resigned in June 2025. Pillen replaced him with his general counsel for the Governor’s Office, Maureen Larsen, who also previously served as deputy director of Pillen’s Policy Research Office.

“I’ve been in the [Capitol] building 25 years, 11 years as an auditor, and I can’t recall anything that had the direct involvement of the governor,” Foley said.

Contract facts

Of about 4,200 contracts entered by the state in each of the past two calendar years, 22 in each year were emergency contracts for which the state sought no competitive bid, according to the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, the state’s clearinghouse for such contracts.

Under the Nebraska Procurement Act, DAS is “the sole and final authority on contracts for personal property by a state agency,” including for no-bid emergency contracts.

Including the GSD contract, only five of the state’s 44 emergency no-bid contracts over the past two years left the justification blank, DAS says. Three of the five were DED contracts, officials said. Two were on behalf of DAS itself.

From mid-2020 through 2025, the Department of Economic Development signed a total of four emergency no-bid contracts, officials said. Two paid six figures. One was for five. GSD’s was for $2.5 million.

Pillen’s team blamed a former DED attorney for not adding the legal justification to the GSD contract and the others. But Pillen-led DAS signed off on the GSD contract without the justification, copies of the contract indicate.

Lee Will, director of the Department of Administrative Services, said last week that the state contracting office, after Foley’s audit, had revised its Deviation Form to make clearer that the justification section must be filled out and added a step to its processes to make sure the required box is completed.

Foley said he would like his office to join the process. State Sen. Bob Andersen of Sarpy County introduced Legislative Bill 997 Tuesday on Foley’s behalf that would require an additional copy of state no-bid contracts, including emergency no-bid contracts, to be filed with the State Auditor’s Office, in addition to the agency and DAS.

The Governor’s Office, over several days last week, told the Examiner Pillen recommended contracting with Bushell because of her business connections, leads on potential development projects and experience in maximizing how much federal money Nebraska could secure at the end of the Biden administration.

Pillen spokeswoman Laura Strimple said the Governor’s Office has supported two emergency no-bid contracts “when the Legislature passed requirements to engage vendors in a certain timeframe, and the cumbersome procurement process would not have met the deadline.”

Both have helped taxpayers, she argued, and “delivered overwhelming value to Nebraska.” One was the DED contract with GSD. Another was a $10 million, four-year state contract with Utah-based Epiphany Associates and the Department of Administrative Services to help DAS use technology to find potential “systemic cost savings across state government.”

“The bioeconomy contract delivered hundreds of millions to Nebraska, and the DAS cost-reduction effort continues to produce lasting reforms in cost-cutting efforts for the state,” Strimple said.

The Epiphany contract drew legislative scrutiny during the 2024 session, including questions from state senators about whether leadership of the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services should have disclosed previous ties to the company.

Governor’s Office: Bushell helped state get funds

Team Pillen says Bushell’s business, GSD, helped Nebraska secure $550 million in federal funds — about $200 million of which have yet to arrive. Among the funds mentioned, the administration says Bushell helped the state secure $33 million in U.S. Department of Agriculture funds for Affordable Clean Energy Loans to Sandhills Energy and Bluestem Energy Solutions and $10.3 million in Rural Energy for America grants and loans.

The $200 million USDA New Era grant to Nebraska Electric G&T is the part that had not yet been disbursed, Foley’s letter says.

Pillen’s staff also credits Bushell with a pledged investment of at least $5.5 billion to build a cornstalk converting biofuels plant in Phelps County, in the Holdrege area.

Former Phelps County Development Corporation director Ron Tillery called Bushell’s help vital.

Tillery said Pillen suggested during a visit to Phelps County in July 2024 that local economic development officials should meet with Bushell if they were serious about pursuing a sustainable aviation fuel plant, which locals wanted as a means to carve out a market niche in a world of ethanol and biodiesel plants.

Kenny Zoeller, who leads the Governor’s Policy Research Office and spoke for Pillen’s team, said Bushell came recommended by Nebraska business leaders and “Aksarben,” which is often shorthand in political circles for a group of statewide business leaders sometimes loosely tied to the Omaha-based Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben organization.

Three people with ties to the group questioned whether its leaders would recommend a contractor for a state bioeconomy consultant, and more than one said Pillen had introduced members of the group to Bushell. Bushell joined the group’s board in mid-2024, archives of the foundation’s website show.

Bushell, in a sit-down interview last week, echoed the Governor’s Office in saying the economic benefit to Nebraskans of her work helped the state obtain more federal money than it might have otherwise. She said her contacts in the bioeconomy space helped land planned projects like Phelps County’s DG Fuels plant.

The Pillen administration, through Zoeller and Will, argued that Bushell’s work helped Nebraska secure nearly $290 million more in federal funds than a per-capita projection of what the state should expect to receive.

“I think the deliverables of this contract speak for themselves,” Bushell said. “I am incredibly proud that the world knows that Nebraska is the leader in bioeconomy, and in an economic position that the state’s in now. I think it’s really important that we continue to grow and invest in these projects.”

Foley argued that the administration’s per-capita number ignores that most such federal projects run through more complex formulas that consider much more than population. He noted in his audit letter that “other states received comparable amounts of the same grant and loan monies, presumably without any involvement by GSD.”

Questions about DG Fuels

Foley’s audit letter also questions whether Nebraska and Phelps County economic development officials are banking on a $5.5 billion DG Fuels project that might not be built.

The audit team dug into 11 announced DG Fuels projects in 10 states since 2001, seven of which pledged investments of more than $1 billion. The Foley letter indicates that none of the DG Fuels projects his team reviewed has yet been built to completion, although the audit shows several of the projects have made progress.

Among them: a sustainable aviation fuel plant planned for the former Loring Air Force Base in Maine, where the audit said ground was expected to be broken in 2026, and a 2024 announced project in St. James Parish, Louisiana, which expects to start producing fuel in 2028.

Washington, D.C.-based DG Fuels, a biofuels and sustainable aviation fuel developer, did not return multiple Examiner attempts over several days to reach the company by phone and email.

Michael Darcy, the owner of DG Fuels, originally agreed to sit down with Foley’s team, the auditor said. But Foley said Darcy and his company cut off communication before the two met, after Foley communicated that he planned to question the progress of projects in other states.

Bushell said Nebraska needs to be careful not to create an environment that costs the DG Fuels project. She and Tillery say the project is making more progress through the state and local permitting process. Bushell said DG Fuels told her the Nebraska project is among its top priorities.

Foley’s audit letter also highlights that Bushell sought in October 2024 to amend the conflict-of-interest provision of her state contract so she could negotiate with DG Fuels about possible future work after the state contract ended. She did not respond to the Examiner’s follow-up questions about that push via text or email.

DED, with the Governor’s Office’s knowledge, approved the contract change. Will, in a statement to the Examiner, said the department “felt the revised terms would not lead to a conflict of interest.”

“In short, there was no risk for a conflict of interest, because there was no funding to create a conflict while under state contract,” Will said.

Foley said such conflict of interest language is meant to protect taxpayers and that he had unanswered questions about Bushell’s push to negotiate with a private company she had been working with on the state’s behalf.

“The Phelps County project is one of the trophy projects that supposedly came from this [contract],” Foley said. “There were a number of federal grant awards that they say came because of GSD. … When our auditors looked into it, other states were able to get similar amounts.”

Too little time?

Foley, in his letter, wrote that DED had enough time “to search for a qualified service provider in compliance with statutory competitive bidding requirements” for the $2.5 million bioeconomy contract that went to GSD.

But Zoeller and Will pushed back, arguing that Legislative Bill 1412, the mid-biennium budget bill, left the state too little time to act when it took effect in early April 2024.

The bioeconomy provision in the budget bill required DED to coordinate work aimed at bioeconomy development, seek federal grants, and it gave the agency 15 months to report back on its progress. The law did not require immediate spending or entering into a contract.

The Governor’s Office pointed to the law’s requirement for a status report on the new bioeconomy initiative to the Legislature by June 30, 2025. According to Zoeller and Will, issuing and evaluating requests for proposals takes up to 60 days, followed by an RFP protest period of up to 50 days, which meant completion without the emergency approach could have taken up to 110 days.

But Foley said because the Governor’s Office sought that section of LB 1412, the Department of Economic Development had early warning and could have started its processes sooner to be ready to go out for bids and could have sought requests for information to gauge interest sooner from potential bidders.

Contract obligations questioned

Foley’s questions about the contract stretched into how little it required of GSD in terms of reporting how the firm spent state money. It did not require itemized receipts of expenses or time sheets. It required only the submission of monthly invoices summarizing the work done and dollar amounts, he said.

Those invoices largely say Bushell’s firm helped introduce state and local leaders to bioeconomy developers, scheduled and attended meetings, lobbied federal agencies and contacts, reviewed and discussed grant applications and communicated with project planners.

Will said that, while Foley was right that many state contracts are stricter with reporting requirements for the spending of state funds, some state contracts with consultants, including many in economic development, leave more flexibility to let consultants spend the funds more nimbly.

The State of Nebraska pushed to end Bushell’s contract two months early, at the end of February 2025. Zoeller told the Examiner the change in presidential administrations meant that Nebraska and Pillen had a more direct relationship with the Trump administration and no longer needed GSD’s connections. Foley said he started requesting information about the state contract in mid-January 2025.

In the end, the state paid Bushell’s firm $2.08 million. What Nebraska got for that money, Foley said, remains unclear. Pillen’s team says the state got a more than reasonable return on its investment.",https://media-chadronradio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2026/01/unnamed-7.png,N,,2026-01-19 15:56:38.134619

With millions of possible MOFs to choose from, the formulas accurately predict how much usable hydrogen each porous crystal can hold, according to a new University of Michigan study.

With molecules in general containing 80-90% empty space, just one gram of a MOF has an internal surface area as big as a football field. Hydrogen molecules cling to their porous surface, but small variations in the crystal’s structure impact how the hydrogen interacts with the material.

Using a few physical properties of a potential MOF, researchers can now—without using a supercomputer or machine learning—estimate how much hydrogen can be stored under real-world conditions.

“By enforcing the right physics from the beginning, we show that you can match black-box machine-learning performance with models that are fully transparent. The combination of accuracy, interpretability, and deployability is what sets this approach apart,” said Alauddin Ahmed, research faculty of mechanical engineering at U-M and author of the study in PRX Energy.

The optimal MOF would store hydrogen with high weight efficiency and space efficiency. While the U.S. Department of Energy set targets for a 5.5% capacity by weight and 40 grams of hydrogen per liter under real-world conditions, no material has yet reached both benchmarks simultaneously.

Simple, explainable models

Previously, researchers relied on complex computer simulations that are accurate but computationally expensive and time consuming. More recently, machine learning models have sped up the search process, but they don’t explain the underlying physics.

To improve transparency, the researchers combined symbolic regression with other advanced algorithms to sift through billions of mathematical possibilities to find the simplest algebraic equations that predict performance as accurately as a complex simulation.

“I care deeply about interpretability. In safety-critical and mission-critical applications, people need to understand why a model is making a prediction, not just whether it is accurate on a test set,” said Ahmed.

The study curated a database of 88,400 MOFs detailing seven key crystal properties. Each entry also includes a prediction of storage capacity under a real-word operating range—between 100 and 5 bar at 77 kelvin.

The team used their algorithm to search for mathematical relationships between crystal properties and hydrogen storage capacity within this large dataset. To ensure the math was widely applicable, they validated the equations against a superdatabase of 600,000 MOFs pulled from open-source repositories previously reported by the author.

Pore space drives hydrogen uptake

Just one or two physical traits drove the vast majority of variation in usable hydrogen capacity across the MOFs. Void fraction—the ratio of empty space inside the crystal to crystal volume—can alone predict a MOF’s space efficiency. Void fraction plus pore volume predicts weight efficiency. Additional factors only added marginal gains to the predictions.

“We expected these features to matter, but we did not expect simple, constrained equations to match the accuracy of complex machine-learning models so closely,” said Ahmed.

Because the final models are fast, interpretable and essentially cost free, they can be integrated directly into automated systems that design and screen new hydrogen storage materials.

“More broadly, this work shows that physics-informed symbolic regression can be a practical bridge between large-scale simulations and real-world design. If we can replicate this success across other classes of energy materials, we will have a powerful new way to turn data into insight and, ultimately, into better technologies,” said Ahmed.

The company expects the park will produce sustainable aviation fuel, as well as renewable methanol.

Parsons was asked the steps that had to be taken to receive approval and what this first phase of the project entails.

Nova Sustainable Fuels plans to use waste biomass from forestry and forest-based industries to create low-emission aviation fuel as an alternative to petroleum-based fuel.

According to the provincial government, the company would create a new market for the oversupply of biomass from forestry activity like wood chips and bark that are byproducts of silviculture, harvesting, and sawmilling.

Parsons explained how biomass would fuel the operation and whether this involves local companies like Port Hawkesbury Paper in Point Tupper.

According to Nova Sustainable Fuels, sustainable aviation fuel is made from renewable materials and performs like traditional jet fuel. The company said sustainable aviation fuel is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 85 per cent, compared to conventional jet fuel. Parsons was asked where that number comes from.

Powered by solar and wind farms, the company said the park will combine renewable electricity, sustainable biomass, and water to produce these fuels.

According to the province, the company will need a second environmental assessment approval for these farms, as well as a transmission line, in this second phase.

Parsons explained where the solar farms and transmission line would be located, as well as their size and capacity.

The company said the sustainable fuel is considered a “drop-in fuel” that works with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure, and Parsons was asked if this means any aircraft running on jet fuel can use their product.

The First Movers Coalition shows that ambitious demand, combined with strategic collaboration, can accelerate decarbonization in even the hardest-to-abate sectors.","The need for progress on global decarbonization has never been greater than in an era marked by geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic volatility.

The World Economic Forum's First Movers Coalition was launched to help scale breakthrough decarbonizing technologies through the market.

Despite the challenging context, First Movers are demonstrating that progress is happening and makes business sense.

In a period marked by geopolitical tensions, divergent regulatory priorities and persistent macroeconomic volatility, the need for global decarbonization progress has never been greater.

In 2021, half of the emissions reductions needed to reach net zero depended on technologies that were not yet commercially available. The World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition (FMC) was launched to create the demand signal required to help scale these breakthrough decarbonizing technologies through the market.

Since then, significant progress has been made. By 2023, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimated that the share of required emissions reductions dependent on early-stage technologies had fallen to 35%. Yet, a substantial gap still remains.

Today, the FMC represents 101 companies that have pledged a total of $19 billion in purchasing commitments by 2030 across hard-to-abate mobility industries including aviation, shipping and trucking and materials sectors including cement and concrete, steel, aluminium as well as carbon dioxide removal (CDR).

These commitments would help reduce 26 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) through purchasing alone. Five years ahead of the commitment target, members are already moving towards implementing their pledges and have collectively signed more than 130 offtake agreements.

First Movers helping transform mobility sectors

Across mobility sectors, infrastructure limitations, insufficient supply and high green premiums continue to slow the adoption of low emission mobility solutions. Companies are overcoming these barriers through coordinated investments in supply chains, infrastructure and alternative carbon accounting opportunities.

In aviation, sustainable aviation fuel remains expensive and unevenly distributed. To address this challenge, American Express Global Business Travel, together with a consortium of partners, helped establish Avelia, one of the first large-scale book-and-claim platforms for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Avelia enables corporate customers to claim the emissions benefits of SAF, even when the fuel is delivered elsewhere. By June 2025, the platform had enabled more than 155 million litres of SAF to enter the global network and avoided more than 370,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This shows how innovative accounting systems can unlock new pathways for scaling supply.

In road freight, the uptake of zero-emission trucks remains limited by the lack of charging and depot infrastructure. Freight company Toll Group is addressing this challenge through an investment of $43 million in charging infrastructure, including 28 electric trucks and 30 dedicated charging hubs. By building infrastructure alongside vehicle deployment, Toll Group is proving the viability of electric freight corridors and contributing to the expansion of zero-emission trucking.

In maritime transport, the adoption of low-carbon fuels has long been constrained by supply chain and vessel readiness challenges. Early movers are now operating vessels powered by cleaner fuels such as methanol, sending demand signals to shipyards and fuel producers.

Mitsui O S K Lines plans to deploy nine ammonia dual fuel ships beginning in 2026, while also investing in carbon transformation company Twelve to support the development of clean marine fuels. These actions illustrate how decarbonized maritime supply chains become feasible when buyers and suppliers advance together.

Taken collectively, these examples show that technology adoption depends not only on innovation but also on the ecosystems that support it. Companies are investing in those ecosystems by strengthening supply chains, enabling infrastructure and creating financing and contracting models required to scale low carbon mobility.

Scaling decarbonized materials through collaboration

Sectors such as aluminium, steel, and cement and concrete, require fundamental production process changes and high capital expenditure investments to reach near-zero emissions. Companies are showing that breakthroughs occur when buyers collaborate directly with suppliers to bring advanced technologies to market.

This year marks a breakthrough in zero-emissions aluminium production. The first commercial-scale implementation of inert anode technology has been achieved at mining giant Rio Tinto’s Alma smelter in Québec. This is the result of collaboration between aluminium producer Alcoa and Rio Tinto, the founding partners of ELYSIS, (listed in the FMC’s First Suppliers Hub), together with the Government of Canada. Their commitment has resulted in the commissioning of the world’s first zero-emission aluminium smelter.

In cement and concrete, energy company Vattenfall and green cement producer Cemvision have formed a commercial agreement that enables Vattenfall to fulfil its commitment. Cemvision will supply Vattenfall with 20% of its cement and concrete demand from 2028. Cemvision’s cement, produced leveraging technology using recycled industrial by-products and fossil-free energy, will offer 80% of emission reductions by 2028 and up to 95% by 2030.

Energy equipment manufacturer GE Vernova has contracted zero-emission steel for wind tower production from First Supplier and steel maker SSAB. This material was developed through the integration of hydrogen-reduced iron produced with HYBRIT technology at SSAB’s facility in Iowa. The resulting steel is third-party verified and meets thresholds for near zero emissions established by the International Energy Agency and the First Movers Coalition.

By supporting pilot projects and validating new production methods, companies are helping bring next-generation materials into the commercial mainstream and laying the foundation for decarbonized industrial value chains.

Creating a market for carbon dioxide removal

The development of a durable and diversified carbon dioxide removal ecosystem has long been constrained by the absence of stable demand.

This year, technology giant Microsoft expanded its portfolio of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) solutions. Its 10-year agreement with heating provider Hafslund Celsio for 1.1 million tonnes of removals, combined with its expanded deal with energy company Stockholm Exergi for 5.08 million tonnes, represents one of the largest corporate carbon removal procurement strategies in the world.

Other successes include Google’s 200,000 tonnes purchase from Terradot’s Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW) project. ERW involves spreading finely ground minerals across forest soils, croplands or coastal areas, where they dissolve in water and naturally absorb CO₂, storing it for hundreds to thousands of years.

Together, these agreements amount to more than 6 million tonnes of contracted carbon removals. This represents a significant share of the carbon removal target set within the FMC and is helping shift the economics of the sector by providing long-term revenue certainty and encouraging supplier investment.

What is still needed for industrial decarbonization

Despite significant progress, industrial decarbonization still faces high capital requirements, complex permitting processes and fragmented policy environments.

Broader industry adoption and an enabling policy framework are essential to achieve the scale required for cost convergence with traditional production methods and meaningful global emissions reductions.

More harmonized policies, innovative blended finance mechanisms, sharing costs along the value chain, enabling chain of custody models and diversifying types of contracts can expand pools of demand, which will be essential to accelerate deployment across sectors.

The First Movers Coalition shows that ambitious demand, combined with strategic collaboration, can accelerate decarbonization in even the hardest-to-abate sectors. By investing in supply chains, infrastructure and breakthrough technologies, and by giving emerging suppliers visibility through the First Supplier Hub, companies are shaping the markets that will form the foundation of a net-zero economy.

But there is no room for complacency. This is why the newly released First Movers Coalition’s impact brief takes stock of members’ pathways towards fulfilling their commitments as part of a wider assessment of best practices to catalyse early markets.

Further in 2026, the First Movers Coalition will continue to explore the following questions: What are the mechanisms that have demonstrated they can work in addressing the green premium? How can we leverage new markets and key geographies to ensure the availability of supply and further grow the demand signal and global purchasing power for near-zero products? And who are the new actors and what are the new engagement models that need to be pursued to continue to remain relevant and impactful in a troubled world?",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_sVrJk-sF2pGUfVCdf_KW-oI01w8pL096XoVe-fqkDJ0.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 13:56:44.328775

The expansion was driven by growth in Brazil’s domestic market and a recovery in international travel demand across Latin America and the United States.

In December alone, LATAM carried 7.9 million passengers, up 7.6% year on year. The group expanded consolidated capacity, measured in available seat kilometers (ASK), by 10.9%. LATAM Airlines Brazil recorded an 11.9% increase in domestic capacity, while international operations grew 13.9%.

The company said the capacity expansion reflects network adjustments aimed at aligning supply with demand trends in long-haul and intra-regional markets. LATAM also reported the launch of 10 new routes in December, including two long-haul connections—Santiago–Buenos Aires (Ezeiza)–Miami and Guayaquil–New York—which it described as part of a strategy to strengthen connectivity between South America and North America.

Consolidated passenger traffic, measured in revenue passenger kilometers (RPK), rose 10.5% compared with December 2024, while the group’s consolidated load factor reached 84.5% for the month. Cargo capacity, measured in available ton kilometers (ATK), totaled 731 million in December.

Across 2025, LATAM added eight destinations. Fernando de Noronha, Curaçao, and Tucuman expanded the group’s network in Caribbean and South American markets. As of year-end, LATAM served 160 passenger destinations across 27 countries.

The company said that its most active daily routes in 2025 were Cuzco–Lima; São Paulo (Congonhas)–Rio de Janeiro (Santos Dumont); Bogota–Medellín; Arequipa–Lima; and Brasília–São Paulo (Congonhas). LATAM stated that the concentration of flight frequencies on these markets reflects the relative strength of domestic and regional corridors.

The airline attributed its performance to market dynamics in Brazil and the continued normalization of long-haul demand. In its operational report, the airline said its network expansion “responds to sustained demand in domestic markets and adjustments in international itineraries to support connectivity and price competitiveness,” adding that its destination mix helps balance seasonal demand and optimize fleet utilization.

LATAM is also positioning itself as one of the region’s advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development. In July 2025, the carrier signed a five-year agreement with Colombia’s Fedepalma to promote SAF production from palm-based feedstocks and position the country as a regional supplier. The partnership includes engagement with policymakers, technical education initiatives, and visibility campaigns, while leveraging the palm oil sector’s sustainability credentials and economic footprint. LATAM has also operated SAF-powered flights and supported Colombia’s SAF roadmap as part of broader regional efforts to accelerate aviation’s energy transition.

Industry analysts note that LATAM’s growth aligns with broader consolidation trends in Latin America and the recovery of corporate and leisure travel. The expansion of long-haul connectivity is also viewed as a move to strengthen the airline’s competitive positioning ahead of 2026 planning cycles, particularly in trans-American and intra-South American markets.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2026-01/Captura%20de%20pantalla%202026-01-19%20105158.png?h=22b0d429&itok=I08y7i4_,N,,2026-01-19 12:57:00.546167

---------- Oracle Power PLC - developer of projects in Pakistan and Australia - Reports ""further positive results"" from drilling at the Kalgoorlie gold project in Western Australia.
It says the drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as it expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone gold project.","(Alliance News) - The following is a round-up of updates by London-listed companies, issued on Monday and not separately reported by Alliance News:

----------

Panthera Resources PLC - London-based gold explorer and mine developer in West Africa and India - Reports high-grade gold intersections from reverse circulation drilling at its Bido project in Burkina Faso, including a peak result of 1 metre at 19.2 grammes per tonne of gold at the Kwademen prospect. The company says maiden drilling confirms historical mineralisation across several targets, with multiple shallow, high-grade intersections and broad zones remaining open in several directions. Managing Director Mark Bolton says the results support further exploration upside in a rising gold price environment.

----------

Hercules PLC - Cirencester, England-based labour supply company for the UK infrastructure and construction sectors - Expects to publish its delayed full-year results in March, citing additional audit work required following extensive acquisition activity during financial 2025. The firm says the audit process is well advanced, but the volume of acquisitions completed in 2025 extends the timetable for finalising the accounts.

----------

Hydrogen Utopia International PLC - London-based developer of technology to convert non-recyclable waste plastics into hydrogen and other clean energy - Says it is exploring the use of InEnTec technology to support large-scale production of sustainable aviation fuel and hydrogen-derived diesel in the Middle East, with a particular focus on Saudi Arabia. The company said the technology could enable flexible deployment of SAF plants across the region, without the need to co-locate with heavy industrial sites. Preliminary modelling suggests a Saudi-based project could deliver internal rates of return in the high teens, depending on assumptions, with potential capital investment of at least USD800 million per facility. Hydrogen Utopia said it or a local subsidiary could hold a 10% to 20% free-carry equity interest in such projects and earn management fees from the front-end engineering design stage, as it targets rising SAF demand across the MENA region.

----------

Block Energy PLC - Georgia-focused oil and gas company - Completes the farm-out of its XIQ licence in Georgia after receiving government approval, with US-based Aspect Georgia funding a staged work programme estimated at around USD95 million. Under the deal, Aspect Georgia can earn up to a 75% working interest through seismic, exploration and appraisal drilling and early production facilities, fully carried with no capital exposure for Block. The partner also has an option to raise its interest to 92.5% for additional consideration. Block says the completion provides positive read-across for its adjacent acreage, including Project III and the IX licences, with seismic acquisition at XIQ expected to begin in 2026.

----------

United Oil & Gas PLC - mining company with an exploration asset in Jamaica - Says a survey vessel has been mobilised to begin an offshore surface geochemical exploration programme on its Walton Morant licence offshore Jamaica, marking a key step in advancing the project. The company says the R/V Gyre departs Trinidad over the weekend and is expected to arrive in Kingston, Jamaica, within five to six days, with offshore operations due to start on or around January 27 following inspections. The programme will include multibeam echo-sounder surveying, heat-flow measurements, and seabed piston coring. United expects preliminary geochemical results one to two months after survey completion, with final analysis due by mid-2026. The work is aimed at confirming the presence of thermogenic hydrocarbons and further de-risking the basin to support future exploration decisions.

----------

Oracle Power PLC - developer of projects in Pakistan and Australia - Reports ""further positive results"" from drilling at the Kalgoorlie gold project in Western Australia. It says the drilling programme has continued to intersect shallow gold mineralisation as it expands the gold footprint at the Northern Zone gold project. ""It is great to follow on from previous announcements and continue to expand and intersect gold grades in the northeast area and expand the saddle area. We believe these results are very impressive and add significant upside to the project for our plans with our partners for gold production targeted for later this year,"" says Chief Executive Officer Naheed Memon.

----------

Neo Energy Metals PLC - uranium and gold projects in South Africa - Agrees up to GBP8 million of strategic funding from a UK-based investor to support work toward bringing the Beisa uranium and gold mine in South Africa back into production. The company says an initial GBP1.5 million is advanced via a placement of 166.7 million shares at 0.9p each, alongside a further GBP1.0 million raised from other investors on the same terms. Subject to South African regulatory approvals for the Beisa acquisition, the strategic investor may provide a further GBP6.5 million as a convertible loan, priced at a 10% discount to market with a 5% coupon. Separately, Neo Energy agrees with several debt providers to repay around GBP1.2 million through the issue of 130.7 million shares at the same price. Proceeds are to fund the ongoing implementation assessment programme and working capital through completion of the Beisa acquisition, which the company expects in the first quarter of 2026.

----------

Premier African Minerals Ltd - developer of RHA tungsten and Zulu lithium projects in Zimbabwe - Enters into a settlement agreement with contractor J R Goddard to stay enforcement action relating to the Zulu lithium and tantalum project in Zimbabwe. Agrees to settle the claim for a total of USD2.4 million, plus interest, payable through an initial USD400,000 by the end of January, followed by monthly instalments through November 2026. Enforcement action will be suspended as long as the company complies with the payment schedule. Chair Godfrey Manhambara says the agreement provides certainty and enables Premier to progress funding and operational initiatives at Zulu Lithium. The company also says it is actively reviewing appointments to strengthen the board following recent changes, with a focus on technically experienced candidates to support the next phase of development.

Cette obligation de déclaration peut être remplie via la solution de branche SF6.","La solution de branche SF6,qui a fait ses preuves, sera poursuivie : Swissmem et l’Office fédéral de l’environnement (OFEV) ont signé un Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) actualisé, fixant ainsi les conditions-cadres pour la prochaine période de mise en œuvre de 2026 à 2030. Cet accord confirme l’engagement commun de l’industrie et des autorités à réduire davantage les émissions de SF6 en Suisse.

Nouvelle période avec des plafonds d’émissions plus bas

Pour la nouvelle période de mise en œuvre, les entreprises participantes s’engagent à maintenir les émissions d’hexafluorure de soufre (SF6) dans les deux domaines d’application, à savoir les installations de commutation et les accélérateurs de particules, en dessous des plafonds d’émission à nouveau abaissés. Cela permettra de poursuivre les succès obtenus jusqu’à présent par la solution de branche et d’intensifier encore les efforts visant à réduire les émissions.

La solution de branche volontaire, un instrument éprouvé

La solution de branche SF6 continue de miser sur une approche volontaire et responsable. Cet instrument a fait ses preuves au cours des dernières décennies : grâce à des innovations techniques, à l’optimisation des processus et à une utilisation plus responsable du SF6, les émissions ont pu être considérablement réduites malgré une utilisation parfois croissante au cours des dernières décennies. Compte tenu du potentiel de réchauffement climatique très élevé et de la longue durée de vie du SF6, cela représente une contribution importante à la protection du climat. Le lancement d’un dialogue interne sur une trajectoire de réduction à long terme devrait permettre d’intensifier ces efforts.

Respecter les obligations de déclaration via la solution de branche

Le SF6 est le gaz à effet de serre le plus puissant qui existe et est donc interdit, avec des exceptions. Les utilisations relevant de ces exceptions doivent être déclarées à l’OFEV. Cette obligation de déclaration peut être remplie via la solution de branche SF6. Les entreprises participantes s’engagent à ne pas dépasser le total des plafonds d’émissions fixés. Pour ce faire, le gaz est manipulé avec précaution, les émissions sont évitées dans la mesure du possible et le personnel est formé.

Règles plus strictes dans l’UE et en Suisse

Actuellement, des restrictions plus strictes concernant l’utilisation du SF6 entrent en vigueur tant dans l’UE, dans le cadre du règlement européen sur les gaz fluorés, qu’en Suisse, dans le cadre de l’ordonnance sur la réduction des risques liés aux produits chimiques (ORRChim). Sont concernés les appareils de commutation des niveaux de tension les plus bas, pour lesquels il existe désormais des alternatives techniquement abouties. Les interdictions seront encore étendues au cours des prochaines années.

💡Les acteurs concernés par le SF6 sont impliqués dans la solution de branche, à savoir :

les fabricants et exploitants d’installations de commutation et d’autres installations du réseau d’approvisionnement en électricité,

l’Association des entreprises électriques suisses (AES)

A global coalition representing business aviation has urged aircraft operators travelling to the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting in Davos-Klosters in 2026 to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) where possible.

The Business Aviation Coalition for Sustainable Aviation Fuel said operators should arrange SAF supplies through their fuel providers or fixed-base operators (FBOs).

It noted that more than 100 FBOs worldwide now offer physical SAF, including Jet Aviation at Zurich Airport, a key gateway for flights heading to the WEF.

For operators flying from airports where SAF is not physically available, the coalition highlighted the use of the “Book and Claim” system as an alternative way to cut emissions and support the SAF market.

Under the Book and Claim model, operators buy SAF at an airport where it is available and receive credits for the associated emissions reductions, even though the fuel is not loaded directly onto their aircraft.

The fuel is instead added to the global supply chain, helping to reduce overall aviation emissions.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Increased NATO defense spending and Pacific security initiatives are direct drivers for the Defense & Propulsion segment.","As of January 19, 2026, the industrial landscape of the United States has been fundamentally redefined by the emergence of GE Aerospace (NYSE: GE) as a standalone powerhouse. Once the sprawling centerpiece of a multi-industry conglomerate, the company now stands as a pure-play aviation titan, commanding a dominant position in both commercial and military propulsion. Today, GE Aerospace is no longer judged by the complexity of its balance sheet, but by the efficiency of its production lines and the sheer magnitude of its $175 billion backlog.

With the global aviation sector navigating a ""super-cycle"" of demand and geopolitical tensions driving a resurgence in defense spending, GE Aerospace has become a critical barometer for the health of global trade and national security. This article provides a comprehensive deep dive into the strategic maneuvers, financial triumphs, and operational hurdles that define the company in early 2026.

Historical Background

The story of GE Aerospace is a narrative of radical transformation. For over a century, General Electric was the quintessential American conglomerate, founded on the innovations of Thomas Edison. However, decades of overexpansion and the financial crisis of 2008 left the company burdened by debt and a fragmented focus.

The turning point arrived in 2018 with the appointment of Larry Culp as CEO—the first outsider to lead the firm. Culp initiated a multi-year ""de-risking"" strategy that culminated in the historic announcement in November 2021 to split the company into three independent entities: GE HealthCare, GE Vernova (Energy), and GE Aerospace. Following the successful spin-off of GE Vernova in April 2024, GE Aerospace officially inherited the ""GE"" ticker and the company’s storied legacy in flight. This transition marked the end of the conglomerate era and the beginning of a focused mission: to invent the future of flight, lift people up, and bring them home safely.

Business Model

GE Aerospace operates a ""razor-and-blade"" business model that is the envy of the industrial world. The company’s revenue is divided into two primary segments: Commercial Engines & Services and Defense & Propulsion Technologies.

Commercial Engines & Services: This is the company’s primary engine of growth. GE, often through its 50/50 joint venture with Safran (CFM International), manufactures the engines that power the majority of the world’s narrowbody and widebody aircraft. However, the true profit center is the Services segment. Jet engines are sold with long-term service agreements (LTSAs) that ensure high-margin recurring revenue for 25 to 30 years. Approximately 85% of the commercial backlog is tied to these aftermarket services.

Defense & Propulsion Technologies: This segment provides engines for military fighters, bombers, helicopters, and marine applications. GE’s defense business is deeply integrated with the U.S. Department of Defense and international allies, benefiting from long-cycle contracts and high barriers to entry.

Stock Performance Overview

Over the past two years, GE Aerospace has been one of the top performers in the S&P 500.

1-Year Performance: In 2025, GE shares surged by more than 45%, driven by consistent earnings beats and the successful integration of its ""Flight Deck"" lean operating model.

5-Year Performance: Looking back to 2021, the stock’s trajectory represents a classic turnaround. From the depths of the pandemic-driven aviation slump, shares have risen over 250%, reflecting the market's approval of the company’s simplified structure and debt reduction.

10-Year Performance: On a decade-long horizon, the chart tells a story of ""addition by subtraction."" After years of stagnation under the conglomerate model, the 2024 spin-off unlocked significant value, with the stock currently trading near record highs of $330 in early 2026.

Financial Performance

The financial profile of GE Aerospace in 2026 is characterized by robust top-line growth and exceptional cash generation.

Revenue: After reporting $38.7 billion in 2024, revenue for 2025 is estimated to have surpassed $45 billion, representing high-teens growth. This growth is fueled by a massive increase in LEAP engine deliveries and a surge in military engine output.

Margins: Operating margins have expanded significantly as the company shifts more of its mix toward high-margin aftermarket services and improves factory floor efficiency.

Free Cash Flow (FCF): GE Aerospace is a ""cash machine,"" with 2025 FCF expected to exceed $7 billion. This liquidity has enabled the company to execute a $15 billion share buyback program and increase its dividend by 30% over the last year.

Backlog: The total backlog stands at a record $175 billion, providing nearly a decade of revenue visibility.

Leadership and Management

The leadership of GE Aerospace is centered on Chairman and CEO H. Lawrence Culp, Jr. Culp has been widely credited with saving General Electric from financial ruin. His management style is defined by ""Lean"" manufacturing principles—a philosophy he brought from his tenure at Danaher.

Under Culp, GE Aerospace has implemented FLIGHT DECK, a proprietary lean operating model that prioritizes safety, quality, delivery, and cost (SQDC). The leadership team’s focus has shifted from high-level financial engineering to the ""gemba""—the actual place where work is done—deploying hundreds of engineers into supplier sites to de-bottleneck the supply chain. This disciplined approach has restored investor confidence and created a culture of continuous improvement.

Products, Services, and Innovations

GE Aerospace’s product portfolio is headlined by the most advanced propulsion systems in the world:

CFM LEAP: The workhorse of the narrowbody fleet, powering the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo families. In 2026, production is ramping toward 2,000 units annually.

GE9X: As of January 2026, the GE9X is entering service on the Boeing 777X. It is the world’s largest and most powerful jet engine, featuring 3D-printed parts and ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) that allow it to operate at much higher temperatures than previous generations.

Defense Innovations: The T901 turboshaft engine is currently being integrated into the U.S. Army’s Black Hawk and Apache fleets, offering significantly more power and better fuel efficiency. Meanwhile, the XA100 and XA102 adaptive cycle engines are positioning GE for the next generation of air dominance.

Competitive Landscape

The aerospace engine market is an oligopoly with intense rivalry.

Pratt & Whitney (RTX): GE’s primary competitor. While Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine is a strong rival to the LEAP, it has faced significant durability issues and recalls in recent years, allowing GE to capture market share and maintain higher reliability ratings.

Rolls-Royce: Competes primarily in the widebody market. While Rolls-Royce has undergone its own successful turnaround, it lacks the massive narrowbody volume that GE enjoys through the CFM joint venture.

Safran: A key partner through the CFM International joint venture, which has proven to be one of the most successful partnerships in industrial history.

GE’s competitive edge lies in its installed base. With more than 44,000 commercial engines in service, the company’s ""moat"" is built on the indispensable nature of its maintenance and repair services.

Industry and Market Trends

The aviation sector in 2026 is defined by several macro drivers:

The Engine Replacement Cycle: Airlines are aggressively replacing older, less efficient aircraft with newer models to meet sustainability goals and reduce fuel costs, driving demand for the LEAP and GE9X.

Defense Modernization: Escalating geopolitical tensions have led to a ""re-arming"" of Western nations, focusing on next-generation fighter capabilities and engine longevity.

Sustainability: The industry is pivoting toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hybrid-electric propulsion. GE is at the forefront of this, testing ""Open Fan"" architectures through the RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program.

Risks and Challenges

Despite its strengths, GE Aerospace faces several formidable risks:

Supply Chain Fragility: The ""engines-out"" rate at Boeing and Airbus is still largely dictated by GE’s ability to source castings, forgings, and raw materials. Any disruption in the tier-2 or tier-3 supplier base can stall deliveries.

Customer Concentration: GE’s fortunes are heavily tied to Boeing. Persistent delays or quality control issues at Boeing (NYSE: BA) directly impact GE’s original equipment (OE) revenue.

Valuation Risk: With the stock trading at a high forward P/E multiple (approaching 40x-50x), the market has priced in near-perfection. Any operational miss or downward revision in FCF guidance could lead to significant volatility.

Opportunities and Catalysts

GE9X Entry into Service: The successful commercial launch of the 777X in 2026 is a massive catalyst for widebody revenue growth.

Defense Step-Change: The ramp-up of the T901 engine and potential awards for the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program represent multi-billion-dollar opportunities.

Aftermarket ""Tail"": As the 2020-2024 delivery vintage of LEAP engines begins their first major shop visits toward the end of the decade, service revenue is expected to accelerate even further.

Investor Sentiment and Analyst Coverage

Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish on GE Aerospace. Major institutions like BlackRock and Vanguard have maintained significant positions, viewing the company as a ""compounding machine."" Analyst consensus is a ""Strong Buy,"" with price targets frequently adjusted upward to reflect the company’s superior cash conversion.

Retail sentiment is also high, driven by the clarity of the new business model. Unlike the old ""Black Box"" GE, the new GE Aerospace is seen as a transparent, high-quality industrial compounder that rewards shareholders through dividends and buybacks.

Regulatory, Policy, and Geopolitical Factors

GE Aerospace operates in a highly regulated environment.

FAA and EASA Oversight: Continuous certification and safety audits are a way of life. The company has worked closely with regulators to resolve LEAP durability issues, strengthening its reputation for safety.

Export Controls: As a major defense contractor, GE is subject to strict ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) controls, which dictate where and to whom it can sell high-tech propulsion systems.

Geopolitical Tailwinds: Increased NATO defense spending and Pacific security initiatives are direct drivers for the Defense & Propulsion segment.

Conclusion

As of January 19, 2026, GE Aerospace has successfully completed its metamorphosis from a struggling conglomerate to a world-class aviation leader. By focusing on its core strengths—unrivaled engineering and a high-margin service model—the company has built a $175 billion backlog that ensures relevance for decades to come.

For investors, the case for GE Aerospace is one of operational excellence. While supply chain constraints and high valuations remain points of caution, the leadership’s commitment to ""Lean"" and the ""super-cycle"" in aviation demand provide a powerful tailwind. As the GE9X takes to the skies and the next generation of defense engines enters production, GE Aerospace is not just participating in the future of flight—it is defining it.

Rising regulatory and sustainability pressures, including the EU Deforestation Regulation and full ETS exposure from 2026, are increasing costs and complexity, forcing operators to balance demand growth against compliance burdens.

Volatility in rates, capacity and geopolitics is accelerating the shift toward AI, automation and data-driven platforms, making digital tools essential for forecasting, visibility and flexible routing rather than optional add-ons.

The European air cargo market posted a resilient 4.3 percent year-on-year demand increase by October 2025, but that headline masks a deeper reconfiguration. The defining trend was the redirection of trade flows, with the Europe-Asia corridor becoming the world’s strongest major lane, surging 11.7 percent in October.

This spike was driven largely by “a pivot from Chinese e-commerce giants towards European consumers and the need to adapt supply chains amid global trade policy shifts.” In contrast, intra-European cargo volumes dipped slightly, underscoring the uneven distribution of growth across the continent.

Automation moves forward

On the operational side, Europe saw a mixed picture. While digitalisation continued to advance — including systems like Germany’s mandatory “Secure Release Order” for port containers – complexity increased elsewhere. “Operational procedures saw both simplification and complexity,” says Alexey Zotov, Managing Director of Air Cargo Green Capabilities S.a.r.l., part of ACN Group.

The regulatory horizon is adding new costs and risk. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), taking effect in January 2026, will require “extensive due diligence documentation for key commodities, risking customs holds for non-compliance.” Meanwhile, the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) continues its phase-out of free allowances, directly impacting airline margins.

“The key will be balancing this demand against rising regulatory and sustainability costs,” Zotov notes, pointing to growing pressure on operators to absorb or offset compliance-related burdens.

Growth goes global

Globally, 2025 defied gloomy expectations with projected three to four percent growth in air cargo demand. Africa led regional performance with 16.6 percent growth in October, while Asia-Pacific recorded 8.3 percent, buoyed by “high-value tech and AI-related shipments.”

North America was the weak link. US policy changes – including “high tariffs and the removal of the de minimis exemption for low-value packages” – contributed to a six-month contraction on the crucial Asia-North America corridor. This pushed carriers to shift capacity and supply chains to more stable regions.

“Freighters were reallocated, and production moved to Southeast Asia and India,” explains Zotov. As a result, “lanes like Middle East-Asia and Within Asia saw near double-digit growth as supply chains adapted.”

But volatility brought complications. Spot rates globally were down six percent year-on-year in early December, but “specific lanes like China-U.S. saw rates spike to their highest annual level.” In response, shippers grew cautious. “This uncertainty made shippers wary, leading to a preference for shorter, 6-month contracts over long-term commitments to maintain flexibility.”

“Freighter utilisation remained high, particularly for perishables… and on growing corridors like Africa-Asia.” However, dedicated freighter availability saw “sharp double-digit declines” from mid-year — a shift partially absorbed by returning passenger bellyhold capacity, particularly on transatlantic routes.

This mismatch caused rate pressure in some regions. Despite growing demand, the influx of bellyhold capacity generally kept global spot rates under downward pressure. But as the peak season arrived, “space on key lanes like Asia-Europe and Asia-US tightened, driving rates up by mid-to-high single digits.”

AI and automation shift from nice-to-have to must-have

Infrastructure strain also persisted – congestion at major hubs and weather events (like Super Typhoon Ragasa) continued to challenge reliable transit times. Against this backdrop, digital tools moved from convenience to necessity. AI-powered platforms for booking, document automation (like data extraction from bills of lading), and real-time visibility became operational necessities, moving from ‘nice-to-have’ to core infrastructure for agile decision-making.

“From 2026, EU airlines will have to account for 100 percent of their emissions under the ETS, increasing costs and incentivising investment in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and fuel-efficient aircraft.” As Zotov puts it: “Environmental costs will become a permanent part of freight pricing.”

Another cost headwind looms in e-commerce. New EU customs fees on low-value packages from 2026 may dampen volumes, putting pressure on a sector that has propped up air cargo demand since the pandemic.

Geopolitical shifts are also quietly changing modal dynamics. “A gradual return of ocean shipping to the Suez Canal may recapture some cargo that shifted to air due to longer sea transits.”

“The volatility of recent years has proven that flexibility is paramount. Success will depend on leveraging AI for forecasting, maintaining diversified sourcing and routing strategies, and using data-driven platforms for end-to-end visibility and agile mode switching.”

From 2026, EU carriers will face full ETS exposure, with no free emissions allowances – a structural cost that reshapes margins, not just for airlines but across the chain. For carriers, that means accelerating investment in SAF and fuel efficiency. Forwarders will need to re-price services more dynamically and help shippers navigate compliance complexity. And for shippers: environmental costs are no longer an externality – they’re baked into the freight bill.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/page-8-.webp,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:31.620145

Abstract

The aviation industry, responsible for approximately 2.5–3.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, faces increasing pressure to adopt sustainable energy solutions. Hydrogen, with its high gravimetric energy density and zero carbon emissions during use, has emerged as a promising alternative fuel to support aviation decarbonization. However, its large-scale implementation remains hindered by cryogenic storage requirements, safety risks, infrastructure adaptation, and economic constraints. This study aims to identify and evaluate the primary technical and operational risks associated with hydrogen utilization in aviation through a comprehensive Monte Carlo Simulation-based risk assessment. The analysis specifically focuses on four key domains—hydrogen leakage, cryogenic storage, explosion hazards, and infrastructure challenges—while excluding economic and lifecycle aspects to maintain a technical scope only. A 10,000-iteration simulation was conducted to quantify the probability and impact of each risk factor. Results indicate that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards represent the most critical risks, with mean risk scores exceeding 20 on a 25-point scale, whereas investment costs and technical expertise were ranked as comparatively low-level risks. Based on these findings, strategic mitigation measures—including real-time leak detection systems, composite cryotank technologies, and standardized safety protocols—are proposed to enhance system reliability and support the safe integration of hydrogen-powered aviation. This study contributes to a data-driven understanding of hydrogen-related risks and provides a technological roadmap for advancing carbon-neutral air transport.

1. Introduction

The aviation industry plays a central role in global connectivity and economic development, contributing approximately 2.7 trillion USD to global GDP and employing over 65 million people as of 2016 [1]. However, it is also a major source of environmental concern, accounting for about 2.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nearly 3.5% of total anthropogenic global warming [2,3]. With global air traffic expected to grow at an annual rate of 4.8% [4], achieving decarbonization in aviation has become one of the most complex challenges in the energy transition era. Kerosene remains the dominant aviation fuel, and short- and medium-haul flights contribute approximately 70% of aviation-related CO2 emissions, while long-haul operations exacerbate non-CO2 climate effects such as contrails and nitrogen oxides [5,6,7].

In the broader energy landscape, the global energy market—valued at approximately 1.5 trillion USD—remains predominantly dependent on fossil fuels [8]. These finite resources contribute substantially to environmental degradation, including air pollution and global warming, rendering them unsustainable in the long term [9,10,11]. In response to these challenges, hydrogen has emerged as a key alternative energy carrier capable of drastically reducing GHG emissions when produced from renewable resources. Hydrogen’s high gravimetric energy density and its ability to produce only water vapor during electrochemical conversion make it a particularly appealing candidate for sustainable aviation [12,13].

Hydrogen’s potential to decarbonize aviation stems from its dual applicability in both combustion and fuel cell systems. When utilized in fuel cells, hydrogen produces zero carbon emissions and significantly reduces non-CO2 effects, including nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), contrails, and particulate matter [14,15]. Furthermore, hydrogen can be produced through multiple pathways—such as electrolysis, thermochemical conversion, and biomass reforming—enabling its integration within a broader renewable energy ecosystem [7,12]. Compared to synthetic aviation fuels and biofuels, which still involve partial carbon cycles, hydrogen offers superior environmental performance and long-term sustainability potential.

Despite its advantages and economic benefits [16], the adoption of hydrogen in aviation presents major technical, infrastructural, and operational challenges. These include cryogenic storage at extremely low temperatures (−253 °C), low volumetric energy density, hydrogen embrittlement in structural materials, and the need for comprehensive redesign of fuel delivery and airport infrastructure systems [17,18]. Additionally, hydrogen’s wide flammability range (4–75%) and low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ) introduce significant safety concerns during storage, transport, and refueling operations [13]. The complexity of these issues is further magnified by the aviation sector’s strict safety and certification requirements [19], making large-scale hydrogen integration technologically and economically demanding.

In the United States alone, transportation accounts for approximately 33% of total GHG emissions—75% originating from road traffic—followed by energy generation (41%), industry and agriculture (16%), and other sources (10%) [20]. This emphasizes the necessity of a clean energy transition across all sectors, particularly aviation, which remains one of the hardest industries to decarbonize. Several studies have discussed hydrogen’s potential role in mitigating aviation emissions [12,17]; however, most have focused primarily on conceptual designs or the theoretical benefits of hydrogen systems, without providing quantitative assessments of the associated technical risks. Moreover, comprehensive probabilistic analyses that evaluate uncertainties in hydrogen leakage, explosion hazards, or cryogenic storage challenges remain scarce [21].

To address this gap, the present study applies a Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) framework to identify, quantify, and prioritize the key technical risks involved in the adoption of hydrogen as an aviation fuel. Monte Carlo Simulation is a well-established probabilistic modeling technique that enables the analysis of uncertainty and variability in complex engineering systems, making it especially suitable for hydrogen risk assessment [22,23]. By generating a large number of random iterations for probability and impact parameters, the method provides statistically robust distributions for each identified risk, supporting data-driven decision-making in safety and design processes.

Accordingly, this study aims to systematically evaluate the technical risks associated with hydrogen-powered aviation and to propose targeted mitigation strategies for safe implementation. The research distinguishes itself from existing studies by integrating quantitative risk analysis with a probabilistic modeling approach, offering a more objective and data-centered framework. The study focuses exclusively on technical and operational risks, excluding economic feasibility and lifecycle emission assessments, to maintain a well-defined analytical scope. The outcomes are expected to inform policymakers, researchers, and industry stakeholders about priority areas for risk mitigation and infrastructure development aligned with global decarbonization goals.

In this context, the study is guided by two primary research questions:

What are the main technical and operational risks associated with the use of hydrogen in aviation?

Which of these risks require urgent mitigation to ensure the safe and scalable adoption of hydrogen as an aviation fuel?

1.1. Transition from Kerosene to Sustainable Aviation Fuels

Aviation’s dependence on kerosene-based fuels remains a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution [5]. While electric propulsion could theoretically reduce operating costs by up to 90%, current lithium-based batteries provide only 5–8% of kerosene’s energy density, limiting range and payload capacity; for example, the Alpha Electro achieves only ~90 nautical miles [24]. These constraints have accelerated interest in higher–specific energy alternatives such as hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). SAF pathways—including e-kerosene produced from power-to-liquid processes—can reduce life-cycle emissions by up to 80% and remain compatible with existing aircraft systems [17,25]. Certified producers such as Gevo, Lanzajet, and Neste have already supplied ASTM D7566–approved SAF to airlines [26]. Nevertheless, several SAF options face economic and scalability limitations, with current production representing less than 1% of global aviation fuel demand and costing three to five times more than conventional jet fuel [7,17]. These constraints highlight SAF’s value as a transitional decarbonization strategy but also underscore the need for hydrogen as a long-term solution.

1.2. Research Gap and Rationale for a Risk-Based Analysis of Hydrogen in Aviation

Although multiple studies emphasize hydrogen’s potential for near-zero-emission aviation, most assessments focus on isolated technical aspects—such as combustion, cryogenic storage, or propulsion design—rather than integrated risk evaluation [12,18,21]. Existing research rarely quantifies the combined probability and impact of hydrogen-related hazards, and there is a clear absence of probabilistic modeling frameworks in this domain. While Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) has been used effectively in other engineering risk analyses, its application to hydrogen aviation remains limited [22,23]. No previous study integrates Delphi-based expert elicitation with high-iteration Monte Carlo modeling to simultaneously evaluate leakage, cryogenic failure, explosion hazards, and infrastructure adaptation. This gap restricts the development of data-driven safety standards. Therefore, the present study introduces one of the first comprehensive probabilistic risk hierarchies for hydrogen aviation by generating 10,000-iteration stochastic distributions for major technical hazards.

1.3. Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft: Environmental Advantages and Engineering Challenges

Hydrogen offers substantial sustainability benefits due to its high gravimetric energy density and near-zero carbon emissions when used in fuel-cell propulsion [12,13]. Combustion or electrochemical conversion produces no particulate matter and markedly lower NOₓ emissions compared to kerosene [17]. However, hydrogen’s physical properties impose significant engineering challenges: liquid hydrogen must be stored at approximately −253 °C and occupies nearly four times the volume of kerosene, increasing risks of leakage, embrittlement, and cryogenic failure [18,21]. Its wide flammability range (4–75%) and extremely low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ) elevate explosion and fire hazards during operations [17]. Furthermore, scaling hydrogen-powered aviation requires major modifications to aircraft architecture, refueling systems, ground operations, and maintenance protocols. Although prototypes such as Airbus ZEROe and ZeroAvia fuel-cell demonstrators validate fundamental feasibility, commercial adoption remains limited by storage, infrastructure, and cost constraints.

1.4. Hydrogen as an Aviation Fuel: Opportunities and Barriers

Hydrogen represents one of the most promising long-term decarbonization pathways due to its high specific energy and potential for near-zero life-cycle emissions when produced from renewable electricity [4,7,12,17]. However, cost barriers remain substantial, as green hydrogen production is typically three to five times more expensive than fossil-derived jet fuels. Engineering and safety challenges—including hydrogen’s diffusivity, low ignition energy, and cryogenic storage requirements—also necessitate advanced materials and robust detection systems [18,27]. Infrastructure adaptation remains one of the most significant barriers, requiring modernization of airport refueling systems, cryogenic logistics, and global safety standards [17]. While hydrogen-powered aviation can virtually eliminate CO2 and particulate emissions, its successful adoption depends on coordinated innovation in fuel production, aircraft integration, and international regulatory frameworks [28].

2. Methodology

This study employs the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method to evaluate the probabilistic nature of technical risks associated with hydrogen integration in aviation. The MCS was selected due to its strong capability to model uncertainty and generate statistically reliable likelihood–impact distributions in situations where empirical failure data are limited—particularly relevant for emerging hydrogen propulsion technologies at Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) 4–6.

A systematic literature review was conducted using Scopus, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases to identify relevant research published between 2000 and 2024. The search utilized keywords such as hydrogen aviation, sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen combustion, Monte Carlo risk analysis, and cryogenic storage. Peer-reviewed studies addressing technical, environmental, and safety-related aspects of hydrogen applications were included, while non-academic or outdated sources were excluded. The final dataset consisted of approximately 80 studies forming the foundation for defining the risk domains and their input parameters.

Four primary risk categories were identified:

Hydrogen leakage;

Cryogenic storage challenges;

Explosion hazards;

Infrastructure adaptation.

Each risk was characterized by two parameters: Probability (P) and Impact (I). These parameters were initially defined through a combination of literature-based evidence and expert judgment from four academic specialists in combustion, hydrogen combustion dynamics, and reactive flow mechanisms. Experts independently reviewed the literature-derived ranges and then refined these values through a Delphi-based consensus process.

In this study, expert elicitation was conducted with four academic specialists who work directly in the fields of combustion, hydrogen combustion dynamics, and reactive flow mechanisms. All experts hold doctoral degrees and have active research experience in hydrogen-based propulsion and high-temperature reactive flows. They were selected based on their publication records, ongoing research projects, and specific expertise related to hydrogen safety. Each expert contributed independently during the Delphi rounds, ensuring unbiased parameter estimation and increasing the methodological robustness of the probability and impact ranges.

2.1. Rationale for Probability Calculation Method

The probability values used for each risk factor were modeled using uniform distributions due to the limited availability of empirical incident data specific to hydrogen-powered aviation. Because hydrogen systems in aviation remain at TRL 4–6, neither historical failure rates nor validated parametric probability distributions (e.g., beta, triangular, gamma) are available. Under such conditions of data scarcity, uniform distributions are widely recommended in probabilistic safety modeling because they avoid introducing artificial skewness, distribute epistemic uncertainty evenly across expert-defined ranges, and prevent distortions arising from unsupported assumptions about the shape of the probability density function.

Although more sophisticated distributions may provide higher realism in mature systems, their parameters cannot be reliably estimated in the current stage of hydrogen aviation development. Therefore, uniform sampling was chosen as the most theoretically justified and methodologically robust approach for representing uncertainty in this study.

In addition to the limited availability of empirical reliability data for hydrogen–aviation systems, alternative probability distributions such as triangular or beta were not used because their parameters (minimum, mode, shape factors) require mathematically consistent calibration. At present, no validated datasets exist for deriving such parameters, and expert estimates did not converge sufficiently to support higher-order distributions. Using these distributions without robust parameterization could create misleading peaks or artificial skewness in the probability space, thereby reducing the credibility of the simulation. In contrast, the uniform distribution reflects epistemic uncertainty transparently and avoids implying a central tendency that cannot be supported by evidence. For emerging technologies with highly incomplete data—as recognized in probabilistic safety research—uniform sampling remains the most defensible and scientifically conservative approach.

2.2. Parameter Definition and Validation Process

To enhance transparency, the probability (P) and impact (I) intervals were established using a structured two-step procedure:

Literature-based parameter extraction: Initial minimum–maximum ranges were derived from published hydrogen safety research addressing leak diffusion characteristics, flammability limits, ignition energy, cryogenic tank behavior, and historical industrial incidents.

Delphi-based expert refinement: Initial minimum–maximum ranges were derived from published hydrogen safety research addressing leak diffusion characteristics, flammability limits, ignition energy, cryogenic tank behavior, and historical industrial incidents.

The Delphi process was conducted over two rounds, during which each expert independently reviewed the literature-derived parameter ranges. Consensus was defined using a ±10% agreement threshold, and any divergence in estimates was resolved through moderated discussion, ensuring coherent and unbiased convergence.

Validation: Final parameter ranges were validated by comparing them with published hydrogen safety benchmarks and existing probabilistic studies in related sectors (e.g., industrial hydrogen systems, fuel-cell automotive applications). These comparisons confirmed that the defined ranges aligned with observed hydrogen hazard behavior.

2.3. Monte Carlo Simulation Procedure

In this study, Monte Carlo Simulation was used to quantify the uncertainty associated with each hydrogen-related risk factor. For every risk category, continuous probability (P) and impact (I) values were generated over 10,000 iterations using expert-defined minimum–maximum intervals. Each iteration produced a continuous risk score defined as:

R = P × I

The raw simulation results were summarized using their mean, standard deviation, and 10th–90th percentile ranges to capture variability and uncertainty in the underlying distributions.

Although the inputs for P and I were sampled uniformly, the resulting risk score RRR is not uniform because it is a multiplicative transformation of two variables. For this reason, the percentile values of RRR are not expected to be perfectly symmetric around the mean. This mild asymmetry—observed, for example, in the 10th–90th percentile bounds—is therefore a normal statistical outcome of the model structure and does not indicate any computational inconsistency.

After obtaining continuous P, I, and R values, the results were converted into the discrete 1–5 scoring format required by standard aviation risk matrices. To ensure consistency with ICAO/EASA qualitative scales, all continuous values were first normalized to their respective minimum–maximum ranges and then divided into five equal-width categories (1 = very low, …, 5 = very high). Each simulated value was assigned to its corresponding category, and the final risk matrix scores were derived using these discrete classes.

Because the continuous simulation outputs and the discrete matrix scores represent different stages of the analysis, their numerical ranges are not identical. For example, continuous impact magnitudes such as 16–20 for hydrogen leakage or 20–25 for explosion hazards reflect raw simulation values, whereas the corresponding matrix entries (e.g., I = 5 for leakage and I = 4 for explosion) are the normalized and categorized representations of these values. Thus, any apparent discrepancy between continuous ranges and final matrix scores is an expected and mathematically consistent result of the discretization process.

2.4. Sensitivity Analysis Approach

To identify which input parameters exert the strongest influence on the simulated risk scores, a post-simulation sensitivity analysis was conducted. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the 10,000 Monte Carlo iterations of each risk score and the corresponding Probability (P) and Impact (I) parameters. This non-parametric approach was selected due to its robustness against non-linear relationships. Higher correlation values indicate stronger sensitivity of the risk score to changes in the respective parameter. The resulting correlation patterns enabled the identification of dominant risk drivers and highlighted which variables require improved empirical data in future research.

2.5. Assumptions and Limitations

The model assumes statistical independence between risk factors. While hydrogen leakage, cryogenic failures, and explosion hazards may be interdependent in real systems, empirical correlation coefficients for aviation applications do not yet exist. Incorporating unsupported dependencies could distort results; therefore independence was adopted as a conservative assumption. This may slightly underestimate total system risk in cases where multiple hazards interact.

3. Findings

This study identified eight primary risk factors associated with the integration of hydrogen into aviation systems. Each risk represents a critical area requiring attention to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of hydrogen-powered aircraft. These factors are summarized and explained below:

Hydrogen Leakage: The high diffusivity and wide flammability range of hydrogen significantly increase the risk of leaks and subsequent ignition. To minimize this hazard, advanced leak detection sensors and fire prevention technologies must be employed [7].

Cryogenic Storage Challenges: Storing liquid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures (−253 °C) requires specialized, highly insulated tanks. These systems pose major engineering, design, and cost challenges for both aircraft and ground infrastructure [12].

Explosion Risk in Storage and Transport: Due to its low ignition energy and high chemical reactivity, hydrogen is prone to explosion hazards during storage and transport. Implementing strict safety standards and international handling protocols is essential to mitigate this risk [18].

High Investment Costs: Transitioning airports and maintenance facilities to support hydrogen operations demands substantial financial investments, including the construction of dedicated refueling, compression, and storage systems [29].

Low Volumetric Energy Density: Hydrogen’s low volumetric energy density necessitates larger fuel tanks, which affect aircraft design, weight distribution, and aerodynamic performance [17].

Wide Ignition Range: Hydrogen can ignite across a broad concentration range in air (4–75%), creating considerable safety challenges during handling and refueling. Advanced insulation systems and continuous leak monitoring are therefore required [7,17].

Infrastructure Development Requirements: The introduction of hydrogen-powered aircraft calls for new airport infrastructure, including cryogenic storage facilities, refueling systems, and specialized ground personnel training [13].

Limited Technical Expertise: The operation and maintenance of hydrogen propulsion systems demand specialized knowledge in cryogenics, fuel cell technology, and safety management. A lack of technical competence can compromise both system reliability and operational safety [17,29].

Using Monte Carlo Simulation, this study evaluated the probabilistic behavior of these eight critical risk factors. Each factor was modeled according to two main parameters: likelihood of occurrence and severity of impact. The simulations produced quantitative risk matrices that classified outcomes into three levels of risk intensity:

Low risk: Risk score <10;

Moderate risk: Risk score between 10 and 17;

High risk: Risk score ≥17.

This classification framework provides a clear visualization of how each risk contributes to the overall safety profile of hydrogen-powered aviation systems. It also serves as a foundation for prioritizing mitigation strategies and guiding future research and investment efforts toward the most critical technical challenges.

The visualizations above represent individual risk matrices generated for each risk factor through Monte Carlo Simulation.

Risk matrices are given in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8. Uncertainty indicators based on the 10th–90th percentile Monte Carlo outputs were integrated into each matrix to better reflect the stochastic behavior of the simulated risks. Complementary visualizations, including histograms and percentile-based distribution plots, were also added to illustrate the variability and dispersion of the 10,000-iteration Monte Carlo outputs.

According to the Monte Carlo Simulation outcomes, hydrogen leakage emerged as the most critical risk for hydrogen-fueled aircraft. Its probability of occurrence exceeds 0.70, with a severe impact level between 24–28, requiring advanced safety and monitoring systems. Similarly, the risk of explosion during storage and transport showed a high probability (0.65–0.80) and severe impact (25–30), emphasizing the need for strict safety standards and real-time monitoring during handling and refueling.

Cryogenic storage challenges were classified as medium to high risk, with moderate probability but high impact due to the technical complexity of maintaining hydrogen at −253 °C. The wide flammability range of hydrogen also represents a major hazard, necessitating rapid detection and response mechanisms.

High investment costs and low energy density were evaluated as low-level risks that can be managed through proper planning and system optimization. Infrastructure requirements were assessed as medium risk, sometimes nearing high due to the complexity of airport adaptations. The lack of technical expertise was identified as the lowest risk, mitigable through training and professional development.

Overall, hydrogen leakage, explosion risk, and flammability range should be prioritized in safety planning. Hydrogen leakage remains the most critical issue due to its high diffusivity and broad flammability range (4–75% in air), which increase the risk of undetected accumulation and ignition. Effective mitigation requires real-time leak detection, high-integrity seal materials, and forced ventilation systems integrated into aircraft fuel architectures [18].

Explosion risk during cryogenic storage arises from low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ), phase transition volatility, and material embrittlement at cryogenic temperatures. Ongoing developments—such as composite cryotanks, pressure relief systems, and automated inerting mechanisms—are progressing but remain at TRL 4–6, requiring further operational validation [30]. Likewise, boil-off management and insulation degradation remain persistent storage challenges. Double-walled, vacuum-insulated tanks with vapor recovery systems appear promising but demand careful integration into aircraft design.

In conclusion, risk mitigation must align with both engineering feasibility and technology readiness levels (TRLs) to ensure safe, scalable adoption of hydrogen-powered aviation.

General Distribution of Risk Scores: The mean risk scores and statistical distribution results obtained from the simulation are presented in the Table 1.

3.1. Interpretation of Results

The simulation results revealed clear differences in the significance and variability of the identified risk factors associated with hydrogen integration in aviation. The findings can be interpreted as follows:

Hydrogen Leakage and Flammability Range: Identified as the most critical risks due to their high probability and severe impact (Mean: 20.29; SD: 1.84).

Explosion Risk: Exhibited the highest variability (SD: 2.85), indicating wide fluctuations in probability and impact under different conditions.

High Investment Costs and Limited Technical Expertise: Considered lower-priority risks with comparatively low scores (Mean: 8.80), manageable through financial planning and training programs.

Uncertainty Analysis: The 10th–90th percentile range showed significant variation, especially for hydrogen leakage, emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring and adaptive safety measures.

Overall, the results confirm that hydrogen leakage, flammability range, and explosion hazards are the most influential factors determining the overall safety profile of hydrogen-powered aviation systems. Addressing these high-priority risks through targeted engineering solutions and regulatory measures is essential for ensuring the safe and sustainable implementation of hydrogen technology in the aviation sector.

The risk matrix obtained as a summary is given in Table 2.

This study successfully utilized Monte Carlo simulation to quantitatively evaluate uncertainties associated with the use of hydrogen in aviation. This method allowed for the analysis of risks over a wide range of scenarios, providing a more detailed understanding of likelihood and impact distributions and enhancing the robustness of the risk assessment.

3.2. Sensitivity Analysis Results

The sensitivity analysis shows that probability values (P) are the dominant drivers for hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards, whereas impact values (I) exhibit stronger influence on cryogenic storage and infrastructure-related risks shown in Table 3.

3.3. Risk Mitigation and Implementation Strategies

The Monte Carlo Simulation outcomes revealed distinct distribution patterns across the four analyzed risk categories. Hydrogen leakage exhibited a moderately right-skewed distribution, with 80% of simulated cases falling between 18 and 22 on the risk scale, while approximately 5% exceeded 23, reaching the “severe” classification threshold. This tail behavior suggests that while the average leakage risk is statistically stable, rare but extreme events—such as simultaneous microcracks and ignition—could lead to catastrophic consequences if not mitigated through redundant system design [18].

Explosion hazards displayed the highest variance (SD = 2.85), indicating greater uncertainty compared to other categories. The distribution followed a semi-normal pattern with multiple local peaks, reflecting complex interactions between storage pressure, fuel temperature, and ignition probability [17]. These findings underscore the importance of probabilistic rather than deterministic safety margins, as linear assessments would underestimate high-variance scenarios.

In contrast, cryogenic storage challenges showed a narrower and more symmetric distribution (SD = 1.44), implying that engineering controls—such as improved insulation and active temperature regulation—can effectively manage these risks [21]. Infrastructure adaptation followed a similar pattern, suggesting that although implementation requires significant capital and regulatory adjustments, the associated technical risk remains statistically predictable [12].

Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8 depicts the cumulative probability curves for each risk category, illustrating that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards dominate the upper percentile regions (90th–95th), confirming their status as critical safety concerns. By contrast, storage and infrastructure-related risks occupy mid-to-lower percentile ranges, aligning with existing industrial maturity levels.

A cross-comparison between mean risk scores and standard deviations further validated these insights: risk categories with higher average values also showed wider spreads, signifying greater uncertainty sensitivity. This relationship highlights the interconnected nature of hydrogen risk parameters, where increased system complexity amplifies the range of potential outcomes.

From an operational standpoint, these results suggest that the integration of hydrogen technologies into aviation should prioritize containment reliability and explosion prevention systems over infrastructural investments during early deployment phases. The use of probabilistic analysis thus enables policymakers and engineers to allocate resources based on statistically verified risk hierarchies rather than subjective estimations.

Finally, the findings confirm that probabilistic modeling not only quantifies uncertainty but also contextualizes it, allowing a shift from qualitative concern to actionable engineering guidance. This capability positions Monte Carlo Simulation as an essential analytical tool for future aviation risk assessment frameworks, supporting both design optimization and regulatory compliance toward sustainable, hydrogen-powered flight.

4. Discussion

The findings of this study demonstrate that hydrogen integration in aviation presents both substantial environmental benefits and significant technical and operational risks. Using a Monte Carlo Simulation framework, this study quantifies these risks by generating probability–impact distributions rather than relying on deterministic or qualitative assessments that dominate the existing literature. This probabilistic perspective allows a more realistic representation of uncertainty, particularly relevant for hydrogen-powered aviation technologies that remain at early Technology Readiness Levels (TRL 4–6).

The ranking observed in the Monte Carlo results is directly shaped by the intrinsic physical and operational characteristics of hydrogen systems. Hydrogen leakage appears as the highest-risk category due to the gas’s extremely small molecular size, high diffusivity, and broad flammability range (4–75%), which collectively increase the probability of accidental ignition. This finding is consistent with previous studies emphasizing leakage as the most dominant hazard in hydrogen technologies [12,17]. Cryogenic storage risks follow because material embrittlement, insulation degradation, and rapid boil-off phenomena remain major engineering challenges for LH2 tanks [21]. Explosion hazards show lower probability despite high severity, as ignition events require simultaneous presence of a flammable mixture and an ignition source—conditions less frequent in controlled aviation environments [18]. Infrastructure-related risks rank lowest because they stem primarily from logistical adaptation needs rather than intrinsic hydrogen hazards. This pattern confirms that the probabilistic hierarchy is consistent with established hydrogen safety literature and not an arbitrary model output.

Consistent with previous studies [17,18], hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards emerged as the most critical risk domains. Their high-risk scores—supported by both mean values and percentile distributions—reflect the intrinsic physical characteristics of hydrogen, including high diffusivity, wide flammability range (4–75%), and exceptionally low ignition energy (~0.02 mJ). However, this study extends existing work by quantifying the variability surrounding these risks. For example, leakage exhibited a moderately right-skewed distribution, indicating that while most simulated scenarios fall within predictable ranges, extreme events remain plausible. Explosion hazards also showed the highest variability among all risk categories, highlighting the potential for nonlinear interactions between pressure, temperature, and ignition factors.

Cryogenic storage and infrastructure adaptation, while still important, displayed narrower and more symmetric distributions. These results suggest that engineering controls—such as insulation technologies, boil-off management systems, and airport-level cryogenic logistics—can effectively reduce uncertainty and contribute to safer system integration. These findings align with emerging industrial trends, where cryogenic tank development and refueling procedures have achieved higher maturity levels relative to other hydrogen system components.

An important methodological contribution of this study is the inclusion of a sensitivity analysis, which reveals that the probability parameter (P) carries greater influence on risk scores for leakage and explosion scenarios, whereas the impact parameter (I) plays a more dominant role for cryogenic storage and infrastructure risks. These insights highlight the areas where future empirical research is most needed. For example, improvements in leak detection, material compatibility testing, and ignition probability modeling would directly reduce uncertainty in the most influential parameters affecting overall system risk.

A further consideration is the potential interdependence between risk factors. Hydrogen leakage, cryogenic degradation, and explosion hazards share operational linkages that could amplify cumulative risk. Due to the current absence of empirical correlation coefficients in the hydrogen aviation domain, risk factors were treated as statistically independent. This assumption ensures methodological consistency but may moderately underestimate total risk, particularly for combined leakage–ignition scenarios. Future studies with access to real-world operational datasets should develop multivariate risk models or integrate copula-based dependency structures to capture inter-risk relationships more accurately.

From a regulatory and operational perspective, the Monte Carlo Simulation outputs provide valuable evidence for aviation authorities such as EASA, ICAO, and FAA. Translating simulated risk scores into existing probabilistic safety thresholds can support certification frameworks for hydrogen-powered aircraft. For instance, high-risk clusters identified in the simulation align with categories that require additional redundancy, enhanced inspection intervals, or stricter design safety margins. These insights offer a practical basis for developing data-driven regulatory guidelines rather than relying solely on deterministic safety assumptions.

This study also highlights methodological pathways for future probability modeling. As more empirical hydrogen incident and component-level reliability data become available, probability calculations can be refined using parametric distributions (beta, triangular, Weibull), Bayesian updating methods, or non-parametric density estimation. Such advancements will enable more accurate probability density functions and contribute to more robust risk estimation.

Overall, this research provides one of the first probabilistic hierarchies of hydrogen risks in aviation, demonstrating the critical importance of uncertainty quantification for guiding engineering design, infrastructure planning, and regulatory development. While hydrogen-powered aviation offers transformative decarbonization potential, its safe implementation requires targeted mitigation strategies focusing primarily on leakage containment, explosion prevention, cryogenic system reliability, and airport infrastructure modernization. By integrating probabilistic simulation, expert elicitation, and sensitivity analysis, this study establishes a methodological foundation for advancing both academic and practical understanding of hydrogen safety in aviation.

5. Conclusions

This study provides one of the first comprehensive probabilistic risk assessments of hydrogen integration in aviation using a combined Monte Carlo Simulation and Delphi-based expert elicitation methodology. By quantifying likelihood–impact distributions across 10,000 simulation iterations, the analysis establishes a transparent and data-driven hierarchy of technical risks, addressing the lack of quantitative evidence frequently highlighted in the existing literature. The results show that hydrogen leakage and explosion hazards consistently yield the highest risk levels due to intrinsic physical properties—such as high diffusivity, wide flammability range, and extremely low ignition energy—whereas cryogenic storage challenges and infrastructure adaptation fall into the moderate and more controllable categories.

The study makes several methodological contributions. First, the use of uniform probability distributions was explicitly justified as the most scientifically defensible approach under conditions of limited empirical failure data and early TRL system maturity. Second, expert judgment was strengthened through a transparent Delphi process involving four specialists with recognized expertise in hydrogen combustion and reactive flows. Third, sensitivity analysis revealed that probability parameters are the dominant drivers of leakage and explosion risk, while impact parameters play a more substantial role in cryogenic and infrastructure-related risks—providing guidance for future empirical data collection priorities.

The findings also highlight the need to account for potential dependencies among risk categories, particularly between leakage, cryogenic degradation, and ignition pathways. Although independence was adopted as a conservative modeling assumption due to missing empirical correlation coefficients, future studies should incorporate multivariate probabilistic models or copula-based dependency structures as operational hydrogen datasets become available.

From a regulatory and operational perspective, the probabilistic evidence presented here supports the development of data-informed certification criteria for hydrogen-powered aircraft by agencies such as ICAO, EASA, and FAA. High-priority mitigation strategies should focus on leak prevention, explosion control, and robust cryogenic storage solutions, while infrastructure modernization and workforce training must accompany early deployment phases.

Overall, this study contributes a foundational probabilistic framework for evaluating hydrogen risks in aviation, offering both methodological rigor and practical insights that support engineering design, infrastructure planning, and long-term decarbonization strategies.

Future research should expand empirical datasets on hydrogen system reliability, develop validated probability distributions for aviation-specific failure modes, integrate multi-hazard dependency modeling, and explore sectoral cross-validation with more mature hydrogen applications such as automotive and industrial storage systems. These advances will improve the fidelity of probabilistic risk assessments and accelerate the safe, scalable adoption of hydrogen in aviation.

The IEA reports that industrial energy consumption is still dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal; and transportation relies on oil products for nearly 91 percent of its energy. As of the first half of 2025 however, the global energy supply shows a more positive picture as renewable energy overtook coal as the leading source of energy for the first time in history. But that was no miracle; that is market logic in action. The environmental commodity markets have played the role of scaffolding by providing the framework and support on which the energy transition can be built.

To explain the concept of environmental commodity with a simple analogy: If a homeowner wants to lower his or her carbon footprint, they might install some solar panels. But presuming they live in a block of flats, they might ask a friend to put solar panels on their roof instead. The flat owner helps the friend to finance that and in return can claim that they have neutralised the carbon output of their flat. What those homeowners are doing is creating a marketplace for decarbonisation opportunities, which is exactly what is happening at a macro-level between energy producers, corporates and major industry. It allows people who want to make moves to decarbonise, but who might be constrained. It allows them to invest in the move to decarbonise elsewhere. Similarly, it also enables people who have the opportunity, but not the finance, to get their projects off the ground.

The levers of transition

Emissions Trading Systems (ETS) that put a price on emissions were first launched in 2005. In addition, renewable energy certificates (GOs, IRECs, RECs) that link clean energy generation with consumer demand and fuel mandates (LCFS, REDIII) that reward low-carbon alternatives have gained their importance as tools to put a price on emissions and address environmental impact. These markets exist not to virtue-signal but to account for the cost of emissions and make decarbonisation bankable. Just as in other markets, traders, like us at STX Group, come in to facilitate pricing structures and climate solutions that simplify sales and manage risk for both the buyer and the producer. This market mechanism brings more investment to the market and is therefore an essential part of the commodities markets.

Carbon is finally being priced appropriately — and investment is following

The energy transition is ultimately executed through three levers: efficiency, switching towards renewable fuels and feedstocks, and carbon capture. But these levers only move at scale when markets make them investable; for example, when carbon emissions have been properly priced. The good news is, carbon is being appropriately priced and, as a result, environmental commodity markets have been growing rapidly over the last 20 years. New regulations are also taking effect, especially in Europe, across multiple industries. In shipping, FuelEU Maritime is reshaping fuel demand. In aviation, ReFuelEU mandates are driving uptake of sustainable fuels. RED III is pushing EU member states to increase renewables in power and heat. CBAM is levelling the playing field between domestic and foreign producers in the EU. All these regulations put more pressure on European refineries to ramp up their production of clean energy products. These regulations and increased renewable energy also translate into growing demand for certificates, and that demand makes the transition investable. The future growth of the ‘sustainable economy’ is driven largely by the widening net of regulatory compliance but also has become a lifeline for energy companies operating on markets rapidly shifting towards renewables.

While the pace of change to decarbonise the global economy is arguably still slow, we cannot ignore the emissions that have been capped and addressed because of market schemes like the ETS and a large variety of environmental commodities. To give a sense of the scale, the global EAC market has grown to over 2,400 TWh annually since its formalisation in the early 2000s, representing a size equal to more than 60 percent of the total electricity demand of the European Union. It now covers approximately 40 percent of the EU’s total GHG emissions and generates €38bn in revenues in 2024.

By my latest count, more than 70 countries now operate carbon pricing systems. Clean fuel mandates and schemes are spreading across North America and Asia. In Europe, numerous clean energy policies and regulations are making carbon a balance-sheet cost for major heavy industries including aviation, shipping and manufacturing. There are plenty more schemes similar to the existing regulation that we expect to see make a big impact in the coming years, such as sustainable aviation fuel certificates (SAFc), white certificates to drive energy efficiency and biofuel mandates. One thing is clear: emissions now carry a price, and that price is rising.

I strongly believe that market mechanisms are the most efficient way to align political ambition, corporate obligation and consumer demand to decarbonise, at an affordable cost. Without them, the transition risks becoming slower, costlier and more divisive.",https://www.worldfinance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/marketdriver-600x450.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:41.947365

Experience leads some researchers to believe the answer is sugarcane.

At the ARC Research Hub for Engineering Plants to Replace Fossil Carbon, scientists are working with global technology leaders using the latest science to solve this challenge. Emeritus Professor Robert Henry, The University of Queensland, published a perspective in Agriculture Communications.

The mission is ambitious: create economically viable, renewable aviation fuel at the scale this huge industry needs. Plants are the best current source for renewable carbon, and all available evidence suggests sugarcane is the plant offering the best chance of success.

Sugarcane is the only crop currently produced at the tonnage demanded for this purpose.

Other options, like algae, sound promising in theory, but the economics don't add up. Algal systems are expensive, and unless you can generate a high-value co-product, they will not be cost-effective.

Canola is another option being considered internationally. A lot of Australia's canola is being exported into Europe and turned into fuel rather than food, so that is a food issue. But more than that, it's a scale issue. The yield of canola is a few tons per hectare, so the land you'd need to grow enough to replace jet fuel is more than the area of Australia.

Land use is a critical consideration. So, what crops can you scale? Sugarcane is productive and grown on a relatively small proportion of land. Its small footprint and exceptional productivity make it the standout choice.

Research at the Hub focuses on improving plant biomass to convert it into fuel. They are exploring genetic changes in rice, sorghum and sugarcane to increase the proportion of biomass that can be converted without sacrificing yield.

Rice is the model system as it's easier to manipulate genetically. Once researchers identify promising changes in rice, they will test some of the most effective in sorghum, sugarcane's closest relative among domesticated crops. If it works in sorghum, they can transfer the most promising alternatives to sugarcane, where the genetics are more complex. This tiered approach saves time and resources and increases our chances of success.

Australia and Queensland, in particular, are uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. There is a well-established sugarcane industry, strong research capability, and global partnerships that can accelerate innovation.

Australians fly more than almost anyone else, so the demand for sustainable aviation fuel is enormous in the domestic market. If sustainable fuel can be produced commercially, the world will quickly adopt it. The Hub's aim is to find ways to reduce costs further, making the investment compelling.

The challenge now is clear: breed crops with a high proportion of convertible biomass without sacrificing yield. It's a complex puzzle, but one worth solving.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2026/sugarcane.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:58:53.291399

BRIN researcher Budi Leksono from the Applied Botany Research Center said in Jakarta on Monday that malapari is gaining attention as a future source of clean energy.

He said the plant offers more than just fuel potential, as it can also improve local livelihoods while contributing to efforts to cut carbon emissions.

Leksono explained that malapari seeds produce oil that cannot be used for food, making it suitable as a raw material for biodiesel and bioavtur. Because the oil does not affect food supplies, it fits well with global aviation rules that encourage the use of sustainable fuels.

He noted that malapari seeds naturally yield between 20 and 28 per cent oil, but this figure can rise to around 44 per cent through careful plant selection and improved processing methods.

According to Leksono, BRIN’s research focuses on breeding high-quality trees that produce fruit faster, deliver higher yields and contain more oil.

Malapari also has environmental benefits. As a legume plant, it can absorb nitrogen from the air through its roots, reducing the need for nitrogen-based fertilisers.

These traits allow malapari to grow well on poor soil and in dry areas, including regions in eastern Indonesia such as Lembata, he said.

Development of malapari in Lembata is being carried out under a community-based agroforestry system. This approach allows local residents to grow crops such as coffee and cocoa beneath the malapari trees.

Leksono said the project is not limited to energy production but is also designed to support climate change mitigation efforts.

He expressed confidence that large-scale planting of malapari could help Indonesia meet its emission reduction targets while creating opportunities for carbon trading that would bring additional income to local communities.

This year, BRIN’s work will focus on setting up certified seed sources and developing high-quality malapari varieties native to Lembata.

Leksono said closer cooperation among government bodies, regional authorities, researchers, businesses and the media is expected to speed up the development of malapari as a strategic national crop that is sustainable, inclusive and based on local strengths.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Biodiesel-3.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 10:59:09.393961

NEWARK, DE, UNITED STATES, January 19, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The global catalysts for bio-jet fuel market is expected to experience sustained expansion over the next decade, driven by the aviation sector’s accelerating transition toward sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). As airlines, fuel producers, and governments align around long-term emissions reduction targets, demand for advanced catalyst technologies enabling efficient bio-jet fuel production continues to rise.

The market is projected to grow steadily between 2026 and 2036, supported by increasing SAF capacity additions, expanding refinery retrofits, and growing commercial adoption of certified bio-jet fuel pathways across major aviation hubs worldwide.

What Are Catalysts for Bio-Jet Fuel

Catalysts for bio-jet fuel are specialized materials used in chemical and refining processes that convert bio-based feedstocks—such as waste oils, fats, and biomass-derived intermediates—into aviation-grade fuel. These catalysts enable critical reactions including hydrogenation, deoxygenation, isomerization, and hydrocracking, ensuring the resulting fuel meets stringent aviation safety, performance, and certification standards.

Their role is central to the commercialization of SAF, as they directly influence conversion efficiency, fuel yield, operating costs, and product consistency.

Who Is Driving Market Development

The market includes a range of established chemical manufacturers, refinery technology licensors, and catalyst specialists supplying tailored solutions for bio-jet fuel production. These organizations support airlines, refiners, and energy companies seeking scalable and certifiable SAF production pathways compatible with existing infrastructure.

Collaboration between catalyst suppliers, process licensors, and fuel producers has become a defining feature of the market, particularly as production volumes increase and regulatory scrutiny intensifies.

Where Growth Is Occurring

Demand for bio-jet fuel catalysts spans North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East & Africa. Regions with strong SAF policy frameworks, aviation traffic growth, and refinery modernization programs are emerging as key markets.

Countries investing heavily in renewable fuel infrastructure and low-carbon aviation strategies are driving adoption, with growth supported by long-term airline procurement agreements and public-private partnerships.

Why the Market Is Expanding

Several structural factors are shaping long-term demand:

• Aviation Emissions Reduction: Airlines face mounting pressure to decarbonize operations while maintaining fleet compatibility, making SAF a near-term solution.

• Regulatory and Policy Support: Blending mandates, emissions reduction targets, and sustainability frameworks are accelerating SAF deployment.

• Fuel Certification Requirements: Strict aviation fuel standards increase reliance on high-performance catalysts that deliver consistent molecular composition.

• Feedstock Diversification: The need to process variable bio-based feedstocks elevates demand for catalysts with improved tolerance and durability.

How Technology and Processes Are Evolving

Hydroprocessed pathways, including HEFA-based routes, remain the dominant production method due to their technical maturity and compatibility with existing refinery assets. Hydrotreating and hydrocracking catalysts account for a significant share of overall demand, reflecting their essential role in producing jet-range hydrocarbons.

Technology development increasingly focuses on extending catalyst life, improving selectivity, reducing hydrogen consumption, and minimizing sensitivity to feedstock impurities. These performance attributes are critical for improving plant economics and enabling large-scale SAF deployment.

Market Challenges and Competitive Dynamics

Despite favorable growth prospects, the market faces ongoing challenges. Feedstock variability can impact catalyst stability, while process economics require careful optimization to balance yield, energy use, and operational reliability. In addition, long qualification and certification timelines for new catalysts can slow market entry.

As a result, competition centers on proven performance, process integration expertise, and long-term operational support rather than short-term pricing alone.

Strategic Importance for Industry and Investors

Catalysts for bio-jet fuel represent a foundational segment of the SAF value chain. Their adoption provides insight into the pace of aviation decarbonization, refinery investment cycles, and future SAF supply growth. For industry leaders, analysts, and investors, catalyst demand trends serve as an early indicator of scalable bio-jet fuel production and long-term market viability.

A notable advancement in sustainable aviation has emerged with the expansion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) supply at Frankfurt Airport. This strategic move not only reinforces the region’s position in the global sustainability landscape but also paves the way for broader international collaboration. As SAF becomes an essential pillar in aviation’s decarbonization, the expansion of supply networks highlights how companies are responding to both environmental obligations and operational demands.

Frankfurt Becomes a Fuel Forward Hub

Frankfurt Airport’s integration into the SAF supply chain signals a deeper commitment to carbon reduction across Europe. This development is particularly impactful as Frankfurt serves as a major hub for both passenger and cargo traffic. By enabling cleaner fuel options, this initiative amplifies the airport’s role in supporting a greener aviation network across countries such as the United Kingdom, Norway, Singapore, and Germany.

The operation centers on the delivery of HEFA SPK blend SAF—a type derived from waste oils and fats—reinforcing a shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels. What makes this rollout particularly significant is not only its scale but also the meticulous planning and execution that underpin it, with adherence to strict safety and quality protocols.

Partnership-Fueled Progress

Behind this seamless launch is a collaboration grounded in technical precision and strategic foresight. The groundwork was laid through months of joint planning between the SAF supplier and operational service providers. The result is a robust, resilient framework capable of supporting the needs of diverse airline customers, from national carriers to international conglomerates.

This type of operational synergy reflects a new norm in aviation sustainability—one where logistical excellence meets environmental responsibility. It demonstrates how the private sector can align efficiency with ethics in aviation fuel management.

Benefiting Global Airlines

The supply chain expansion isn’t merely a regional win—it is an international leap forward. Major airlines operating in and out of Frankfurt are already reaping the benefits. Singapore Airlines and the Lufthansa Group, among others, now have greater access to SAF, supporting their own sustainability targets while ensuring compliance with evolving fuel regulations.

For carriers seeking to bolster their environmental credentials, the availability of SAF at strategic transit points is a key enabler. It transforms environmental aspirations into actionable fuel-switching strategies, providing tangible progress in emissions reductions.

Milestones That Matter

Among the standout achievements of 2025 is the delivery commitment of over 1,000 tons of SAF to Frankfurt Airport within a single year. While the volume may seem modest in the context of global jet fuel usage, the implications are far-reaching. This initiative dovetails with the broader European SAF mandate and illustrates a practical roadmap for scaling greener fuel alternatives.

By embedding SAF into its supply architecture, Frankfurt is aligning with global aviation goals while setting a precedent for other airports to follow.

Leading Toward a Lower Carbon Future

As the aviation sector intensifies its focus on environmental performance, the role of SAF cannot be overstated. It is one of the most immediate and impactful tools available to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from air travel. The expanded availability of SAF in key transit markets serves as both a signal and a solution—a signal that the industry is ready to adapt, and a solution that is viable today.

This transition is not just about fuel—it is about forging a pathway for a more responsible, resilient, and resource-efficient aviation industry. It is about meeting regulatory requirements while exceeding expectations in innovation.

A New Era of Aviation Energy

In essence, the expansion of SAF supply at Frankfurt Airport is more than a business decision—it is a commitment to transformation. It reflects the collective will of an industry to change course, to seek alternatives, and to lead responsibly. And it suggests that the future of aviation will be powered not only by technology, but by intention.

The journey toward net-zero aviation is complex, but with every milestone—like this SAF deployment—it becomes more achievable.

The private aviation sector has traditionally drawn scrutiny for its disproportionate environmental footprint. Yet in a turn that hints at deeper shifts in priorities, Wheels Up has unveiled a program that brings sustainable aviation fuel into clearer focus for its clients. This is more than a press release. It signals a strategic recalibration in how business aviation might begin to redefine its legacy through practical and participative sustainability.

SAF Takes the Stage Through Demand-Led Strategy

Sustainable aviation fuel has long been touted as a key lever in decarbonising air travel. What makes the Wheels Up initiative stand out is not the product itself but the market mechanism surrounding it. By inviting customers to contribute toward the purchase of SAF, the company is cultivating a new kind of demand environment. It is not a direct fuel swap yet. It is something more foundational.

In effect, the company is bypassing current supply limitations by giving clients a way to invest in the idea of SAF. The move is more than symbolic. It is a structural vote of confidence in a fuel type that is still ramping up in availability. Market frameworks like this could form the bedrock of future procurement and production cycles.

The Influence of an Airline Legacy

Delta Air Lines has played a foundational role in this development. Holding a significant stake in Wheels Up, Delta is not simply sharing its supply of SAF. It is offering credibility, infrastructure, and long-range planning that can benefit from the collective momentum of multiple carriers and clients.

Delta aims to fuel 10 percent of its operations with SAF by 2030. This long-term goal complements the incremental, client-facing efforts of Wheels Up. It also reflects an ecosystemic approach: the idea that sustainability in aviation cannot succeed in silos. Partnerships matter. Infrastructure matters. Policy advocacy matters.

Drop In, Step Forward

One of the more compelling qualities of SAF is its compatibility. As a drop in fuel, it requires no aircraft redesigns or airport overhauls. It blends seamlessly with existing systems. That compatibility makes it especially suited for early adoption within business aviation, where operational flexibility is prized.

The environmental gains are equally significant. Lifecycle emissions can drop by up to 80 percent compared to traditional jet fuel. In sectors where travel is often seen as optional or luxury based, that kind of reduction repositions the conversation. It becomes less about guilt and more about responsible participation in an energy transition.

Software as the Bridge to Action

Technology is another quiet catalyst in this rollout. The platform used to implement the program, Choose, connects end users with climate action in real time. It translates intent into traceable outcomes. With usage by major airlines already underway, the platform’s adoption by Wheels Up adds consistency to how SAF programs are introduced and scaled.

In a world where environmental claims are often under the microscope, systems like this build trust. They provide the transparency and verification that today’s discerning travellers increasingly expect. That trust becomes the currency for future programs, including those that may one day allow direct SAF purchasing for individual flights.

Reframing the Customer Role

What this program also achieves is a subtle redefinition of customer engagement. In the past, clients booked flights and paid premiums for comfort or convenience. Now, they can also choose to contribute to fuel innovation. It positions the private flyer not just as a passenger but as a stakeholder in the aviation transition.

This change speaks to evolving travel preferences. Environmental, social, and governance considerations are no longer confined to boardrooms. They are influencing personal travel decisions, especially in the high-net-worth segments where private aviation finds most of its customers.

Scaling with Intent

Even with these promising developments, the road to meaningful SAF adoption is long. Supply remains limited. Prices are high. Infrastructure and policy support are still developing. Yet Wheels Up’s new program contributes a necessary spark. It adds shape to the conversation by introducing a form of participation that is both accessible and meaningful.

As more customers opt in, producers gain signals of demand. That, in turn, supports investment, scalability, and policy momentum. It is not a silver bullet. But it is a tangible step in a sector known for abstract ambitions.

A Parallel Worth Watching

For organisations guiding transportation clients on their sustainability pathways, initiatives like this provide valuable insight. They illustrate how behavioural levers, technological platforms, and strategic partnerships can work in tandem. The goal is not simply to reduce emissions per flight. It is to embed sustainability into the service model itself.

The aviation industry is not short of innovation. But progress hinges on how that innovation is implemented, how incentives are structured, and how collaboration is scaled across value chains. That is where advisory roles gain relevance. Not by reinventing the wheel, but by showing where it can turn with greater purpose.

Conclusion

The partnership between Wheels Up and Delta brings the promise of sustainable aviation fuel into the charter travel space with new clarity. It offers a glimpse of how the future of flight might be reshaped not through radical transformation, but through smart, integrative steps.

This initiative bridges the gap between ambition and action. It enables travellers to do more than offset their journey. It invites them to shape the journey of aviation itself.

In doing so, it hints at a larger truth. The most effective sustainability programs are those that do not rely solely on disruption. They thrive on inclusion. They invite every participant to contribute to progress. And they suggest that with the right alignment of innovation, collaboration, and intent, even the most exclusive corners of transport can open new pathways to responsibility.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-8-1-1024x576.png,N,,2026-01-19 07:56:56.697946

Airports have a pivotal role to play as the air cargo industry moves ahead with managing increased e-commerce volumes.","Cargo at a crossroads: digitalisation, e-commerce and climate action in 2026

At the close of 2024, e-commerce accounted for approximately 20% of air cargo volumes worldwide, with projections that those volumes could double within the following decade.

Various business models have been employed to handle, process, transport, clear and deliver this high volume of shipments. However, as the growth happened over a rapid period, accelerated by COVID-induced changes in consumer behaviours, many deviations to processes emerged.

E-commerce shipments are not governed by industry standards in terms of processing or handling, and there are no international regulations that cover handling for this specific commodity, although e-commerce shipments must comply with safety and security regulations.

In addition to a lack of industry standards, deviations in government regulations, deviations in standard operating procedures and deviations in customer expectations all contributed to a complex and challenging business environment.

E-commerce market outlook

Air cargo accounts for approximately 35% of global trade value annually, worth an estimated US$9.0 trillion. In volume terms, this equates to more than 64 million metric tonnes.

E-commerce volumes have grown steadily over the last five years, and industry estimates indicate that it now accounts for over 12 million metric tonnes.

Changes in consumer behaviour have shifted from traditional retail ‘brick and mortar’ to online marketplaces, C2C platforms and direct sales channels. Social media-based retail activity, via Instagram, Facebook and the growing TikTok shop, among others, are accelerating this evolution as retail is now available 24 hours a day and accessible via smart phone technology. Global payment systems support this ‘shop anywhere, anytime’ mindset.

Ex-China e-commerce reached 4.4M tonnes in 2024 and has grown 38% p.a. since 2021. China e-commerce volumes have almost doubled in the past two years.

Low-value e-commerce reached 55% of China-U.S. air trade volumes in 2024 at the expense of general air cargo.

More recently, with the U.S. tariff changes since the beginning of April 2025 and the removal of the ‘de minimis’ exemption since the start of May, a strong impact is observed on the e-commerce origins China/HK to the United States.

E-commerce safety across the supply chain

Safety and security remain the air cargo industry’s top priority, so it bears noting that the rapid growth of e-commerce has brought additional safety and security concerns, particularly with the low barrier to entry for global shippers and the proliferation of C2C and B2C environments.

The rapid growth of e-commerce, projected to reach $8 trillion in global sales by 2027, has reshaped air cargo safety in three key ways:

Surge in shipment volume and complexity, with small, high-frequency shipments complicating screening, labelling and compliance enforcement.

Hazardous materials risks – Lithium battery shipments, growing 30% annually, account for a significant portion of air cargo fire risks. In recent years, more than 50% of reported air cargo fire incidents involved lithium battery-related shipments.

Security and cyber threats – Smugglers exploit fragmented e-commerce logistics to ship counterfeit or illegal goods, while cyber-attacks on air cargo tracking systems have risen by 15% annually, increasing risks of shipment fraud and data breaches.

Simplified and aligned processes

Air cargo is complex by nature as cargo is moved on behalf of millions of shippers across 193 countries, involving more than 20,000 connected points on the services of over 700 airlines with thousands of truckers, freight forwarders and ground handlers getting involved.

The compliance environment involves international and national regulations, trading bloc conditions and operator-specific instructions. For the industry to operate efficiently, we seek simplified and aligned processes wherever possible.

The rise of e-commerce has transformed air cargo operations, necessitating significant changes in data management practices. Traditionally, air cargo relied on fragmented data systems that varied by carriers, freight forwarders and customs agencies.

The surge in e-commerce has heightened the need for real-time tracking, efficient customs clearance and optimised last-mile delivery. Key changes include the adoption of standardised data formats (e.g., IATA Cargo-XML or ONE record), the integration of advanced technologies like blockchain for data transparency and the implementation of automated data exchange protocols. These changes promote interoperability and enhance data accuracy, enabling stakeholders to respond swiftly to market demands.

Ground handler challenges

Ground handlers are the first line in customer service for carriers’ customers and the last line of defence when it comes to safety, security and compliance. Ground handling activity is currently unregulated, with many differences existing between carriers in terms of standard ground handling operations and procedures.

As such, a ground handler who represents multiple carriers is faced with managing various operational standards and deviations.

As e-commerce grows, the role of the ground handler becomes even more important as volumes of small shipments often place additional burdens on facility and border management when compared to larger consolidated shipments.

Sustainability

Sustainability considerations are becoming increasingly critical for air cargo and, consequentially, e-commerce logistics. The TIACA annual sustainability survey illustrates that sustainability considerations are important for many industry stakeholders, as illustrated in the chart below.

As e-commerce continues to grow, its impact on air cargo operations has raised concerns about sustainability, particularly in terms of environmental impact and waste management.

The rapid rise in parcel volumes has led to increased air freight traffic, contributing to higher carbon emissions and energy consumption. The environmental challenges are compounded by the growing demand for expedited deliveries, often requiring higher frequency and shorter lead times.

To address these challenges, air cargo companies are focusing on reducing their carbon footprints through various measures. The shift toward more fuel-efficient aircraft, investment in sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and the use of electric ground support equipment (GSE) are key changes aimed at minimising emissions.

Additionally, air cargo providers are working on waste reduction strategies, such as optimising packaging, reducing single-use plastics and recycling materials.

Technology plays a significant role in improving sustainability by enabling better route optimisation and energy management systems. Advanced data analytics and AI are being used to forecast demand, optimise flight schedules, and minimise excess fuel consumption.

Furthermore, the integration of sustainable practices in last-mile delivery through electric vehicles, drones and optimised packaging further enhances the sustainability of e-commerce logistics.

These changes are crucial in balancing the increased demand for air cargo with the growing need to reduce environmental and waste management impacts.

Summary and conclusion

The e-commerce sector will continue to evolve as consumer behaviour, business operations and regulatory environments change. Air cargo will remain ideally placed to capitalise on these evolutions from lower value B2C and C2C as well as growing values in the B2B sectors. Although more stringent formal customs entries can be anticipated.

Safety is a critical concern, especially with lithium battery risks and increased cyber threats. We must strive for stricter compliance, enhanced screening, and global regulatory harmonisation. Customs management must address fraud and processing delays, calling for digitalisation, AI-driven risk analysis, and global standards.

Process simplification is essential for improving efficiency, with technology investment and inter-stakeholder collaboration identified as key enablers. The need for a common data infrastructure based on industry standard communication and data protocols architected for next level use in data analytics, AI agents and large language models (LLMs) is crucial.

Infrastructure challenges remain a critical growth factor as demand for investment often exceeds that which is available within supply chain partners. It is expected that private capital investment targeting real estate development will need to be leveraged to ensure new facilities are available to address the growing demand.

Ground handlers are burdened by fragmented standards and rising parcel volumes, requiring training and digital upgrades. Freight forwarders must adjust to smaller shipments and customer-centric models while ensuring compliance and technological integration. Final-mile delivery is a vital link, benefiting from automation, localised hubs, and drone use to meet customer expectations.

Reverse logistics is becoming increasingly critical due to high return rates in e-commerce, necessitating streamlined systems and green logistics. Innovation, particularly through AI and drones, will reshape efficiency, cost-effectiveness and sustainability. Sustainability concerns cut across all operations, prompting calls for carbon reduction, waste minimisation, and green technology adoption.

E-commerce is not just a new cargo segment but a paradigm shift in air logistics, demanding co-ordinated industry-wide innovation, regulatory reform, and sustainability focus. By adopting standardised practices, investing in digital infrastructure, and strengthening global cooperation, the air cargo industry can align with the future demands of e-commerce while ensuring safe, efficient, and environmentally responsible operations.

Airports have a pivotal role to play as the air cargo industry moves ahead with managing increased e-commerce volumes. Airport communities and common systems facilitate the various supply chain partners exchanging data, aligning on practices and preparing for this new era of industry expansion.

Will it mean the end of NATO? Will it lead to war with Denmark? But despite Trumpâ€™s notorious unpredictability, there seems to me vanishingly little likelihood of any kind of military aggression by the United States against Greenland. Why so?

His off-hand remarks cite Greenlandâ€™s strategic and commercial importance to America. And of that there can be no doubt. As the Greenland ice shelf melts â€” at a rate of 270 billion tonnes per year – several strategic sea routes open up. Greenland controls the top end of the Greenlandâ€“Icelandâ€“UK Gap, crucial to NATO submarine surveillance and vital in resupplying Europe.

This article is the opinion of the authorÂ and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.Â

The increasingly ice-free Northwest Passage skirts Greenlandâ€™s shores. Thereâ€™s even talk of a deep-sea port to serve the emerging Northern Sea Route or NorthEast passage, either in Iceland or â€” just possibly â€” in East Greenland.Â Mike Pompeo once called Arctic sea-lanes the â€œ21st-century Suez and Panama Canalsâ€. So Greenlandâ€™s strategic importance to the US is abundantly clear.

Yet there are three powerful reasons why a military invasion of any sort would be foolish and self-defeating.

First, Greenland already hosts a huge American military base, and congress have recently approved a $4 Billion programme of upgrading for it. Indeed America is already the only effectiveÂ military presence in the entire island. The Pituffik Space Base is an essential part of US air defence and missile early warning systems which would detect any nuclear missile launched in Russiaâ€™s Kola Peninsula or nearby (which houses the bulk of Russiaâ€™s nuclear capabilities.) Pituffikâ€™s 10,000 ft runway (about the same size as Gatwick) handles more than 3000 flights a year. And it has the northernmost deepwater port in the world. There are 150 military personnel there. Thatâ€™s down fromÂ 6000 in the Cold War, but could be regrown easily without any kind of â€˜invasionâ€™. So what would be gained by any kind of American military action elsewhere on the island? Not only would it be pointless, but under the 1951 Treaty which allows it, the US presence in Greenland can only continue as long as both Denmark and the United States remain NATO members.Â

Second, there really is nothing in Greenland which invites invasion. 80% of the island is covered by an ice sheet which averages 1 mile in thickness. The weather is extremely cold for 8 months of the year (down to Minus 50 degrees), with spikes of heat in the Summer (recently up to 35 degrees). It is largely dark, or at least very gloomy from September until March, and most of the island is uninhabitable. Aside from the capital, Nuuk (20,000 population), there are no towns or cities of any size. There is only one road- 100 miles in length, so all travel is by air or sea. There is very limited industry of any kind aside from fishing and a little tourism.Â

And third, while America has nothing at all to gain from any invasion, and a great deal to lose, they have a great deal to gain from harmonious financial and industrial relations with Greenland. It is all about natural resources. Trumpâ€™s unashamed lust for Greenlandâ€™s rare earths is but one element of a global race to control the production of the strategic minerals which are essential components of batteries, phones, electric vehicles and all modern computing devices. Itâ€™s about silicon, germanium, phosphorus, boron, indium phosphide, gallium, graphite, uranium, copper, lithium, cobalt and nickel, among others, and he who controls their production holds the key to the digital globe.Â

Taiwan manufactures over 60% of the worldâ€™s semiconductors and more than 90% of its most advanced chips. So if China were ever to carry out its threat to invade Taiwan (which some observers think may be imminent, perhaps encouraged by Trumpâ€™s daring action in Venezuela), it would gain near-total control of the global microchip supply. Do we really want to be dependent on China for every phone, computer and electric vehicle produced in the West?

That means that the US needs to develop chip-making capabilities comparable to Taiwanâ€™s, to achieve which it needs reliable sources for the 50 or so critical minerals required. And Greenlandâ€™s Ilimaussaq Intrusion mine at Kvanefjeld alongside several others, holds concentrated quantities of 30 of them, amounting to 10% of the worldâ€™s total rare earth reserves.Â

Â However the practical reality is that with a population of just 57,000 â€” many of them Inuit fishermen and hunters â€” Greenland currently lacks the industrial infrastructure to extract these minerals and both China and the US would be keen to fill that gap. China in particular has shown intense interest, at one point proposing a $2.5bn investment in a Greenlandic mine (more than the islandâ€™s entire GDP), which would have brought in 5,000 Chinese workers. Then they proposed massive infrastructure investments including a deep-sea port and two international airports. These would require capital which would leave Greenland beholden for all time. Denmark and the US, unsurprisingly, blocked these plans.

The final umbilical cord linking Greenland to Denmark is the annual block grant of 3.9 billion kroner (roughly $560 million), making up about 19% of Greenlandâ€™s GDP. But to put that in perspective, it is less than the amount annually spent by the US on the city of El Paso, Texas. And it is minuscule compared to the mineral wealth Greenland could one day command in partnership with a deep-pocketed ally like America.

So military invasion would be wholly self-defeating and pointless. But massive infrastructure and minerals extraction investment makes a huge amount of geostrategic good sense. In October 2024, the US and Greenland issued a joint statement pledging deeper cooperation on many of these issues. While an outright purchase may be politically impossible, other options exist â€” such as a Compact of Free Association, similar to agreements the US has with other strategically placed Pacific nations. These can deliver economic and security benefits to both parties. Trillions of dollars of Wall street investment in mineral extraction would without doubt follow.

Trumpâ€™s 2025 call to â€œbuyâ€ far less invade Greenland sounds outlandish â€” even offensive â€” as with so much of his rhetoric. But beneath the bombast may lie the bones of a deal: one that could benefit the predominantly Inuit population, while delivering enormous strategic and commercial gains to the United States.Â

It was the Viking, Eric the Red who, in AD 986, first saw Greenlandâ€™s potential. He wanted to colonise his newly discovered island, and in a blatant piece of Tenth-Century spin-doctoring hit on a wizard wheeze to encourage other Norse people to come to this bleak, icy and remote corner of the unknown world.

â€œIn the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favourable name.” (Erik the Redâ€™s Saga)

Greenland must now find a way to harness its vast resource wealth while preserving its fragile culture and ecology. Greenland cannot be sacrificed to short-term capitalism â€” but it can, and must, find a way to benefit from it. If managed with wisdom and care, the coming years could bring not only prosperity to Greenlanders, but a global model of sustainable extraction and indigenous self-determination.Â

America, China and Russia may want Greenland. But perhaps Greenlanders need them just as much?",https://ukdj.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2024/09/NorthropGrummanDemonstratesMQ-4CTritonNavigationSystemsOvertheArcticOcean_363ee8d0-c14c-46c9-a537-926c4042c1ae-prv.remini-enhanced.jpg,N,,2026-01-19 03:57:45.368621

Calumet’s recent refinancing news comes on the back of a 90 day share price return of 8.25% and a 1 year total shareholder return of 10.49%, suggesting momentum has been building even as the latest 1 day share price move was slightly negative.

If this kind of debt refinancing story has your attention, it could be a good moment to widen your lens and check out .

With the refinancing in motion, a 5.5% gap to the average analyst price target, and recent returns in positive territory, the key question is whether Calumet’s current price still leaves upside on the table or whether the market is already factoring in future growth.

Most Popular Narrative: 5.2% Undervalued

With Calumet last closing at US$20.33 against a narrative fair value of US$21.45, the current setup frames a modest discount that hinges on how its future earnings story plays out.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs. This is expected to capture premiums of $1-$2 per gallon over renewable diesel and tap into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally, which may support a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Curious how an unprofitable business today supports that fair value? The narrative leans on higher margins, steady top line growth and a rich future earnings multiple. Want the full story?

The most followed narrative is built on a discount rate of 8.21%, paired with steady revenue growth assumptions and a move from current losses to positive earnings over the next few years. It also factors in modest share count dilution and assigns a future P/E multiple that is materially higher than typical oil and gas benchmarks to bridge to the US$21.45 fair value estimate.

Result: Fair Value of US$21.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, this upbeat story can unravel if regulatory support for renewable fuels weakens or if high debt levels limit Calumet’s flexibility to handle bumps in cash flow.

South Korea has published a clear timeline that begins with a one percent sustainable aviation fuel blend in twenty twenty seven and rises as high as ten percent by twenty thirty five. Importantly, each target will be finalised two years before activation, allowing producers and airlines to plan with confidence.

Smart Flexibility

The mandate is tied to domestic SAF availability rather than fixed volumes. That dynamic approach prevents cost spikes while still sending a strong long term market signal. A clever, less obvious insight is that this formula may also stabilise regional feedstock prices because refiners can synchronise purchases with confirmed local demand instead of speculative exports.

Incentives Drive Investment

The package includes:

· Up to twenty five percent corporate tax credit on plant construction.

· Forty percent credit on research and development spending for new feedstock pathways.

· Deferred compliance on twenty percent of the required volume for three years in case of supply disruptions.

These measures lower capital risk and give innovators room to perfect advanced routes such as power to liquid synthesis and algae based oils.

Airline Advantages

Carriers that surpass quota earn three point five bonus points when bidding for new international routes. For network planners those points can mean early access to premium slots on trans Pacific hubs, converting environmental leadership into revenue.

Domestic Benefits

By mandating that ninety percent of departing international flights refuel locally, the scheme locks in demand that can sustain multiple commercial scale SAF plants, create thousands of construction jobs, and reduce dependence on imported kerosene. Energy security and export potential therefore grow together.

Conclusion

The Korean roadmap balances ambition with pragmatism. Flexible targets, generous incentives, and strategic route rewards position the nation to become an influential supplier of sustainable jet fuel while supporting airlines and taxpayers alike.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-13.svg,N,,2026-01-19 05:58:17.635689

Miscanthus grass arguably ticks all these boxes.
“So, if you go at scale - 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 hectares - you can do the maths of what the pre-investment volumes are.
Finding a thousand hectares for miscanthus grass should not be hard.
The company is fundraising for 5,000 hectares of miscanthus in France, the first 500 of which will be planted in spring 2026.","Renewable, plant-based alternatives to plastics and fossil fuels are not new, but many are criticised for requiring premium arable farmland that could otherwise grow food for humans or livestock. More demand for fields can mean more deforestation and habitat loss.

Miscanthus grass could be different, according to Willem Roos, the founder and CEO of Sustayn Group.

The perfect biomass crop would happily grow on degraded, uneven or hilly land. It would provide multiple harvests from a single sowing, it would require no additional maintenance outside harvest time, it would be frost and drought resistant, and would require few-if-any pesticides or fertilisers. Naturally, also, it would be non-invasive, keeping itself to itself, even on small plots.

Miscanthus grass arguably ticks all these boxes. So why isn’t it everywhere already? Initial cost is the single biggest answer, which could be where Luxembourg comes in.

“That is exactly what we [at Sustayn] do different from the regular agricultural sector,” said Roos. “All of us have miscanthus farming backgrounds, either that or agronomist backgrounds, project development backgrounds, or private equity and investor backgrounds.”

Up-front investment

Farmers are not only constrained by the traditional rhythm of the seasons - sowing and harvesting every year - they are also constrained by the economics this year-on-year model imposes on them.

Miscanthus is expensive to procure and plant, and it also usually provides no income whatsoever for the first three years. Economically, it is a mix of farming and forestry, but in a way that neither foresters nor farmers can easily adapt to.

Timber growers in Europe would typically be reluctant to (and prohibited from) replacing forest with miscanthus, while farmers cannot afford to switch. “Depending on the land prices, we invest somewhere between €2,500 and €3,500 per hectare just to develop the plantation and the crop,” said Roos. “So, if you go at scale - 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 hectares - you can do the maths of what the pre-investment volumes are. That’s why the common farmer is not jumping on it.”

Based on these figures, 500 hectares at the lowest price would cost €1.25 million, while 10,000 hectares at the highest price would be a whopping €35 million. It would be a big gamble for a farmer to unilaterally dedicate a percentage of their land to miscanthus and then try to find a market for it.

Sustayn, meanwhile, starts with demand and then secures supply. “We take it from an industrial perspective: how much land do we want in order to have a meaningful downstream production. We calculate it backwards,” Roos said.

Miscanthus is a slow investment compared to food crops but fast compared to forestry, which takes 10–15 years to produce yields. It also compares favourably as an energy investment: “Any energy project; a wind project or a solar project or classic energy producing units, you have a three-to-five-year pre-planning and permitting processes, then you have a two-year construction period plus, let’s say, one year to stabilise operations. So yes, in the energy sector, [long-term investment is] very known.”

Diverse applications

Miscanthus biomass has uses that range from simple to complex. It is good as animal bedding, or to enrich soils. It can be used instead of trees to make papers and pulps. Miscanthus burns well - as pellets, briquettes or simply dried - and can be used for heat or electricity.

Its fibres could be the next big thing for fabrics in the world of sustainable fashion. It is a construction material, and it can be turned into plastic alternatives.

Then there is biofuel, arguably most exciting of all.

Sustayn works with three growing partners and is a “relatively young company,” of roughly six years, Roos said, adding that it is based in Luxembourg for “no particular operational reason”.

Sustayn does not grow any miscanthus in the Grand Duchy, but Roos says the country is a favourable legal environment for a holding and project development company. “There is a very intense green economy here in Luxembourg. Luxembourg is, I believe, the second largest, if not the largest green investment hub in Europe. So, to raise funds, Luxembourg is a logical place to be.”

The Grand Duchy could one day host a miscanthus nursery that supplies germinated shoots for the whole continent, and the Greater Region is a possible site for a future plantation for sustainable aviation fuel, he added.

“Food grade packaging might need a feedstock of 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of miscanthus per year. Depending on the region, you produce somewhere around 15 tonnes per hectare per year,” Roos explained. “So, in order to feed such a production unit, you would need a thousand hectares.”

That is the equivalent of a thousand rugby pitches, or 0.39% of Luxembourg, and would cost in the region of €3 million to prepare and plant. “This is way beyond the scope of any ordinary farmer,” said Roos.

So much land and such a high price tag make it a daunting prospect. But it is worth bearing in mind that one single financial outlay can be expected to bring reliable annual returns for around two decades, the entrepreneur explained, and it can be spread over many small plots of underutilised, otherwise unproductive land.

Still, miscanthus plots must be big enough for farm machinery to access for harvesting. They must be accessible by road for transport. And they must be close enough to the processing/production facility to make sense. This can be up to a roughly 150 km diameter circle around the factory, according to Roos.

That theoretical circle of 150km contains over 1.75 million hectares of surface area - similar to the size of Kuwait. Finding a thousand hectares for miscanthus grass should not be hard.

Sustayn buys or leases land for cultivation but hopes that proven success will prompt young farmers in the future to volunteer land for the grass.

Environmental concerns

If there is any chance of a non-native plant breaking its bonds and spreading wildly, it is immediately a non-starter - especially for a biomass crop that touts its green credentials.

Miscanthus exists in Europe only as a cultivated species, and the “hybrids employed for agricultural purposes, specifically Miscanthus Giganteus, are sterile and thus incapable of seed production, eliminating the risk of dissemination via seeds,” a botanist at the Luxembourg National Museum of Natural History told the Luxembourg Times by email. “However, there remains a possibility of their spread through rhizomes during soil cultivation.”

Because it is harvested in spring, miscanthus fields offer a useful winter refuge to small wildlife, the botanist said. On the other hand, as a crop which lives for years, “these cultures leave little opportunity for the growth of typical annual field weeds - many of which have grown increasingly rare and now face threats to their survival.”

This mix of pros and cons would seem to vindicate Roos’ vision for the incorporation of miscanthus as part of the existing farm landscape.

The dream scenario

Farmers want reliable income, and diversification helps them achieve this. Even in Europe, where the average farm is small, many could feasibly spare 10-20% of their territory for miscanthus, according to Roos. Doing so, he says, the continent would boost its economic and environmental sustainability.

“[It is a] nice steady-state income with no, or relatively low inputs, relatively low effort. 20–25 years is the technical life of the crop. The first three years are the most work intensive. You prepare the land, then you have a first season where you actually plant it, and then you watch over the crop for the first two seasons and after those two seasons you then harvest in springtime. After the first initialisation period of two or three years, it’s basically just harvesting once a year,” Roos said.

Miscanthus grass is hardy and versatile (its thicker stems cope better with extreme weather than maize, for example) but its long lifespan means potential losses from crop failure are greater than for annual crops. It matters, therefore, where one plants it.

“You don’t want to [have to] artificially irrigate. And you want to have sufficient sunshine, as it is a photosynthesis process, the growing of crops,” Roos said. “You want to have a lot of sunshine, long seasons and sufficient rain.” With such a long life, it is increasingly important to keep climate change in mind.

Sustayn’s oldest miscanthus plantations (2,000 hectares) are in the UK, even though the most favourable regions today are in northern Italy and southern France. “Personally, I’m of the opinion that will move up 200 to 300km over the next 20 years,” Roos said. In the long term, Germany, Luxembourg - even southern Scandinavia and the Baltics - could become ideal.

The company is fundraising for 5,000 hectares of miscanthus in France, the first 500 of which will be planted in spring 2026. Planting in small stages is good, Roos says, because harvesting will start gradually and production will rise steadily - allowing the company time to secure the market. “Yes, it’s nice to receive [sustainability] grants and subsidies, but on the other hand, you’re looking for sustainable, long-term, economically viable businesses,” Roos said. Sustayn aims to offer investors double-digit returns without the addition of any additional grant, subsidy or carbon credit income.

“If they come, if they are available, great, we will go for it, But we thought it would not be a good basis to say ‘our business case depends on the future five, ten, 15 years of subsidies. So, ours is a self-sustaining proposition,” Roos said.",https://img.luxtimes.lu/public/luxembourg/nazoyg-miscanthus-ii.jpeg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/miscanthus%20ii.jpeg,N,,2026-01-19 03:58:27.244493

The combined guaranteed loan amount of up to $15 million will be used to provide engineering services and electrical equipment, e.g. batteries, for Eve’s electric Vehicle Take-Off and Landing program (eVTOL) during its developmental period.

What Is In The Agreement?

Eve Air Mobility’s agreement with EXIM Bank and PEFCO is for funding for the suppliers that are developing their eVTOL aircraft. Eve is working closely with British company BAE Systems and Brazilian company Embraer as part of a joint aerospace operation. BAE Systems is supplying the main energy power sources (batteries), and Embraer is contributing its propulsion technology. DUC Hélices Propellers will provide the rotor and propeller blades used in the construction of the eVTOL aircraft prototypes. Eduardo Couto, Eve’s chief financial officer, spoke highly about the agreement and the overall project in a statement:

“This agreement underscores EXIM Bank’s confidence in Eve’s business model and the strong future of urban air mobility. It will empower Eve’s U.S. supply chain by providing critical financial flexibility, accelerating the adoption of sustainable air travel globally.”

Couto also said: “We are incredibly proud to partner with EXIM Bank to offer this innovative financing solution…”

What is eVTOL?

Eve’s eVTOL aircraft is designed to use multi-rotor and thrust vectoring technology to enable an electrically powered and vertically piloted aircraft capable of completing regular short-haul transport cycles per year, more than a thousand, according to Eve’s technical specifications. The eVTOL specifications also mention carrying four passengers and one pilot. The aircraft (similar in size to the standard consumer industrial drone) is also planned to be both virtually silent and environmentally friendly, designed to eliminate 90% of noise pollution and up to 47% of CO2 emissions compared to petrol vehicles.

Eve plans to make the aircraft accessible to consumers by taking their first big step to secure their place in the larger Urban Air Mobility (UAM) ecosystem by providing safe transport to passengers and cargo with frequent testing of their prototype eVTOL aircraft. The first consumer deliveries for the eVTOL aircraft are expected around the start of 2028.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Eve_eVTOLConfiguration_Release-1024x576.png,N,,2026-01-19 00:56:19.244759

Pasay City, Philippines / January 18, 2026 — As it marks 85 years of flight, Philippine Airlines (PAL) signaled a global turn with the unveiling of its first Airbus A350-1000, becoming the first airline in Southeast Asia to operate the long-range widebody.

In a landmark ceremony held at Lufthansa Technik Philippines, Macroasia Economic Zone, Villamor Airbase, PAL Holdings, Inc. President Lucio C. Tan III welcomed President Ferdinand ‘Bongbong’ Marcos, Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, together with top government officials and dignitaries, to witness this momentous event.

PAL Holdings President Lucio C. Tan III reaffirmed the airline’s commitment to supporting the country’s tourism growth and strengthening its competitiveness on the global stage: “The A350-1000 aircraft stands as a powerful symbol of our resurgence. It represents our confidence to compete globally, while remaining deeply rooted in who we are as Filipinos. In many ways, the arrival of the Airbus A350-1000 mirrors the Philippines today: resilient, forward-looking, and prepared to engage the world with confidence.”

“As Philippine Airlines continues its transformation, we remain mindful that our journey is inseparable from that of our country,” he said. “Our role as the flag carrier is not simply commercial. It is a responsibility that we take very seriously. We exist to connect people, support livelihoods, and contribute meaningfully to the country’s development, consistent with the ideals of Bagong Pilipinas.”

The new flagship features the airline’s iconic “Sunrise” livery accented with a commemorative “85 Years” decal, reflecting both its legacy and its forward-looking ambitions. Five A350-1000 aircraft are scheduled to join the fleet in 2026, with the remaining three arriving in 2027.

President Marcos led guests in touring the state-of-the-art aircraft, which is set to elevate PAL’s long-haul transpacific services to the US Mainland and Canada. Configured in a spacious tri-class layout, the A350-1000 accommodates 382 passengers, with 42 seats in Business Class, 24 in Premium Economy, and 316 in Economy.

The cabin experience, developed in partnership with aircraft cabin design studio Lift Aero Design, places a strong emphasis on comfort, privacy, and functionality. The “Mabuhay Studios” Business Class features 42 full-flat suites with sliding doors for enhanced privacy, arranged in a 1-2-1 layout to ensure every passenger has direct aisle access. Each suite is equipped with a 20-inch 4K personal entertainment screen. Complimentary full flight messaging, browsing, and streaming are available via inflight Wi-Fi. Additional amenities include in-seat power outlets, USB-A and USB-C charging ports, and wireless charging docks.

Premium Economy features spacious recliner seats designed for enhanced comfort, each equipped with its own legrest and footrest. Passengers enjoy the convenience of private mini-cocktail tables, multiple stowage options, in-seat power outlets, as well as both USB-A and USB-C charging ports to keep devices powered. The 13.3-inch 4K personal entertainment screens offer a superior in-flight viewing experience. Additionally, complimentary full-flight messaging and browsing via inflight Wi-Fi ensure passengers stay connected from takeoff to landing.

Economy Class raises comfort standards with a 32-inch seat pitch, generous recline, adjustable four-way headrests, built-in personal mobile device holders, and both USB-A and USB-C charging ports. These thoughtful ergonomic features help make long-haul travel more restful and enjoyable.

Beyond the cabin, the A350-1000 sets a new benchmark in sustainable aviation, delivering up to a 25 percent reduction in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft and offering compatibility with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Enhanced cargo capacity further strengthens PAL’s logistics and freight operations.

Recognized as Asia Pacific’s Most On-Time Airline for 2025, PAL continues to demonstrate operational excellence. The milestone event was also marked by the launch of a new jingle—performed by Ogie Alcasid, Gary Valenciano, and Martin Nievera—capturing the spirit of 85 years of shaping Philippine aviation.

With the addition of the A350-1000, PAL’s fleet now stands at 82 aircraft. The acquisition underscores the airline’s ongoing focus on fleet modernization and network expansion, as it positions itself for greater efficiency, connectivity, and competitiveness in the global aviation landscape.

American Airlines, following in the footsteps of Delta, Lufthansa, JAL, Ryanair, Emirates, and several other major airlines worldwide, has been hit with a surcharge bombshell that’s shaking up air travel. These extra charges are affecting flights across the globe, with every major carrier imposing new fees that are raising flight costs to unprecedented levels.

Whether you’re flying with American Airlines, Delta, or Lufthansa, it’s clear that the days of affordable flying are over. These extra charges aren’t just limited to fuel surcharges anymore. Ryanair, JAL, and Emirates are also slapping passengers with environmental levies, new taxes, and higher fees for everything from luggage to seat selection.

The ripple effect is undeniable – travelers are now feeling the pressure as each airline scrambles to offset rising operational costs. But what does this mean for the future of air travel? American Airlines, Delta, and their counterparts around the world are setting the tone, but the bigger question remains: Can the global aviation sector recover from this surcharge explosion? Travel And Tour World urges you to keep reading to uncover the shocking truth behind these skyrocketing prices.

Air travelers around the globe are feeling the pinch as airfares soar to new heights. While airlines blame rising fuel prices, labor costs, and new environmental rules, governments aren’t sitting idle. With higher taxes, surcharges, and levies, passengers are now facing more expensive flights than ever before. Buckle up as we take you through how airlines like Delta, American Airlines, Emirates, and many more are adding extra charges, making it nearly impossible to escape the rising cost of air travel.

American Airlines Raises the Bar: Higher Surcharges from South Korea

American Airlines isn’t far behind. In January 2026, the carrier increased its fuel surcharge on flights departing South Korea. The surcharge for tickets flying to the United States, Canada, and Latin America rose from ₩72,300 to ₩84,700 – a 17% increase! This change demonstrates how airlines are quick to pass on fuel price hikes to passengers. The best part? American Airlines warns that these surcharges are based on the ticket issue date – if you buy early, you might be stuck with higher charges later. Explore American Airlines’ Latest Surcharge Adjustments

Delta’s Fuel Surcharge Bombshell: Extra Charges on Flights from Japan

Delta Air Lines is leading the charge in raising airfares through fuel surcharges on flights departing from Japan. For a one-way flight to North America, Central, or South America, the surcharge is a hefty 25,000 JPY. A trip to Hawaii? That’ll cost you an additional 16,000 JPY. Delta reviews this surcharge every two months based on the average price of Singapore kerosene, meaning it’s directly tied to volatile fuel prices. Even infants traveling in seats aren’t exempt from this fee! As fuel costs rise, Delta’s passengers are seeing their flight prices skyrocket. Learn more about Delta’s Fuel Surcharge in Japan

Emirates Slaps Japan Passengers with Enormous Surcharges

Emirates has followed suit, imposing significant fuel surcharges on flights from Japan. A trip from Japan to Dubai now incurs a surcharge of ¥28,000 each way, and for journeys beyond Dubai, it jumps to ¥39,500. The surcharge applies to both economy and premium-class passengers, showing how no traveler is exempt from the cost increases. Emirates, like many other airlines, justifies this surcharge by tying it to the price of Singapore kerosene. As fuel costs remain volatile, so too does the additional cost for passengers.

Japan Airlines Forces Passengers to Pay Up: Surcharges for North America and Europe Routes

Japan Airlines (JAL) has also introduced steep fuel surcharges for international travel. For flights between Japan and North America, Europe, the Middle East, or Oceania, passengers must pay an additional USD 164 per segment. The surcharge varies by region, with cheaper rates for routes to Thailand and the Philippines. JAL reviews these surcharges every two months, and with fuel prices being unpredictable, passengers can expect to see these fees rise frequently. It’s clear that fuel surcharges are now a regular part of flying internationally with JAL. Learn more about JAL’s Surcharge Updates

Lufthansa’s Green Surcharge: Passengers Pay for Sustainable Fuel Mandates

Lufthansa Group is one of the first airlines to introduce an “Environmental Cost Surcharge.” This surcharge is in response to European Union sustainable aviation fuel mandates and carbon emissions trading systems. Beginning in 2025, passengers will pay between €1 and €72 depending on the route and class. These charges reflect the cost of complying with the EU’s green mandates. The surcharge is visible in the ticket price breakdowns, and while it’s aimed at funding environmental initiatives, passengers still end up paying more to fly with Lufthansa. Read about Lufthansa’s Green Surcharge and How It Affects Fares

Singapore’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Levy: Who Will Pay?

Starting in 2026, Singapore will implement a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy for all passengers departing from the country. The levy will vary based on distance and class, ranging from S$1 for short-haul flights to Southeast Asia to a hefty S$10.40 for long-haul flights to the Americas. Premium passengers will face charges up to four times higher. This government-imposed surcharge aims to fund sustainable fuel initiatives, but it’s another levy that will raise the price of flying from Singapore. The SAF levy applies to all flights from Singapore starting in 2026. Learn More About Singapore’s SAF Levy

The UK’s Air Passenger Duty: Why It’s Getting More Expensive to Fly

Air travelers in the UK are also feeling the pain of rising taxes. The Air Passenger Duty (APD) tax on flights leaving the UK will rise again in April 2026. Short-haul flights will see a modest increase from £28 to £32, but long-haul flights will face much higher taxes. Band B flights will see their APD rate jump from £216 to £244, and long-haul flights to the Americas will face an increase from £224 to £253. This tax hike is part of a broader trend of increasing government levies on air travel, further contributing to the soaring costs.

Canada’s Higher Security Charges: Adding to the Pain

Canada has also raised its Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC), which passengers must pay for both domestic and international flights. The charge for domestic flights is now between $9.46 and $18.92 per segment, with transborder flights reaching up to $32.16. The ATSC for international flights has also risen, with some tickets now costing passengers an additional $34.42. This 33% increase in the ATSC adds another layer to the rising costs of flying in and out of Canada.

Ryanair and Qantas: Fare Hikes Even for Budget Travelers

Low-cost carrier Ryanair had a brief stint of fare cuts in FY2025, helping it carry 200 million passengers. However, by mid-2026, the airline reversed this trend, raising average fares by 13%. The increase was attributed to strong Easter demand and “fare recovery” from last year’s cuts. Similarly, Qantas saw its domestic unit revenue increase by 5% in FY25, partly due to higher seat factors and business travel demand. Both airlines, once known for their cheap fares, have been forced to raise prices as operational costs increase. Learn More About Ryanair’s Fare Adjustments

Turkish Airlines’ New Infant Fee: A Hidden Cost You Didn’t See Coming

Turkish Airlines has introduced new fees for infants traveling on a parent’s lap. Starting in January 2026, parents will need to pay 610 Turkish Lira on direct domestic flights and 915 Lira on connecting flights for their infants. This charge, which used to be nominal or free, now adds up to a significant cost for families. It’s clear that Turkish Airlines is monetizing every aspect of the flight experience, further driving up costs for passengers Read More About Turkish Airlines’ Infant Charges

Air India’s Sneaky Credit-Card Surcharge: An Extra 2.5% for Non-Preferred Cards

Air India has quietly introduced a 2.5% surcharge for tickets booked with credit cards not issued by preferred banks or registered with the airline. From May 2024, travelers using non-preferred cards will face this hidden fee, which increases ticket prices without much warning. This sneaky charge is part of a growing trend where airlines add fees for payment methods to boost revenue. Find Out More About Air India’s Credit Card Surcharge

Who’s to Blame for the Soaring Fares?

The truth is that both airlines and governments are responsible for making flying unaffordable. Airlines have raised fuel surcharges, added environmental levies, and even imposed new charges for infants and credit cards. Meanwhile, governments have introduced higher taxes and levies that make flights more expensive. The result? Air travel is becoming increasingly unaffordable for many. Passengers must be vigilant, checking ticket breakdowns carefully to understand the various surcharges and taxes added to their flights.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/airlines-6.jpeg,N,,2026-01-18 15:56:31.401237

Shell plc today is less a traditional oil company and more an enormous, evolving energy platform. It operates upstream oil and gas fields, LNG megaprojects, integrated refining and petrochemicals, fast?growing power and renewables businesses, and a sprawling global retail network stretching from petrol forecourts to fast?charging hubs for electric vehicles. Shell plc is not a single product in the narrow sense; it is the flagship portfolio of one of the world’s largest energy producers at a moment when the very idea of energy is being rewritten.

The core problem Shell plc is trying to solve is existential: how do you deliver reliable, affordable energy to a world still hungry for oil and gas, while decarbonising fast enough to remain investable, credible, and ultimately relevant? That tension runs through everything Shell does right nowfrom the oil platforms and LNG trains that still mint cash, to offshore wind farms, hydrogen hubs, and EV charging networks that are supposed to secure its future.

Investors, regulators, and customers are all watching the same story play out: can Shell plc turn a century of fossil?fuel dominance into an advantage in the low?carbon race, or will the weight of its legacy drag it down while more agile players sprint ahead?

Get all details on Shell plc here

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

Shell plc is built around scale and integration. Its power lies in linking resources, infrastructure, and customers into a single system that can shift with global demand and regulation. To understand Shell plc as a product, you have to think in platforms, not projects.

Operationally, Shell is split into three major engines that define its offering:

1. Upstream and Integrated Gas: The Cash Machine

Shell remains one of the worlds dominant producers of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Its Integrated Gas division runs a portfolio of LNG assets that span Qatar, Australia, the United States, and beyond. This side of Shell plc underpins energy security for Europe and Asia, particularly as they try to reduce dependence on Russian pipeline gas while still needing flexible, dispatchable power.

The companys upstream oil and gas fields continue to generate the bulk of free cash flow. That cash is the financial backbone of the broader Shell plc strategy: funding shareholder returns, while underwriting more selective investments in low?carbon technologies and infrastructure.

2. Downstream, Chemicals & Products: From Refineries to Molecule Platforms

Shells refineries are rapidly morphing from classic fuel factories into more flexible molecule platforms. The company has closed or converted several older sites, focusing on a smaller number of ""Energy and Chemicals Parks"" that can handle bio-feedstocks, produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and support advanced plastics recycling.

Shell plcs downstream engine is increasingly about blending legacy and future: distill petroleum today; integrate biofuels tomorrow; build chemical value chains that can survive in a carbon?constrained world. The aim is to maintain Shells presence in transport and materials even as the fuels and feedstocks themselves change.

3. Renewables & Energy Solutions: The Future Bet

Shells most visible transformation sits in its Renewables and Energy Solutions segment. Here the company is building an ecosystem that spans:

Offshore and Onshore Wind: Stakes in large offshore wind zones in the North Sea and off the US East Coast, plus onshore projects in markets where policy and grid access are attractive.

Solar and Power Marketing: Utility?scale solar farms and power trading capabilities that let Shell arbitrage weather, demand, and market prices across regions.

EV Charging: Shell Recharge, a global EV charging brand, spanning thousands of charge points at service stations, supermarkets, and dedicated hubs in Europe, Asia, and North America. The pitch is simple: wherever drivers refuel today, they should be able to recharge tomorrow.

Hydrogen: Early?stage hydrogen projects serving heavy transport, industrial clients, and pilot networks of hydrogen refuelling stations.

Carbon Management: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) investments and nature?based solutions, packaged into carbon credits for corporate customers trying to hit net?zero targets.

Together, these business lines form the core of Shell plcs repositioning: it does not just produce energy; it increasingly designs, balances, and optimises energy systems. That systemic approachleveraging data, trading, infrastructure, and customer relationshipsis the unique selling proposition that few pure?play renewables developers can match.

Data, Trading and Digital: Shells Hidden Superpower

Behind the visible assets, Shell plc runs one of the worlds largest energy trading operations. This trading arm dynamically allocates molecules and electrons, balancing supply, demand, and price signals in near real time. In a grid dominated by intermittent renewables, this capability is no longer a back?office utility; it is a front?line competitive weapon.

Shell increasingly wraps this trading and optimisation expertise into digital offerings for industrial and commercial customers. Think smart power contracts, flexible LNG delivery, and hedging products tied to emissions constraints. In practice, Shell plc is selling not just energy, but resilience and optionality in a volatile market.

The Strategic Reset: Fewer Moonshots, More Disciplined Growth

The company has recalibrated its energy transition strategy in the last couple of years. Management has moved away from spreading capital thinly across every possible green technology, toward a more focused posture: double down where Shell has structural advantage (LNG, integrated power, EV charging, select biofuels and chemicals), and be far more selective with capital?intensive bets like hydrogen and large?scale offshore wind.

This has drawn criticism from some climate advocates who argue that Shell plc is slowing its decarbonisation. But from a product?strategy perspective, it is a bet that scale and integration will matter more than early?stage experimentation. Shells thesis is that customers will pay for reliable, end?to?end energy solutions, not just clean electrons in isolation.

Market Rivals: Royal Dutch Shell A (alt) -> Shell plc vs. The Competition

Shell plc does not operate in a vacuum. It is locked in a high?stakes race with other oil and gas supermajors that are trying to pull off the same trick: maintain hydrocarbon cash flow while pivoting to low?carbon and electrified energy. The most direct rivals are BP plc and TotalEnergies SE, with Saudi Aramco and ExxonMobil also shaping global dynamics, even if their transition strategies differ.

Shell plc vs. BP: Competing Visions of an Integrated Energy Company

Compared directly to BPs integrated energy offering, Shell plc looks slightly more conservative on near?term decarbonisation targets, but more diversified in gas and trading.

Hydrocarbons: BP has pledged steeper absolute reductions in oil and gas production by 2030, while Shell is focused more on emissions intensity and profitability rather than outright volume cuts. That leaves Shell with a stronger medium?term cash profile, but greater exposure to long?term transition risk.

Renewables: BP has aggressively chased early renewable capacity, especially offshore wind and large solar pipelines. Shell has been more selective, focusing on projects where it can bolt on trading, supply, and customer networks.

EV Charging: Both push into charging, but Shell Recharge is more tightly integrated with a massive global retail network, from motorway service stations to urban hubs. For drivers, Shells proposition is anchored in convenience and familiarity.

Power Trading: Shells trading operation is broadly considered deeper and more diversified than BPs, particularly in LNG and short?term power markets.

In short, BP is betting harder on rapid portfolio rebalancing; Shell plc is betting on full?system optimisation and cash discipline.

Shell plc vs. TotalEnergies: Two Versions of the Same Future

Compared directly to TotalEnergies integrated energy platform, Shell plc is competing head?to?head on LNG, renewables, and EV charging, with subtle differences in emphasis.

LNG Leadership: Both Shell and TotalEnergies rank among the worlds top LNG players. Shells greater historical scale in LNG gives it a slight edge in portfolio optionality, while TotalEnergies has built a reputation for striking bold, early deals in emerging markets.

Renewable Capacity: TotalEnergies has moved quickly to lock in large solar and wind pipelines, especially in the Middle East, India, and the US. Shell plc, by contrast, has been more opportunistic, preferring projects where it can cross?sell power and services to industrial and retail customers.

Brand and Retail: Shells retail network is one of the largest in the world, offering an easier pathway to mass?market EV charging and convenience offerings. TotalEnergies is expanding, but Shell started from a larger base.

Both companies are converging on a similar vision: a portfolio balanced between hydrocarbons, power, and low?carbon molecules. Shells differentiator is its heavier emphasis on LNG and its global brand presence in mobility.

Shell vs. the Pure Plays: Orsted, Iberdrola, and Nextera

Compared directly to pure renewable developers like Orsteds offshore wind platform or Iberdrolas integrated renewables and networks business, Shell plc is less nimble but far more diversified. Where Orsted can specialise in offshore wind, Shell must juggle a thousand moving partsfrom deepwater oil to digital power contracts.

Yet this is also where Shells USP kicks in. Pure plays live and die by power prices, policy design, and project execution. Shell can lean on hydrocarbons and trading to buffer volatility, keeping its balance sheet strong enough to ride out policy cycles and technology shifts.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

In a market where everyone is promising energy transition, the question is what makes Shell plc different. Its core advantages sit in four areas: scale, integration, optionality, and customer reach.

1. Scale Meets System Thinking

Shell plc runs one of the broadest energy portfolios on the planet. That scale alone is not uniqueExxonMobil and Saudi Aramco are just as largebut Shells willingness to reconfigure that scale around new value chains is distinctive. It is not simply bolting solar onto a fossil base; it is trying to design integrated systems that run from molecule to megawatt to mobility.

This system thinking shows up in how Shell designs projects: pairing offshore wind with green hydrogen hubs, linking LNG portfolios to downstream power markets, or embedding EV charging into large mobility platforms.

2. LNG and Gas as Transitional Backbone

Where some competitors have leaned harder into absolute oil exit narratives, Shell plc has framed natural gas and LNG as the backbone of its transition strategy. The argument: as coal is phased out, flexible gas generationbacked by LNGwill remain indispensable for grid stability. That plays directly to Shells strength as the worlds leading LNG trader and one of its top producers.

In practice, this gives Shell a more bankable cash flow profile over the next one to two decades than many renewables pure plays, which are highly sensitive to interest rates, policy shifts, and supply chain constraints.

3. Global Retail and EV Charging Footprint

Shells retail network is a structural edge that is hard to overstate. Millions of drivers already visit Shell forecourts daily. As internal combustion engines give way to EVs, Shell can repurpose this physical and emotional real estate into Shell Recharge hubs, layer in convenience retail, and add services like subscription charging, loyalty schemes, and bundled home energy offers.

Compared to BP and TotalEnergies, Shell starts with more sites and a more globally recognisable fuel and mobility brand. Compared to pure charging networks, it brings superior capital, site control, and cross?selling opportunities.

4. Trading, Data, and Risk Management

Shells trading division is a quiet powerhouse. In a world of volatile prices, intermittent renewables, and weather?driven demand, the ability to dynamically optimise portfolios will separate winners from also?rans. Shell plc is positioned to sell customers not just green power, but stable, predictable outcomes: fixed?price contracts, firm supply backed by LNG and storage, and complex hedging products that smaller players cannot replicate.

5. Disciplined Capital Allocation

After a period of transition exuberance, Shells management has tightened its capital discipline. The company is pruning lower?return green projects, exiting some early?stage or subsidy?dependent ventures, and concentrating firepower where it can combine structural asset advantage with customer access and trading expertise.

The result is a version of Shell plc that looks less like a climate charity and more like a hard?nosed, returns?driven energy platform with a decarbonisation strategy. For investors, that clarity matters.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Shell plc is not just an energy platform; it is also a stock, trading under ISIN NL0000009827, that reflects how convincingly the company is navigating the transition. To understand the financial lens on Shell plc, we need to look at current market data and how investors are reading the strategy.

Current Stock Snapshot

Using live market data from multiple sources, Shell plcs London-listed shares were recently trading around the mid-20s in pounds sterling per share. Data pulled from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch on a recent trading day showed the stock at approximately GBP 260 to GBP 260 intraday, with only minor variance between sources. Both sites reported a similar 52-week range and market capitalisation in the ballpark of the high tens of billions of pounds. All price data referenced here is as of the most recent available trading session and should be checked against live feeds for intra-day moves.

When markets are closed, what matters is the last closing price. On the most recent completed session, both referenced sources showed Shell plc closing within pennies of each other, underlining data consistency.

How the Product Strategy Feeds the Valuation

For equity markets, Shell plcs sprawling product set translates into three main valuation drivers:

Hydrocarbon Cash Flow: Higher oil and gas prices, plus strong LNG margins, directly lift free cash flow, funding dividends and buybacks. This remains the primary share price driver in the near term.

Transition Credibility: Investors are increasingly screening for climate risk and stranded asset exposure. Shells renewables and energy solutions portfolio is less about current earnings and more about derisking the long?term story.

Capital Discipline: The shift toward higher-return, focused low?carbon projects is being closely watched. Markets have rewarded Shell when it has emphasised shareholder returns and disciplined capex, and punished it when transition spending looked unfocused.

The balance between these forces explains Shells valuation discount relative to pure-play renewables (which trade on growth) and its often modest premium to some oil peers (which trade on yield and resilience). Investors are essentially pricing in a hybrid: a high?yielding oil and gas major with a credible, but still maturing, energy transition engine.

Is Shell plc a Growth Driver for the Stock?

From a product perspective, the elements of Shell plc that have the clearest potential to structurally re?rate the stock over time are:

LNG and Integrated Gas: As global LNG demand grows, particularly in Asia and Europe, Shells leading position in LNG supply and trading could justify a higher multiple than traditional upstream oil.

Renewables and Power: If Shell can demonstrate that its integrated power and renewables portfolio can achieve mid?teens or better returns on capital at scale, markets could start to value this business more like a utilities/renewables hybrid than a legacy oil segment.

Mobility and EV Charging: Shell Recharge and the broader mobility platform are still in investment mode, but success here would anchor Shell in the future of transport. A profitable, scaled EV charging and convenience ecosystem would support a more durable earnings base as liquid fuel demand eventually plateaus.

In practice, Shell plcs stock remains tightly linked to macro energy prices and geopolitics. But the more the company can show that its integrated energy platform can grow earnings and cash flow independently of crude benchmarks, the more investors will treat the shares as a genuine transition play, not just a cyclical oil bet with a green halo.

The Bottom Line

Shell plc is a product of contradictions: it is at once a dominant fossil fuel producer and an ambitious player in renewables, power, and low?carbon molecules. Its edge does not lie in having the single biggest wind farm or the flashiest hydrogen pilot. It lies in its ability to orchestrate an entire energy ecosystemfrom wellhead and LNG terminal to grid connection, EV charger, and corporate contract.

That orchestration is what could keep Shell at the centre of the global energy system as it is rewired for net zero. The question is not whether Shell plc can build green assets; it is whether it can turn its historical weight into a flexible, profitable platform for the next energy era. On that front, the company is not yet finished, but it is significantly ahead of many rivalsand markets are already starting to price in that advantage.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405025_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 15:56:35.682300

This article dives into the distinct features of YVR that have contributed to its recognition, with a focus on technological advancements, sustainability efforts, and passenger services.

A Seamless and Elevated Passenger Experience

Vancouver International Airport’s commitment to offering a seamless passenger experience has been a key factor in its impressive ranking. The airport boasts spacious, modern terminals designed to reflect the natural beauty of Vancouver, with an emphasis on openness and accessibility. Natural light floods the terminals, creating an inviting atmosphere for travelers, while a variety of high-end amenities, including premium lounges, diverse dining options, and duty-free shopping, ensure passengers feel at ease.

Passenger satisfaction is at the heart of YVR’s operational strategy. The airport continually innovates with systems that enhance convenience, including fast-track security lines, clear signage, and accessible services for people with reduced mobility. YVR’s focus on improving every aspect of the passenger journey—from check-in to departure—has earned it recognition for providing world-class service and a comfortable environment.

Embracing Cutting-Edge Technology and Artificial Intelligence

One of the standout features that has propelled YVR’s success is its integration of cutting-edge technology. Vancouver International has embraced artificial intelligence (AI) to streamline airport processes, reduce wait times, and improve operational efficiency. AI-powered tools are used for facial recognition at check-in counters and boarding gates, allowing passengers to breeze through security without the need for physical documents. This technology ensures faster processing while maintaining the highest security standards.

In addition to AI-based innovations, YVR has deployed an array of automation systems to improve the flow of passengers and luggage. Baggage handling has been fully automated, minimizing human error and speeding up the process. YVR also integrates machine learning algorithms to predict traffic patterns and optimize airport operations, including baggage handling and flight scheduling.

State-of-the-Art Security Measures

Security at YVR is both robust and efficient, utilizing advanced technologies to ensure the safety of all passengers while minimizing inconvenience. Biometric screening, powered by AI, plays a major role in speeding up security checks, allowing for quicker processing of travelers and reducing congestion. YVR also employs sophisticated surveillance and real-time monitoring systems, ensuring a high level of vigilance across the airport.

Security measures are continually updated to adapt to emerging threats while ensuring a smooth travel experience. These efforts help make YVR one of the most secure airports globally, while also enhancing the overall efficiency of airport operations.

Leading the Way in Sustainability

Vancouver International Airport is committed to minimizing its environmental footprint through various green initiatives. As part of its strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, YVR has implemented an array of sustainable practices aimed at reducing waste, lowering energy consumption, and using renewable resources. These initiatives are part of a broader effort to set a new standard for sustainable aviation.

YVR is recognized for its commitment to green building practices, with much of the airport’s infrastructure built to meet high environmental standards.

The agreement will assist British Airways in achieving its target of running 10 percent of flights on SAF by 2030, as per the UK government's SAF policy.

It is made by Hong Kong company EcoCeres and has the potential to cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80 percent on average versus traditional fossil-derived jet fuel. Carbon reductions from the deal are forecast at the equivalent of the carbon footprint of a combined total of about 240,000 return economy-class flights between New York and London.

British Airways is part of a network of expanding airlines to try out greener fuel in a bid to reduce the environmentally harmful nature of flying. British Airways' Sustainable Aviation Fuel, for example, covered 2.7 percent of the airline's fuel consumption in 2024 and reduced carbon intensity by 13 percent compared to the 2019 baseline. One advantage of SAF is that its chemistry is the same as conventional fossil jet fuel, and therefore it will be feasible to blend it with current airplane engines and airport refuelling infrastructure without it requiring to be changed.

Although SAF continues to emit carbon dioxide when it burns, its net impact on greenhouse gases is much lower since the carbon is derived from renewable, biological origins and hence stays in the natural carbon cycle. SAF is thereby therefore a key near-to-medium-term solution to aviation de-carbonization, at least until industry is technology mature with hydrogen propulsion and electric flight.

EcoCeres, sponsored by private equity backers Kerogen Capital and Bain Capital, produces low-carbon fuels on commercial scale. A spin-off of Hong Kong towngas utility company and ISCC-certified, its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), and renewable naphtha are all produced on the back of waste and residue feedstocks.

British Airways partnership is embraced as a milestone for EcoCeres in securing further worldwide access to the SAF market. The deal is proof of increasing commercial aviation demand for low-carbon alternative fuel and further endorsement of waste-based biofuels' contribution to worldwide climate ambitions.

While in view is the environmental return, scale availability worldwide is not yet imminent. Global SAF use continues to be below 3 percent of all aviation fuel used worldwide. Industry experts foresee a transition at scale worldwide will depend on increasing production levels, building supply infrastructure, and consistent government incentivization by way of regulation.

The production of SAF is currently limited by feedstock availability, low yields, and the low number of commercial facilities. Indeed, developments like the research work by British Airways and EcoCeres are in the direction of establishing a system for sustainable markets along the way to fulfilling requirements someday across the globe.

Although neither of the carriers reports the size or terms of the deal, the strategic rationale is clear: both of them wish to minimize plane emissions in the race towards world net-zero ambitions. British Airways' overarching business strategy for sustainability is to be 2050 net-zero carbon, and SAF forms the cornerstone for such a strategy.

Sale of alternative fuel to aviation is a sign that the airline sector desires to break free from its carbon past. Pressure on the world airlines sector to cut carbon emissions will grow, and agreements between carriers and manufacturers will be more rapid in pace, giving birth to green aviation.

On a global scale, the UK experiences relatively high average wind speeds, especially offshore, and East Anglia is no exception.

Down to the wire With many sustainable energy projects either underway or imminent, you’d be forgiven for thinking that it’s “problem solved”.","East Anglia, one of the UK’s principal agricultural heartlands, has been a provider of renewable energy for centuries. Hundreds of windmills once dotted the flat and gently undulating landscape of the region, providing a revolutionary labour-saving method of processing grain into flour. This not only increased food productivity greatly, but was achieved without a single gram of carbon dioxide being released in the process

The counties of the region continue in this vein to this day, as organisations lead the charge with sustainable technology projects that build on the simple but elegant concept that windmills once provided for cereal processing. The 21st technologies that now exist and those that are in the development phase will make the region more sustainable as the green industry boom progresses, while simultaneously improving energy security and local job prospects.

The power of wind

Much as East Anglia’s agrarian forebears improved food production rates, engineering firms and sustainability collaborations are currently accelerating renewables capability in the region. It now boasts an impressive display of wind turbines, that can bring hundreds of Megawatts of electricity to nearby towns and villages. On a global scale, the UK experiences relatively high average wind speeds, especially offshore, and East Anglia is no exception. Its relatively flat and open topography lends itself to efficient wind power generation, with averages of approximately 8 mph for inland areas and significantly higher speed along the North Sea coast.

Wind speeds are even higher out at sea, a factor which has contributed to the development of the East Anglia Hub project. This is a huge offshore wind farm established through a joint venture between Scottish Power Renewables and Bilbao Offshore Holding Ltd. It claims an impressive clean power generation capacity of 714 Megawatts via 102 turbines. In other words, the windfarm can provide the electricity necessary to power over half a million homes in East Anglia.

The East Anglia Hub wind farm has been operational since 2020 and further projects are planned for the near future. These could provide Gigawatts of clean energy to the entire region, thus making a significant contribution to the UK’s overall clean energy strategy.

Tilting at wind turbines

Back on (relatively) dry land, much smaller arrays of wind turbines now dot the 21st century East Anglian landscape, providing renewable energy at smaller scale. While sometimes considered divisive due to their aesthetic contrast with the natural landscape and hazards posed to birds, onshore windfarms will be a crucial part of the sustainability puzzle, especially if the government is to deliver on its Clean Power 2030 pledge.

Enhancing wind power technology is by no means a breeze, but it has come a long way over the past few centuries, and things are continuing to evolve. This is nicely showcased by Spanish start-up Vortex, who have developed bladeless wind-turbines, some of which are surprisingly small.

Vortex haven’t taken their technology to commercial scale yet, but the concept is a further evolution of the traditional windmill that could find itself as much as in your back garden, as well as miles out in the Sea. The absence of blades also drastically reduces the risk to avian life. What’s more, they are quieter and more streamlined than the current technology, which may make renewables critics more forgiving overall, potentially resulting in a smoother pathway to development (and present less of an obstacle to Don Quixote).

Bring me sunshine

The East of England also has the privilege of being the driest region in the country, in what is otherwise a mostly cloudy and wet corner of Europe. With a comparatively low average rainfall of approximately 600mm per year (versus 1,400mm nationally), it makes sense to harness the power of the sun here too.

So, much like wind turbines across the region, solar farms are also popping up, with wide scale plans to establish more. The Droves solar farm project in Norfolk is currently going through the planning process and if delivered in its entirety, could provide clean energy for over 100,000 homes.

(Not) always sunny in East Anglia

However, concerns have been raised by some regarding such large projects. James Wild, MP for North West Norfolk, has submitted a formal consultation response on behalf of some of his constituents who worry that The Droves solar installation will have a lasting negative impact on the area.

Among those fears is chiefly the prospect of losing up to 2,000 acres of arable land to energy infrastructure. This will undeniably change the area’s visual character, but it will also impinge on local farming productivity.

Further issues are acknowledged in a report by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), some of which corroborate Wild’s concerns. This research shows that 53% of large-scale solar arrays in England are currently located on what is classified as “best and most versatile” (BMV) agricultural land, with the Goosehall and Black Peak Farm sites in Cambridgeshire contributing heavily to this statistic. Whichever way things progress, East Anglian residents would hope to reap the benefits of hosting solar projects – cheaper energy would be a nice start.

Sunlit uplands

Local concerns can often frustrate new green schemes, but trade-offs and compromises will be required if the UK’s sustainability mission is to progress. Furthermore, such debates can sometimes stimulate constructive ideas that bring forth alternative proposals – including augmentation of existing rooftops with solar panels and introducing legislation that mandates inclusion of photovoltaic installations in new building developments.

Local governments can also be of assistance by providing bursaries that incentivise small businesses to incorporate solar technology into their premises – for example, the Solar For Business initiative established by several Suffolk district councils, has been a success for many years now. These substitutes for building over nature could bring some sought-after long-term benefits, by way of energy bill reduction and stronger civic approval.

Down to the wire

With many sustainable energy projects either underway or imminent, you’d be forgiven for thinking that it’s “problem solved”. Unfortunately though, it’s not always a case of “plug and play”, because many new projects wait years to go live due to bottlenecks in the National Grid infrastructure. There are approximately 400 gigawatts of clean energy awaiting connection to the grid, so many renewables projects, both nationally and regionally, are not yet realising their full potential.

Power usage habits have also changed in recent years, which is largely driven by the rise in electric vehicle charging, causing sometimes unpredictable electricity demands at unusual times. Upgrades to the digital framework within which power usage predictions and load monitoring is done will be needed, alongside infrastructure expansion, if the National Grid is to be fit for the future. Those overseeing this situation are very aware of the challenges ahead, and initiatives have been established to facilitate positive change – Energy Systems Catapult and Energy UK are working with energy providers to accelerate plans to ultimately achieve the goals that will deliver the “green” juice to residents and businesses across East Anglia.

E-Fuels

While there is currently no “silver bullet” for the climate crisis, so-called electrofuels (e-fuels), may be the closest thing to it so far. E-fuels are a low-carbon, synthetic alternative to the traditionally refined fossil fuels so widely used and are regarded as an exciting new development in the energy sector. The production of e-fuels involves turning a plethora of existing feedstocks, such as waste biomass, municipal rubbish and captured-CO2, into liquid fuels using green-hydrogen and renewable energy. Johnson Matthey, a chemicals firm based in Royston on the South Cambridgeshire border, has made progress in this area recently, in partnership with BP. In 2023 the introduction of their patented sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) catalyst technology (FT-CANS) enabled the first net-zero transatlantic passenger flight to take place. FT-CANS is a low-carbon modification of the traditional Fischer-Tropsch process, which is historically responsible for the synthesis of fuels not derived directly from crude-oil distillation.

SAF is not yet at cost-parity with conventional jet fuel, however, there are signs that commercial viability is improving, with DG Fuels currently running SAF projects in Louisiana and Nebraska, and more projects are in the pipeline globally. If the economic challenges are to be overcome, there will need to be a confluence of smart public policy-making and targeted private sector investment. Promisingly, the UK government has now set targets for the use of SAF in the aviation industry, so not only will this decarbonise air travel going forward, but also grow employment in the SAF production sector and provide energy security via a diversified and resilient feedstock supply chain.

The proverbial cherry on top is that SAF and e-fuels can be dropped directly into much of the existing petrochemical infrastructure. Porsche are one car manufacturer pushing the defossilisation boundaries with automotive e-fuels in conjunction with Highly Innovative Fuels (HIF). So, further development may bring carbon-neutral petrol to a forecourt near you!

Looking after our own interests

Given the risks posed by rising sea levels and that much of East Anglia is low-lying, there is not only a moral imperative to mitigate climate change, but a pragmatic one too. NIMBY pushback can occasionally impede projects. Sometimes this is justified. So, it is essential to proceed with care when undertaking new developments, by considering the requirements of local residents and natural habitats alike. Ultimately, this will be key to bringing the public onside.

Encouragingly, there is a genuinely local focus on sustainability to go alongside the national effort.Councillor Ros Hathorn, of Cambridgeshire County Council, states that:

“Addressing climate change both through proactive carbon reduction and resilience actions is absolutely essential to how we operate today and plan for the future. Cambridgeshire county council has been strengthening its capacity for climate and nature action over time. There are specialists in natural capital, nature and the environment, climate change and carbon reduction, renewable projects and community energy and flood resilience”.

As this article will have hopefully evidenced, buy-in from local officials, private companies and individual citizens is genuinely making a positive difference across the region.

It’s easy to become overwhelmed by the challenges posed by climate change due to much of the gloomy rhetoric surrounding the issue. However, there are reasons to remain hopeful as action is being taken. All the while, new sustainable technologies are being developed – now is the opportunity for East Anglia to lead the way in the green revolution – it makes sense to be sustainable.",https://api.mightyshare.io/v1/MSNCRcNFBlA4Mnts/c5066731be927108487620cc54c8d875889404dc8bfcf0358ef842de3c932987/jpeg?cache=true&height=630&width=1200&template=basic-6&template_values=%5B%7B%22name%22%3A%22google_font%22%2C%22google_font%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo_width%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22primary_color%22%2C%22color%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22logo%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Feastangliabylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2023%252F10%252Feastanglia.png%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22background%22%2C%22image_url%22%3A%22https%253A%252F%252Feastangliabylines.co.uk%252Fwp-content%252Fuploads%252F2026%252F01%252FStonor-Goliath-Poldermolen.jpg%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22title%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22Sense%2520and%2520sustainability%253A%2520from%2520windmills%2520to%2520clean%2520energy%2520renewables%22%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22description%22%2C%22text%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D&page=https%3A%2F%2Feastangliabylines.co.uk%2Fenergy%2Fsense-and-sustainability-from-windmills-to-clean-energy-renewables,N,,2026-01-18 12:58:24.376483

In 2025, Kenya Airways cemented its position as a major force in African and global aviation, earning widespread acclaim for its service excellence, sustainability efforts, and financial revival. The national carrier marked an extraordinary year with a series of prestigious awards, operational milestones, and strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening its network and leadership in the aviation industry.

Africa’s Leading Airline and Multiple Accolades

Kenya Airways’ remarkable year began with a triumph at the 32nd Annual World Travel Awards Africa & Indian Ocean Gala Ceremony held in Dar es Salaam. The airline was named Africa’s Leading Airline for 2025, a highly coveted title that recognizes the carrier’s exceptional service, innovation, and operational performance. This award was accompanied by three additional accolades: Africa’s Leading Airline Brand, Africa’s Leading Airline – Business Class, and Africa’s Leading Inflight Magazine (Msafiri).

These four victories underscored Kenya Airways’ commitment to delivering high-quality services across all aspects of the passenger experience, from inflight hospitality to the strength of its brand. The recognition also highlighted the success of Msafiri, the airline’s flagship inflight magazine, which has resonated with passengers by blending cultural storytelling with operational performance.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Initiative and Environmental Leadership

Kenya Airways made significant strides in its sustainability efforts during 2025. In October, the airline achieved a continental milestone by operating Africa’s first intra-continental flight using a 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) blend on its Nairobi–Cape Town route. This initiative was in line with global standards under the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and CORSIA, marking a significant step toward reducing aviation’s environmental impact. The SAF initiative aligns with Kenya Airways’ broader commitment to environmental leadership and sustainability.

These efforts include plans to incorporate SAF blending on European routes, with the airline projecting a reduction of tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon emissions annually. As part of its strategy to lead environmental aviation practices in Africa, Kenya Airways has emerged as a prominent player in the drive for sustainable air travel.

Record Financial Performance and Strategic Partnerships

The carrier’s success extended beyond service awards and sustainability. By December 2025, Kenya Airways achieved its first net profit in 11 years, signaling a robust financial recovery after years of pandemic-related disruptions and challenges. The airline’s ability to turn around its financial performance, despite global industry challenges, highlights its strong leadership and commitment to long-term growth.

Strategic partnerships were key to expanding Kenya Airways’ global reach. The airline deepened its alliance with Qatar Airways, enhancing its codeshare agreement to cover 19 destinations across Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. This partnership not only strengthens Nairobi’s position as a key regional hub but also boosts connectivity for passengers traveling between continents.

Additionally, Kenya Airways’ growth trajectory was supported by its cargo division. In February, Kenya Airways Cargo was named African Air Cargo Airline of the Year at the Air Cargo Africa Conference in Nairobi, further solidifying its role in regional logistics and trade facilitation.

Kenya Airways Leads in Workforce Development

Internal growth and employee engagement played a pivotal role in the airline’s success in 2025. Earlier in the year, the airline was awarded Top Employer of the Year by The Employers Institute. This recognition reflects Kenya Airways’ ongoing efforts to improve its organizational culture, enhance employee satisfaction, and develop its workforce, all of which are critical elements in the carrier’s turnaround strategy.

Recognition at National and Regional Levels

Kenya Airways’ accolades were not limited to international events. At the Kenya Travel Industry Business Awards (KeTIBA) in December, the airline secured two major honors: Best Regional Airline and Best International Airline. These awards were voted on by industry professionals and travelers, reinforcing Kenya Airways’ dual role as a key regional connector and global aviation player.

Leadership Change and Strategic Direction for 2026

As Kenya Airways looked toward the future, it also experienced a shift in leadership. Captain George Kamal was appointed Acting Group Managing Director and CEO, signaling a new phase for the airline as it consolidates its gains and seeks further operational improvements. Under his leadership, Kenya Airways is poised to continue its upward trajectory, focusing on enhanced efficiency, strategic partnerships, and market competitiveness in the years to come.

A Bright Future for Kenya Airways

With a combination of continental awards, environmental initiatives, strategic alliances, and financial success, Kenya Airways has set the stage for continued growth in 2026. The airline’s focus on sustainable practices, customer experience, and expanding its global footprint positions it as one of Africa’s leading carriers with a growing presence on the world aviation stage. As it enters 2026, Kenya Airways is well-equipped to maintain its momentum and enhance its role as a key player in African and global air travel.

According to Airbus’ 2025 Cargo Global Market Forecast (GMF), the global skyline is projected to become considerably more crowded.
The air cargo terminal of the 2026–2030 period is resolving this through a radical transition toward smart terminals.
Forward-thinking cargo hubs like LGG are proactively addressing the future gap in cargo aviation infrastructure by focusing on three key areas.
The air cargo industry of 2026 is no longer a supporting actor in global trade; it is the lead architect.","The global air cargo sector is currently undergoing a profound metamorphosis. Once characterised as a labor-intensive, documentation-heavy foundation of international commerce, the industry is rapidly divesting itself of its analog processes. In their stead, a highly interconnected, data-centric, and increasingly automated ecosystem is emerging, one that is redefining the movement of goods globally in an era of instant gratification and environmental urgency.

Driven by a staggering $8.1 trillion e-commerce boom and an industry-wide mandate for net-zero emissions, the aviation cargo landscape of 2026 transcends the mere physical movement of boxes. It has become a digital-first frontier where success is predicated not solely on fleet size, but on the capacity to optimally orchestrate the data those aircraft generate.

According to Airbus’ 2025 Cargo Global Market Forecast (GMF), the global skyline is projected to become considerably more crowded. The report anticipates that the worldwide dedicated freighter fleet will surge to 3,420 aircraft over the next two decades, representing a substantial 45% increase from current levels.

This influx of capacity does not signify a simple replication of existing assets. The GMF outlines a strategy of renewal and specialised growth. To satisfy the projected demand for cargo aviation, a total of 2,605 additional freighters will be necessitated between 2026 and 2030, according to the Airbus GMF.

This requirement is segmented into three primary categories: 1,120 small aircraft, which will be essential for maintaining regional agility; 855 mid-size widebodies; and 630 large widebodies, which are requisite for transcontinental heavy lifting operations.

Perhaps most indicative of the industry’s pivot toward circularity and efficiency is the origin of these aircraft. While 935 will be new constructions, the vast majority 1,670 aircraft will be passenger-to-freighter (P2F) conversions. This trend injects new operational life into existing airframes, enabling airlines to strategically redeploy assets into the high-margin cargo sector as passenger travel patterns stabilise.

While aircraft technology advances significantly, the industry has long identified a persistent bottleneck: the warehouse. This terrestrial hurdle has historically slowed transit, encumbered by manual sorting and paper manifests.

The air cargo terminal of the 2026–2030 period is resolving this through a radical transition toward smart terminals. These facilities are intentionally designed to be human-light, prioritising extreme throughput speed and the near-total elimination of processing errors.

""We perceive the evolution toward more automated, human-light cargo terminals not as a binary choice between efficiency and survival, but as a strategic imperative,"" stated Frédéric Brun, Head of Commercial Cargo & Logistics at Liege Airport (LGG) and Torsten Wefers, Vice President Sales & Marketing at LGG.

At CargoLand by LGG, the practical implementation of this vision is evident. By deploying AI-powered vision systems and autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), terminals are reporting a 70% reduction in errors. These robots execute palletisation and sorting with a level of precision that human crews are unable to replicate consistently over a 24-hour shift.

Brun noted that this initiative is not focused on replacing personnel, but on empowering them. By utilising tools such as digital twins, virtual replicas of the physical warehouse, operators can simulate workflows in real-time, proactively identifying potential bottlenecks before they manifest on the floor.

The infrastructure of tomorrow

The evolution extends beyond the confines of the warehouse and into the fundamental fuel and flight paths of the industry. The middle-mile drone has formally transitioned from a nascent technology to a logistical imperative.

New-generation cargo drones, developed by companies such as Dronamics (Bulgaria/UK), Elroy Air, and Sabrewing Aircraft Company, have moved beyond carrying light parcels. These autonomous aerial vehicles are now capable of transporting 200–500kg across hundreds of miles.

Aviation confronts a formidable path toward achieving Net Zero. Innovation in propulsion is bifurcating into solutions for short-haul (Electric/Hydrogen) and long-haul.

“Alternative propulsion for regional middle-mile cargo, specifically electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) and hydrogen-propulsion aircraft, are progressing rapidly from prototype stages to certification,” said Brun.

According to IATA reports, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is projected to constitute less than 1% of total fuel consumption in 2026, a reflection of the inefficacy of the current policy environment.

This deficiency is further compounded by the lack of harmonisation between CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and various regional initiatives, which engenders fragmentation and curtails substantive emissions reductions.

Forward-thinking cargo hubs like LGG are proactively addressing the future gap in cargo aviation infrastructure by focusing on three key areas. Firstly, they are committing to complete electrification, transitioning all ground equipment to 100% electric operations.

Secondly, they are ensuring the immediate availability of SAF through the development of dedicated fuel infrastructure. Finally, these hubs are implementing cargo connect, a comprehensive digital ecosystem designed to facilitate the seamless sharing of critical data among airlines, handlers, and all logistics partners.

The brain of the operation

As the physical and digital infrastructure attains maturity, the commercial dimension of the business is also undergoing a revolution. For decades, the industry operated in silos, with sales (GSAs), operations, and tech infrequently communicating effectively.

Aerion, a commercial holding company, is challenging the current fragmented model of cargo aviation. It unites ECS Group, Global GSA Group, CargoTech, Healthc’Air, Mail & More, TCE, and Squair. Founded by the leaders of the ECS Group, Aerion signifies an evolution from simple airline representation toward full operational orchestration.

“For nearly three decades, we have been actively shaping the air cargo industry rather than simply adapting to it,” said Adrien Thominet, Founder and Chairman of Aerion. “First by establishing ECS Group, then by integrating Global GSA Group, we constructed an unparalleled network. Aerion is the mechanism that connects these components.”

Aerion centralises strategic intelligence by consolidating a range of specialised entities, each focusing on a distinct area of cargo aviation: CargoTech provides high-end digital capabilities for planning and optimisation; TCE offers expertise in safety, security, and quality operations; Squair delivers specialised back-office and claims support; Mail&More handles the high-velocity requirements of e-commerce and postal flows; and Healthc'Air manages the rigorous requirements of temperature-sensitive medical logistics.

In practice, Aerion functions as a strategic central intelligence unit. While each entity preserves its operational independence, they function under a consolidated commercial strategy aimed at achieving measurable, sustainable profit.

Perhaps the most significant paradigm shift highlighted by the emergence of Aerion is the industry's new relationship with data. Historically, possessing information conferred a competitive advantage. Today, data is ubiquitous; it has become a commodity.

The true disruption in 2026 resides not in access to data, but in the capability to exploit it judiciously. Industry standards such as IATA’s ONE Record have provided the requisite foundation for a cleaner, consistent methodology for information sharing. However, Aerion contends that this foundation merely represents the beginning.

""The substantive difference is no longer determined by ‘who possesses the data, but ‘who truly understands how to leverage it to drive profitability,"" the company added.

Aerion does not seek ownership of the data, but rather the orchestration of its utilisation, translating market signals into precise decisions concerning network planning, pricing, and customer segmentation. In this environment, technology serves as a decision accelerator.

The rise of the neutral hub

As the industry advances, the concept of the neutral hub is becoming increasingly appealing to traditional carriers. To maintain relevance in the face of tech-heavy integrators and agile startups, traditional airlines require operating environments that offer 24/7 flexibility unconstrained by passenger-driven schedules.

Torsten Wefers, Vice President of Sales & Marketing at LGG, observes that the objective is to ensure a seamless integration between air and ground logistics. By utilising hubs such as CargoLand, airlines can operate within an ecosystem where pricing, legal compliance, safety protocols, and sales execution are comprehensively aligned.

The air cargo industry of 2026 is no longer a supporting actor in global trade; it is the lead architect. By blending physical capacity with digital orchestration, the sector is finally moving at the speed of the modern world.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2026/01/17/91133-1763396335400.jpg,N,,2026-01-18 06:56:11.868770

What’s next?

The airport said that regulatory and policy decisions in 2026 would determine if the expansion proceeds to the next phase, adding that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) needed to clarify how early development costs for the project would be recovered.

Thomas Woldbye, Heathrow’s CEO, stated that the:

“Heathrow expansion is a critical national project,” adding that “Maintaining momentum will mean the CAA and Ministers remain focussed on securing the benefits of the project by meeting vital milestones in 2026 that are essential to enabling the next phase of delivery.”

The Department for Transport is expected to publish a draft Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) this summer, setting out the framework for decisions on airport expansion.

The current Labour government has stated it wants to make a final decision on the expansion by 2029 and have the third runway operational within a decade.

The complicated history of Heathrow’s possible third runway

It is not the first time that the government has aimed for a third runway at Heathrow Airport.

In May 2003, the British Airports Authority (BAA plc) publicly admitted for the first time that it wanted approval for the third runway. The response was strong condemnation and opposition from local groups, climate activists, politicians, and even the aviation sector itself.

After years of back-and-forth, the British parliament approved the Airports National Policy Statement backing a third runway in 2018.

Only two years later, in 2020, the Court of Appeal ruled the government’s approval unlawful for failing to consider the Paris climate agreement, but the Supreme Court overturned that decision later the same year.

Technology Advancement

Technological innovation is a powerful catalyst transforming how refined petroleum products are produced, optimized, and delivered. Modern refineries are adopting advanced processing technologies such as hydrocracking, catalytic reforming, and deep desulfurization — all aimed at boosting yields, improving fuel purity, and meeting stringent environmental standards. These technologies allow producers to convert heavier crude fractions into lighter, higher‑value products like gasoline and diesel more efficiently.

Digital transformation plays a pivotal role in operational excellence. The integration of real‑time data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) enables predictive maintenance, optimized process control, and energy efficiency enhancements. For example, AI‑driven models can forecast equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and extending the life of critical units. Digital twins — virtual replicas of physical refinery operations — help engineers simulate process changes, explore optimization scenarios, and enhance safety margins.

Refineries are also exploring cleaner fuel technologies and alternative feedstocks as part of sustainability strategies. This includes co‑processing bio‑based feedstocks such as vegetable oils or waste fats alongside conventional crude, producing biodiesel blends and lower‑carbon fuel alternatives. The development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel is particularly notable, reflecting the industry’s efforts to reduce lifecycle emissions from transportation fuels.

Innovation in catalyst development is another key area. New catalyst formulations enhance reaction efficiency in fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) and hydroprocessing units, leading to improved product yields and reduced environmental impact. Similarly, advancements like modular hydrocrackers offer flexibility in refinery configurations, helping operators adjust quickly to market demands or regulatory changes.

Together, these advancements are not only improving refinery performance but are also helping the market evolve in line with global energy and environmental goals.

Pour y répondre, les constructeurs aéronautiques misent notamment sur l'avion électrique, une technologie encore en développement mais porteuse de fortes promesses. Moins polluant et potentiellement moins coûteux à exploiter, ce nouveau modèle pourrait aussi rebattre les cartes du prix des billets Une bonne nouvelle pour le portefeuille des voyageurs?

La compagnie scandinave SAS prévoit le premier vol en avion électrique pour 2028

En juin 2023, la compagnie aérienne SAS a ouvert les réservations pour ses trois premiers vols commerciaux en avion électrique à destination de la Suède, la Norvège et le Danemark. 90 billets (30 par vol) ont été mis en vente. Ils ont rapidement trouvé preneur. Les heureux élus devront prendre leur mal en patience, ces vols inauguraux n'étant pas prévus avant 2028! Le prix du billet était fixé à 1.946 couronnes suédoises, danoises ou norvégiennes, frais et taxes inclus. Cela correspondait, à cette période, à un tarif de 165 euros pour les passagers suédois, 171 euros pour les Norvégiens, et 261 euros pour les voyageurs danois. Le montant de 1.946 couronnes est un clin d'œil à l'année de création de la compagnie aérienne. Celle-ci espère écrire «un nouveau chapitre de l'histoire de l'aviation».

La Suède développe le plus grand avion électrique au monde

L'annonce de SAS peut paraître prématurée. En 2019, la compagnie a conclu un accord avec Heart Aerospace pour développer des avions électriques. L'entreprise basée près de Göteborg, en Suède, travaille actuellement sur le futur ES-30. Cet appareil d'une envergure de 32 mètres, pouvant embarquer jusqu'à 30 passagers, sera propulsé par quatre moteurs électriques alimentés par des batteries rechargeables en 30 minutes. Il disposera d'une autonomie de 200km, et pourra effectuer un trajet total de 400km grâce à un moteur hybride alimenté en carburant d'aviation durable (CAD, en anglais SAF pour sustainable aviation fuel). En réduisant la capacité à 25 passagers, l'avion peut atteindre 800km d'autonomie.

Le prototype Heart Experimental 1 (Heart X1) devait effectuer son vol-test inaugural au départ de l'aéroport de Plattsburgh, dans l'État de New York, en 2025, mais il a été reporté à deux reprises. Il est désormais prévu pour 2026. Heart Aerospace présentera ensuite un prototype de préproduction, le Heart X2, capable d'effectuer un vol hybride-électrique. L'entreprise vise une certification de l'ES-30 et son exploitation commerciale dès 2028, mais cette date pourrait être décalée.

Plusieurs prototypes pourraient voler d'ici 2030

La start-up américaine BETA Technologies a conçu le Alia CTOL CX300. En septembre 2025, l'avion a effectué un premier vol-test de fret en conditions réelles entre les aéroports de Stavanger et de Bergen, dans le sud-ouest de la Norvège. L'appareil a parcouru les 160km en 55 minutes. Il peut transporter jusqu'à 5 passagers, et dispose d'une autonomie de 400km. L'entreprise vise une certification à l'horizon 2028-2030

La start-up allemande Vaeridion développe un avion électrique d'une autonomie de 500km. Selon Eurocontrol, près d'un tiers des vols au sein de l'Union européenne en 2022 concernaient des distances inférieures ou égales à ce rayon d'action. Cela permet par exemple de couvrir des liaisons comme Londres-Amsterdam, Berlin-Munich ou Madrid-Lisbonne. Vaeridion prévoit le premier vol d'un prototype en 2027, avec une exploitation commerciale dès 2030. L'entreprise vise une clientèle d'affaires aisée, avec des prix de sièges entre 150 et 300 euros

Le concept E9X, créé par la start-up néerlandaise Elysian en collaboration avec l'Université de technologie de Delft, est un avion à réaction entièrement électrique pouvant accueillir jusqu'à 90 passagers, et voler sur 800km. Dans sa version finale, il pourrait parcourir jusqu'à 1.000 kilomètres. Selon l'entreprise, l'appareil serait adapté pour couvrir environ la moitié des vols commerciaux réguliers. Un prototype pourrait voler en 2033. Il reste à savoir si un tel projet est viable sur le plan économique.

L'avion est jusqu'à 26 fois moins cher que le train en Europe

L'ONG Greenpeace a analysé 142 trajets de moins de 1.500 km en Europe, dont 109 transfrontaliers. En pondérant par le nombre de passagers aériens, le train coûte en moyenne 2,5 fois plus cher que l'avion pour voyager en Europe. Certains vols low cost sont jusqu'à 26 fois moins chers que le même trajet en train. L'étude prend l'exemple d'un voyage Barcelone-Londres à 14,99 euros en avion contre 389 euros en train pour une réservation anticipée à moyen terme. Un vol Marseille-Londres est affiché à 15 euros , contre 188 euros pour le rail. En France, 95% des voyages transfrontaliers sont moins chers en avion.

So with Minerals Technologies trading around US$67, a DCF suggesting a 57% discount and the share price still below its 1 year level, is this a genuine mispricing, or is the market already factoring in future growth?

Most Popular Narrative: 20.1% Undervalued

On this narrative, Minerals Technologies' fair value of US$84 sits well above the last close of US$67.12, setting up a clear valuation gap for investors to assess.

Ongoing investments in capacity expansions for high-growth, sustainable products (e.g., sustainable aviation fuel purification, animal health solutions, fabric care, and pet litter in Asia) are positioned to benefit from global population growth, urbanization, and heightened sustainability demand. These factors directly support revenue growth and above-average margin expansion.

Curious what earnings, margin shifts, and revenue trajectory have to look like for that fair value to stack up? The narrative leans on sharp profit turnaround, sustained top line growth, and a very low future earnings multiple. If you want to see how those pieces fit together, the full story is worth a read.

""Look at all of the private jets at Nice airport on takeoff,"" wrote the original poster.

The French city of Nice has been well aware of the impact of luxury travel on its infrastructure. The city's mayor has previously worked to ban cruise ships from docking there.

Besides being a tacky display of wealth, luxury travel produces an outsized share of pollution. Per passenger emissions from private jets are far higher than commercial airlines. For example, one study suggested that Jeff Bezos' two private jets crank out more pollution in a year than the average Amazon worker could in 207 years.

Worse still, private jet travel is on the rise. Between 2019 and 2023, private jet pollution went up 50%. A big part of this increase are empty legs, where private jets fly without passengers on board.

Private jet pollution has immediate effects on local air quality, but the issue is even bigger than that. Atmospheric pollution traps heat, exacerbates destructive weather patterns, and passes the costs of natural disasters to society at large. This has led to crises in home insurance and agriculture.

The use of sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to reduce pollution from air travel, but there are much lower-impact options available, like rail. Taking the train when possible is not only better for the environment, it can be a very comfortable ride, too.

Reddit commenters were less than pleased to see so many private jets parked in the south of France.

It’s a card that I have, as someone who has Flying Blue Platinum status. We’ve just learned about some changes coming to the card, and they’re entirely positive, as I see it (thanks to Levi for flagging this).

What’s changing about the Air France-KLM credit card

Over the coming weeks, we’re going to see some major changes to Flying Blue’s credit card in the United States.

For one, in March 2026 we’re going to see the card converted from a Mastercard to a Visa — specifically, it’ll go from being the Air France KLM World Elite Mastercard to being the Air France KLM Visa Signature Card. The transition should be seamless, so existing cardmembers should automatically receive a new version of the card, with a new card number.

More immediately, for applications as of Wednesday, January 21, 2026 (and for existing cardmembers), we’re seeing some improvements to the benefits of the card. It’ll maintain the same $89 annual fee it currently has, with a couple of major changes.

First, we’ll see the card get a new bonus category of earning 3x miles on dining. This complements the existing rewards structure of 3x miles on Air France, KLM, and SkyTeam bookings, plus 1.5x miles on all other everyday spending.

On top of that, we’ll see new anniversary rewards on the card. As before, the card will offer 5,000 anniversary bonus miles after $50 in annual purchases, in addition to 20XPs each card anniversary just for having the card. With these updates, you’ll also be able to earn 80 XPs for annual purchases of at least $15,000, and an enhanced offer of an additional 60 XPs for annual purchases of at least $25,000.

In other words, in total cardmembers will be able to earn 160 XPs if they spend $25,000 on the card in anniversary year.

I’m very happy to see these changes to the card!

I find the Air France-KLM Flying Blue program to be super useful, which is why I have Platinum status in the program. It’s fantastic to see Flying Blue actually make it more compelling to use the card for spending.

If I can earn 160 XPs per year by spending $25,000 on the card, all while earning a minimum of 1.5x miles, I’d consider that to be a worthwhile opportunity. For context on XPs, that’s the metric by which you earn status with the Flying Blue program:

100 XPs gets you Silver status

You then need 180 additional XPs to earn Gold status

You then need 300 additional XPs to earn Platinum status

The clock resets as you work your way up the tiers. In other words, if you’re starting from scratch, you’d need a total of 580 XPs to earn Platinum status, but you’d have more than a year, since the tiers keep resetting. Meanwhile if you already have Platinum status, you only need 300 XPs to requalify for the status.

So by spending $25,000 on the card per year, that’ll get me over half way to Platinum status. Personally, I didn’t find it worthwhile to put spending on the card before, so I’m very happy to see this. I also find the annual fee on the card easy to justify, since the 5,000 miles go a long way to offsetting the $89 annual fee.

Kudos to Flying Blue on these changes. If I had any wish, it’s that it would be awesome if there were even more opportunities to earn XPs for spending on the card. The folks at Flying Blue are savvy and understand the US market really well, so you’d think they’d embrace credit card spending as much as possible.

Bottom line

The Air France-KLM credit card in the United States is going to see some updates. For one, it’ll go from being a Mastercard to a Visa, which is the most minor change, as I see it. On top of that, the card will earn 3x miles on dining, and it’ll also be possible to earn up to 160 XPs on the card per year, by spending $25,000.

When you consider that the annual fee is staying the same, I’d consider these to be entirely positive changes. At least for me, Flying Blue will accomplish its goal — I’ll be switching some spending to the card!",https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Air-France-Business-Class-A350-104.jpeg,N,,2026-01-17 18:56:58.725746

These efforts mirror a broader trend among logistics companies to shrink their environmental footprint. However, the journey to a carbon-neutral future isn’t without hurdles. Climate-related challenges like floods and heatwaves could disrupt these strategies. eBay is urging its partners to collaborate closely to anticipate and mitigate these risks.

Challenges on the Green Road

While the plan is ambitious, it’s not without its critics. One major hurdle is the high cost of transitioning to greener technologies. Implementing electric vehicles and investing in alternative fuels require significant resources, which not all companies are willing to allocate.

Additionally, eBay must ensure its partners maintain their commitments and progress steadily. Unpredictable climate changes pose another potential risk, threatening supply chains and the ultimate goal of carbon neutrality.

As European regulations tighten and consumer expectations for sustainability rise, eBay must skillfully navigate this rapidly changing environment. Whether these initiatives will succeed and if the company will meet its ambitious targets remains to be seen.",https://appel-aura-ecologie.fr/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cropped-favicon-150x150.jpg.webp,N,,2026-01-18 01:57:19.962695

But how did commercial flights go from being exclusively for the wealthy to the mainstream and affordable option they are today? Artemis Aerospace guides us through the different decades of air travel and how it has shaped modern-day living.

The First Commercial Flight

The first ever passenger flight took off in May 1908 when Wilbur Wright carried Charles Furnas just 2000 feet across the beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Just one year later, the first airline in the world, the German airship company DELAG, was founded.

In 1914, the world’s first scheduled passenger service, an airboat piloted by Tony Jannus, set off from St. Petersburg, Florida, and landed at Tampa, around 17 miles away. The service only ran for four months, but it had unlocked the appetite of those keen to tap into the novelty of air transport.

A New Era of Aviation

However, it wasn’t until the 1920s that commercial flights carrying paying passengers started to become commonplace with the introduction of the multi-engine airplane, the Lawson C-2, which was specifically built to carry passengers.

During this time, more and more start-up airline carriers were being established, some of which are still in operation today. These include KLM in the Netherlands (1919), Colombia’s Avianca (1919), Qantas in Australia (1920), and Czech Airlines (1923).

Aircraft from this period would land frequently to refuel and fly at lower altitudes due to unpressurized cabins. This made traveling by plane noisy, cold, and expensive. Flying times were lengthy, and turbulence was frequent. Passengers regularly experienced air sickness, and many airlines hired nurses to reduce anxiety and tend to those affected.

In 1935, one of the world’s oldest airlines, Qantas, operated its first international passenger flight, traveling from Brisbane to Singapore. From there, British-owned Imperial Airways connected this flight to the UK. This was to set the wheels in motion for creating a regular travel route between Australia and the UK in the coming decades.

Despite flying being incredibly dangerous and extremely expensive during this period, it was still a fashionable way to travel for the rich. According to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, the number of airline passengers grew from just 6,000 in 1930 to nearly half a million by 1934; the aviation industry was well on its way to becoming hugely important to the global economy.

Innovation That Revolutionized Air Travel

The introduction of the Douglas DC-3 in 1935 also had a big impact on the future of commercial flight. The propeller-driven airliner was a larger and much improved aircraft compared to its predecessors. Faster and more reliable, it could carry up to 32 passengers and had a cruising speed of 207 mph with a range of 1500 miles. This made it popular with well-established airlines, including Delta, TWA, American, and United, who soon added the aircraft to their fleets.

During the 1940s, the onset of WWII meant commercial aviation developments slowed considerably. However, by the end of the decade, the industry was heading towards a new era as Pan Am began operating its fleet of Boeing 307s, which featured the first-ever pressurized cabin.

This transformed air travel for passengers, allowing them to enjoy a comfortable experience at an altitude of 20,000 feet. Major airlines were now ramping up their advertising spending and offering travelers smooth journeys to far-flung destinations and business hubs, including Pan Am’s iconic New York-London route.

The Golden Age of Air Travel

The 1950s and 1960s heralded the age of jet engine aircraft, and with it came an upsurge in commercial flights, airline carriers, and international flying routes.

Commercial air travel was booming, and major airlines were fiercely competitive, offering passengers more and more inflight perks, including lavish silver-service meals and fine wines.

Pan Am was a front-runner in pioneering and marketing the very best air travel had to offer. It was the first airline to fly worldwide and introduced ground-breaking changes to the industry, such as adding jet aircraft to their fleets and utilizing computerized reservation systems.

In the 1960s, work began on creating the world’s first supersonic aircraft and what would eventually become an iconic symbol of commercial flight, the Concorde. Offering transatlantic flights in just 3.5 hours, the aircraft was a hit with business travelers and royalty alike. However, tickets were extremely expensive and only a privileged few could afford to travel via Concorde.

The Rise of the No-frills Airline

Seeing a gap in the market for making air travel more accessible to everyday people, British-owned Laker Airways, founded in 1966 by Freddie Laker, was one of the first airlines to start offering a budget alternative by adjusting its inflight offer.

Using the budget airline business model that is commonplace today, Laker was able to offer lower fares by reducing inflight services and luxuries, such as free meals. The airline also found innovative ways to reduce fuel consumption and engine wear by introducing the reduced thrust take-off technique and faster climbs to obtain the optimum flying altitude in as little time as possible. Sadly, the airline was a casualty of the 1980s recession and subsequently went bankrupt.

However, it paved the way for budget travel and opened a world of possibilities for millions more people to get the chance to travel by air.

Today, the world’s largest low-cost carrier is Southwest Airlines in the US. Synonymous with budget travel, the company’s low-cost domestic and short-haul offer has undoubtedly inspired many other well-known brands to tap into the no-frills market, including Ryanair and EasyJet.

Air Travel for the Masses

Larger and more economical aircraft, such as the Boeing 747, had also made cheaper air travel possible. Airlines were now able to carry more passengers than ever before, meaning ticket prices could be sold at a reduced rate. Holidaying abroad was no longer reserved for the rich.

This change in dynamics meant airlines now started to look for different ways to retain the luxurious service and long lunches that had been synonymous with the golden age of travel, without compromising on providing a budget alternative.

First-class cabins, sophisticated onboard bars, and exclusive-use airport lounges meant those who could afford to, could still travel in style.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the budget airlines Ryanair and EasyJet launched. Offering airfares for as little as £20, they changed the face of commercial flying and put pressure on traditional carriers to lower ticket prices.

Security Tightening in the 2000s

The tragic events of 9/11 had a profound effect on air travel. Security at airports was increased significantly and passengers without a ticket at US airports could no longer accompany friends and family through security to the gate.

Cockpit security was also heightened. Previously, it had been possible for passengers to visit the flight deck and speak to the pilots. However, after 2001, cockpit doors were locked with only the pilots controlling who could enter.

A New Era for Air Travel

According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, it took until 2004 for air passenger numbers to reach pre-9/11 levels and until 2007 to reach a record high.

During this period, low-cost carriers were experiencing increased demand as the popularity of booking websites surged, and, by 2009, figures from the tourism research company PhoCusWright reported that half of all travel-related bookings were being made online.

Passenger numbers continued to surge throughout the 2010s, and by the end of the decade, the volume of travelers using commercial airlines was at an all-time high.

The Post-pandemic Era: Flying into a New Age for Aviation

Prior to the pandemic, the IATA projected that global passenger numbers could reach 7.2 billion by 2035. Few, however, could have anticipated the scale of disruption that followed: worldwide fleet groundings, fractured supply chains, volatile border policies, and the most severe financial shock in aviation history.

By 2024, global passenger traffic had largely returned to, and in some regions surpassed, pre-pandemic levels, marking one of the fastest recoveries the industry has ever experienced. International long-haul demand rebounded strongly across the Atlantic and Pacific, while emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America reshaped global traffic flows. New hubs gained prominence, secondary cities secured nonstop intercontinental links, and airlines rethought network strategies with resilience, not just growth, in mind.

Yet recovery has not meant a return to the old normal. From 2023 through early 2026, aviation has operated under persistent structural constraints. Aircraft delivery delays, engine reliability issues, pilot shortages, and air traffic control bottlenecks have limited capacity just as demand surged. Airlines responded by extending fleet lifespans, accelerating cabin retrofits, and prioritizing yield over sheer scale — signaling a more disciplined era of growth.

The Promises to Come True

At the same time, sustainability moved from aspiration to operational reality. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production expanded, regulatory frameworks tightened in Europe and beyond, and airlines increasingly tied long-term strategies to fleet renewal conducive to cost and emissions reduction, and transparent environmental reporting. While the path to net-zero remains complex, aviation entered 2026 with clearer benchmarks and stronger alignment between policy, manufacturers, and operators than at any point before.

Technology and passenger expectations have also reshaped the experience of flying. AI-driven operations, biometric processing, next-generation premium cabins, and redesigned airport infrastructure reflect an industry focused on efficiency, comfort, and differentiation. Premium and long-haul leisure travel proved especially resilient, reinforcing aviation’s role not just as transport, but as a lifestyle and economic enabler.

As we move deeper into this new era, global aviation stands neither fragile nor complacent, but transformed. The years since the pandemic have reaffirmed a central truth: air travel adapts because it must. No matter the geopolitical, economic, or environmental challenges ahead, the impulse to connect across cities, continents, and cultures remains fundamental.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/696bc79d393a2c05e679cc33_AW_Chris%20Goulet-35.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 13:56:25.869756

Strategic partnership to scale CBG in India

On 11 November 2025, Sumitomo Corporation agreed to acquire a stake in TruAlt Gas Private Limited (TGPL), a subsidiary of TruAlt Bioenergy Limited, and enter into a strategic collaboration. Following the investment, TGPL will be renamed TruAlt Sumi Gas Private Limited (TSGPL).

TSGPL plans to build 16 compressed biomethane gas production facilities across India over the next three years, with operations starting in phases from 2026. Once fully operational, the plants are expected to produce around 320 tonnes of CBG per day, equivalent to the daily gas needs of nearly 800,000 Indian households. The gas will mainly be sold as automobile fuel to city gas distributors.

Supporting energy security and government targets

India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, is pushing to improve energy self-sufficiency and reach energy independence by 2047. CBG plays a key role in this plan, as it is produced from agricultural and industrial waste such as sugarcane and ethanol residue.

The Indian government has mandated CBG blending in vehicle fuel and household city gas, targeting a 5 per cent blend by 2028. This policy has made rapid expansion of CBG production facilities a priority.

Expansion plans and future bioenergy initiatives

TSGPL will first construct four CBG plants in Karnataka and Maharashtra, major sugarcane-producing regions. Sumitomo Corporation and TruAlt will also explore expanding bioethanol capacity and producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from bioethanol.

Despite the abrupt shift in federal energy policy, US innovators in the fleet electrification field continue to exercise an outsized impact on the global decarbonization movement. The latest example comes from the Texas startup Fleetzero, which has just nailed $43 million in Series A financing to scale up its electric ship business.

The Fleetzero Electric Ship Solution: Smaller And Slower Are Better

Fleetzero surfaced on the CleanTechnica radar in 2022 with a multi-faceted approach to electrifying the global shipping industry. Rather than attempting to electrify the biggest cargo vessels traveling the longest routes at the fastest speed, Fleetzero reverses the economy of scale script to focus attention on smaller electric ships traveling relatively short distances between stops, at slower speeds.

If you’re guessing that battery swapping comes into the picture, run right out and buy yourself a cigar. Fleetzero’s electric ships can swap batteries in far less time than it takes to recharge. The battery system is designed to fit into standing shipping containers, so they can be changed out with standard port equipment.

As a follow-on effect of the swapping approach, Fleetzero’s ships require smaller batteries that take up less space, leaving more room for cargo. In addition, the focus on smaller ships enables Fleetzero to call at smaller port facilities that are closer to local destinations, shrinking the last-mile expenses associated with ground transportation.

Yet another intertwining factor is the speed of the ships. The Fleetzero fleet runs at about half the speed of the biggest container ships. That provides a savings on battery range, while the lost time can be offset by shrinking the miles needed for ground transportation.

As for who’s gonna pay for all this, Fleetzero calculates that their electric ships will cost less to operate than conventional propulsion systems. “The company’s Leviathan™ propulsion system can be used on new or existing ships in a hybrid or all-electric configuration and is designed to lower the total cost of ownership of large commercial ships through maintenance and fuel savings,” Fleetzero states.

$43 Million More For The Electric Ships Of The Future

In the latest news, Fleetzero’s new cash infusion of $43 million will enable the company to open up a new electric ship factory and research facility — in Texas, of course, where everything is bigger including the maritime fleet electrification movement.

“The capital will be used to expand manufacturing of Fleetzero’s Leviathan™ hybrid and electric marine propulsion system, which is being deployed globally on commercial vessels,” Fleetzero explained in a press statement.

Fleetzero initially launched in New Orleans, Louisiana. The new $43 million cash infusion supports the company’s move to Texas, where it will ramp up operations to the next level.

“Fleetzero’s new headquarters in Houston will serve as the company’s hub for manufacturing and R&D. The facility includes a production line with an initial capacity of 300 MWh/year of marine ESS systems, a marine robotics and autonomy lab, and a marine propulsion R&D center. Fleetzero plans to expand its Houston production capacity up to three GWh/yr over the next five years,” the company explained in a press statement.

“Houston has the people who know how to build and operate big hardware – ships, rigs, refineries, and power systems,” emphasized Fleetzero COO and co-founder Mike Carter.

“We’re pairing that industrial DNA with modern batteries, autonomy, and software to bring back shipbuilding to the US,” Carter added again for good measure.

Keeping Up With The Joneses

That’s … interesting! With a focus on supporting fossil fuel producers, the Trump administration has been putting the brakes on the vehicle electrification movement. However, some automakers are continuing to introduce new EVs to the US, including Toyota as well as newcomers Slate Auto and Telo Trucks. Signs of activity are also rising in the truck and other delivery fleet electrification area. Now here comes Fleetzero with a plan to displace fossil fuels by floating more electric ships into the market, too.

As Carter indicates, the broader aim is to keep the US shipbuilding industry competitive with new technologies as global stakeholders move beyond conventional fuels to adopt autonomous and alternative propulsion systems.

Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk also participated in the Series A funding round through its Maersk Growth branch, attracted in part by the port infrastructure element in Fleetzero’s business model.

“We believe that electrification will be an important part of the mix on our journey to reach net-zero,” explained the company’s Head of Energy Transition, Morten Bo Christiansen, taking note of Fleetzero’s focus on “broader infrastructure.”

Think Globally, Invest Locally

The Series A round also demonstrates that US-based investors can continue to push the decarbonization envelope globally, regardless of temporary shifts in federal energy policy.

Leading the Series A round was the California firm Obvious Ventures. A quick stroll through the firm’s portfolio indicates a focus on transformative technologies that push the energy transition envelope in the US and globally. The list features some familiar faces on the pages of CleanTechnica, including the US advanced geothermal startup Zanskar and California-based Lightship, creator of a battery-powered, self-propelled RV.

Other participants in the Series A round included the New York-based firm 8090 Industries, which is also on the prowl for transformative industrial-scale technologies with a focus on energy, including the Texas SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) startup Cemvita, which has a billion-gallon order under its wing from American Airlines.

Also on the 8090 roster are the electric seaglider startup Regent, the synthentic graphite manufacturer Maple Materials, the renewable energy and thermal storage specialist Exowatt, the advanced geothermal firm Quaise, and the e-fuels specialist Infinium, the startup behind the massive Project Roadrunner renewable energy and e-fuels facility in Texas.

The “seaglider” angle is of interest as a sort of airborne version of Fleetzero’s electric boat. Regent uses seaglider to refer to wing-in-ground watercraft, which generate a cushion of air to lift themselves completely out of water. That distinguishes them from seaplanes, which are aircraft equipped to land on water, but in terms of sustainable transportation the general idea is similar. Both planes can use existing bodies of water instead of runway infrastructure and they can dock at existing port facilities, ideally landing their passengers closer to their ground destinations.

Rounding out the returning Fleetzero investors for Series A are the very familiar US-identified firms Breakthrough Energy Ventures and Y Combinator, among others.

The main investments and innovations are increasingly shifting to the southern and western regions of the country.","In the coming years, Spain could see an economic leap if it carries out its ambitious plans to build data centers, advanced manufacturing plants, and facilities linked to renewable energy. These initiatives are expected to generate more than €44 billion in additional industrial value for the country. The scope of these changes extends to almost all regions except Castilla y León and the island territories. The list ranges from methanol production plants in Asturias to major data centers in Madrid and expansive hydrogen valleys in Andalucía.

In recent years, Spain has become a magnet for foreign investors attracted by low electricity prices driven by the growth of green energy. Until now, however, it has remained unclear exactly how many projects are in the pipeline and where they will be located. Investors often negotiated with several regional authorities at once, leading to confusion and inflated expectations over the number of future enterprises.

Energy and Industry

The spotlight is on the future of nuclear energy. If the operational life of all existing Spanish nuclear power plants is extended beyond 2035, industry could save about 1.4 billion euros annually on energy costs. This is because nuclear generation can reduce wholesale electricity prices by approximately 14 euros per megawatt-hour. Such a move is particularly important for regions with developed industry: Catalonia, País Vasco, Andalucía, and Valencia. Most of these regions have nuclear plants either within their territory or very close by—for example, Catalonia hosts the Ascó and Valdellós plants, Valencia has Cofrentes, and Andalucía is near Almaraz.

Preserving nuclear generation will help maintain the competitiveness of Spanish industry amid rising global energy prices. This will not only reduce costs but also help preserve jobs, which is especially important in regions where industry has traditionally played a key role.

New projects

The industrial development vector is shifting toward new sectors. Andalucía is planning the creation of two major hydrogen valleys—in Palos de la Frontera and San Roque—each potentially adding 1.5 billion euros to the regional economy. In addition, the north of Huelva province is expected to launch a large mining complex extracting zinc, lead, and copper, which could bring in another 450 million euros.

Murcia is preparing to launch a major green hydrogen plant — the Cartagena Large Electrolyzer — which could generate an additional €340 million for the region. Extremadura is becoming a hub for several innovative projects: data centers expected to generate up to €15 billion in added value, a battery cathode production facility (€800 million), and a synthetic diamond plant in Trujillo, where Leonardo DiCaprio is among the investors, with an estimated investment of €730 million.

Technologies and Regions

In Valencia, construction has already begun on a battery production plant in Sagunto, projected to contribute €10 billion to the regional economy. Zaragoza is set to host another battery facility with a potential value of €4.1 billion. Castilla–La Mancha will see the opening of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant capable of adding €4 billion, as well as data centers with a combined value of €750 million.

Madrid isn’t standing by: new data centers under construction here could bring in €930 million. But the greatest potential in this segment belongs to the Altamira project in Cantabria, estimated at €3.6 billion. Asturias is set for a renewable methanol production plant worth €250 million, while Galicia will gain a facility projected to add €190 million.

Industrial Map

Traditional industrial regions such as Catalonia and the Basque Country may miss out on major new projects this time. The main investments and innovations are increasingly shifting to the southern and western regions of the country. This could alter the balance of economic power between regions and create new hubs for high-tech manufacturing.

Overall, Spain stands on the threshold of sweeping change. If all announced projects are implemented, the country will not only gain new jobs and boost GDP, but also have a chance to become a leader in Europe’s industrial transformation. However, much will depend on how quickly stable energy supplies can be secured and a favorable climate for investors created. Time will tell whether these new industries can reshape the country’s economic landscape.",https://russpain.com/wp-content/smush-webp/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-16-180144-1-780x470.png.webp,N,,2026-01-17 11:56:39.509045

In an era where every industrial company claims to be ""green"", Clariant AG is trying something harder: rewiring the guts of global chemicals value chains rather than just polishing the ESG slide deck. The Swiss specialty chemicals group is reshaping its portfolio around high-performance, low?carbon solutions that solve a brutally practical problem for its customers: how to keep making everything from plastics and fuels to detergents and crop protection agents, while slashing emissions, waste, and regulatory risk.

Clariant AG is not a single product in the narrow, gadget sense. It is a tightly curated portfolio with three flagship business areas—Care Chemicals, Catalysis, and Adsorbents & Additives—each engineered to be less commodity, more brainpower. If you’re a refinery trying to hit new clean-fuel standards, a packaging producer under pressure to cut plastic waste, or a consumer brand racing to decarbonize your supply chain, Clariant wants to sit in the critical path.

This pivot toward performance and sustainability is more than branding. Under activist pressure and shifting market economics, Clariant has spent the past several years offloading low-margin, asset-heavy operations and doubling down on higher-return specialties. That transformation is now showing up in its product roadmap—and increasingly, in how investors read Clariant Aktie.

Inside the Flagship: Clariant AG

To understand Clariant AG as a ""product"", you have to think platform, not SKU. The company’s edge comes from translating chemistry R&D into modular solutions that can be tuned for specific industries, regulations, and performance targets. The three core units are increasingly interlinked in how customers actually experience Clariant.

Care Chemicals: Where Sustainability Becomes a Selling Point

Clariant’s Care Chemicals division is the most consumer-facing part of Clariant AG’s portfolio. It powers ingredients for personal care, home care, crop solutions, and industrial applications. The storyline here is clear: bio-based, low-ethoxylate, low-tox formulations that let downstream brands slap ""greener"" on the label without sacrificing performance.

Key pillars include:

Personal & Home Care Ingredients: Surfactants, emulsifiers, rheology modifiers, and actives developed to comply with stricter eco-labels and microplastics regulations. Clariant is investing heavily in naturally derived and renewable raw materials, designed to help brands in Europe, North America, and increasingly Asia-Pacific meet tightening rules without redesigning products from scratch.

Crop Solutions: Formulation aids and adjuvants that help agrochemical producers improve the efficiency and stability of crop protection products. With regulators restricting actives and pushing lower application rates, Clariant’s chemistry is positioned as a way to stretch the performance of existing molecules.

Industrial & Oilfield Chemicals: While more cyclical, these offerings lean on high-performance formulations for corrosion inhibition, lubrication, and process optimization. Here, the selling point is efficiency and uptime rather than pure ESG, but energy transition pressures still loom in the background.

The USP across Care Chemicals is clear: Clariant AG is aiming to be the ""formulation brain"" behind many of the world’s consumer and agro brands, turning regulatory pain into premium-margin chemistry.

Catalysis: Small Pellets, Big Decarbonization Bets

If Care Chemicals is how Clariant touches consumers, Catalysis is how it touches the energy transition. Clariant’s Catalysis segment designs and manufactures catalysts for petrochemicals, syngas, hydrogen production, and increasingly, sustainable fuels and chemical recycling.

Strategic highlights include:

Sustainable fuels and bio-based processes: Clariant has invested in catalyst systems that enable bioethanol, bio-based chemicals, and renewable fuels production. These play directly into mandates for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel, particularly in Europe and the U.S.

Hydrogen and syngas: The company offers catalysts used in steam methane reforming and related processes, and is positioning strongly for low-carbon hydrogen supply chains. As blue and turquoise hydrogen scale, optimized catalysts become a decisive lever for both efficiency and CO? intensity.

Chemical recycling: Clariant’s catalysts support depolymerization and pyrolysis processes that convert plastic waste back into feedstock. It’s an early-stage market, but one with huge regulatory and reputational tailwinds for Clariant’s customers.

In all of these areas, Clariant AG isn’t trying to build plants; it’s trying to be the indispensable, high-margin enabler that refineries, chemical companies, and recyclers can’t swap out without painful requalification.

Adsorbents & Additives: Quiet Infrastructure for Circular Materials

The Adsorbents & Additives unit is where Clariant AG gets closest to the circular economy buzzwords—without the fluff. This business provides:

Plastic additives that enhance stability, color, flame resistance, and recyclability of polymers, with a growing focus on enabling higher recycled content and longer lifecycles for plastics used in packaging, automotive, and electronics.

Purification adsorbents for edible oils, fuels, and industrial fluids, removing impurities that affect quality, safety, or regulatory compliance.

Foundry and mineral solutions that improve casting quality, process efficiency, and environmental performance in heavy industry.

This is the under-the-hood portfolio: you rarely see Clariant’s name on the final product, but the properties that regulators, OEMs, and consumers care about—recyclability, durability, safety—often ride on these additives and adsorbents.

A Portfolio Rewired Around Specialty, not Scale

Over the last few years, Clariant AG has taken significant steps to make this portfolio more coherent and more profitable. It has exited commoditized businesses like pigments and certain parts of standard performance chemicals, using disposals and joint ventures to sharpen its focus. The goal is a tighter, higher-ROCE mix driven by proprietary formulations and technical applications expertise, rather than sheer volume.

That repositioning changes how Clariant competes. Instead of fighting on cost per ton, it’s trying to win on:

Application know-how: Deep, collaborative engineering with customers—especially in Catalysis and Care Chemicals.

Sustainability credentials: Lifecycle analysis, bio-based feedstocks, and products engineered to meet or pre-empt new rules.

Global reach with regional customisation: R&D and technical centers close to growth markets, especially in Asia, where demand for both performance and sustainability is rising fast.

Market Rivals: Clariant Aktie vs. The Competition

Clariant AG doesn’t operate in a vacuum. It faces heavyweight competition across its three main domains. Compared directly to these rival ""product systems"", its strategy looks both differentiated and constrained.

Evonik Industries: Competing Portfolios in Specialty and Care

In Care Chemicals and selected specialty additives, one of Clariant’s sharpest competitors is Evonik Industries AG. Evonik’s product suite for personal care, home care, and specialty additives overlaps significantly with Clariant AG’s Care Chemicals and Adsorbents & Additives, and it is pushing its own sustainability narrative hard.

Compared directly to Evonik’s Care Solutions portfolio, Clariant AG positions itself with:

Strengths: Highly focused on bio-based and naturally derived formulations; a track record of early moves into eco-label compliant surfactants and preservatives; and strong relationships with premium and mid-tier consumer brands that need rapid formulation updates as regulations change.

Weaknesses: Evonik often has greater scale and breadth in some ingredient categories, and deeper exposure to high-value life-science applications, which can support higher long-term margins. Evonik’s diversified specialty portfolio can sometimes cushion sector-specific downturns better than Clariant’s more concentrated mix.

In additives, Evonik’s High Performance Polymers and Additives suite attacks many of the same pain points—e.g., thermal stability and durability for engineering plastics—where Clariant AG competes by pushing recyclability and circularity as added differentiators.

BASF SE: The Integrated Giant vs. the Focused Specialist

On the other flank is BASF SE, the world’s largest chemical company, with deep integration from basic chemicals to advanced specialties. BASF’s Care Chemicals and Performance Chemicals segments are a direct match-up with major parts of Clariant AG.

Compared directly to BASF’s Care Chemicals and Performance Products baskets:

Clariant’s advantages: As a more focused specialty player, Clariant can move faster in certain niches, especially where regulation and sustainability are moving targets. Its product development cycles are often more agile, and its portfolio pruning means less internal competition for capital with massive commodity units.

BASF’s advantages: BASF wields unmatched feedstock integration, cost leverage, and scale in R&D. It can bundle solutions across multiple value chain steps, making it harder for smaller customers to switch. In catalysts, BASF’s Process Catalysts unit is a formidable competitor to Clariant’s Catalysis, with a broad lineup for petrochemicals, emissions control, and energy transition applications.

In catalysis specifically, compared directly to BASF’s process catalysts for syngas, hydrogen, and emission control, Clariant AG leans on its sharper focus on renewable fuels, biomass conversion, and chemical recycling as a way to differentiate where large incumbents may be more conservative.

Solvay / Syensqo and the Battle for Advanced Materials

Clariant AG also skirts competition from players like Solvay (with its spin-off Syensqo focusing on advanced materials and specialty chemistries). While the portfolios don’t map perfectly, there is overlap in high-performance additives and polymer solutions.

Compared directly to Solvay’s advanced materials and specialty polymers offerings, Clariant AG tends to focus less on the polymer backbone and more on the tuning elements—additives and modifiers that give standard polymers new life in circular systems. Solvay may win on high-tech, aerospace-grade materials; Clariant aims to win where mainstream plastics meet real-world recycling and regulatory constraints.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Clariant AG doesn’t ""beat"" BASF or Evonik in the absolute sense; these are bigger, more diversified rivals. But in its chosen lanes, it’s building a distinct competitive edge.

1. Sustainability as an Engineering Constraint, Not a Marketing Label

In many of Clariant AG’s flagship families—whether in Care Chemicals or Catalysis—sustainability is baked in at the design stage. That means products built for:

Regulatory resilience: Formulations that pre-empt upcoming restrictions on certain chemicals of concern, microplastics, or CO? intensity, giving customers a longer compliance runway.

Lifecycle performance: Additives and catalysts engineered not just for immediate performance, but for recyclability, lower energy use, and reduced waste over the product lifecycle.

Where some competitors retrofit existing chemistries with sustainability narratives, Clariant AG is increasingly building its portfolio with sustainability as a non-negotiable design requirement. For customers, that translates into fewer reformulations, fewer supply disruptions, and a clearer ESG story.

2. Focused Portfolio = Sharper Capital Allocation

By exiting commoditized or structurally low-margin businesses, Clariant AG has freed capital and management bandwidth for specialties with better pricing power. That shows up in three ways:

Higher R&D intensity in targeted niches, especially in renewable fuels catalysts, circular plastics additives, and bio-based surfactants.

More disciplined M&A, with bolt-on deals aimed at deepening technology or market access in specific growth pockets, rather than broad diversification plays.

Clearer narrative to customers and investors, who increasingly understand Clariant as a focused specialty player rather than a sprawling chemicals conglomerate.

3. Co-development and Technical Support as Stickiness Engines

In catalysis and high-performance additives, switching costs are real—and Clariant knows it. Its technical service and co-development model creates sticky relationships: once a refinery, polymer converter, or consumer brand co-designs a process around Clariant’s technology, the appetite to switch purely for a small price difference is low.

Compared to giants like BASF, Clariant AG can sometimes be a more nimble development partner, especially for mid-sized customers that want top-tier technical support without being a rounding error in a mega-portfolio.

4. Leveraging Megatrends: Energy Transition and Circular Plastics

Clariant AG’s portfolio lines up squarely with two of the strongest structural drivers in chemicals:

Energy transition: Through its Catalysis segment, it is embedded in hydrogen, sustainable fuels, and lower-carbon petrochemicals—areas where volumes might be volatile, but value per ton of catalyst is high.

Circular materials and eco-design: Through Adsorbents & Additives and Care Chemicals, it plays at the interface where plastics, packaging, and consumer products need to reconcile performance with recyclability and environmental pressure.

That doesn’t immunize Clariant from cycles, but it does anchor the growth story in themes that are likely to outlast individual economic downturns.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

For investors watching Clariant Aktie (ISIN CH0012142631), the transformation of Clariant AG’s product and business mix is central to the equity story. The stock reflects not just quarterly demand for catalysts or additives, but a more structural bet on whether this portfolio can consistently command specialty-level margins.

The company’s shift from bulk and standard chemicals toward higher-value specialties has several implications for valuation:

Margin profile: Specialty-dominated portfolios typically trade at higher earnings multiples than commodity chemicals, assuming execution is credible. Clariant’s growing exposure to high-margin catalysts and differentiated additives is a core reason investors track its product roadmap so closely.

Cyclicality: While Clariant AG remains exposed to industrial and energy cycles—refinery investments, consumer demand, construction, automotive—it is less tied to pure volume swings in basic chemicals. That can justify a smoother earnings profile over time, a key consideration for institutional investors.

ESG and capital flows: Many sustainability-focused funds and mandates are shifting capital away from pure commodity chemicals and toward companies that enable decarbonization and circularity. Clariant’s positioning in sustainable fuels catalysts, chemical recycling, and bio-based ingredients increases its relevance to this investor base.

At the same time, execution risk is real. Underperformance in major catalyst projects, slower-than-expected adoption of chemical recycling, or setbacks in regulatory-driven demand for greener ingredients could weigh on growth expectations and, by extension, on Clariant Aktie. Competitive pressure from integrated rivals like BASF or innovation-centric peers like Evonik adds another layer of risk.

For now, the trajectory of Clariant AG’s product strategy is clear: fewer commodities, more brains; fewer tons, more value per ton. As that mix deepens, the stock increasingly trades not just on volume and cost, but on how convincingly Clariant can claim a premium spot in the global specialty chemicals hierarchy.

In that sense, Clariant AG is more than a portfolio of molecules. It is a live experiment in whether a mid-sized European chemicals player can reinvent itself as a critical enabler of the low?carbon, circular economy—and be paid accordingly in both margins and market capitalization.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404993_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 10:57:40.353481

The number of operational sugar mills has also risen to 518, compared with 500 at the same stage a year ago, reflecting steady crushing progress across major producing states.
Uttar Pradesh has produced 46.05 lakh tonnes, around 8% higher than last year, while Karnataka has reported a 13% rise in output so far this season.
Recent increases in sugarcane prices by several state governments have widened the gap between input costs and sugar realisations.
ISMA has proposed comprehensive GST rationalisation across the biofuels and clean mobility ecosystem, including sharp cuts in GST on flex-fuel vehicles, strong hybrid electric vehicles, higher ethanol blends such as E85 and E100, ethanol production machinery, and ethanol-based cookstoves.","With India’s sugar production recording a sharp increase in the ongoing 2025-26 season, the Indian Sugar and Bio-energy Manufacturers Association (ISMA) has called on the government to use the Union Budget 2026-27 to push tax rationalisation and policy support for biofuels and clean mobility, while also addressing rising financial stress in the sugar sector.

As of January 15, 2026, all-India sugar production has reached 159.09 lakh tonnes, nearly 22% higher than the 130.44 lakh tonnes produced during the same period last year. The number of operational sugar mills has also risen to 518, compared with 500 at the same stage a year ago, reflecting steady crushing progress across major producing states.

Maharashtra has emerged as the strongest performer, with sugar production at 64.50 lakh tonnes, marking a 51% year-on-year increase, supported by higher crushing rates and an increase in the number of operating mills. Uttar Pradesh has produced 46.05 lakh tonnes, around 8% higher than last year, while Karnataka has reported a 13% rise in output so far this season.

Despite the robust production trend, ISMA cautioned that mill finances are under growing pressure. Recent increases in sugarcane prices by several state governments have widened the gap between input costs and sugar realisations. Ex-mill sugar prices in key producing states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka have slipped to around ₹3,550 per quintal, significantly below the current cost of production. As inventories build up, the industry fears a rise in cane payment arrears unless corrective policy measures are taken.

In this context, ISMA has renewed its demand for an early revision of the Minimum Selling Price (MSP) of sugar, arguing that a cost-aligned MSP is critical to restoring financial viability, ensuring timely cane payments to farmers, and maintaining market stability — without adding to the government’s fiscal burden.

Alongside immediate market concerns, the association is pushing for longer-term structural reforms through the upcoming Union Budget. ISMA has proposed comprehensive GST rationalisation across the biofuels and clean mobility ecosystem, including sharp cuts in GST on flex-fuel vehicles, strong hybrid electric vehicles, higher ethanol blends such as E85 and E100, ethanol production machinery, and ethanol-based cookstoves.

The industry body has also sought targeted financial support for advanced biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green bio-hydrogen, compressed biogas (CBG) and isobutanol blending with diesel, while proposing the transformation of sugar mills into integrated bio-energy hubs producing ethanol, gas, hydrogen and green power.

ISMA argues that with surplus ethanol capacity, established production infrastructure and technologies already validated in India, biofuels offer an immediate pathway to reduce emissions, cut fuel imports and stabilise rural incomes. As Budget 2026-27 approaches, the sugar industry is looking to the government to balance short-term relief with long-term clean energy policy support to ensure that a strong production season does not translate into financial stress for mills and farmers.",https://i0.wp.com/a2ztaxcorp.net/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sugar-industry-seeks-GST-relief-on-biofuels-as-sugar-output-jumps-22-this-season.jpg,N,,2026-01-17 11:56:50.088587

Many hydrogen projects, too, are “grey”, with hydrogen generated from methane, which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
Hokkaido, however, is home to multiple “green” hydrogen projects – with the gas produced entirely through clean energy sources.
“For 10 years from fiscal 2014, Japan CCS conducted a survey of potential storage sites offshore from Japan,” Mr Sawada said.
Still, despite the progress of Hokkaido’s green efforts, stakeholders admit to challenges.","– Many would think of whisky or fresh milk when it comes to Hokkaido-made beverages.

Add wine to the list. Mr Takahiko Soga’s pinot noirs, meticulously crafted in the terroir of Yoichi that is better known as the home of Nikka Whisky, have achieved cult status among connoisseurs.

The limited-production wines are so popular that one bottle of Domaine Takahiko wine can command thousands of dollars in Michelin-starred restaurants worldwide. The annual harvest in October draws an international pilgrimage of oenologists and sommeliers eager to volunteer on his 4ha field.

The 52-year-old is not native to

Hokkaido’s burgeoning wine country

. Born into a wine-making family near Nozawa Onsen in mountainous Nagano prefecture, Mr Soga packed his bags for Yoichi in 2009 with nothing but conviction that the town’s potential for high-end wines will only grow as climate change pushed the so-called “wine belt” northwards.

“I took a gamble, and in a sense, I won,” he gamely said.

His wager has paid off spectacularly as a pioneering vintner in Hokkaido, where the number of wineries has tripled to 73 in the decade to May 2025. One in four of them is located in Yoichi, the rapid expansion being a direct consequence of climate change creating surprisingly favourable viticultural conditions.

This is part of the changing face of Hokkaido caused by global warming, altering the types of produce from the island and also affecting the seasons, with more instances of extreme weather events like intense “guerilla rainstorms”, as the Japanese call it, and droughts, especially during summer. Hokkaido endured

an exceptionally brutal summer in 2025

, with the mercury 3.7 deg C higher than average.

And that is where Mr Soga’s ebullience has given way to concerns that the drastic temperature fluctuations have impacted the quality of his wines. In 2025, he took out a loan to construct a barrel cellar to ensure wine can be stored in cooler conditions.

The Straits Times visited Hokkaido twice in late 2025 to observe the impact of climate change on what has traditionally been Japan’s breadbasket.

Salmon and scallops

Warmer climes are starting to leave an indelible impact on the prefecture’s prized agriculture and fisheries industry, which means the food it produces and exports are changing even as experts are racing against time to protect farming livelihoods by creating heat- and pest-resistant cultivars.

Aquaculture, meanwhile, has become more important to mitigate the effect of warmer seas on wild fishing.

And as seasons start to change, there is a clear risk to its hospitality industry. Hokkaido, often associated with cooler summers, has suffered sweltering summers with the mercury surging to 39 deg C in the eastern city of Kitami in 2025. Warmer winters, too, would threaten the volume and quality of snow that winter sports enthusiasts flock to the island for.

Warmer temperatures could also well trigger more intense blizzards that can cause travel chaos, like

the one in December 2025

.

While it is now more conducive to grow crops such as wine grapes, rice and eggplants, the quality of other produce like potatoes, onions and beans has been affected by warmer weather.

Tropical and subtropical marine species like amberjack and puffer fish are now being caught in the warmer waters off Hokkaido.

Meanwhile, catches for seafood like mackerel and squid are declining, as are those for salmon, for which the 2025 autumn catch was its worst on record at 5.6 million, down 64.1 per cent from a year ago, according to prefecture figures on Jan 13. Salmon prices on the market are now 1.5 times of previous years’.

Production of Hokkaido’s famous scallops, while previously stable with moderate fluctuations, is likely to decline 17 per cent to 336,000 tonnes for the year ending March 2026, according to Hokkaido Fisheries Association forecasts.

These changes matter not just to Japan’s food security, but also the island’s global image. Food is one of the things that make Hokkaido popular among Japanese and the 2.83 million international visitors it saw in 2024.

There are other changes at work. Global warming is also an engine of reinvention, giving impetus for the prefecture of five million people to establish itself as a dynamo for clean energy.

Hokkaido’s vast untouched expanses and favourable climate conditions have resulted in renewable energy comprising 40.4 per cent of the prefecture’s energy mix, outpacing the 26 per cent nationwide.

This would not translate into any direct impact for visitors to Hokkaido today, beyond how they will notice more wind and solar farms and batteries for electricity storage as they travel from New Chitose Airport to destinations like Niseko, Biei or Asahikawa.

But this is a statement of how Hokkaido sees its responsibility towards protecting its rich natural environment. Only by taking steps towards carbon neutrality can irreversible changes to the climate be prevented, thus ensuring that in the long run, generations of future visitors will still be able to continue enjoying its powder snow in winter and excellent produce.

And Hokkaido believes it has the potential to boost Japan’s overall woeful energy self-sufficiency rate of 15.2 per cent.

“I believe that Japan cannot achieve carbon neutrality without the success of Hokkaido’s clean-energy projects,” averred Ms Kaori Nishiyama, Sapporo’s director-general of green transformation (GX) promotion.

GX is how Japan describes its key policy to reform its economy and social systems to achieve decarbonisation and economic growth simultaneously.

“Hokkaido ranks first among Japan’s 47 prefectures for its wind, solar, hydropower energy generation, and second for geothermal,” she said, adding that there are plans to build power transmission lines that will allow Hokkaido to directly share power with the Tokyo Metropolitan Region.

Mr Sean Kidney, chief executive of non-government organisation Climate Bonds Initiative that aims to mobilise global capital for green projects, said: “The challenge for Japan is whether it can transition and phase out fossil fuels fast enough, and Hokkaido is central to this as the powerhouse of energy security going forward.”

He added: “There’s no technological barrier; there’s no pricing barrier. The barrier is policy in Japan.”

Dual ambitions

Hokkaido’s aspirations to be a clean energy powerhouse dovetail with its ambition to be Japan’s digital economy hub.

It hosts a semiconductor foundry and is actively wooing data centres, both of which are notorious for their huge appetites for energy.

Mr Yasumitsu Okazaki of the next generation energy department at Hokkaido Electric Power Company (HEPCO) said: “The power demand in Hokkaido had been expected to gradually decrease (due to its declining population), but now everyone is staking their expectations on its renewable energy potential as the energy demand is forecast to rise 1.5 times by 2040.”

But stakeholders believe Hokkaido can meet rising energy needs in a green way, given its rich potential for renewable energy. The cooler temperatures, relative to elsewhere in Japan, also make it more energy- and cost-efficient to host semiconductor foundries and data centres.

The city of Chitose is home to Rapidus, the government-backed chipmaker that hopes to mass-produce advanced 2 nanometre (nm) semiconductors by 2027 and, subsequently, 1.4nm and 1nm chips. This would put it on a par with other global manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company), Samsung and Intel.

Hokkaido also aims to add to the 45 data centres spread out across the prefecture as at June 2025.

One facility in the coastal city of Ishikari, 15km from Sapporo, has trail-blazing potential for being Japan’s first zero-emission data centre.

Managed by Kyocera Communication Systems, the site that opened in October 2024 is powered entirely by a nearby commercial offshore wind farm, as well as the company’s own solar panels and batteries.

Site manager Tetsu Ogata said: “We combine the two fluctuating renewable energy sources to cover our needs, and when this is insufficient, we have storage batteries that can fill the gap.”

He added: “This is the first 24/7 carbon-free energy consumption data centre in Japan, and while it’s still very gradual right now, I think this will become a long-term trend as more data centres are built.”

Japanese tech and investment giant Softbank, meanwhile, has announced that its new Tomakomai AI Data Centre, which will open by March 2027, will likewise be fully powered by renewable energy.

‘Shaking’ things up

All this would arguably be more difficult if there were no national backing for Hokkaido and Sapporo to establish a clear niche for themselves.

Japan is targeting 150 trillion yen (S$1.22 trillion) in public-private GX investment over 10 years from 2023, of which at least 40 trillion yen is earmarked for Hokkaido.

That led to the formation of the Team Sapporo-Hokkaido (TSH) consortium in June 2023, comprising 21 institutions from industry, academia, government and finance.

The consortium identified eight key areas of focus: offshore wind, next-generation semiconductors, data centres, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), battery storage, submarine DC power lines, and cargo ships transporting renewable energy batteries and hydrogen.

Subsequently in June 2024, Japan designated Hokkaido and Sapporo jointly as a “national strategic special zone” for financial and asset management businesses with a GX focus, offering deregulation, tax incentives and streamlined support.

The Sapporo Transnational Expansion and Partnership has since fielded inquiries from more than 200 overseas companies looking to expand into Hokkaido.

To further woo institutional investors and channel capital into sustainable projects, the Hokkaido ESG Pro Bond Market was launched at the Sapporo Securities Exchange in September 2025 as Japan’s first sustainability bond market.

And set to be launched in February 2026 is the SPARX Sapporo-Hokkaido GX Fund, a public-private investment vehicle managed by asset management company SPARX Group, with an ultimate goal of reaching 10 billion yen for start-ups and new innovations.

There is also growing excitement in Hokkaido’s start-up ecosystem. Hokkaido University has been going big on environmental research, with ongoing projects such as the development of a direct air capture coating that can transform concrete into a carbon dioxide absorber, with commercialisation planned for 2026.

The incubator Startup Hokkaido is now supporting nearly 200 start-ups, mainly in the fields of agriculture, space and energy. Come February 2026, it will host its first global start-up accelerator event, SHAKE-H, a pun on the prefecture’s ambitions to “shake things up” with salmon (sha-ke), the famous seafood catch.

A green future

Japan is staking its decarbonised future on nuclear energy, as it fires up atomic plants that were mothballed after the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima. One of the seven reactors at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant – the world’s largest – will be restarted on Jan 20.

Tomari Nuclear Power Plant, which has three reactors, is Hokkaido’s only nuclear facility. Unit 3 was on Dec 10 given the green light to restart by Governor Naomichi Suzuki.

While Japan’s largest prefecture has plenty of space to host more nuclear plants, Hokkaido sees other clean energy sources as playing a far larger role – even if they have run into problems elsewhere.

The island now leads Japan in solar power generation, although mega-solar projects have caused a backlash, given their negative impact on wildlife ecosystems and their destruction of pristine scenery. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s government has said it will end subsidies for such projects, and instead boost incentives for next-generation solar cells and rooftop solar systems.

While one of the projects that has attracted criticism is a development near the Kushiro Wetlands in eastern Hokkaido, Sapporo’s GX chief, Ms Nishiyama, believes in the need to separate the wheat from the chaff.

The Team Sapporo-Hokkaido consortium, she said, does not back such mega solar projects that are deemed to harm the environment, instead only supporting projects with proper environmental impact assessments and which have won local understanding.

Hokkaido also leads Japan in wind power generation, although this has been no small feat.

At Ishikari Bay New Port Offshore Wind Farm, which began operations in January 2024, 14 turbines produce enough electricity to theoretically power 83,000 households. On site are 240 storage batteries to mitigate intermittency.

The plant counts among its clients Kyocera Communication Systems’ zero-emission data centre in the city.

Ms Kumi Sakaida of Green Power Investment Corporation, which oversees the farm, said it took 17 years for the Hokkaido farm to come to fruition, as it had to conduct feasibility tests, overcome regulatory hurdles and woo investors, among other things.

But she said the efforts had been worthwhile. She declined to comment on whether the farm has turned a profit, citing confidentiality.

Yet Green Power’s achievement belies headwinds surrounding wind power after Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp pulled out of three planned projects off the coasts of Chiba and Akita prefectures due to swelling material and labour costs. The retreat prompted the government to look at ways, such as subsidies, to help ensure that offshore wind power operators can avoid massive losses.

Ms Sakaida argued that it was necessary to bite the bullet and seek ways to overcome challenges. She said: “Even if there are headwinds, I believe we should make efforts to introduce renewable energy by facing matters outside our control head-on and overcoming them.”

Hydrogen strategy

In 2017, Japan formulated the world’s first national hydrogen strategy. But the country has not made much commercial progress on this front, given the universal criticisms that the gas is too expensive to produce and too difficult to store and transport.

Many hydrogen projects, too, are “grey”, with hydrogen generated from methane, which releases significant amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Hokkaido, however, is home to multiple “green” hydrogen projects – with the gas produced entirely through clean energy sources.

Japanese industrial gas company AirWater opened a hydrogen refuelling station in the centre of Sapporo in April 2025, which can accommodate large commercial fuel cell vehicles like buses and trucks.

It has a stake in a “hydrogen farm” in the town of Shikaoi, where there are about 100 dairy farms that raise 21,000 dairy cows. The farm converts livestock manure into biogas and then hydrogen, with the residual heat generated in the process used to raise sturgeon and even grow mangoes in winter.

In a separate project, HEPCO runs a 1MW electrolysis facility as a demonstration project to create hydrogen from water using renewable energy. The company intends to scale up and build a 100MW plant that would be the largest in Japan.

And SPARX Green Energy and Technology, a subsidiary of SPARX Group, uses a mix of solar power and biogas generated from a nearby waste disposal facility for round-the-clock hydrogen production in Tomakomai.

It supplies the power to a nearby municipal hot spring, and chemical factories, and to heat gyms and showers at Toyota Motor’s Hokkaido factory.

“We are building a supply chain for production, transportation and use, and we are working to strengthen the cost competitiveness of hydrogen,” said Mr Masaya Kobayashi, vice-president of business development at SPARX Green Energy and Technology.

Current production is relatively low, enough to power about 300 households. But he added: “We’d like to transport hydrogen more often, and our operating rate is still below 50 per cent because it’s still a demonstration.”

Tomakomai is also home to an offshore carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration project, which is Japan’s first such sizeable showcase of a technology regarded by some as critical for carbon neutrality.

The site is managed by Japan CCS, which was set up in 2008 to conduct trial projects for the government. It captured 300,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide generated from an adjacent oil refinery and injected the gas to be permanently stored in geological formations deep beneath the seabed.

“After storage, the gas eventually mineralises,” said corporate adviser Yoshihiro Sawada.

Such injections were conducted between April 2016 and November 2019, with the company still monitoring for anomalies. None has been found so far.

Elsewhere, the company is involved in trials to transport carbon dioxide by ship, as it tries to identify the best conditions for liquefaction, storage and transportation to achieve larger volumes and lower costs.

“For 10 years from fiscal 2014, Japan CCS conducted a survey of potential storage sites offshore from Japan,” Mr Sawada said. “It was estimated that suitable geological formations for carbon dioxide storage exist at 11 locations, with a total capacity of 16 billion tonnes.”

Among these was a Tomakomai site, which can accommodate the injection of 1.5 million to two million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, and has been earmarked by the Japanese government for a commercialised CCS project.

Still, despite the progress of Hokkaido’s green efforts, stakeholders admit to challenges.

Ms Nishiyama noted that Hokkaido’s weakness is its hitherto lack of large manufacturing industries, which had meant less demand for electricity than other industrial areas.

“We are just at the starting line as compared with other regions around the world,” she said, noting that generating positive momentum was critical for the success of Hokkaido’s GX ambitions.

Mr Hideki Takada, director of the Finance Ministry-affiliated GX Acceleration Agency, is so convinced of Hokkaido’s potential that he made nine trips there in 14 months.

But he was concerned by global trends. He said: “Every day there is negative news somewhere in the world about decarbonisation and sustainable finance, or political backlash against sustainability, or some sort of regulatory fatigue. And then there are rising prices, all of which are making GX projects harder.”

Living with nature

Yet the impact of climate change is increasingly being felt – never as a linear, steady rise in warming but an increase in variability with more frequent and intense episodes of heatwaves, downpours, droughts and other extreme weather events.

“If the temperature rises steadily and in a predictable way, we can somehow adapt. Rather, the variations are getting worse,” said Dr Eiji Goto of the Hokkaido Research Organisation’s Central Agricultural Experiment Station.

He added that his agency was urgently trying to grow cultivars that are resistant to crops and heat, while maintaining quality and yield.

Mr Soga of Domaine Takahiko cannot help but wonder if things will get worse for him.

While Yoichi has gained a reputation for its pinot noirs, newcomers are instead growing grapes for chardonnays and merlots, which can thrive in warmer climates, Mr Soga said.

He has focused solely on producing the best quality pinot noir he can, knowing that diversifying would be too challenging for a small business like his, which makes only 25,000 bottles a year.

“Even if I decide to switch varieties, it is not as if everything can change overnight. Grapevines take three or four years to bear a good harvest,” Mr Soga said, adding that he hopes to learn how other wine-producing regions afflicted with climate change have adapted.

The father of three children aged 15, 12 and six, mused: “No one knows what the future holds. Everyone has to face nature, so it’s important to use intuition – in Japanese, we call it sensitivity – when working with the environment. And this is something that must be passed on to the next generation.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/a3a52cba0f307588f1b4db8a00efff819304ae7ca1ce8e2c6937702423462675,N,,2026-01-17 08:57:07.369512

• Washington State University Tri-Cities is leading a multi-million dollar regional initiative backed by $20 million in combined state funding and private investment to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel development

• The university's Sustainable Options in Aviation Research lab positions the region as a national leader in developing ""drop-in"" fuels that work with existing aircraft, addressing a major industry challenge

• While sustainable aviation fuel adoption is growing rapidly, it still represents less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage, creating massive opportunities for the Tri-Cities research hub

RICHLAND, Wash. — Washington State University Tri-Cities has emerged as a central player in a multi-million-dollar statewide effort to expand sustainable aviation fuel production, positioning the region at the forefront of a global industry transformation that could reshape aviation's environmental impact.

The university serves as a lead research partner in the newly launched Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, supported by $10 million in state funding and matched by $10 million from an anonymous private donor. The program represents Washington's major step toward reducing aviation emissions while maintaining current flight operations.

WSU Tri-Cities' Sustainable Options in Aviation Research lab, known as SOAR, positions the region as a national leader in developing sustainable aviation fuels. The lab leverages partnerships with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and local agriculture to create a bio-based energy hub that attracts tech talent and supports Washington's clean energy goals.

The initiative builds on earlier state investment, including $6.5 million allocated by the Washington State Legislature in the 2023-2025 Transportation Budget to establish a sustainable aviation fuel Research & Development Center at Snohomish County's Paine Field. Federal support has also bolstered the effort, with the Federal Aviation Administration awarding $38 million in 2024 to four Washington projects, including efforts involving WSU's partners, funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.

The accelerator was unveiled earlier this month at Boeing's Future of Flight facility in Everett, bringing together state leaders, industry partners, and researchers from around the world. WSU Tri-Cities faculty attended the event, showcasing the testing and analysis conducted in the Tri-Cities.

At the heart of the university's contribution is the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, which operates as one of the most comprehensive SAF testing facilities in the United States. The lab has evaluated nearly 500 fuel samples from North America, Europe and Asia, focusing particularly on converting agricultural waste into fuel.

The collaboration with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory creates powerful synergy, combining WSU's expertise in biotechnology with PNNL's strengths in catalysis and thermal processing for bio-based fuels. This partnership drives economic development by fostering high-tech manufacturing jobs and boosting the competitiveness of the Northwest's agriculture and forestry industries by finding value in waste streams.

""We play a critical role in facilitating companies that, as they go through that scaling process from really low volumes to commercial gallons of millions and billions, that their process remains consistent and aligns with the expectations of airlines and airframers,"" said Josh Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab.

The facility focuses on ensuring new fuels can perform safely under real-world flight conditions, with researchers leading efforts in testing, finishing, and scaling SAF production. The work directly supports other state initiatives, such as the SAF Center at Paine Field, by providing the testing and validation needed for commercial-scale blending and scaling.

""Most of our tests revolve around safety, safety first, safety last, safety everywhere in between,"" Heyne said. ""These test results, normally, are shared directly with producers. We are under material transfer agreements, NDAs. Those institutions that we conduct the testing for, then take that information and maybe tweak their process or have the confidence to move forward.""

The research focuses heavily on developing ""drop-in"" fuel innovation, particularly lignin-based fuels and other processes that aim to create 100% SAF fully compatible with existing aircraft. This addresses a major industry challenge and advances Washington's clean energy leadership by developing cost-effective, low-impact production methods.

The initiative operates on an ambitious timeline, with major production expected to ramp up around 2030 for regional goals. Industry partners like SkyNRG are targeting 50 million gallons per year, while the broader Cascadia region aims to reach a billion-gallon goal by 2035. National targets call for 3 billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to be produced by 2030.

The work comes at a critical time for the aviation industry. While sustainable aviation fuel adoption is growing rapidly—production doubled in 2023 and over 50 airlines now use SAF—it still represents less than 0.1% of total jet fuel usage, according to industry analysts. This creates massive opportunities for research facilities like those at WSU Tri-Cities.

Major carriers like Delta, United, and Lufthansa have pledged to use substantial amounts of SAF, recognizing its potential to reduce emissions by up to 65%. However, airlines face significant challenges, including high costs—often two to four times conventional fuel—and limited supply.

Sustainable aviation fuel is produced from renewable sources such as agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and other organic materials. Unlike traditional jet fuel derived from petroleum, SAF can reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle while requiring no modifications to existing aircraft engines or fuel infrastructure.

Key obstacles to widespread adoption include high production costs, insufficient feedstock availability, and the need for robust global policies to drive investment and scale production. Industry experts from McKinsey & Company and the International Air Transport Association say SAF represents the most viable path to achieve net-zero aviation by 2050.

The development promises substantial economic benefits for the Tri-Cities region. University leaders say the sustainable aviation fuel initiative will generate high-skill jobs in research, engineering, and production, attract millions in research funding, and bring global attention to the area. The program positions the region as a key hub in the emerging clean energy aviation sector.

As part of the accelerator program, WSU Tri-Cities is partnering with others to establish a new sustainable aviation fuel research and development center at Paine Field. The facility will include the world's first global SAF fuel repository, or ""fuel bank,"" which will store and test experimental fuels from around the world.

The researchers are particularly focused on testing new lignin-based fuels and on creating a comprehensive testing nexus to serve the global aviation industry. Key milestones include a 2023 business plan for the R&D center and ongoing work to meet national production targets.

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator represents a coordinated effort to address climate concerns in the aviation industry while maintaining the economic viability of air travel. The program leverages Washington's existing aerospace industry expertise and research capabilities to advance sustainable fuel technologies.

The initiative comes as the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact. Traditional jet fuel contributes significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, making sustainable alternatives a priority for airlines, manufacturers, and regulators worldwide. The slow but steady rise in SAF adoption signifies the aviation industry's serious commitment to sustainability, moving beyond carbon offsetting to tangible fuel changes.

WSU Tri-Cities' involvement in the program builds on the university's established reputation in energy research and its strategic location in a region known for scientific innovation. The collaboration connects local research capabilities with global industry needs, creating opportunities for both technological advancement and economic development in the emerging clean energy economy.

Dekarbonisasi kini semakin sering dipresentasikan sebagai agenda global yang seragam dan mendesak. berbagai negara didorong menurunkan emisi secepat mungkin, dengan asumsi bahwa satu jalur kebijakan dapat diterapkan di semua konteks pembangunan.

Dalam narasi ini, pengurangan emisi ditempatkan sebagai tujuan utama, sementara industrialisasi, penciptaan lapangan kerja, dan pertumbuhan ekonomi kerap diperlakukan sebagai variabel penyesuaian. Pendekatan semacam ini menyimpan persoalan serius bagi negara berkembang. Tanpa desain kebijakan yang cermat, dekarbonisasi justru berisiko mendorong deindustrialisasi dini.

Bagi negara berkembang, industri bukan sekadar sektor ekonomi tambahan. Industri adalah fondasi transformasi struktural, sumber utama nilai tambah, serta penyerap tenaga kerja dalam skala besar. Melalui industrialisasi, produktivitas meningkat, basis pajak diperluas, dan ketahanan sosial diperkuat.

Mengorbankan industri demi target dekarbonisasi yang tidak kontekstual berarti melemahkan kemampuan negara untuk tumbuh dan meningkatkan kesejahteraan. Karena itu, tantangan kebijakan publik sesungguhnya bukan memilih antara dekarbonisasi atau industrialisasi, melainkan memastikan keduanya berjalan simultan dan saling memperkuat.

Pengalaman negara maju sering dijadikan rujukan dalam perumusan kebijakan iklim, padahal konteksnya sangat berbeda. Negara-negara maju tersebut melakukan dekarbonisasi setelah basis industrialisasi mereka matang, dengan infrastruktur, teknologi, dan kapasitas fiskal yang kuat.

Mereka memiliki ruang untuk mengalihkan sumber daya ke teknologi bersih tanpa mengorbankan kapasitas produksi. Sebaliknya, negara berkembang masih menghadapi pertumbuhan kebutuhan energi, struktur industri yang belum mapan, serta keterbatasan fiskal. Dalam kondisi ini, dekarbonisasi yang tidak mempertimbangkan kebutuhan industri berisiko memperlambat pertumbuhan dan memperdalam ketimpangan.

Pelajaran penting datang dari sejumlah negara berkembang yang berhasil mengelola transisi secara lebih seimbang. China, India, dan Vietnam tidak menunda industrialisasi demi mengejar target emisi jangka pendek.

Mereka justru memanfaatkan transisi energi untuk memperkuat basis manufaktur domestik, membangun rantai pasok teknologi, dan meningkatkan daya saing industri. Penurunan emisi dilakukan bertahap melalui peningkatan efisiensi, modernisasi teknologi, dan perubahan bauran energi, bukan dengan menutup kapasitas industri secara prematur.

Kesalahan umum dalam kebijakan iklim adalah memandang emisi semata sebagai persoalan sektor energi. Dalam realitas negara berkembang, emisi sangat terkait dengan struktur industri dan pola pembangunan.

Industri semen, baja, pupuk, petrokimia, dan pengolahan mineral merupakan tulang punggung industrialisasi sekaligus kontributor emisi utama. Menurunkan emisi dari sektor sektor ini membutuhkan investasi besar, teknologi baru, serta waktu adaptasi yang panjang. Pendekatan berbasis larangan atau pembatasan administratif sering kali menimbulkan dampak ekonomi signifikan tanpa penurunan emisi global yang berarti.

Dekarbonisasi tanpa deindustrialisasi menuntut pendekatan yang menekankan efisiensi energi, modernisasi proses produksi, dan substitusi teknologi secara bertahap. Banyak negara berkembang menggunakan gas alam sebagai jembatan transisi untuk menurunkan intensitas emisi industri sebelum teknologi rendah karbon yang lebih maju menjadi layak secara ekonomi. Pendekatan ini bukan penyangkalan terhadap agenda iklim, melainkan strategi transisi yang realistis dan berbasis sistem.

Kebijakan publik juga harus mengakui bahwa biaya dekarbonisasi tidak terdistribusi secara merata. Industri di negara berkembang menghadapi biaya modal lebih tinggi, keterbatasan akses teknologi, dan risiko pasar yang lebih besar dibandingkan negara maju.

Jika standar emisi ketat diterapkan tanpa dukungan kebijakan yang memadai, hasilnya bukan penurunan emisi global, melainkan relokasi industri atau penyusutan kapasitas produksi domestik. Dalam kedua skenario tersebut, negara berkembang menanggung kerugian ekonomi dan sosial, sementara emisi global tidak banyak berubah.

Pelajaran lain yang tak kalah penting adalah perlunya integrasi kebijakan iklim, energi, dan industri. Dekarbonisasi tidak dapat dilepaskan dari ketersediaan energi yang andal dan terjangkau. Industri membutuhkan kepastian pasokan untuk berinvestasi dan berkembang.

Transisi energi harus dirancang untuk mendukung kebutuhan industri, bukan membebani atau menghambatnya. Energi terbarukan memiliki peran strategis, tetapi efektivitasnya sangat bergantung pada kekuatan dan fleksibilitas sistem kelistrikan.

Pengalaman berbagai negara menunjukkan bahwa dekarbonisasi yang dipaksakan tanpa kesiapan sistem kerap melahirkan kontradiksi kebijakan. Target emisi ditetapkan secara ambisius, namun ketergantungan pada energi fosil tetap tinggi demi menjaga pasokan listrik dan aktivitas industri.

Ketidakkonsistenan ini menciptakan ketidakpastian kebijakan dan menghambat investasi. Negara berkembang yang relatif berhasil adalah mereka yang jujur terhadap keterbatasan sistem dan merancang peta jalan transisi yang kredibel serta bertahap.

Dimensi ketenagakerjaan juga tidak bisa diabaikan. Industri manufaktur dan pengolahan menyerap jutaan tenaga kerja dengan keterampilan menengah. Dekarbonisasi yang mengabaikan dampak ketenagakerjaan berisiko menciptakan pengangguran struktural dan resistensi sosial.

Karena itu, kebijakan transisi harus mencakup peningkatan keterampilan, diversifikasi industri, dan penciptaan lapangan kerja baru yang realistis. Transisi yang adil bukan sekadar narasi, melainkan prasyarat keberlanjutan kebijakan.

Dalam konteks global, negara berkembang menghadapi tantangan keadilan. Banyak negara maju mendorong standar iklim ketat dan mekanisme penyesuaian karbon lintas batas, meski jejak emisi historis mereka jauh lebih besar.

Jika dekarbonisasi dijadikan syarat akses pasar atau pembiayaan tanpa mempertimbangkan perbedaan tahap pembangunan, tekanan tambahan justru jatuh pada industri negara berkembang. Pengalaman forum internasional menunjukkan bahwa transisi berkelanjutan membutuhkan pembagian beban yang adil serta dukungan nyata terhadap transformasi industri.

Indonesia berada pada posisi yang sangat relevan dalam diskursus ini. Di satu sisi, Indonesia mendorong industrialisasi berbasis sumber daya melalui hilirisasi dan penguatan manufaktur. Di sisi lain, komitmen terhadap target iklim jangka panjang terus ditegaskan.

Tantangan kebijakan publik adalah memastikan kedua agenda ini saling menguatkan. Dekarbonisasi harus diposisikan sebagai sarana meningkatkan efisiensi, daya saing, dan ketahanan industri, bukan sebagai pembatas pertumbuhan.

Pelajaran dari negara berkembang menunjukkan bahwa urutan kebijakan sangat menentukan. Investasi pada efisiensi energi, modernisasi industri, dan pengembangan teknologi domestik perlu didahulukan sebelum pembatasan emisi yang ketat diterapkan. Pendekatan ini memberi ruang bagi industri untuk beradaptasi, berinovasi, dan menyerap teknologi baru tanpa kehilangan daya saing, sehingga penurunan emisi berjalan seiring dengan peningkatan produktivitas.

Pada akhirnya, dekarbonisasi tanpa deindustrialisasi bukanlah kompromi lemah, melainkan strategi pembangunan yang rasional dan berimbang. Pendekatan ini mengakui urgensi krisis iklim sekaligus menghormati realitas pembangunan negara berkembang. Dengan kebijakan iklim yang terintegrasi dengan agenda energi dan industri, penurunan emisi dapat dicapai tanpa mengorbankan penciptaan nilai tambah dan lapangan kerja.

Dalam dunia yang semakin menuntut aksi iklim, keberhasilan tidak diukur dari seberapa cepat emisi turun di atas kertas, melainkan dari seberapa kuat ekonomi dan masyarakat bertahan selama proses transisi. Inilah saatnya pemerintah menempatkan dekarbonisasi sebagai instrumen penguatan industri nasional, merancang peta jalan yang realistis, dan memastikan transisi energi menjadi motor ketahanan ekonomi jangka panjang Indonesia.

Unveiled Jan. 8 at the Boeing Future of Flight in Everett, the accelerator will bring together state leadership, private-sector partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives, labor and community stakeholders to rapidly scale the production and adoption of low-carbon aviation fuels. Funded through a 2025 legislative appropriation and additional philanthropic support, CSAA is the most comprehensive initiative of its kind in the Pacific Northwest.

Two WSU Tri-Cities faculty from the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab — BSEL Director Josh Heyne and Research Assistant Professor Harrison Yang — were on-hand during the launch event to demonstrate and discuss their lab’s SAF testing programs with other guests. WSU system President Besty Cantwell was an invited speaker, and more than 210 government and industry leaders — including Washington Governor Bob Ferguson attended the event.

WSU Tri-Cities research driving real-world impact

WSU is a in CSAA, leveraging more than a decade of national leadership in sustainable aviation. Much of that work is happening at WSU Tri-Cities, home to one of the the Sustainable Options in Aviation Research (SOAR) Lab and BSEL.

“WSU Tri-Cities provides the applied research and testing capabilities that make this work real,” said WSU Tri-Cities Chancellor, Sandra Haynes. “From validating fuels to supporting certification and commercialization, our researchers are helping the industry bridge the gap between promising science and commercial scale.”

Directed by Heyne, BSEL operates in partnership with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and serves as . Since 2024, the SOAR Lab within BSEL has supported emerging energy solutions by providing specialized testing methodologies and equipment to industry and academic partners.

To date, BSEL researchers have tested nearly 500 SAF candidate samples from roughly 40 institutions across North America, Europe, and supporting supply-chain validation, performance evaluation and federal policy efforts. Heyne was recognized last year as the most cited and most published researcher in the field, as well as the most productive author in SAF research from 2001 to 2023. He also holds the highest connection strength among researchers in the discipline — illustrating the breadth of his collaborations — contributing to WSU’s designation as the most collaborative institution in sustainable aviation research.

As part of CSAA, is partnering with Snohomish County to establish a Sustainable Aviation Fuel Research and Development Center at Paine Field Airport. The center will house the world’s first SAF repository, where fuel samples will be collected, tested, indexed and distributed globally to support research and commercialization efforts. WSU Tri-Cities experts will play a key role in fuel testing, design of novel SAF compositions, while collaborating with government, industry and academic partners to foster innovation, workforce development and economic growth in the region.

WSU’s SAF research also contributes to ASCENT, the Federal Aviation Administration’s Center of Excellence for Alternative Jet Fuels and Environment, co-led by WSU and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Looking ahead

With aviation accounting for an estimated 2 to 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, leaders emphasized that SAF represents one of the most promising near-term strategies for reducing emissions while maintaining safety, affordability and reliability.

Zurich and Geneva Airports Top Pre-Covid Passenger Numbers While Cutting Flights

New traffic statistics released on 15 January by the Board of Airline Representatives in Switzerland (BAR-CH) reveal that the country’s two main hubs handled more passengers in 2025 than in any year before the pandemic even as aircraft movements continued to fall. Zurich Airport welcomed 32.6 million travellers (103.4 % of the 2019 level) on 270,116 flights—still 1.9 % below the 2019 movement count—while Geneva processed 17.85 million passengers on 177,288 flights, down 4.7 % from 2019.

Higher-capacity aircraft, stronger load factors and a tariff structure that discourages low-yield rotations allowed both airports to deliver record throughput with fewer take-offs, a trend hailed by the Federal Office of Civil Aviation as proof that efficiency and sustainability goals can align. Night-time departures after 22:00 at Geneva dropped a further 24.6 %, and latest-generation jets now make up 34 % of its traffic mix.

For mobility managers the headline is resilience: seat supply into Switzerland has not only recovered but grown on key long-haul routes. Zurich added a Shanghai service on China Eastern, and both hubs expect additional North-American frequencies once the World Economic Forum (WEF) starts on 19 January. Nevertheless, parking stands at Zurich will be saturated during WEF week, and corporate flight departments are urged to lock in slots and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) allocations early.

Meanwhile, travellers and programme managers looking to stay ahead of Switzerland’s entry formalities can lean on VisaHQ’s digital platform, which consolidates the latest visa and transit requirements, offers step-by-step application support and even integrates with corporate booking tools—details are at https://www.visahq.com/switzerland/.

BAR-CH’s report also foreshadows higher airport fees for noisier aircraft from April 2026, a move that could influence fleet-planning decisions for carriers serving Switzerland and, by extension, corporate travel budgets. Companies should revisit travel-policy fare caps for the second quarter and brief travellers on likely terminal congestion spikes tied to the phased rollout of the EU Entry/Exit System (EES) biometric gates beginning in March.

The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel.
Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving.
New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.","For much of the past half-century, nuclear energy in the United States has occupied an uneasy space between a technology of the past and a technology of the future — but not quite one of the present. That is beginning to change, and Alaska is part of that shift.

A couple of months ago, Project Janus, an initiative led by the Department of the Army, identified Fort Wainwright as one of nine candidate sites for deploying a new generation of small, advanced nuclear reactors. While the announcement received little public attention in Alaska, the program is significant. Janus is designed not only to support the energy security of military installations, but also to move advanced nuclear from isolated pilot projects toward repeatable, “nth-of-a-kind” deployments, where costs are expected to become more predictable and decline over time relative to first-of-a-kind efforts.

This follows on the heels of a June 2025 announcement that Oklo Inc. was selected to move forward on a planned microreactor deployment at Eielson Air Force Base. Taken together with other demonstrations and commercial proposals now moving through testing and licensing, these projects point to a broader shift: new nuclear is no longer hypothetical — it is beginning to move into real-world deployment.

Why nuclear stalled

Nuclear power in the United States generates roughly 20% of the nation’s electricity — about the same share as all renewable sources combined — yet it is often perceived as static and outdated. While wind, solar and battery storage have seen rapid, highly visible innovation and have dominated conversations about the energy future, nuclear has largely been associated with aging plants, long development timelines and high costs.

From time to time, talk of a nuclear renaissance has resurfaced. But for years, that renaissance seemed perpetually just out of reach — always promised, but not delivered. Large projects such as the Vogtle Electric Generating Plant in Georgia came to symbolize this tension. Built around conventional, large-scale reactor designs developed decades earlier, Vogtle’s long delays and multibillion-dollar cost overruns ultimately hardened public skepticism about whether nuclear still had a role to play in the nation’s future energy supply.

For many observers, the question became not whether nuclear power could work, but whether it still made sense in an energy landscape increasingly shaped by shorter build times and greater flexibility in how capacity is sized and deployed. Wind, solar and natural gas plants can often be built quickly, with far less up-front capital and can be scaled incrementally. Against that backdrop, large, conventional nuclear projects increasingly appeared obsolete.

Reimagining nuclear

This new generation of nuclear technologies is not trying to solve old problems by building better versions of the same systems. Instead, it represents a fundamental rethinking of how nuclear power is designed, built and used. New designs emphasize smaller-scale, standardized systems that can be factory-assembled and rapidly deployed to a site. This shift reflects an effort to adapt nuclear technology to the practical realities of today’s energy landscape.

A major focus of this new wave of nuclear innovation has been safety. Traditional nuclear plants rely on multiple engineered systems, layers of redundancy and highly trained operators to manage risk. By contrast, many advanced reactor designs place greater emphasis on inherent or passive safety: Both the reactor and its fuel are designed to remain stable under extreme conditions.

These more accident-tolerant approaches are being put into practice. A major milestone occurred a few months ago, when the first fuel shipment designed specifically for these advanced reactors arrived at Idaho National Laboratory. The fuel, known as TRISO, is configured differently from conventional nuclear fuel. In TRISO fuel, uranium is encapsulated within multiple ceramic layers designed to withstand extreme heat and physical stress. As a result, a significant portion of the safety function is built directly into the fuel itself.

This initial production run will support the first advanced reactors to be tested at Idaho National Laboratory in several decades. Commercial demonstrations are expected to follow, with multiple vendors seeking access to the laboratory’s limited testing infrastructure, including Oklo Inc.

What Alaskans are saying

Surveys conducted by Strategies 360 on behalf of the Alaska Center for Energy and Power at UAF over several years show that Alaskans across a broad spectrum of communities and political views consistently favor greater diversification of the state’s energy systems. Respondents support expanding hydroelectric, solar and wind resources while reducing reliance on gas and coal.

Views on nuclear energy remain more mixed, though they are evolving. In the most recent poll, a slim majority of respondents said they would be open to greater use of nuclear energy in Alaska, while the share of those strongly opposed has dropped below 10 percent. Support increases when respondents are provided with additional information: Those who report greater familiarity with nuclear energy tend to be more supportive overall, and among less familiar respondents, interest rises substantially after hearing a brief, neutral description of advanced nuclear technologies. Taken together, these results suggest that many Alaskans are receptive to learning more and engaging on the issue as new information becomes available.

Taking stock: Where are we now?

While progress is encouraging, we still have a way to go before these technologies are available off the shelf. Even the vendors closest to market remain in design, licensing or early demonstration phases. New nuclear technology is no longer purely theoretical, but it is still far from an established technology.

There are also important unresolved questions: how these systems will perform over time; how they will be financed, owned and operated; how regulatory frameworks will adapt; and how issues such as waste management and emergency planning will be addressed. These questions can only be answered through experience — by moving projects from concept to operation and learning from them along the way. And that’s exactly what’s happening.

One reason this moment feels different is the level of sustained federal involvement and investment — an area of rare continuity in U.S. energy policy. Support for advanced nuclear has continued across both the Biden and Trump administrations, enabling momentum in addressing long-standing barriers that have kept these technologies from moving beyond paper studies and early prototypes.

Alaska is already playing an important role. Through defense-led demonstrations, research activities and early commercial proposals, it is reasonable to expect continued discussion and activity in the coming years. Decisions about how far Alaska ultimately leans into a new nuclear era will rest with Alaskans themselves. In the near term, the state clearly has a seat at the table. The question ahead is not whether nuclear can be developed, but when — and under what conditions — Alaskans will decide whether it belongs as part of the state’s future energy mix.

Neg8 Carbon’s electrostatic DAC technology works by drawing in air and passing it over a specifically designed sorbent system that attracts and captures carbon dioxide molecules. The captured molecules can then be permanently and safely stored underground or converted into climate-neutral carbon products, such as sustainable aviation fuel.

Dr John Breen, chief technology officer at Neg8 Carbon, said: “The 50 tonne per annum unit will serve to validate Neg8’s system as a leading engineered carbon capture technology that will support industries and governments in their drive to net-zero and beyond to negative carbon emissions.”

Michael Kent, director at Prochem Engineering, said: “This collaboration reflects the shared commitment of Neg8 Carbon and Prochem Engineering to deliver innovative, sustainable engineering solutions that support meaningful environmental progress and a lower-carbon future.”
