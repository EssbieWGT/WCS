Over the past two years, a series of high-profile near-miss incidents—ranging from midair collisions to runway incursions—have exposed systemic flaws in air traffic management and coordination between civilian and military operations. These events are not just operational blunders; they are reshaping investor sentiment, intensifying regulatory scrutiny, and creating both risks and opportunities for airline and aerospace stocks.

The Catalyst: A Year of Escalating Safety Crises

The most harrowing incident came on January 29, 2025, when an American Airlines regional jet collided with a U.S. Army helicopter near Reagan National Airport, killing all 67 people on board. This tragedy, the deadliest U.S. aviation disaster in 25 years, was preceded by a string of near-misses in 2023 and 2024, including a 100-foot near-collision between a Delta and American Airlines jet at JFK and a February 2023 incident where a FedEx and Southwest plane nearly shared the same runway. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reported a 10% increase in fatal crashes in early 2025 compared to 2024, with staffing shortages and communication failures cited as key contributors.

These incidents have triggered a cascade of regulatory actions. The FAA launched a 14-year safety review in 2023, introduced the Approach Runway Verification (ARV) system, and accelerated hiring for air traffic controllers. Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued urgent recommendations to decongest flight paths and modernize collision-avoidance systems. For investors, this regulatory tightening is a double-edged sword: while it could reduce long-term accident risks, it also raises operational costs and creates uncertainty for airlines already grappling with inflation and fuel price volatility.

Investor Sentiment: Volatility and the ""Guilt by Association"" Effect

The market's reaction to aviation safety incidents has been swift and severe. Boeing's stock plummeted 5% within hours of the Air India Dreamliner crash in early 2025, while GE Aerospace shares fell 2% as investors questioned the reliability of critical components. Smaller airlines and regional carriers have fared even worse. For example, Republic Airways, which operates regional jets for major carriers, saw its stock drop 8% following a May 2025 near-miss at Reagan National, where two commercial flights had to abort landings due to a military helicopter's proximity.

The ""guilt by association"" effect is particularly pronounced for airlines with fleets heavily reliant on Boeing aircraft. Low-cost carriers like Southwest and American Airlines, which operate large numbers of 737s and 787s, have faced sharper sell-offs than their more diversified peers. Conversely, Airbus and Embraer have seen modest gains as investors hedge against Boeing's vulnerabilities. This dynamic underscores a broader trend: in a crisis, market participants punish firms with perceived systemic risks, even if the incident is unrelated to their core operations.

Regulatory Scrutiny and the Cost of Compliance

Regulatory responses to 2025's safety crises are already reshaping the industry. The FAA's Controller “Stand Up for Safety” campaign, which prioritizes communication and error correction, has forced airlines to invest in new training programs and technology. For instance, the ARV system, which provides real-time alerts for runway conflicts, is being rolled out at major airports, but its implementation costs could add millions to operating budgets. Similarly, the NTSB's push to decongest military helicopter routes near Reagan National has led to temporary flight restrictions, reducing capacity for regional carriers.

Investors must weigh these regulatory costs against potential long-term benefits. While compliance expenses may squeeze short-term margins, they could also reduce accident risks and stabilize demand. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts that airline net profits will rise to $36 billion in 2025, driven by falling oil prices and strong passenger demand. However, carriers with weak balance sheets—like Spirit Airlines and Allegiant Air—may struggle to absorb safety-related costs, increasing their vulnerability to market volatility.

Long-Term Opportunities: Safety as a Competitive Advantage

Despite the risks, the current crisis also creates opportunities for airlines and aerospace firms that prioritize safety and innovation. Airlines with robust safety records, such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines, have seen their stocks outperform peers, as investors seek refuge in companies perceived as less likely to face regulatory penalties or reputational damage. Similarly, aerospace firms investing in advanced collision-avoidance technologies—like Honeywell and Garmin—are gaining traction as the FAA mandates upgrades to TCAS (Traffic Collision Avoidance System) and ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast) systems.

For investors, the key is to differentiate between short-term pain and long-term resilience. Airlines that can modernize their fleets, reduce reliance on aging aircraft, and adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) strategies are likely to outperform in the coming years. For example, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines have committed to SAF investments, which could mitigate both environmental and safety risks while aligning with regulatory trends.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

The aviation sector in 2025 is at a crossroads. Safety incidents have exposed vulnerabilities in air traffic management, regulatory oversight, and corporate governance, but they've also accelerated innovation and transparency. For investors, the path forward requires a nuanced approach:

Hedge against volatility: Diversify airline exposure by investing in a mix of legacy carriers with strong balance sheets and regional players with growth potential.

Prioritize safety-focused firms: Favor airlines and aerospace companies that are proactively modernizing their operations and fleets.

Monitor regulatory trends: Stay attuned to FAA and NTSB updates, as policy shifts will continue to shape the industry's risk profile.

Consider insurance dynamics: Insurers like Travelers and Allstate are navigating a new landscape where coverage for regulatory non-compliance is limited, creating opportunities for firms offering parametric or data-driven risk models.

In the end, the aviation sector's ability to adapt to its current challenges will determine its long-term success. For investors, the lesson is clear: safety isn't just a regulatory issue—it's a financial imperative.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 18:56:07.717666

Currently, the TSA advises travelers to continue following the 3-1-1 liquids rule unless otherwise notified.
At some airports using CT scanners, passengers may be allowed to leave liquids and laptops in their bags, but policies are not yet standardized.","Passengers in the United States will no longer be required to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints as part of a major policy shift by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). The agency officially lifted the mandate at select airports equipped with advanced screening systems in July 2025.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem described the change as the start of a broader modernization of air travel security. “We’ve entered a new phase of aviation screening,” she said. “This is just the beginning.”

The new shoe policy was made possible by the deployment of advanced CT scanners and artificial intelligence-based detection systems at over 250 U.S. airports. These tools allow TSA officers to detect threats without requiring travelers to remove footwear, a practice that has been in place since 2001.

Following the announcement, Noem indicated that the TSA’s long-standing limit on carry-on liquids may be the next rule to be revised.

The 3-1-1 rule, which restricts travelers to liquids in containers of 3.4 ounces or less, placed inside a single quart-size plastic bag, was introduced in 2006 following a terror plot involving liquid explosives. However, TSA officials are now reviewing the necessity of its use in light of newer scanning technology.

Noem, speaking at The Hill Nation Summit, said, “The liquids, I’m questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be.”

According to the Associated Press, approximately 255 of the 432 commercial airports in the U.S. now utilize CT scanners that provide 3D imaging of carry-on contents, allowing TSA officers to analyze the materials inside without unpacking.

The TSA confirmed that changes to the liquids rule are under review, but gave no timeline for implementation. The agency emphasized that full removal of the rule would depend on scanner availability and consistent security performance nationwide.

Several international airports have already lifted their liquids ban after installing similar technology. The U.S. could follow a phased approach, allowing liquid limits to be eased at certain airports first.

Experts have urged caution. Jeffrey Price, an aviation security professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said uneven deployment of CT scanners could lead to confusion. “If one airport allows large liquids and another does not, passengers are going to be caught in a grey area,” he said.

In addition, a former TSA official noted that clear public messaging will be essential if the rule is revised. “The devil is going to be in the details,” they said.

Currently, the TSA advises travelers to continue following the 3-1-1 liquids rule unless otherwise notified. At some airports using CT scanners, passengers may be allowed to leave liquids and laptops in their bags, but policies are not yet standardized.

In the long term, the TSA is exploring the possibility of walk-through screening systems that allow passengers to pass through security checkpoints without removing electronics, shoes, or liquids at all. Officials believe that as biometric technology and AI continue to advance, a more seamless travel experience is possible.

“Our goal is to provide the highest level of security with the least amount of disruption,” Noem said. “That’s the future of air travel.”",https://ftnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/airport-security-control-liquids-in-bag.webp,N,,2025-07-20 14:56:08.213826

Carbon-neutral, powered solely by hydrogen, and capable of flying long distances with up to 200 passengers onboard, the ZEROe looks set to send shockwaves around the aviation industry when it enters commercial service.

In this article, we take a look at the development of the Airbus ZEROe, some of the previous designs and propulsion technologies that were considered, what place the ZEROe might occupy in the market, and the future of hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Development Of The Airbus ZEROe

The Airbus ZEROe project was launched in September 2020, with the goal of being in service by 2035. The ZEROe is billed as a hydrogen-powered, zero-carbon commercial aircraft that will help to decarbonize the aviation industry and will support airlines across the world with their ambitious sustainability goals.

Initially, the plan considered two primary options for hydrogen propulsion: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. Among the engines for the hydrogen combustion systems that were considered by Airbus were the turbofan and the turboprop. One of the options for the Airbus ZEROe also features a blended-wing body, which not only gives the aircraft a unique and unmistakable appearance, but also makes it more streamlined and able to fly more efficiently.

After extensive research and testing, hydrogen fuel cell technology was selected in 2025, with the European manufacturer turning away from the hydrogen combustion that had previously been favored. This choice was driven by the operational performance of hydrogen fuel cell technology, but does not rule out the future use of hydrogen combustion should it be deemed suitable.

Hydrogen fuel cell technology is very efficient, but generates a smaller amount of power compared to hydrogen combustion, therefore somewhat limiting the range of the Airbus ZEROe. When it comes to hydrogen combustion, the technology required is deemed easier to retrofit onto existing infrastructure and creates more power, but still produces some harmful emissions, albeit lower than those created by traditional jet fuel.

Water Is The Only Byproduct

The Airbus ZEROe features an electric propeller propulsion system that is powered by hydrogen fuel cells developed in partnership with ElringKlinger. These hydrogen fuel cells transform the hydrogen into electricity through a chemical reaction, which then, in turn, drives the propellers to create the movement needed to fly. Each of the aircraft's four propellers has its own hydrogen fuel cell stack.

Hydrogen fuel cell technology is not new, but there are currently none large enough to power an aircraft while maintaining a low enough weight to allow the aircraft itself to fly. The overwhelming positive hydrogen fuel cell technology is that this process only creates one byproduct: water. This means that as long as the hydrogen has been sourced in a sustainable manner, the process is completely carbon-neutral.

Airbus has also teamed up with MTU Aero Engines, signing a memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show in June 2025. MTU is one of the world's leading experts in aircraft engines, generating annual revenues in excess of $8.75 billion. The partnership aims to combine the expertise of Airbus and MTU, both leaders in their fields, to develop the most suitable plans for the ZEROe. The European manufacturer's Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux, celebrated the agreement, saying:

“Our focus on fully electric fuel cell propulsion technology for future hydrogen-powered aircraft underscores our confidence and progress in this domain. Collaborating with MTU, a leader in engine manufacturing and innovation, is a perfect complement to our own advancements. This partnership will allow us to pool our collective knowledge, accelerate the maturation of critical technologies, and ultimately deliver a revolutionary hydrogen-powered propulsion system for future commercial aircraft. Together, we are not just imagining a sustainable future of flight, we are actively pioneering it.""

Greater Hydrogen Infrastructure Is Needed

The idea of a carbon-neutral, hydrogen-powered aircraft like the Airbus ZEROe sounds like an attractive option for many airlines. However, the fact remains that in order to facilitate the aircraft's entry into commercial service, the majority of airports around the world will need to completely overhaul their hydrogen infrastructure.

For example, hydrogen needs to be stored at temperatures as low as -253°C. This is currently impossible at many airfields, with a significant amount of technological investment still required to reach such temperatures on a regular and consistent basis.

In order for the hydrogen fuel cell technology onboard the Airbus ZEROe to be considered a carbon-neutral solution for aviation, the hydrogen used must be made from electrolysis using renewable energy. Currently, demand for this renewable hydrogen vastly exceeds the supply. For this reason, the hydrogen supply chain needs to be considered, covering all the lifecycle steps from production and liquefaction to transport and storage.

Airbus's 'Hydrogen Hubs At Airports' Program

That is why Airbus has launched its 'Hydrogen Hubs at Airports' program, which is working in partnership with more than 220 airports around the world, as well as multiple energy providers and airlines. In a statement, Airbus said:

“Hydrogen has the potential to be a transformative energy source for aviation. However, we recognize that developing a hydrogen ecosystem – including infrastructure, production, distribution and regulatory frameworks – is a huge challenge requiring global collaboration and investment.”

Airbus describes the program as a collaborative initiative that ""brings together airlines, airports, industry players, energy providers and technology specialists to address the key questions around producing, storing and distributing hydrogen."" Among the airlines currently involved in Airbus' Hydrogen Hubs at Airport program are:

Delta Air Lines .

Air New Zealand.

All Nippon Airways.

Korean Air.

Delays In The Development Of The Airbus ZEROe

Despite the concept coming to fruition in 2020, Airbus has since put the estimated delivery date of the first ZEROe aircraft back to 2035 at the earliest. The European manufacturer was previously testing technology on a modified Airbus A380 aircraft. However, this testing program has reportedly since been shut down, according to a report from Aerospace Testing International.

Apparent delays in the development of the technology needed to power the Airbus ZEROe have also been causing concern among some industry insiders, leading to questions about Airbus's ability to dominate in the future sustainable aircraft market. We will have to watch this space, with the coming months and years being crucial as several different manufacturers battle it out to produce hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft at scale.

Shifting Focus On Sustainable Aviation Fuel

With much skepticism surrounding the viability of programs like Airbus ZEROe hydrogen cell-powered aircraft, there are calls within the industry to focus efforts instead on Sustainable Aviation Fuel(SAF). These are already available and can be produced from various sustainable resources, including used cooking oil, agricultural and forestry waste.

Currently, sustainable aviation fuels are generally blended with conventional jet fuel so that they can be used in existing aircraft without the need for engine modifications. However, future investments may lead to the development of large-scale commercial aircraft capable of flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuels. Work will also need to be done to bring down the cost of such fuels, which currently put them out of reach of many operators worldwide.

Has Airbus Unlocked The Aircraft Of The Future?

Iconic aircraft such as the Airbus A380and modern, fuel-efficient long-haul aircraft such as the A350 are among the most celebrated aircraft in the European manufacturer's catalog. As such, there is no denying that Airbus is leading the way when it comes to traditional aircraft powered by jet fuel. However, it remains to be seen whether Airbus can live up to its reputation when it comes to more sustainable initiatives such as the ZEROe program.

The idea certainly holds much potential, and if it comes off, it could well be a game-changer for an industry that is constantly looking at ways to become more sustainable and meet its ambitious net-zero targets. The Airbus ZEROe may well be the key to long-range, hydrogen-powered air travel, but before its planned entry into service in 2035, the global hydrogen supply chain and infrastructure will need to be overhauled in order to support the regular use of such technology.

ZeroAvia is another manufacturer hoping to get its slice of the pie. The UK-based manufacturer was founded in 2017, and hopes to develop a 9-19 seat aircraft with a range of up to 300 miles by the mid-2020s, scaling the aircraft up to accommodate 40-80 passengers by 2027, and ultimately creating a hydrogen-powered aircraft capable of carrying up to 100 passengers on flights of up to 1,000 miles in length by 2030.

ZeroAvia has been backed by several of the world's largest airlines, including United Airlines, and the manufacturer's first aircraft, known as the HyFlyer II, has so far completed several test flights. However, given the challenges that the global giant Airbus is facing, despite its impressive array of connections and industry experience, it remains to be seen how successful smaller manufacturers such as ZeroAvia will be in the face of such stiff competition.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/everything.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 14:56:12.022071
,,2025-07-20 16:26:43+00:00,Scandasia,Business transformation consultant/FBC Chairman Pasi Haatainen outlines the latest ... - Scandasia,Joakim Persson,,,,,https://scandasia.com/business-transformation-consultant-fbc-chairman-pasi-haatainen-outlines-the-latest-singapore-opportunities-and-obstacles/,"Pasi Haatainen, a long-term Singapore resident and also Finnish Business Council Singapore (FBC) Chairman since 2021, has since 2007 been based in the city-state as a senior business consultant.
He also has vast experience within business transformation.
“Currently I use being the Chairman of the Finnish Business Council Singapore as leverage to brand myself, and secondly my company.
Attracting new members, he says is difficult: “Not that many Finnish companies come here and we have a few that have still not joined.
There are currently 14,000 European companies in Singapore.” Pasi recently toured some Johor facilities with the Finnish Business Council and came away impressed.","Pasi Haatainen, a long-term Singapore resident and also Finnish Business Council Singapore (FBC) Chairman since 2021, has since 2007 been based in the city-state as a senior business consultant. Because of these roles, Pasi naturally stays informed about key developments for business and trade. He also has vast experience within business transformation. In the wake of Covid-19 he paints a not so rosy picture for the business climate, while also giving examples about the impact from the large-scale arrival of AI (artificial intelligence). And in this time of particularly decisive disruptions and changes, Singapore as a hub is being impacted in various ways – now opening up for large-scale integration with the state of Johor. Get a Finnish executive’s top-of-mind insights and observations on these topics!

Pasi first arrived to Singapore in 2007, having been laid off during the Nokia–Siemens Networks merger in the U.S – enticed to come over by several friends living there.

“It took me one hour to set up a company here and get the bank account sorted, and then Nokia hired me back as a consultant.”

Working for them during two years was actually how his consultancy businesses started, explains Pasi.

“And, from then on, I’ve just worked out of Singapore with different multinationals as clients. I was in Pakistan, Russia, many northern European countries also, and for the last 14 – 15 years mainly in Southeast Asia.”

Two of Pasi’s clients were also Finnish companies; Taival (a boutique strategy firm) and Headlong Finland Oy (a small IT company), who both hired him as Head of Business Development.

“Unfortunately, we couldn’t gain enough traction in the market for either. Simultaneously I have been running my consultancy; mainly doing transformation programmes for clients.”

Another more recent client was the Japanese company Rakuten Mobile, where Pasi and other senior consultants were hired to establish its global headquarters in Singapore.

“I headed that – setting up the company, getting government grants and hiring people – which took place right when Covid-19 started.”

Transformation management in focus

Although Pasi spent many years at Nokia in telecom, he doesn’t specialize in any single sector, applying his transformation expertise across multiple industries. Today, with his consulting firm Dationic (rebranded from Dynamic Business Consulting) his expert services focus on strategic planning, sales development, and digital transformation programmes and other services.

“We believe that short-term efforts can yield long-term benefits – which is essentially our approach with clients.”

As an MSc-qualified Transformation Leader with over twenty years of experience he drives such large-scale business programmes and change initiatives.

“I’ve deliberately not limited myself to one industry. I’ve been doing consulting, specialising purely on transformation management. So, big MNCs and application rollouts in different business domains such as telecom, insurance, banking, mining, and a coffee business. And that doesn’t really matter because when you talk about change management it’s mainly about people and the organisation, as well as technology and processes. I get more crystallized on the added value of the services. Of course, if a customer asks specifically for other assistance I can also consider,” Pasi explains.

“Usually, companies hire me to manage their big programmes, and in a few of those cases they were suffering for whatever reason and brought me in to get things back on track. Oftentimes they also hire me to manage their vendors, as they prefer someone independent for that. If they use any large consulting company, it will definitely sell them more than is actually needed. The customers’ problem is that they don’t always know the pitfalls and terms – and should definitely have a well-defined and fair contract. For a lot of the transformation and change problems corporations use external resources that they don’t have inhouse. Then, they ought to start with analysing the vendor contract(s),” adds the Finn. “I help them to define the new contracts and do vendor analysis as well, as an easy, fast-fix.”

His clients are mainly European, American, Indonesian or Filipino – who are more inclined to use independent consultants.

Nothing has changed

Digital transformation and AI are also unavoidable topics, since they connect strongly to Pasi’s services: “Nobody talked about ‘digital’ fifteen years ago; it was just a change programme, maybe ‘transformation’- or ‘process re-engineering’ programmes. Now, everything’s digital, but nothing has changed concerning that it’s all about the people, processes and technology. So, get back to basics!”

“A lot of times, companies start off with changing some technology, whatever that may be. But it always comes back to that you have to change people’s behaviour and the organisation. Then technology also follows through; that’s the easy part! People and processes are absolutely the most difficult ones to change! Ultimately, even with all the new digital tools, transformation success hinges on those. You can introduce cutting-edge tech, but if the team isn’t on board and processes aren’t aligned, it won’t stick – because nobody really wants to change!”

“Usually, you have to have a well-defined strategy, and then the transformation is what drives that through. And people think that everything’s transformational, when it’s actually normal operational excellence. Real transformation is about growth, innovative concepts and doing something new; that’s usually when transformation programmes come into play,” he elaborates.

“In the Nordics we conducted large transformation programmes already in the 1990s, while in Asia a lot of companies are still struggling to do the same! Out here businesses have been very labour-intensive, and now they are beginning to realise that they can no longer compete just based on hiring more and more people; hence these kinds of digital transformation efforts – of which the majority always fail!”

Golden era for consultants

Meanwhile, the ‘digitalisation’ trend has led to a lot more consultancy work over all. Accenture, for instance, employs approximately 774,000 people worldwide. But that escalating need for management consultants is fast coming to an end and will likely go into reverse, leading to redundancies.

“With the arrival of AI this will now turn around, so 50% or more of those are probably going to be laid off in next five years!” believes Pasi.

Having scores of consultants spending endless hour on producing and polishing power points will no longer be needed with generative AI.

“For me, as a self-employed, AI is a blessing; one that levels the playing field. Now I can effortlessly produce research papers, and use cases for customers – regardless of what it is. And a lot of times the customers doesn’t realise what their current problems are and what their competitors are doing – lacking the research capabilities. And with AI LLM models customers can do it by themselves as well – or use people like me.”

“In other words, one experienced consultant equipped can with AI do what it used to require a whole team of juniors to accomplish. That’s why I believe we’ll see a golden era for senior advisors – companies will seek out veterans who can ‘jump onto a moving train and fix things immediately’, rather than paying for big teams of analysts. So, from that point of view, I’m kind of optimistic, and that more and more the customers will want immediate value, rather than the kind of transformation we were focusing on five years ago.”

“But at the same time, it’s tougher. Right now, the main problem in the business climate – and this is not limited to the consulting area – is that it’s very difficult to get new contracts signed.”

Pasi observes that, across industries, decision-makers are hesitating to commit to new projects because of geopolitical and economic uncertainties – hence the delaying mentality that slows down deal-making.

Joining forces with EuroCham

Overall, getting new customers for Pasi happens through networking.

“Currently I use being the Chairman of the Finnish Business Council Singapore as leverage to brand myself, and secondly my company. People mainly buy from people, not from the company.”

He notes that LinkedIn is “by far the best marketing tool for independent consultants” – a platform he leverages to build his personal and company brand (though he admits he could utilise it even more).

Pasi is also a board member of EuroCham as the FBC representative.

“FBC just rejoined as member and want to combine forces with EuroCham and do a lot of events, which I think is going to give more opportunities for Finnish companies to network and to get a bigger audience. I think that might give more value for Finnish B2B and B2C members as well. Events are a lot of times based on what’s in demand of that year. Sustainability was still a hot topic last year but has now cooled down. There was maybe too much hype around it and too many events. Now of course AI is still big, and it’s all about the quality of what is presented.”

Post Covid-19, events fatigue has also set in: “People went to so many physical events that they got tired of that too. Also, people work more from home these days and, consequently, go out less. Recently, we got more requests to just arrange networking events without any specific topic. So, we’ve had a whisky tasting and will have one for champagne! We also arrange company visits, as part of accommodating as much as possible what the members want.”

FBC members and Finland friends can also look forward to a big party later in the year, namely the 40th anniversary of the council’s establishment. “We will end this celebration year with a bang!” promises its chairman.

Attracting new members, he says is difficult: “Not that many Finnish companies come here and we have a few that have still not joined. I think one of the reasons is that you can easily find a lot of information by yourself in Singapore. And it’s an extremely social place: there are a lot of networking opportunities, compared to say Shanghai. Also, in my opinion, once outside Finland, Finns think they can handle things on their own.”

One way to try to entice Finnish companies to Singapore are the incentives offered for setting up headquarters there – regional or even global!

“Right now, the Singapore government offers businesses from overseas a big promotion. Put the regional or global headquarter here, and you’ll get a lot of different grants and tax incentives. And if you want to put your global headquarters here, the Singapore government will love you! At FBC we are not driving this, but we accommodate and share knowledge as much as possible.”

“Nightingale, a Finnish Health tech company put their regional headquarters here,” Pasi exemplifies.

Costs a major hindrance

Something undisputable is that Singapore is a hub for international trade and a gateway to Asia, with extensive trade networks and strategic maritime location. But despite foreign investor confidence in Singapore (with its may FTAs, cross-border investment facilitation and protection for foreign investors’ rights) there is crucial difference compared to before, and by no means any small matter. In 2025, the increased costs of living, and other challenges relating to Singapore and running a business there have become, to quote Pasi, a “major hindrance”.

“Rents have gone up on average between 50 – 100%, so this has hit really hard in the wake of Covid. And I don’t know how sustainable this is. The rents for individuals or household rents have continued going up insanely high. And over 3,000 F&B outlets closed down in 2024 alone!

I think Singapore will suffer, and I can through EuroCham confirm that many from various national business groups share this view.”

“Also, we have hard times getting highly skilled people in here because the spouse can’t easily get a work permit, while in Malaysia and Thailand you can.”

Overall, my view is that Singapore needs to address these cost- and talent issues or it could risk losing some appeal. And, actually, Hong Kong is now looking more attractive again. I have friends working there who say that their rents are lower, while salaries are higher. Cars cost one-third or one-fifth of the price here! And currently they don’t have enough skilled foreigners either.”

Moving production across the channel

For Singapore there are two clear paths emerging in 2025. “I meet a lot of people throughout the year who are about to set up their company and considering Singapore for global headquarters, especially digital mobile-only companies and based on Shopify. Mainly they give taxation as reason and that the people they hire are working from home all around the world and not in Singapore. So, putting the headquarters here is less about the people,” says Pasi. “And even Singapore is recognising that.”

Enter ‘JS-SEC’, the Johor-Singapore Special Economic Zone (launched in January) – an agreement for strengthening Johor and Singapore to jointly compete for global investments

by improving cross-border goods connectivity, enabling freer movement of people, and strengthening the business ecosystem within the region. JS-SEC’ is intended to supercharge cross-border investment, enhance supply chains and foster a Singapore–Johor economic corridor.

“Singapore is actively encouraging companies to headquarter here while placing operations in Johor to take advantage of cross-border efficiencies. There are currently 14,000 European companies in Singapore.”

Pasi recently toured some Johor facilities with the Finnish Business Council and came away impressed. ‘They’re really heavily pushing the Johor economic zone everywhere,’ he says, noting that it’s a strategy for Singapore to remain attractive despite rising costs.",https://scandasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pasi-Haatainen.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 12:56:11.815399

Looking Ahead: The Future of Supersonic Air Travel What lies ahead for Boom Supersonic and the future of fast travel?","After more than two decades of silence in the skies following the retirement of Concorde, supersonic passenger flight is probably staging a comeback. Leading this new chapter is Boom Supersonic, an ambitious American aerospace company developing a next-generation aircraft called the Overture. Designed to fly at twice the speed of today’s airliners, the Overture promises to revolutionize air travel. In our article, we will analyze everything we know about Boom’s Overture as of July 2025, covering its origins, technology, test flights, airline interest, public opinion, and the future of supersonic flight.

Boom Supersonic's vision is not merely to build a faster airplane, but to create a sustainable and commercially viable one. The manufacturer promises speeds of up to Mach 1.7, a sleek design focused on the passenger experience, and the use of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Overture aims to make a bold attempt to reintroduce supersonic travel in a responsible and scalable manner. But as with all high-flying ambitions, it comes with its share of challenges, questions, and remarkable milestones.

The Birth Of Boom Supersonic And The Overture Project

Boom Supersonic was founded in 2014 by Blake Scholl, a former Amazon executive with a passion for fast travel and aviation innovation. Headquartered in Denver, Colorado, the company began with a bold goal: to make supersonic commercial flight economically viable and environmentally responsible. The company managed to raise more than $600 million from 53 investors, including companies and private individuals, as well as a special grant from the US Air Force, as reported by Crunchbase. Boom has steadily built momentum toward its flagship aircraft, the Overture.

According to the official Boom Supersonic website, the Overture is designed to fly at Mach 1.7, which is twice the speed of current subsonic airliners, and the plane can carry between 60 and 80 passengers over a range of 4,250 nautical miles (or 7,871 Km). Boom plans to focus first on transoceanic routes, such as New York to London or Tokyo to Seattle, as these are the routes where the sonic boom will have the least impact on populated areas. The aircraft's design incorporates four engines, a delta wing, and a fuselage optimized for aerodynamic efficiency.

As mentioned on the Boom Supersonic website, in 1973, FAA regulation 14 CFR 91.817 prohibited all supersonic flight over land in the US until June 6, 2025, when President Donald Trump issued and signed an executive order entitled “Leading the World in Supersonic Flight,” lifting the 52-year ban on supersonic flight over the US. This is good news for pioneering supersonic companies such as Boom Supersonic, as the company can conduct test flights over the mainland and, in the future, offer supersonic domestic flights on routes like New York to Los Angeles.

The XB-1 Demonstrator: Supersonic Testing Begins

Before committing to full-scale production of the Overture, Boom has been developing and flight-testing the XB-1, a one-third-scale supersonic demonstrator. This jet is crucial for validating the aerodynamic design, materials, and propulsion systems planned for Overture. The XB-1 took its first flight on March 22, 2024, at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California. It has also become the first civil aircraft to go supersonic over the continental United States.

To date, XB-1 has completed at least 13 test flights as of July 2025, including its first supersonic flight (Mach 1.1) on January 28, 2025. These tests have validated key design features, including laminar flow over the fuselage and wings, stability at high speeds, and structural integrity under various flight conditions. The data collected from these flights is being directly fed into the development of the Overture and can be accessed here.

NASA also captured the XB-1 using Schlieren photography, revealing clearly defined shock waves (insert video from above) around the aircraft during flight. This not only serves as a powerful demonstration of supersonic travel but also supports Boom's ongoing research into ""boomless cruise,"" where aircraft might fly at speeds that minimize or eliminate the sonic boom on the ground. The entire process is described in detail by Space.com.

Cutting-Edge Technology Inside Overture

Overture’s performance hinges on advanced technologies, including a carbon-composite airframe for weight savings and a delta-gull wing for supersonic efficiency. The heart of any supersonic aircraft is its propulsion system, and Boom's solution is the next-generation turbofan Symphony engine.

Unlike Concorde's thirsty Olympus turbojets, Symphony is a medium-bypass turbofan developed in collaboration with Florida Turbine Technologies, GE Additive, and StandardAero, the latter of which will assemble the powerful jet engines at their site in San Antonio, TX. It promises 35,000 pounds of thrust, optimized for Mach 1.7 flight without the need for afterburners, which is a significant leap in efficiency.

Another important feature we have mentioned above is an advanced noise design principle, known as “boomless cruise” and aerodynamic shaping, which aims to minimize sonic-boom impact. Combined with over-water supersonic operation, these efforts address the regulatory and environmental constraints that hindered earlier SST efforts.

The Overture will also operate entirely on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and its design incorporates advanced carbon composite materials to minimize weight. The engines are also expected to meet the ICAO Chapter 14 noise levels, making them suitable for more airports worldwide. Boom anticipates beginning Symphony engine testing in 2026, with flight-ready units prepared for Overture's certification program.

Boom's engineering team has focused heavily on ensuring low-drag performance, safe flutter behavior, and material durability at supersonic speeds. Lessons from XB-1 testing are being applied to fine-tune these systems. For instance, the nose droop mechanism, a Concorde-era feature designed for improved landing visibility, is now being modernized with camera systems on the Overture.

Airline Interest: Orders, Partnerships, And Strategic Vision

The Boom project has attracted interest from several major airlines. American Airlines signed a deal for 20 Overture aircraft, with options for 40 more, and placed a non-refundable deposit to secure their order. United Airlines also signed a contract for 15 aircraft with options for 35 more, while Japan Airlines holds pre-orders for 20 units. In total, Boom reports over 130 aircraft in its order backlog.

The strategic vision behind these orders is to reclaim long-haul premium business routes. For instance, an Overture could cut transatlantic flight times in half, making the journey from New York to London a 3.5-hour trip, similar to the flight time during the golden era of Concorde flights. Airlines anticipate using these jets on high-margin routes where passengers value time saved over ticket cost, suggesting that the Overture will initially cater to business and premium-class travelers.

Boom has also signed a defense-focused partnership with Northrop Grumman to explore military variants of the Overture, possibly for rapid personnel transport. Key suppliers include Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Safran Landing Systems, reflecting a Boeing-style global supply chain.

Public Opinions And Industry Skepticism

As with any ambitious aviation project, opinions from the public and industry are mixed. On Reddit’s r/aviation, many users express enthusiasm for the return of supersonic flight, noting XB-1’s real flight data as a sign of serious progress. Others remain skeptical, raising concerns about funding, timelines, and challenges with certification.

Some aviation experts argue that while Boom is making measurable progress, the challenge of building and certifying a supersonic airliner by 2029 remains enormous. Developing an engine like Symphony without a major OEM (original equipment manufacturer), such as Rolls-Royce or GE, as the lead partner is viewed as especially risky and subsequently, lengthy. Even so, Boom's transparent communications and frequent test updates have earned it more credibility than earlier supersonic startups.

Still, concerns persist about sonic boom regulations, airport compatibility, and economic viability. Community sentiment reflects cautious optimism, with many noting that even if Boom misses its target, it has revived serious interest in supersonic travel and pushed regulators and manufacturers to re-examine the category.

Looking Ahead: The Future of Supersonic Air Travel

What lies ahead for Boom Supersonic and the future of fast travel? If all goes according to plan, Boom expects the Overture to be flying passengers by 2030. FAA and EASA certification processes will be a major milestone, with Symphony engine testing set to begin in 2026. Flight testing of the full-scale Overture aircraft is expected by 2027, followed by customer deliveries a couple of years later, as stated by the BBC.

Beyond Boom, other companies like NASA and Lockheed Martin (with the X-59 Quiet Supersonic Technology project) are also pursuing quieter and more efficient supersonic concepts. Meanwhile, regulatory frameworks around sonic booms are evolving, with studies underway to permit supersonic overland flight under strict noise limits.

Boom's legacy may not hinge solely on flying at Mach 1.7, but rather on making supersonic flight desirable and viable for the 21st century. From factory floor to final approach, Boom Supersonic is positioning itself at the forefront of the next aviation revolution, and the world is watching.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/the-boom-overture-supersonic-aircraft-everything-we-know-so-far-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 12:56:16.974117

These include the uncertainties surrounding the impending U.S tariffs and the viability of low cost carrier models upon the exit of Qantas’ owned Jetstar. He also heavily criticised the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

U.S. tariffs may cause airlines to refuse delivery of aircraft

Airlines may be reluctant to take delivery of aircraft due to the ongoing uncertainty around U.S. tariffs and their impact on the cost of the planes, Walsh said, as reported by Reuters.

“It’s not just going to be a major Boeing and Airbus issue. It’ll impact all aspects of the aerospace industry and have an impact on most, if not all, airlines as well,” he said.

The 50% tariff that U.S. President Donald Trump plans to impose on Brazilian exports starting in August could hammer the revenue of planemaker Embraer like the COVID-19 pandemic did, its CEO Francisco Gomes Neto, warned last week, flagging risks to U.S. partners.

Neto said the tariffs would amount to a trade embargo on the regional jets it supplies to U.S. airlines and could trigger order cancellations, deferred deliveries and tough consequences for Embraer’s U.S. suppliers.

EU’s green fuel mandate costly, not helping environment

IATA also stepped up criticism of the European Union’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” Walsh said.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes, or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel”.

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a six per cent SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production in 2025, targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” Walsh said.

We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.

Low-cost carrier model remains viable, but may not work at every airport

The budget airline model is not dead, but it does not always work at every airport, said Walsh. He added that it probably does not make sense for budget carriers to operate at certain airports because of their nature or cost structure.

“Just because you see some low-cost airlines exiting the market, I don’t think you can read across that the business model is not relevant for the future,” he said. “I firmly believe it is and will continue to be. But it doesn’t always work at every airport. Airlines that are labelled budget or low-cost, that doesn’t necessarily guarantee their financial success.”

The viability of budget airlines at high-cost airports such as Changi Airport was thrust into the spotlight after Jetstar Asia said it was exiting Singapore at the end of July, flagging increased competition and operating costs as some push factors.

“Heathrow Airport is no different. For example, there’s no real low-cost operation at Heathrow, principally because of the cost of the airport and the access to slots.”

The airline industry is a highly competitive one, Walsh added. He pointed out that, although 408 new airlines were started in the past decade to December 2024, there were 420 failures as well, making a net loss of 12. Profitability on a global level is wafer-thin – the net profit margin this year is forecast at 3.7 per cent.

In the global fight against climate change, the aviation industry finds itself at a crossroads. While commercial air travel has connected the world like never before, it remains a significant source of carbon emissions. For an industry that relies on high-energy-density fuels to keep planes in the sky, the transition to sustainability presents unique challenges. But a potential solution is already here: sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.

Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable sources, drastically reducing carbon emissions while maintaining the same performance standards. Industry leaders and policymakers are increasingly looking to SAF as a cornerstone of aviation’s decarbonization strategy. But is it enough? And what will it take to make SAF the industry standard rather than an expensive niche product?

The Urgency: Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

Aviation currently accounts for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, a figure expected to rise as air travel demand grows. While other industries are transitioning to electrification, aircraft remain heavily dependent on liquid fuels due to their energy density and reliability.

SAF presents a compelling alternative. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). The benefits extend beyond carbon reduction: SAF also produces fewer sulfur oxides and particulate matter, improving air quality around airports.

Beyond environmental concerns, SAF enhances energy security by diversifying fuel sources. Instead of relying on petroleum imports, countries can develop domestic SAF production, leveraging agricultural waste, industrial byproducts, and even captured CO₂.

What Is SAF Made From?

SAF isn’t a single product but rather a category of fuels derived from various sustainable sources. Unlike experimental energy solutions, SAF is already compatible with existing aircraft and airport infrastructure, making it a viable near-term solution.

Bio-Based SAF: Turning Waste into Jet Fuel

One of the primary pathways for SAF production involves biomass-based feedstocks. These sources range from waste oils to agricultural residues:

• Used Cooking Oil & Animal Fats: Waste oils from restaurants and animal processing industries can be refined into SAF. These are considered low-carbon-intensity sources since they repurpose existing waste.

• Lignocellulosic Biomass: Agricultural and forestry residues—such as wood chips, corn stover, and wheat straw—can be processed into SAF without competing with food production.

• Sugars & Starches: Although less common due to food security concerns, crops like sugarcane and corn can be converted into jet fuel through fermentation.

Synthetic Fuels: The Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Revolution

Beyond biomass, a more futuristic approach involves power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, also known as e-fuels. This method uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen, which is then combined with captured carbon dioxide to create a synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. If powered by wind, solar, or nuclear energy, PtL fuels could potentially achieve near-zero emissions.

Another promising pathway, alcohol-to-jet (AtJ), converts ethanol or butanol—produced from sustainable sources—into jet fuel. This technology is still emerging but could scale significantly as bioethanol production expands.

Challenges to Scaling Up SAF

Despite its promise, SAF accounts for less than 0.1% of global jet fuel consumption today. Scaling up production remains one of the biggest hurdles.

1. Cost Barriers

SAF is currently two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. High production costs stem from the complexity of refining alternative feedstocks and the limited availability of processing infrastructure. Without strong incentives, airlines may struggle to justify the switch.

2. Production Bottlenecks

For SAF to become a mainstream fuel, production capacity must expand exponentially. A 2021 report by the World Economic Forum estimated that global SAF production must increase 1,000 times by 2050 to meet industry net-zero targets.

3. Sustainability & Certification

Not all SAF is created equal. Some biofuels, if not carefully sourced, can contribute to deforestation, water depletion, or competition with food supplies. To prevent unintended environmental consequences, stringent certification frameworks—such as those developed by CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation)—are crucial.

4. Policy & Incentives

Governments play a critical role in SAF adoption. Tax credits, fuel mandates, and direct subsidies can help bridge the cost gap. The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced a blender tax credit for SAF, while the European Union is moving toward mandating minimum SAF usage for flights departing from EU airports.

Where We Stand: The Future of SAF

Momentum for SAF is growing. Airlines, airports, and fuel producers are ramping up investments, and governments are enacting policies to accelerate adoption.

• Major airlines—including United, Delta, and British Airways—have pledged to increase SAF usage, with some setting targets as high as 10% SAF by 2030.

• Boeing and Airbus are testing aircraft on 100% SAF to pave the way for future approvals.

• Oil giants like Shell and BP are investing billions into SAF refineries, betting on long-term demand growth.

The road ahead remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: if aviation is to thrive in a carbon-constrained world, SAF must move from the fringes to the mainstream. Whether through policy, technological breakthroughs, or shifts in consumer behavior, the next decade will determine whether sustainable aviation fuel can truly take flight.",https://i0.wp.com/aviatealabama.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/create-a-high-resolution-highly-detailed-image-for-a-blog-post.png?fit=1024%2C768&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-20 13:56:09.179600

However, the city's ability to rebuild and adapt after extreme weather events has created unique investment opportunities in sectors like aviation and tourism. Recent typhoons—Super Typhoon Saola (2023), Typhoon Yagi (2024), and Typhoon Wipha (2025)—have tested Hong Kong's infrastructure and operational resilience, but also revealed a robust recovery framework. This article analyzes how these sectors rebound post-typhoon and why they represent compelling long-term investment prospects.

Aviation: A Model of Resilience and Innovation

The aviation sector in Hong Kong has demonstrated remarkable adaptability in post-typhoon recovery. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) is a prime example. During Typhoon Wipha in July 2025, the Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) activated contingency protocols, including emergency rest centres and AI-driven passenger flow analytics, to manage 100,000 stranded passengers. Despite the cancellation of 500 flights, operations resumed within 24 hours, with 400 flights resuming by the afternoon. This efficiency is underpinned by the Three Runway System (3RS), a HK$141.5 billion project scheduled for completion in 2024, which diversifies runway configurations and reduces single-point failure risks.

Technological innovations further bolster resilience. Cathay Pacific and the Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) are accelerating adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which cuts lifecycle emissions by 80%. This aligns with global decarbonization trends, positioning the sector for regulatory and market-driven growth. HAECO, a key airport services provider, has also integrated solar PV systems and cooling paints to reduce energy dependency during outages.

Tourism: Rebounding Through Strategic Partnerships

The tourism sector, though more vulnerable to typhoon disruptions, has shown strong rebounds. For instance, after Typhoon Wipha, Hong Kong Disneyland and other attractions reopened swiftly, leveraging partnerships with local airlines to attract stranded passengers. The closure of 500 flights during Wipha created a temporary surge in demand for local tourism, with hotels and dining sectors reporting 15–20% revenue spikes in the following week.

Historical data reveals a pattern of recovery. After Super Typhoon Saola (2023), which caused HK$0.48 billion in damages, visitor numbers rebounded within six weeks, driven by discounted travel packages and promotional campaigns. The government's collaboration with airlines and tour operators to offer “post-typhoon deals” has become a standard practice, mitigating long-term economic impacts.

Lessons from Recent Typhoons

Comparing recovery timelines from 2023 to 2025 highlights a trend of increasing efficiency. For example:

- Super Typhoon Saola (2023): Full airport operations resumed within 36 hours; tourism sector recovered 90% of pre-typhoon revenue in 60 days.

- Typhoon Yagi (2024): 48-hour recovery timeline; tourism rebounds accelerated by 30% compared to 2023.

- Typhoon Wipha (2025): 24-hour recovery; tourism revenue rebounded to 95% of pre-typhoon levels within 21 days.

This improvement is attributed to enhanced infrastructure, digital tools, and policy coordination. The AAHK's use of AI-driven weather forecasting and real-time passenger analytics has reduced recovery costs by an estimated 12% annually.

Investment Thesis: A Dual-Track Approach

Aviation Infrastructure Plays:

Hong Kong Airport Authority (0014.HK): The 3RS project ensures long-term capacity growth and operational redundancy. Its stock has outperformed regional peers by 8% annually since 2023.

Cathay Pacific (0293.HK): Adoption of SAF and partnerships with HKSAFC position it as a leader in sustainable aviation. Its post-typhoon recovery performance has historically outpaced competitors.

Tourism-Linked Sectors:

Hotel Chains and Leisure Operators: Companies like Hotel Chain A and Disney Resort Operators benefit from post-typhoon demand spikes and government-led promotional campaigns.

Local Restaurants and Retailers: Quick-service chains and duty-free stores see a 20–30% revenue boost post-typhoon due to stranded passenger spending.

Risks and Mitigation

While the investment case is strong, risks include climate volatility and regulatory changes. However, Hong Kong's proactive approach—such as the HK$141.5 billion 3RS project and SAF adoption—mitigates these concerns. Diversifying across aviation and tourism assets also reduces sector-specific exposure.

Conclusion

Hong Kong's aviation and tourism sectors exemplify how strategic infrastructure, technology, and policy coordination can transform typhoon-related disruptions into opportunities. For investors, these sectors offer not only resilience but also alignment with global trends in sustainability and digital transformation. As typhoon frequency rises, the ability to recover swiftly and profitably will become a critical differentiator—making Hong Kong's post-typhoon rebound a compelling long-term investment theme.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-20 10:56:49.942344

A new Channel 5 documentary, Lip-Reading The Royals: The Secret Conversations, which aired last night, featured a forensic lip reader analysing a charming family moment from last year's Trooping the Colour.

On Saturday, June 14, the Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, Princes George and Louis and Princess Charlotte, joined King Charles and Queen Camilla on the Buckingham Palace balcony to witness a flypast by the Red Arrows.

However, lip reader Nicola Hickling provided insight into how William issued a fatherly order to his children as they observed the spectacle. It appears that George was also struck by something slightly closer to Earth.

Nicola suggests that William instructs his children: ""Eyes up to the sky."" Following this, all three look upwards, before George turns to his father and remarks: ""The crowd is so loud.""

She further noted that a gesture made by Louis indicated he had spotted a propeller, prompting George to ask: ""Where?"" Subsequently, Kate asked her youngest: 'Wow, did you enjoy that?""

Cristo Foufas, a royal analyst, said: ""Kate and William immediately go into mum and dad mode then. 'Can you see it? Oh, they're coming around again', you know, 'Did you enjoy it?' All of those sorts of things they're saying to make it a special moment for their children.""

He claimed that the couple must have seen a ""million flypasts"" and that the displays were likely as ""dull as ditch water"" to them by now, but William and Kate weren't ""letting that get to them"".

Cristo added that the future King and Queen were ""making themselves enthusiastic"" about it and attempting to make the proceedings ""really special"" for their children.

Trooping the Colour has celebrated the official birthday of the British monarch for over 260 years, with more than 1,400 soldiers, 200 horses, and 400 musicians coming together annually for the ceremony.

This year's event, which showcased the traditional pageantry, saw Charles and Camilla participating in a carriage procession down the Mall towards Horse Guards Parade, according to BBC reports.

At Charles's behest, the Royals donned black armbands to honour the victims of the Air India crash, which sadly resulted in the loss of 241 passengers and crew, along with at least eight individuals on the ground.

In a nod to sustainability, the Red Arrows used a greener fuel for the 2025 display, comprising sustainable aviation fuel and biofuel, creating the iconic coloured trail.

Selama ini, kebutuhan energi untuk kehidupan dilayani oleh bahan bakar fosil selama lebih dari 100 tahun. Namun, bahan bakar ini akan habis cadangannya dan dapat berdampak bagi lingkungan, di antaranya global warming dan climate change. Oleh karena itu, diperlukan bahan bakar atau energi alternatif yang dapat menjamin kehidupan berkelanjutan.

Berdasarkan Outlook Energi Indonesia, data pasokan energi primer Indonesia terbagi menjadi pasokan energi primer fosil dan nonfosil. Diperkirakan porsi energi primer fosil terutama batubara mencapai di atas 40%, sedangkan energi primer nonfosil, yaitu energi terbarukan dan energi baru, dari segi bioenergi dan biofuel diharapkan di atas 60%.

Hal yang mendasari penelitian ini salah satunya karena sektor pembangkit listrik, transportasi, dan industri berperan utama dalam emisi CO2. Beliau mengembangkan Model Sistem Pengelolaan Energi yang menjaga tiga pilar, yakni ekonomi, sosial, dan lingkungan. Sistem ini menggunakan milestone ekonomi dengan PDB/kapita memenuhi target 2045, lingkungan dengan emisi CO2 memenuhi target 2050, dan milestone sosial berupa lapangan kerja sektor energi diharapkan meningkat.

ITB melakukan kolaborasi bersama PT. Pamapersada Nusantara dalam pengembangan teknologi peningkatan kualitas batubara (Coal Upgrading Technology, CUT) dan pembangunan pabrik percobaannya (Pilot Plant). Cadangan sumber daya batubara di Indonesia sejumlah 35 miliar ton tergolong Low Rank Coal sehingga perlu ditingkatkan kualitasnya dengan mengurangi kandungan airnya dan mengkompaksi menjadi briket.

Selain itu, beliau membahas pengembangan teknologi konversi gambut menjadi bahan bakar padat setara batubara melalui proses torefaksi. Indonesia memiliki cadangan gambut terbesar ketiga di dunia setelah Kanada dan Rusia, sejumlah 200 miliar ton. Gambut merupakan cikal bakal batubara, yang melalui proses peatification dan coalification.

Beliau mengatakan percepatan proses pembatubaraan (coalification) dari gambut yang secara natural perlu ratusan tahun menjadi hanya 30 menit. “Kami yang terdiri dari saya, Ir.

Strategic Expansion and Market Relevance

This new route signifies VietJet Thailand’s continued strategic expansion in the Indian market, following earlier services connecting Mumbai to Bangkok and Phuket. Kolkata stands as an essential gateway for travel between eastern India and Thailand, ranking third behind Delhi and Mumbai in terms of passenger volume to Bangkok.

The introduction of Thai VietJet Air as a budget airline on this route is expected to increase competition, potentially driving airfare reductions and providing passengers with more travel options. This addition aligns with the growing trend of low-cost carriers (LCCs) expanding their reach beyond traditional domestic markets into more extensive international routes.

Impact on Global Travel and Aviation

The launch of Bangkok–Kolkata flights underscores a larger global aviation trend where budget carriers actively expand their footprints in strategically important routes. Such expansions exert competitive pressure on traditional, full-service airlines, pushing them to either lower fares or improve their service offerings.

Moreover, VietJet Thailand’s new flights are likely to stimulate increased passenger traffic between Thailand and India. Both nations have significant cultural and commercial ties, and easier travel access could further enhance tourism, business interactions, educational exchanges, and healthcare tourism.

Enhancing Regional Connectivity

Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok’s primary international hub, saw over 50 million passengers in recent years, driven by expanded infrastructure such as a third runway and additional terminal facilities. The Kolkata route enhances Bangkok’s position as a vital connection hub in Southeast Asia, providing travelers with improved regional connectivity to neighboring countries.

,,2025-07-20 07:01:57+00:00,Simple Flying,Why Did Boeing Build The 777X With The Longest Wings Ever On A Twinjet?,Luke Diaz,,,,,https://simpleflying.com/why-boeing-build-777x-longest-wingspan/,"The result of those giant wings, per Boeing, is a claimed 10% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to the Airbus A350-1000.
The wing’s higher aspect ratio is the key to the improved aerodynamics, but the folding wingtips are what make that possible.
Unlike the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, whose folding wings have an actuating system made by Moog Aerospace, the mechanism in the 777X will be provided by Liebherr Aerospace.
The 777X Has Uniquely Bird-Like Wings Inspired by birds, the new wings were designed to allow the giant twinjet to glide through the air with unparalleled efficiency.
The distinctive curved form happens as the 777X wing flexes under load.","Boeing’s highly anticipated next-generation widebody, the 777X, has made headlines for its stunning curved wing form with a span of 235 feet (71.8 meters) that beats even the gigantic 747 and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy by 10 feet (3 meters). On top of the sheer length of the highly flexible wings, the one-of-a-kind folding wingtips are something that has never been seen before in commercial aviation.

The Liebherr Aerospace folding mechanisms allowed the 777X to add 11 feet of wing on both sides without shattering the footprint it will maneuver in on the ground at airports around the world. The 777-9 is the longer of the two models currently undergoing testing and certification. It will also be the longest passenger jet ever produced once it is ready for service: at 251 feet (76.7 meters) in length, this makes it longer than both the 747-8 and the Airbus A380.

Even with its massive proportions, the innovative new design allows it to be the most efficient widebody in history. The result of those giant wings, per Boeing, is a claimed 10% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to the Airbus A350-1000. With that in mind, let’s dive into the design and engineering behind the aerodynamics, materials, and other exceptional engineering that produced the marvel that is the 777X.

A Next-Generation Widebody

The Boeing777X will not only have a much larger wingspan and longer fuselage than its predecessor, but it will also have a more spacious, comfortable, and modern cabin with larger windows as well. The advanced composite construction of the jet saves weight and adds strength to make it not only more fuel efficient but capable of hauling more cargo and more passengers while flying further than anything else in its class.

The gigantic General Electric GE9X turbofans that will power the largest widebody twinjet in aviation history, the 777-9, are also the biggest engines ever fitted to a commercial plane. The 777X series will make a list of firsts in the history of flying when it becomes fully operational.

The era of double-decker,quadjets is over, following the shuttering of Airbus A380 production in 2021 and Boeing 747 production in 2023. Only a handful of 747s remain in operation, with newer models primarily serving cargo operators, and the largest operator of A380s in the world, Emirates, is currently refurbishing as many of the giants as it can.

The future of ultra-long-haul flying and massive commercial jets will rest firmly on the shoulders of the 777X series alongside its competitor, the A350 family. These giant twinjets will also be good for the environment as they produce far fewer emissions than quadjets. Looking to the future, ICAO notes that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is also in the works by both Airbus and Boeing, promising a cleaner and better flying industry for all.

It All Comes Down To The Wingspan

By generating more lift with reduced drag, the 777X's extended wingspan improves aerodynamic efficiency and lowers fuel consumption. The wing’s higher aspect ratio is the key to the improved aerodynamics, but the folding wingtips are what make that possible. The engine cowlings that surround its massive GE9X engines under the wings have also been designed for laminar airflow to complement the new and improved wing shape.

Scott Fancher, the Vice President and General Manager of Airplane Development at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said after announcing the 777X at the 2013 Dubai Air Show (per Boeing) that:

""The 777X builds on the heritage of the 777-300ER and incorporates many advanced technologies designed for the 787 to create a new standard for widebody airplanes. It will truly be a worthy successor to the 777-300ER.""

After the destruction of the Antonov AN-225 'Mriya' in Ukraine by Russian air attacks, the only planes left in the world that beat the 777X in size are the Airbus A380 and the Stratolaunch Roc. The Roc has an incredible 385 feet (117 meters) total span, and owing to its special mission of air launching space vehicles, it is the largest plane ever built by exterior dimensions.

The Roc, however, won’t be flying any passengers around, so, with the A380 at just under 262 feet (80 meters) wide, the 777X will be the second widest of all commercial jets. According to a report by the Air Current, Boeing claims the longer total wing length is 3% more fuel efficient than a similar design with a winglet instead of the folding tip. The wingtips are almost completely made of carbon fiber, as is much of the total wing structure.

The First Of Its Kind: Examining The 777X's Folding Wings

The additional 22 feet (7 meters) of wingspan provided by the wingtips is largely how the 777X attains 10% lower fuel burn than older 777s and the A350. The 777X becomes a Category E aircraft when the wingtips are folded down. Since the majority of the world's major airports are Category E airports, especially legacy 777 hubs, it is essential for the carriers that will operate them to retain access to the same airport infrastructure, including runways, taxiways, and terminals.

Boeing has a lot of experience with folding wings thanks to the US military, but no commercial aircraft in the world has ever been outfitted with such a device. The folding wingtip will bring one of the most radical visual changes to commercial flying in years, as passengers watch the action of the tips folding down and locking in position before takeoff, or folding up on landing.

Safety is paramount, and failure of the wingtips to fold will ground the 777X, so reliability is essential. Unlike the Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet, whose folding wings have an actuating system made by Moog Aerospace, the mechanism in the 777X will be provided by Liebherr Aerospace. Liebherr is a 75-year-old German-Swiss company and one of Europe’s largest industrial equipment manufacturers across several industries, as well as the first in the world to develop a leading-edge actuation system for commercial aviation.

The wings begin to fold automatically once the huge jet’s ground speed broaches the 50 knot threshold during landing. Boeing inspected over 400 airports to confirm that the 20-second folding time would be sufficient to allow for rapid taxiway exits and smooth ground operations. The new avionics, which are all glass like the 787 Dreamliner, feature a specific display that indicates the position, transition, and status of the wingtips to pilots. The full system is a groundbreaking change to airliner technology.

The 777X Has Uniquely Bird-Like Wings

Inspired by birds, the new wings were designed to allow the giant twinjet to glide through the air with unparalleled efficiency. The wings can bend up to 26 feet from their resting neutral position in flight, which dramatically improves lift and efficient airflow. The distinctive curved form happens as the 777X wing flexes under load.

Dubbed the 'unconstrained wing,' the unique aerodynamic qualities of these huge wings are how the aircraft achieves its top-of-class fuel efficiency and range. The wing design’s higher lift-to-drag ratio, aspect ratio is 10:1 compared to the legacy 777’s 9:1 ratio. That is a longer and narrower wing shape by 10% overall, which is optimal for cruising with the lowest fuel consumption.

The strong yet pliable wing area also increased by roughly 15% in comparison to its predecessor, from 4,702 to 5,562 square feet (436.8 to 516.7 square meters). Not only are the wings larger, stronger, and more aerodynamic they can also store more fuel. The 777X tank capacity can hold up to 350,410 pounds (158,943 kilograms), compared to the 777 at 320,863 lbs (145,541 kilograms). Across the board, the metrics represent a ~10% improvement in many side-by-side comparisons to the outgoing 777 series.

That epic wing flexibility, along with the other enhancements, is thanks to advanced composite materials that are stronger than any of its widebody predecessors. Incredible carbon fiber composites are responsible for the realization of the advanced wing design. We can only hope that the 777X program will reach production soon, and these amazing aircraft will be seen with their folded wingtips on the ramps of airports all around the world.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/length.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 03:56:11.200755

Come potrebbero cambiare i viaggi",Federica Petrucci,,,,,https://quifinanza.it/lifestyle/travel-economy/crisi-carburante-aereo-effetto-prezzi-voli/920335/,"La domanda di carburante aereo sta rallentando a livello globale.

Una frenata che potrebbe sembrare una buona notizia per i viaggiatori italiani, perché suggerisce minori costi per le compagnie aeree e quindi – almeno in teoria – biglietti meno cari.

Ma la realtà, come spesso accade, è ben più sfaccettata. E quella che potrebbe diventare una conclusione logica in realtà è un interrogativo. Una domanda da porsi, cioè: assisteremo a un calo dei prezzi o a una riduzione dell’offerta? In altre parole, viaggeremo di più spendendo meno, o voleremo meno perché le tratte diminuiranno?

Cosa sta succedendo al mercato del carburante aereo

Secondo l’ultima analisi condotta da Reuters, la domanda globale di jet fuel è destinata a rimanere sotto i livelli pre-pandemia almeno fino al 2026, a causa di tre fattori principali: il calo dei viaggiatori cinesi all’estero, le politiche restrittive sull’immigrazione negli Stati Uniti e l’efficienza crescente dei nuovi aerei.

In particolare, la Cina – seconda economia del pianeta – continua a puntare sul turismo interno, dopo un periodo prolungato di chiusure e timori legati alla pandemia. I viaggi internazionali dei cittadini cinesi, che rappresentavano una quota importante della domanda di voli long-haul (a lungo raggio), sono ancora ben lontani dai numeri del 2019. Le compagnie aeree internazionali stanno dunque riducendo l’offerta verso il mercato cinese, con ripercussioni dirette anche sull’equilibrio complessivo della domanda di carburante aereo.

Nel frattempo, negli Stati Uniti, le politiche migratorie sempre più stringenti volute dall’amministrazione Trump scoraggiano i turisti stranieri, soprattutto quelli europei. Secondo BMI, società del gruppo Fitch, nel 2025 si prevede un calo del 16,3% degli arrivi internazionali negli USA. E i dati Cirium evidenziano già un -1,2% dei passeggeri britannici diretti oltreoceano rispetto al 2024.

Il paradosso dei carburanti: meno voli, ma più efficienza

Al rallentamento della domanda si aggiunge un altro fattore strutturale, ovvero l’innovazione tecnologica nei velivoli. I nuovi modelli di aerei sono infatti molto più efficienti dal punto di vista energetico. L’A320neo di Airbus, introdotto negli anni 2010, ha ridotto del 15% il consumo di carburante rispetto alla generazione precedente. Boeing non è da meno, con il 737 Max che offre un risparmio analogo. E per il futuro, Airbus promette un aereo ancora più performante, in grado di tagliare i consumi del 20-30% rispetto alla linea attuale, anche se l’entrata in servizio è prevista tra 10-15 anni.

Questo significa che anche se i voli non diminuiscono drasticamente, la quantità di carburante utilizzato per trasportare lo stesso numero di passeggeri cala sensibilmente. Di conseguenza, la domanda di jet fuel si raffredda, influenzando l’intero comparto petrolifero. Non a caso, il carburante per aerei pesa per circa il 7% sulla domanda globale di petrolio, e una sua contrazione può contribuire ad allentare la pressione sui prezzi del greggio.

Prezzi dei voli davvero in calo?

Per i consumatori italiani, la speranza è che un minor costo del carburante si traduca in tariffe aeree più basse. Tuttavia, questa equazione non è affatto automatica. Infatti, mentre l’efficienza dei mezzi e il calo della domanda potrebbero ridurre i costi operativi delle compagnie, altri fattori potrebbero controbilanciare questo effetto.

In primis, è probabile che di fronte a un calo dei profitti (per l’abbassamento dei prezzi) le compagnie optino per la riduzione delle tratte. Se alcune destinazioni, specialmente long-haul, diventano meno redditizie per le compagnie (soprattutto in assenza dei turisti cinesi o statunitensi), potrebbero essere cancellate o operate con minore frequenza. Il risultato? Meno concorrenza e, quindi, prezzi stabili o persino in aumento su alcune rotte.

Secondariamente, le compagnie aeree si trovano ad affrontare un contesto macroeconomico incerto, tra inflazione dei servizi, aumento del costo del personale e investimenti richiesti per la transizione ecologica (incluso l’utilizzo di carburanti sostenibili come il SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel – ben più costosi del jet fuel tradizionale). È quindi probabile che cerchino di mantenere i margini, evitando di trasferire ai passeggeri eventuali risparmi sui carburanti.

Cosa cambia per chi viaggia dall’Italia?

Per i viaggiatori italiani, l’impatto di questo scenario sarà diverso a seconda della destinazione e della tipologia di volo. Ecco alcune implicazioni chiave:

Le tratte verso gli Stati Uniti e l’Asia potrebbero essere ridotte, oppure operate con meno frequenza. È plausibile che l’offerta venga ridimensionata, con impatti sui prezzi e sulla disponibilità, specialmente in alta stagione.

Considerando invece i voli intra-europei, l’Europa continua a registrare una domanda sostenuta, anche se i dati IATA mostrano una stagnazione nei voli domestici in alcuni Paesi. Tuttavia, i prezzi potrebbero restare elevati a causa della ridotta concorrenza in alcuni mercati.

Si aprono invece opportunità per mete meno tradizionali ma più economiche dal punto di vista operativo. Compagnie aeree low-cost potrebbero rafforzare l’offerta su rotte verso Nord Africa, Balcani e Turchia, dove i costi sono inferiori e la domanda cresce.",https://quifinanza.it/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/07/Crisi-carburante-aerei-effetto-sui-voli.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 03:56:17.376326

The Boom Supersonic aerospace company is leading the charge in building a new generation of passenger jets.
He said: ""Supersonic travel still demands more fuel, stricter maintenance, and higher ticket prices.
If those align, then yes, supersonic travel could make a comeback.
Legally and ethically, ""the return of supersonic travel must be accompanied by a modernisation of air passenger rights, ensuring that speed doesn’t come at the cost of fairness,"" he said.","There has been a flurry of momentum in the supersonic travel industry in the past few years, with multiple companies across the globe vying to be the first to relaunch commercial flights at the speed of sound, which has been nonexistent since Concorde's grounding over 20 years ago. For example, the Colorado-based Boom Supersonic company has made significant progress with its upcoming Overture jet, while Fly Concorde Ltd, a UK-based initiative, aims to revive the iconic Concorde experience.

What's more, early last month, US President Donald Trump issued an executive order ending the Federal Aviation Administration's 55-year ban on supersonic flights within US airspace. The noise rules had been in place since 1968 and a corresponding FAA restriction on flights exceeding Mach 1 was established two years later. These rules previously prevented Concorde operations on transcontinental flights. Yet, while Mr Trump's ""Concorde Bill"" has opened the doors for the development of supersonic travel and excitement is growing, according to Anton Radchenko, founder and CEO of AirAdvisor, ""we need to balance that excitement with the operational, environmental and safety realities that still stand in the way"".

Mr Radchenko told The Express: ""We’re seeing some real momentum in this space, with notable developments such as Boom Supersonic securing multiple partnerships, prototypes in progress and the recent Concorde Bill in the U.S. lifting a major regulatory hurdle. But these developments are just the beginning.""

The Boom Supersonic aerospace company is leading the charge in building a new generation of passenger jets. Overture is Boom's flagship aircraft, targeting Mach 1.7 - about 1,300 mph - and plans to fly aircraft with capacity for 64 to 80 passengers by 2029. Boom has secured pre-orders from major airlines including United, American Airlines and Japan Airlines, highlighting just how much commercial interest there is in the industry. Boom promises to slash the travel time for long-haul flights, with flights between London and New York cited to be just 3.5 hours.

Concorde retired in 2003 after nearly 30 years of service. However, it was plagued with problems. It was expensive to maintain and fuel, with limited seating and no economy class. Its sonic booms and high fuel consumption also drew criticism and limited where it could fly. The final nail in the coffin was the fateful Air France Flight 4590, which crashed in 2000 and killed all 109 on board and four on the ground. After this, confidence in its flights fell and never fully recovered. This also coincided with a downturn in global air travel after the 9/11 attacks, which further reduced demand for luxury supersonic flights.

However, Fly Concorde Ltd, a UK startup, has emerged with a mission to bring back the legendary Concorde. Backed by international engineers and aviation entrepreneurs, the company's new aircraft being an updated version of the original Concorde with many innovative features. The new jets are set to run on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), be 50% lighter than their 20th-century predecessor and operate at altitudes around 60,000 feet.

However, Mr Radchenko said: ""Realistically, we are still at least five to eight years away from commercially viable supersonic routes. Technological readiness, public perception and regulatory harmonisation across global airspace will all need to align, and that’s a tall order.

Economic viability, he added, is also a significant hurdle.

He said: ""Supersonic travel still demands more fuel, stricter maintenance, and higher ticket prices. The Concorde’s downfall wasn’t just about noise or a crash; it was also that it simply wasn’t profitable. For it to return sustainably, it must work not just for business-class elites but for broader operational models that airlines can support long-term.

The expert explained that passenger rights will also need to be overhauled to adapt to this new, faster form of travel. Current compensation frameworks, such as EU261 or the US Department of Transportation's rules, are based on traditional flight schedules and operational norms. For example, delays of two or three hours trigger specific entitlements.

""But what happens when a supersonic flight, which promises to cut London-New York to under four hours, gets delayed by just one hour?"" Mr Radchenko asked. ""In relative terms, that’s a major disruption, yet under current rules, it may not qualify for compensation. Regulators will need to revisit how delay thresholds are calculated in the context of much shorter scheduled flight times.""

So, realistically, how close are we to being able to fly with our hair on fire again? According to Mr Radchenko, ""I don’t think it’s likely to resume on a commercial scale before 2030, but we are certainly closer than ever before.

""The foundational pieces are being put in place. What’s needed now is global collaboration, responsible rollout, and public trust. If those align, then yes, supersonic travel could make a comeback.

Legally and ethically, ""the return of supersonic travel must be accompanied by a modernisation of air passenger rights, ensuring that speed doesn’t come at the cost of fairness,"" he said.

He added: ""The goal should be to enhance both the travel experience and consumer confidence, and that means embedding robust protections from the very first takeoff.""",https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/78/1200x630/6303408.jpg,N,,2025-07-20 03:56:22.445803

Those who align with Hong Kong's resilience-driven strategy are poised to thrive in an uncertain future.","In an era of escalating climate volatility, the resilience of critical infrastructure has emerged as a cornerstone of long-term investment strategy. Typhoon Wipha, which battered Hong Kong in July 2025, offers a compelling case study. With over 200 flights cancelled, public transport suspended, and Cathay Pacific's operations grinding to a halt, the storm exposed vulnerabilities in the city's aviation and logistics ecosystems. Yet, it also catalyzed a surge in strategic investments aimed at fortifying infrastructure and adopting risk-mitigation technologies. For investors, this dual narrative of disruption and innovation presents opportunities to capitalize on sectors poised for transformation.

The Immediate Fallout: A Test of Resilience

Typhoon Wipha's intensification forced the Hong Kong Observatory to issue its highest storm warning (No. 10), with hurricane-force winds and torrential rains paralyzing the city. The Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) became a focal point of disruption, as Cathay Pacific, HK Express, and other carriers cancelled flights en masse. Over 280 flights were scrubbed in two days, with passenger operations suspended entirely for 12 hours. The ripple effects extended beyond aviation: ferry services, MTR lines, and road transport to the airport were shuttered, compounding logistical bottlenecks.

The financial toll was staggering. Airlines incurred losses from waived rebooking fees, stranded passengers, and operational delays. For HKIA, the cost of deploying 1,000 staff, opening temporary rest areas, and maintaining 24/7 retail operations added to the burden. Yet, the airport's swift activation of contingency systems—such as the Queue Ticket System for taxis and emergency rest centres—highlighted the value of preparedness.

Long-Term Infrastructure: Building for the Future

The Three Runway System (3RS), a HK$141.5 billion project, has become a linchpin of Hong Kong's resilience strategy. Scheduled for full completion by late 2024, the 3RS will expand HKIA's capacity to 120 million passengers and 10 million tonnes of cargo annually. This expansion not only addresses pandemic-era recovery but also future-proofs the airport against extreme weather. By diversifying runway configurations and integrating automated systems, the 3RS reduces single-point failure risks, a critical factor in storm-prone regions.

Beyond runways, the airport's “Airport City” vision—encompassing retail hubs like 11 SKIES and a 20,000-seat performance venue—positions HKIA as a multifunctional hub. This diversification mitigates revenue risks tied to flight cancellations, creating a buffer during weather disruptions. For investors, the 3RS represents a blue-chip infrastructure play, with its completion expected to drive long-term passenger and cargo growth.

Risk-Mitigation Technologies: Innovation in Action

Hong Kong's aviation sector is also embracing cutting-edge technologies to counter climate risks. The Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK) has deployed AI-driven weather forecasting tools and real-time passenger flow analytics to optimize resource allocation during typhoons. These systems enable proactive staff deployment and dynamic queue management, minimizing passenger discomfort and operational costs.

HAECO, a key airport services provider, has emerged as a leader in green technology. Its expansion of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems—now generating 4 million kWh annually—reduces reliance on grid power during outages. HAECO's adoption of cooling paints and LED lighting further cuts energy use, aligning with its 2030 electrification roadmap. For investors, HAECO's sustainability initiatives signal a shift toward ESG-aligned infrastructure, a sector with strong growth potential.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is another frontier. The Hong Kong Sustainable Aviation Fuel Coalition (HKSAFC) has spurred collaboration among airlines, fuel producers, and regulators to accelerate SAF adoption. Cathay Pacific and HKBAC now offer SAF blends, reducing lifecycle emissions by 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. With global SAF demand projected to reach 10% of total fuel use by 2030, investors in SAF producers and logistics enablers stand to benefit from this green transition.

Global Trends and Investment Implications

Globally, the aviation sector is racing to meet net-zero targets. The International Air Transport Association's (IATA) SAF Registry, launched in 2025, has streamlined tracking of SAF transactions, fostering transparency and scalability. Meanwhile, hydrogen-powered aircraft and battery-electric propulsion remain in early testing phases, with Airbus and ZeroAvia leading trials. These technologies, though nascent, could redefine the industry by 2040, offering investors high-growth but high-risk opportunities.

Hong Kong's strategic location as a Greater Bay Area (GBA) nexus amplifies its relevance. The HZMB Bridge and HKIA Logistics Park are enhancing cargo connectivity, while AI-driven cargo handling systems at HACTL optimize throughput. For logistics investors, the GBA's integration with Hong Kong's climate-resilient infrastructure presents a compelling value proposition.

Conclusion: Navigating the Storm

Typhoon Wipha underscored the fragility of even the most advanced infrastructure. Yet, Hong Kong's response—combining robust expansion projects with innovative risk-mitigation technologies—demonstrates a forward-looking approach. For investors, this blend of physical resilience (via 3RS) and digital resilience (via AI and SAF) offers a blueprint for long-term success.

Key Investment Opportunities:

1. Infrastructure Giants: Stake in the 3RS through AAHK or construction contractors.

2. Green Tech Pioneers: HAECO's solar and electrification initiatives.

3. SAF Ecosystems: Invest in HKSAFC-aligned companies or global SAF producers.

4. Logistics Innovators: HACTL's AI-driven cargo solutions and GBA-linked logistics hubs.

As climate volatility intensifies, the aviation and logistics sectors will require continuous reinvention.

BRUSSELS – The European aviation sector, represented by the DESTINATION 2050 partners*, together with fuel suppliers (Fuels Europe, Hydrogen Europe, Project SkyPower) and cargo and express delivery operators (European Cargo Alliance, European Express Association), issued an urgent call for accelerated policy support to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

The joint call highlights the pressing challenges of affordable SAF deployment across Europe. Chief amongst them is that the current SAF market remains nascent – HEFA‑based fuels (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) are the only commercially available option today and face a substantial cost gap compared to conventional kerosene. At the same time, next‑generation SAF pathways – such as e‑SAF and advanced biofuels – continue to struggle with access to investment, in particular in reaching Final Investment Decisions (FID).

In response, the industry has laid out a 10‑point action plan, designed to address early‑mover disadvantages and catalyse the scale‑up of SAF production and deployment. The plan lays out the key regulatory and financial measures needed to de‑risk investment, bridge the significant cost gap and incentivise innovation in fuel technologies critical to decarbonising air transport.

This call to action was handed over today to Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, during the Implementation Dialogue he convened to specifically address the ramp up of renewable and low‑carbon transport fuel production.

The initiative comes at a pivotal moment, as the European Commission prepares to unveil its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in Q3 2025 – which is expected to finally provide the support needed to effectively accelerate and deploy SAF and related infrastructure.

Participating in the Implementation Dialogue, the ACI Europe President and CEO of Fraport, Stefan Schulte commented: “By setting SAF mandates, ReFuelEU Aviation provided the ‘sticks’ needed for legal certainty, but failed to provide the ‘carrots’ – namely, the financial incentives and flexibility mechanisms required to ensure SAF is produced at scale and at competitive prices. Today, the industry has come together to present a 10‑point plan to address this imbalance. It is now crucial that the Commission moves swiftly to create the supportive policy environment needed to develop Europe’s SAF market. Only then can we remain globally competitive and achieve our shared goal of net zero emissions by 2050.”",https://www.traveldailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airbus-1200x580.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:02:32.734460

A National Push Toward Sustainability

President Ramaphosa’s plan for climate leadership is already changing the game. Through initiatives like the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), South Africa has attracted over R193 billion in investments and added more than 6,300 MW of renewable energy to the national grid. It’s a clear sign: South Africa is serious about building a green economy that creates jobs and protects the environment.

South Africans Expect More from Brands

Sustainability here isn’t a buzzword — it’s a movement. From Cape Town to Durban, consumers are making it clear: they want brands that care about the environment. Companies that take real action don’t just stand out; they secure trust and loyalty from customers who want to shop with a conscience. In a market where reputation matters, going green is fast becoming a must-have.

DHL’s GoGreen Portfolio: Simple Steps, Real Impact

Logistics keeps our economy moving, but it also comes with a carbon footprint. DHL recognises this and has been investing in sustainable logistics for years. The GoGreen portfolio is designed to make it easy for any business, big or small, to lower its environmental impact and show customers it’s serious about sustainability.

DHL GoGreen offers climate-neutral delivery by offsetting the carbon emissions from every shipment through certified global climate projects. It’s a straightforward way for South African businesses to demonstrate climate action — whether it’s supporting renewable energy or reforestation. With GoGreen, every parcel delivered is a step towards a carbon-neutral future.

Instead of simply offsetting emissions, GoGreen Plus lets South African companies actively reduce their supply chain emissions within DHL’s own operations. Through the “book & claim” model, you can invest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Sustainable Marine Fuel, bio-LNG, and electric vehicles. The environmental benefits are allocated to your shipments, verified by independent auditors like SGS, and reported in line with global standards such as ISO 14083 and the GLEC Framework.

Why Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matters

SAF is a game changer for logistics. Made from renewable sources like used cooking oil or agricultural waste, it can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, or even 94% in some cases. For South African businesses shipping overseas, using SAF means you can substantially reduce your Scope 3 emissions — those tricky, indirect emissions from outsourced transport — and make real progress towards net-zero targets.

Easy Wins for Local Businesses

You don’t have to be a giant corporation to make a difference. DHL’s Green Logistics Toolkit recommends practical steps: switch to LED lighting, install rooftop solar panels, or use warehouse energy-management systems to cut Scope 1 and 2 emissions. And by choosing GoGreen Plus when you ship, you’re taking action on Scope 3 — without needing to overhaul your entire supply chain. Eco-friendly packaging and AI-powered route optimisation add up to a lighter footprint and happier customers.

Global Proof, Local Opportunity

More than 40,000 businesses across Asia-Pacific are already using GoGreen Plus and seeing measurable results. In Malaysia, AFFIN Group is on track to cut shipment emissions by 70%. In Taiwan, CHIMEI Corporation is aiming for a full 100% reduction using SAF. These stories show what’s possible for South African exporters and importers looking to boost their sustainability credentials and stand out in a competitive global market.",https://www.dhl.com/discover/content/dam/south-africa/logistics-advice/sustainability/Building a greener Future.jpg,N,,2025-07-19 23:02:38.267558

Sebagian kalangan mempertanyakan relevansinya terhadap kebutuhan pariwisata nasional saat ini. Namun, jika ditelaah dengan pendekatan strategis dan kerangka pembangunan jangka panjang, langkah ini justru menandai fondasi penting bagi transformasi besar sektor penerbangan dan pariwisata Indonesia.

Garuda Indonesia bukan sekadar maskapai penerbangan. Ia adalah flag carrier, simbol kehadiran negara dalam ekosistem langit global. Dalam sejarahnya, Garuda lahir di tengah perjuangan kemerdekaan dan tumbuh menjadi kebanggaan Indonesia di kancah dunia.

Maka, ketika Presiden Prabowo menyatakan tekad untuk membesarkannya kembali, yang dimaksud bukan sekadar bisnis penerbangan, tetapi pemulihan martabat udara nasional.

A. Diplomasi Ekonomi dan Akses Pasar Global

Pembelian 50 pesawat Boeing merupakan bagian dari diplomasi ekonomi yang lebih besar. Sebagai hasil negosiasi bilateral dengan Amerika Serikat, tarif ekspor produk Indonesia ke pasar AS berhasil ditekan dari 32 persen menjadi 19 persen.

Imbal balik dagang ini membuka ruang lebih luas bagi pelaku UMKM, produk pariwisata, dan industri kreatif Indonesia untuk menembus pasar global, terutama dari daerah-daerah destinasi wisata seperti Bali, Yogyakarta, Mandalika, dan Danau Toba.

Jika dipandang dari sudut konektivitas, kebijakan ini menjawab salah satu titik lemah paling krusial dalam daya saing pariwisata Indonesia.

Menurut Travel and Tourism Development Index 2024 yang dirilis World Economic Forum, Indonesia masih berada di posisi ke-52 dari 119 negara dalam aspek infrastruktur transportasi udara. Artinya, meskipun destinasi dan kekayaan budaya kita menduduki peringkat 6 besar dunia, ekosistem konektivitasnya masih tertinggal jauh dari potensi.

Pembelian pesawat berbadan besar seperti Boeing 777 juga tidak bisa hanya dipahami melalui lensa pariwisata massal. Sebaliknya, pesawat-pesawat ini membuka peluang pembukaan rute jarak jauh langsung (direct long-haul) ke pasar wisatawan berkualitas dari Eropa, Timur Tengah, dan Amerika.

Ini sejalan dengan arah baru pariwisata Indonesia yang berfokus pada quality tourism yakni mendorong wisatawan dengan masa tinggal lebih lama, pengeluaran lebih besar, dan kontribusi ekonomi yang lebih berkelanjutan.

B. Infrastruktur Bandara Sudah Lebih Siap

Kritik mengenai keterbatasan bandara dalam menerima pesawat jumbo memang relevan. Namun, data pembangunan infrastruktur udara sejak 2015 menunjukkan arah yang progresif.

Bandara seperti Soekarno-Hatta, Ngurah Rai, Kualanamu, Sultan Hasanuddin, hingga Yogyakarta International Airport telah siap melayani pesawat berbadan besar. Pemerintah juga terus merevitalisasi dan memperluas bandara di destinasi-destinasi prioritas sebagai bagian dari Proyek Strategis Nasional.

C. Menuju Energi Bersih: Bioavtur dan SAF

Argumen lain menyangkut harga avtur yang mahal dibanding negara tetangga seperti Singapura. Namun dalam konteks transisi energi, Indonesia tengah melangkah menuju penggunaan bioavtur yang lebih ramah lingkungan.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) berbasis inti sawit, sumber daya yang Indonesia miliki dalam jumlah besar, tengah dikembangkan melalui riset intensif antara Pertamina, BPDPKS, dan sejumlah universitas. Target pemerintah adalah memproduksi 2,4 juta kiloliter SAF pada 2030.

Perlu dicatat, pesawat-pesawat Boeing terbaru telah dirancang kompatibel dengan SAF, menjadikan pembelian ini sebagai bagian dari strategi hijau nasional.

D. Dampak Ekonomi: Konektivitas dan Pertumbuhan PDB Pariwisata

Studi Oxford Economics yang dirilis oleh IATA menunjukkan bahwa setiap kenaikan 10 persen dalam konektivitas udara akan meningkatkan kontribusi sektor pariwisata terhadap PDB sebesar 0,5 persen.

Maka penguatan armada Garuda akan berdampak langsung pada pertumbuhan ekonomi sektor pariwisata yang pada 2023 telah menyumbang lebih dari 3,8 persen terhadap PDB nasional dan berpotensi menembus 5 persen pada tahun 2027 jika didukung konektivitas udara yang kuat dan merata.

Di sisi lain, pengalaman negara seperti Turki yang menjadikan Turkish Airlines sebagai jembatan utama masuknya wisatawan global, atau Emirates yang menjadikan Dubai sebagai hub dunia, menunjukkan bahwa kekuatan maskapai nasional menjadi kunci sukses dalam mengembangkan pariwisata berkelas dunia. Indonesia memiliki peluang serupa dengan menjadikan Jakarta, Denpasar, dan Makassar sebagai simpul udara regional dan global.

E. Garuda adalah Wajah Bangsa Indonesia dan Kunci Transformasi Pariwisata

Konektivitas udara bukan sekadar persoalan logistik. Ia adalah infrastruktur emosional dan simbolik. Setiap maskapai yang mendaratkan pesawatnya di negeri lain membawa pesan, inilah wajah negara kami. Dalam hal ini, Garuda membawa bendera Merah Putih, dan dengan membesarkannya, Indonesia membangun kembali kehormatan dan kepercayaan dunia.

Transformasi pariwisata tidak cukup dengan promosi destinasi atau kampanye digital. Ia memerlukan reformasi struktural, perkuatan maskapai nasional, integrasi rute, pemanfaatan energi bersih, dan diplomasi udara yang cerdas. Keputusan Presiden Prabowo bukan hanya membenahi kekurangan masa lalu, tetapi menyiapkan landasan untuk melompat ke masa depan.

Langkah ini memang tidak populis dalam jangka pendek. Namun, ia menandai tekad politik yang kuat untuk memperbaiki akar sistem, bukan sekadar mempercantik permukaan. Dalam semangat itu, membesarkan Garuda adalah bagian dari upaya membesarkan Indonesia melalui sektor pariwisatanya.

The platform, launched in 2022 to help scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage, will now allow customers—including airlines, corporations, and freight forwarders—to manage SAF from a variety of suppliers in one place, reports Green Air.

This change is expected to streamline how users track and allocate their SAF purchases, even when physical access to SAF at specific airports is limited. By the end of March, Avelia had attracted 57 corporate and airline participants and facilitated over 900 SAF retirements, resulting in more than 33 million gallons of SAF being used across 17 airports in Europe, Asia, and North America. That SAF use, according to the partners, has prevented over 300,000 tonnes of CO₂e emissions—equivalent to 530,000 passengers flying from London to New York.

Avelia is now introducing a ‘Bring Your Own SAF’ (BYOS) model, enabling airlines to include SAF they purchased outside Shell’s network on the platform. This change is expected to enhance industry credibility around book-and-claim systems and help standardize SAF tracking across the aviation sector.

To further ensure transparency and broaden industry participation, Avelia is developing a multilateral governance structure to oversee platform operations and standards. All platform data will now be independently managed and hosted by Accenture, offering users a secure and verified digital environment.

“Avelia’s evolution from a single-supplier platform to a multi-supplier industry solution is a powerful demonstration of how collaboration, technology and innovation can accelerate the scaling of SAF,” said Raman Ojha, President of Shell Aviation.

Dr. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg of Accenture added, “This safeguards data compartmentalisation and transparency, giving customers clear control. It also builds the secure, scalable foundation needed for a flexible industry platform.”

Avelia’s growing list of participants includes major global players such as Alaska Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways, Delta Air Lines, Emirates, Google, JetBlue, Rolls-Royce, Bank of America, and others.

Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have not yet been disclosed, the potential is significant.","In a move to expedite decarbonization efforts while reducing clean energy costs, Japan and India are finalizing a Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). This bilateral framework will allow both nations to share emission reduction credits. It will also aid Japan in fulfilling its climate commitments.

Japan's goal of achieving net zero by 2050 and India's 45% emissions reduction target by 2030 highlight the natural partnership between the two countries in decarbonization and economic growth. With Japanese companies increasingly interested in entering the Indian market as a relocation destination for production bases or as an investment opportunity, this article explores the potential of partnerships in the carbon market sector.

What is the Joint Credit Mechanism?

Under the JCM, Japanese companies will invest in and deploy advanced carbon reduction technologies in India. In return, Japan will receive carbon credits that can offset its emissions or be traded within its national carbon market.

The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which ensures internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions. Once finalized, carbon credits will be officially registered and tracked. Joint committees will be formed to oversee project implementation and to verify credit issuance through the formulation of a detailed report. Consequently, this mechanism will help both countries meet their nationally determined contributions under the Paris framework.

A wide range of sectors, including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel, are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

Originally initiated by Japan, the JCM facilitates the transfer of technical expertise and climate-friendly technologies from developed to developing countries. While developed nations benefit by outsourcing their emissions reductions, often at a lower cost, this supports sustainable development in host countries. It helps mobilize international finance, alleviating the cost burden for the recipient country. Currently, Japan has established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

An India-Japan Partnership

India and Japan have discussed a JCM partnership since 2014. In 2023, a $600 million USD fund was jointly launched by India's quasi-sovereign wealth fund, the National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) to invest in sustainable projects. JBIC contributed 51% of that total, while the remainder came from India.

The fund aimed to invest in sustainable projects in areas such as e-mobility, renewable energy, and waste management. Other key initiatives, such as the Perform, Achieve, and Trade, or ""PAT"" scheme, have facilitated a long-standing India-Japan collaboration in energy efficiency. This partnership has reduced 10 million tons of CO₂ emissions, saved 25 million tons of oil equivalent energy, and generated $10 billion in investments.

What Are the Benefits?

For a country like India, which is vulnerable to climate change, adopting clean technologies is both essential and urgent. Achieving low or zero carbon emissions necessitates access to these technologies. However, such technologies often come with high upfront costs.

This may exceed what the governments of developing countries can currently fund. They are typically expensive or not widely available. For example, generating electricity from coal is cheaper than using green hydrogen, solar or thermal power, despite the environmental cost. In this context, Japan's role becomes critical. It helps to equalize the cost of clean energy with conventional, polluting sources by subsidizing these technologies.

Today, problems such as a severed supply chain, amid an unstable global situation, have aligned both countries' efforts and broader climate ambitions to build effective carbon markets.

Coal continues to dominate India's power mix due to its lower capital costs. However, with Japanese subsidies, alternatives such as energy storage systems and solar thermal plants could become economically viable. They could thereby accelerate India's energy transition. It has the potential to transform India's energy sector by improving the competitiveness and affordability of renewable energy technologies.

Strengthening India-Japan Strategic Ties

Beyond emissions cuts and costs, the JCM has the potential to generate jobs in both nations by fostering investments in low-carbon technologies. It promises to drive economic growth by creating skilled jobs, becoming a double-edged weapon. India can strategically channel these funds into underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to expedite its transition to a low-carbon economy. This aligns with India's dual goals of sustainable development and economic expansion. Meanwhile, Japanese companies gain access to a rapidly growing market for clean technologies.

The initiative is likely to strengthen India-Japan strategic ties. This complements their collaboration in infrastructure, defense, and economic security. It also counterbalances China's growing regional influence, having a ripple effect on different domains of collaboration. However, the ultimate goal is for India to adopt and scale these technologies independently, making JCM a high-stakes and high-impact partnership.

India Fields Itself

India is poised to introduce its long-awaited carbon market by 2026. The market for the sale and purchase of carbon credits does not currently exist in our country. Under this program, those who use fossil fuels or emit carbon would buy carbon credits. Meanwhile, those who use power from non-fossil sources would receive carbon credits that they can sell in the market.

The introduction of carbon credits should incentivize manufacturers to adopt green energy solutions, reducing carbon emissions and enhancing compliance with global regulations. India's strong potential in green hydrogen, energy efficiency, waste management, and biogas also reaffirms Japan's commitment to supporting these initiatives.

Major Roadblocks

There have been significant roadblocks to warming India-Japan relations in the climate domain. The negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014. They highlight the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements. Challenges also remain in ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted. It will be crucial to uphold the mechanism's credibility and prevent any compromise of its integrity.

Additionally, there is a concern that Japan might use the JCM to delay more decisive domestic climate actions. Critics argue that developed countries should prioritize cutting emissions at home first, as it feeds into domestic political debate on climate. However, supporters of the mechanism contend that international cooperation through frameworks like the JCM facilitates faster and more cost-effective global progress toward climate goals.

Furthermore, long-term sustainability is another critical issue. India must ultimately develop the capability to adopt and scale these technologies independently. This will require not only funding but also knowledge transfer, training, and the development of infrastructure. Without such capacity-building, the JCM risks becoming a short-term fix rather than a foundation for lasting transformation. India must cultivate the ability to sustain and expand these technologies over time.

Conclusion

India is the world's third-largest GHG emitter, primarily due to its coal and industrial activities. The trend with other JCM partnerships, such as those in Vietnam, already shows achievements in measurable CO₂ reductions in key sectors. A similar trajectory can also be expected for India by targeting high-emission areas with solutions like sustainable aviation fuel and green hydrogen.

Although the exact emissions reduction targets under the India-Japan JCM have not yet been disclosed, the potential is significant. The Japan-India JCM could serve as a global blueprint for climate cooperation if implemented effectively. It has the potential to reduce the cost of climate action, accelerate technology transfer, and strengthen diplomatic ties. That helps both nations move closer to their climate goals.

Focus is on the potential of green ammonia, hydrogen, and solar energy in industrial transformation, as well as the importance of carbon dioxide removal technologies. There is a need for technology transfer, financing, and strategic partnerships to boost sustainability efforts.

Both nations are committed to climate action. Innovative technologies and strong policy frameworks can create mutually beneficial pathways toward decarbonization. Japan's approach to carbon markets aligns well with India's sustainability goals. Japan's commitment to strengthening investment ties with India through the JCM framework, which promotes energy security and a low-carbon future, is well-timed.

By aligning sustainability objectives with strategic interests, this partnership can show how developed and developing countries can collaborate meaningfully to address one of the most significant challenges of our time: climate change.

Institutional ownership remains elevated (~70%), and short interest is low at ~1.46% of the float (2.3 days to cover), indicating limited bearish positioning. News and social media coverage have been constructive following the Q2 beat, though focus is shifting to potential tariff headwinds and supply chain updates.

Key Risks

Cyclical Demand Exposure: A slowdown in global air travel or defense budget cuts could dent engine orders and aftermarket services revenue, exposing the company to macroeconomic cyclicality.

Supply Chain Constraints: Ongoing material shortages and supplier delays pose execution risks; despite a 26% sequential improvement in material inputs in H2 2024, further bottlenecks could hamper production and delivery.

Tariff and Trade Headwinds: Approximately $500 million of tariff-related costs are anticipated in 2025; failure to pass these fully to customers could compress margins.

Valuation Risk: High P/E and PEG multiples increase vulnerability to earnings misses or downward guidance revisions, potentially amplifying share price volatility.

Geopolitical and Regulatory Uncertainty: Export controls, shifting defense procurement policies, and environmental regulations around sustainable aviation fuel could increase compliance costs or limit market access.

Bull Case

Services-Led Growth: Recurring, high-margin MRO and long-term service agreements (70% of revenue) provide resilient cash flow and support margin expansion.

Engine Production Ramp: Backlogs for LEAP and GE9X engines (~$175 billion) underpin sustained revenue growth through 2028, driven by narrow-body and wide-body fleet renewals.

Technological Leadership: RISE open-fan program targets a 20% fuel efficiency gain, supported by $1 billion annual R&D, bolstering long-term competitive advantage.

Robust Capital Returns: Management plans to return 70–75% of free cash flow via dividends and buybacks, including a $19 billion authorization, enhancing shareholder value.

Strong Financial Position: Investment-grade balance sheet with net debt reduced to $5.65 billion and high cash conversion provides flexibility to invest and weather cycles.

Bear Case

Macro-Cyclicality: A downturn in air travel or defense spending could sharply reduce orders and aftermarket volumes, impacting top-line growth.

Execution and Quality Risks: Delays in overcoming supplier constraints or durability issues (e.g., LEAP engines) could disrupt delivery schedules and margin targets.

Margin Pressure from Tariffs: Inability to fully offset $500 million of tariffs through pricing or cost savings could weigh on operating margins.

Rich Valuation: At near-record multiples, any EPS or guidance miss could trigger a disproportionate share price decline.

Regulatory and Geopolitical Risks: Stricter export controls, defense budget shifts, or environmental regulations may increase costs or reduce addressable markets.

On Our Radar

3Q 2025 Earnings Release: Expected around October 22, 2025, investors will focus on production ramp progress and guidance updates.

Tariff Policy Update: Potential U.S. tariff adjustments on aerospace parts due August 1, 2025, could impact gross margins.

Defense Sector Earnings Week: Late July 2025 reports from Lockheed Martin, RTX, and others will provide context on defense spending trends.

Investment Recommendation

GE Aerospace’s leadership in high-margin aftermarket services, strong growth outlook from engine backlogs, and robust cash flow generation make it an attractive proposition for long-term investors seeking exposure to aerospace and defense trends. However, current premium valuation multiples and exposure to cyclical demand and supply chain headwinds suggest that patient investors may consider waiting for a pullback or confirmation of sustained margin improvements before initiating new positions. A long-term investor may view today’s levels as offering a compelling entry into a high-quality aerospace franchise, while shorter-term traders should monitor upcoming earnings and tariff developments closely.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-07-19 23:03:18.273082

Moree farmer Matthew Madden said he is keen to get on board as new crop genetics enable more viable canola crops to be used in rotation with cereal crops in northern NSW.
Mr Madden planted 240 hectares of canola in April, which has just started to produce the yellow flowers that have made canola crops a tourist attraction and a popular social media backdrop.
National grower group Graingrowers has also stepped up its push for a national LCLF feedstock strategy that includes domestic SAF production.
Current biofuel production in Australia from crops primarily involves ethanol production from wheat starch and molasses.","Canola crops in the Liverpool Plains and the north west ‘Golden Triangle’ region could soon be fuelling the future of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production in Australia.

Advocacy from farmer groups and a $250 million Federal Budget commitment to grow an Australian Low Carbon Liquid Fuels (LCLF) industry has launched the new market opportunity.

Qantas has also committed to using 10% SAF in its overall fuel mix by 2030 and private investors are in the planning phase for a new large-scale refinery to produce biofuel from crops like canola.

Moree farmer Matthew Madden said he is keen to get on board as new crop genetics enable more viable canola crops to be used in rotation with cereal crops in northern NSW.

Mr Madden planted 240 hectares of canola in April, which has just started to produce the yellow flowers that have made canola crops a tourist attraction and a popular social media backdrop.

“I’m looking forward to a future where we have a home-grown industry for SAF and other biofuels,” Mr Madden said.

“It creates a new market opportunity for our crops, and if Australian companies like Qantas are seeking to use SAF to reduce carbon emissions we should be the one’s supplying the feedstock to produce it.”

While Mr Madden’s 2025 canola crop will not be taking to the air, he will be advocating for prompt government action on kickstarting domestic SAF production through representing the northern NSW region with NSW Farmers and Grain Producers Australia.

National grower group Graingrowers has also stepped up its push for a national LCLF feedstock strategy that includes domestic SAF production. It has called for targeted grants for critical LCLF processing infrastructure such as fuel refining facilities and oilseed crushes.

Current biofuel production in Australia from crops primarily involves ethanol production from wheat starch and molasses. While Australia has significant grain and molasses resources, the production and consumption of biofuels remain relatively low.

Zach Whale, General Manager of Policy and Advocacy at Graingrowers, said SAF presents a ‘brilliant’ market diversification option for farmers using canola in cropping rotations.

“There is one big hungry market for Australian oilseeds, particularly in the EU. We export 70 per cent of our canola, much of which is used in flourishing biodiesel industry in the EU.”

“Our farmers are helping the EU meeting their carbon reduction targets. We should be doing the same thing here using feedstock from canola crops grown in regions like north western NSW.”

“Producing low-carbon liquid fuels from this feedstock can play a key role in meeting national emissions reduction targets while simultaneously boosting rural economies.”

Mr Whale said there are a couple of key hurdles to overcome before takeoff.

“The basic economics is one. It costs more to produce SAF than conventional fuel and no one wants to pay more for air travel and freight. That’s why government investment is critical to support the industry to get economies of scale.”

“There is enthusiasm from the federal government and private investors to achieve this.”

The economics are also why northern NSW is so important: the Golden Triangle region, roughly defined as the area east of the Newell Highway, stretching from Bellata to North Star and Yallaroi, encompasses around 350,000 hectares of some of the highest yielding cropping country in Australia.

Australian-owned fuel companies GrainCorp and Ampol have teamed up with industry super fund IFM Investors to work on refining canola oil in Australia for use in the aviation industry. GrainCorp’s aspirations are to establish a new canola crush with capacity to process 1million tonnes a year in NSW or Western Australia- the two biggest canola growing states.

“We also need to ensure our canola meets the technical certification criteria and mandates for aviation fuel,” Mr Whale explained.

In the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Roadmap published last year by the CSIRO, it was assessed that local SAF production would prove the most likely gateway investment in other fossil fuel replacements, such as biodiesel.

The same CSIRO research identified that just 4.5 million tonnes of canola could yield 2 million tonnes of lower-carbon liquid fuel, which is equivalent of around 250,000 return flights between Sydney and Melbourne.

NSW Farmers President Xavier Martin said further research and investment in the biofuels industry is essential to unlock the full potential and benefits of these alternative fuels.

“These fuels can be produced out of materials farmers already produce and can provide whole new income streams for farm businesses while slashing on-farm energy and fuel costs.”

“Biofuels could also play a key role in furthering the sustainability of the agricultural industry, with these fuels burning much more cleanly than fossil fuels and originating from renewable resources.”",https://www.netimes.com.au/wp-content/uploads/NET-July-25-18.jpeg,N,,2025-07-19 23:03:39.054325

One of the key developments includes NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) planning a large-scale green hydrogen project at Pudimadaka in Visakhapatnam.
The total investment across the state’s green hydrogen ecosystem is projected to reach ₹1.85 lakh crore.
Another major concern is the substantial water requirement for green hydrogen production.","Andhra Pradesh is aiming to achieve 1 million metric tonnes (MMT) of green hydrogen production annually by 2030, a move that will require significant investment and infrastructure development. Union Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, Pemmasani Chandra Shekhar, shared this vision during an event in Amaravati, encouraging private players to take advantage of the state’s investor-friendly policies.

This goal aligns with the broader National Green Hydrogen Mission, approved by the Union Cabinet in January 2023, which outlines a national target of producing 5 MMT of green hydrogen per year by 2030. The mission carries a total allocation of ₹19,744 crore to support this clean energy transition.

“Andhra Pradesh is positioning itself as a central hub for India’s green hydrogen sector, aiming to contribute 20% of the country’s total production target,” said Mr Shekhar. One of the key developments includes NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) planning a large-scale green hydrogen project at Pudimadaka in Visakhapatnam. This facility is expected to produce 1,500 tonnes of green hydrogen per day, along with 7,500 tonnes per day of derivatives such as green ammonia, methanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The total investment across the state’s green hydrogen ecosystem is projected to reach ₹1.85 lakh crore. Another major company, Hero Future Energies, is exploring plans to establish a green hydrogen facility in Tirupati. The minister noted that Andhra Pradesh’s extensive port infrastructure enhances its position as an export-ready clean energy destination, signaling both scalability and profitability to global investors.

While the growth potential is substantial, Mr Shekhar highlighted several challenges that need to be addressed for the green hydrogen sector to scale sustainably. Green hydrogen holds great promise for clean energy, but its widespread adoption is currently hindered by high production costs. At present, green hydrogen is priced between USD 3 to 6 per kilogram, significantly more expensive than grey hydrogen, which costs around USD 1 to 2 per kilogram. Bridging this gap requires advancements in technology, particularly through the development of more efficient electrolysers and the scaling up of renewable energy sources to power the production process at lower costs.

Another major concern is the substantial water requirement for green hydrogen production. Creating just one kilogram of hydrogen through electrolysis consumes approximately 9 liters of freshwater. This poses a significant challenge, especially for countries like India, where water demand is expected to exceed supply in the coming years. To make green hydrogen a sustainable option, there is an urgent need to explore alternative solutions, such as seawater electrolysis or water recycling technologies.

Infrastructure remains a critical barrier in building a robust green hydrogen economy. The current lack of dedicated pipelines, safe storage facilities, and refueling stations limits the ability to transport and distribute hydrogen efficiently. These logistical gaps make it difficult for green hydrogen to reach end-users at scale and must be addressed through coordinated investments and planning.

Overcoming these challenges will require a combined effort from governments, industry players, and research institutions. Strategic policy support, public-private partnerships, and innovation in production and distribution technologies are essential to make green hydrogen cost-competitive, sustainable, and accessible. With the right infrastructure and resources in place, green hydrogen can play a transformative role in the global shift to clean energy.

Despite these hurdles, the state is pressing forward with integrated plans and incentives. Mr Shekhar urged domestic and international investors to participate in Andhra Pradesh’s full value chain — from electrolyser manufacturing to derivative fuel production. He emphasized the importance of the state’s proposed Integrated Clean Energy (ICE) Policy 2024, which includes tax incentives, subsidies, and other supportive measures to accelerate green hydrogen adoption.",https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Pemmasani-Chandra-Sekhar.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:04:09.747263

This article cuts through the noise to evaluate whether Air Products can sustain its dividend growth amid restructuring costs, rising debt, and a challenging macroeconomic environment.

The Numbers Behind the Headlines

Air Products' latest earnings report tells a mixed tale. While adjusted EPS of $2.69 for Q2 2025 fell short of guidance, the company maintained its quarterly dividend at $1.79 per share, a 2.3% yield. This move, however, comes with a critical caveat: the payout ratio now stands at 104%, meaning the company is paying out more in dividends than it earns. Historically, Air Products has managed to keep its payout ratio below 100%, a metric that raises red flags for investors wary of overextension.

The disconnect between cash flow and dividend commitments is partly driven by non-recurring charges. A $2.3 billion after-tax restructuring cost—linked to exiting three U.S. projects, including a green hydrogen initiative in New York—weighed heavily on GAAP results. Yet, even excluding these one-time hits, the company's adjusted earnings have declined 6% year-over-year, reflecting lower volumes and rising input costs. This trend raises the question: Can Air Products continue to fund its dividend without sacrificing reinvestment in growth or liquidity?

Strategic Restructuring: A Double-Edged Sword

The company's restructuring efforts—aimed at streamlining operations and focusing on core industrial gas and hydrogen projects—have been aggressive. Exits from high-risk ventures like the California-based sustainable aviation fuel expansion and Texas carbon monoxide projects resulted in $2.9 billion in pre-tax charges. While these moves reduce exposure to volatile markets, they also signal a shift away from high-growth bets that could have bolstered future cash flow.

Capital expenditures remain a key lever. Air Products plans to invest $5 billion in 2025, a figure that underscores its commitment to long-term projects but also strains near-term liquidity. The company's debt load—$14.15 billion as of March 2025—has grown amid increased short-term borrowing, and its debt-to-equity ratio now stands at 0.48. While this is lower than peers like Linde and Air Liquide, it remains elevated for a company targeting free cash flow breakeven by 2026.

Credit Metrics and Analyst Sentiment

Moody's Ratings recently revised its outlook for Air Products to “negative” from “stable,” citing concerns over free cash flow generation and debt management. The downgrade highlights a critical vulnerability: Air Products' ability to service its debt while maintaining dividend payments. With a Net Debt/EBITDA ratio of 3.0x (excluding joint venture debt), the company is operating at the lower end of its current A2 rating threshold. If leverage creeps above 2.5x or retained cash flow-to-debt falls below 25%, a further downgrade could loom.

Analyst sentiment is similarly split. While the consensus remains a “Moderate Buy” with a $331.53 price target (12% upside from current levels), recent upgrades and downgrades reflect uncertainty. UBS raised its target to $344, citing long-term hydrogen demand, while B of A Securities cut its target to $282, warning of near-term margin pressures. The divergence underscores the tension between Air Products' strategic pivot and its immediate financial constraints.

The Dividend Dilemma: History vs. Reality

Air Products' dividend history is a testament to its resilience. The company's $1.6 billion annual payout is supported by a $2 billion cash balance and $3.5 billion in undrawn credit facilities, offering a buffer against short-term shocks. However, the 104% payout ratio is a red flag. For context, industry leaders like The Coca-Cola Company and Procter & Gamble typically maintain payout ratios below 80%, ensuring flexibility during downturns.

The key differentiator here is Air Products' business model. Its on-site industrial gas contracts—often take-or-pay agreements—provide stable cash flow, even in economic downturns. This structural advantage, combined with a global footprint in 50+ countries, offers a degree of insulation from regional disruptions. Yet, the company's foray into high-risk projects (like green hydrogen) and its recent exit from others complicate the calculus.

Investment Implications

For income-focused investors, Air Products remains a compelling but cautious bet. The 2.3% yield is attractive, but the payout ratio and credit risks demand careful monitoring. The company's ability to achieve free cash flow breakeven by 2026 will be pivotal. If Air Products can stabilize margins, reduce debt, and maintain its focus on core industrial gas projects, the dividend could remain intact. However, a repeat of the Q2 2025 earnings miss or a failure to curb capital spending could force a dividend cut—a scenario that would likely trigger a sell-off.

For growth-oriented investors, the restructuring presents mixed signals. While exiting high-risk projects reduces volatility, it also limits upside potential. The hydrogen sector, in particular, is a double-edged sword: it's a $300 billion market by 2030 but requires heavy capital investment with uncertain returns. Air Products' $5 billion capex plan is a bet on long-term demand, but it comes at the expense of near-term liquidity.

Final Verdict

Air Products' long-term dividend story is far from dead, but it's in a holding pattern. The company's industrial gas dominance and take-or-pay contracts provide a solid foundation, but its debt load, high payout ratio, and restructuring costs introduce significant risks. Investors should view this as a “wait-and-see” scenario: the dividend may hold for now, but the path to sustainability hinges on Air Products' ability to balance reinvestment, debt reduction, and shareholder returns.

In the short term, a watchful eye on free cash flow trends and debt metrics is essential. For now, Air Products remains a high-yield, high-risk proposition—a stock that rewards patience but demands vigilance.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-19 23:04:36.708072

It specifically intends to exclude biodiesel from the United States because the Ontario government claims it is subsidized and is driving Canadian competitors out of the market.

In a posting on its regulatory proposals website, the government said:

“Subsidies for U.S. biofuel producers, specifically the 45Z tax credit under the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act, threaten to shut down Ontario’s biodiesel production.”

“The U.S. 45Z tax credit provides significant subsidies to American producers of cleaner fuels, such as ethanol, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and other transportation fuels. Such subsidies are not available to Canadian producers. The credit is awarded on a per-gallon basis, with the amount varying based on the fuel’s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and whether a facility has satisfied labour requirements.”

Article content

“Renewable fuel policies such as the federal Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR) and provincial policies including those in Ontario, BC and Quebec are driving demand for increased volumes of renewable content such as ethanol and biodiesel in Canada. The 45Z tax credit is offering U.S. producers a strong competitive advantage over Canadian producers in this growing market for clean fuels. This is impacting the operational viability of Ontario’s facilities. The continued presence of U.S. subsidies could result in permanent closure of Ontario’s biodiesel facilities and impact Ontario’s resource recovery objectives if no action is taken.”

“In this policy proposal, we are seeking feedback on a domestic renewable content requirement for diesel fuel placed in the Ontario market. Ontario is proposing to require three per cent of the renewable content required in diesel fuel to be produced in Canada. This requirement represents 75 per cent of the renewable content that is currently blended in diesel fuel. This enables the continued processing of some Canadian waste feedstock at clean fuel facilities in Ontario.”

“Local biodiesel facilities are critical players in sustaining a circular economy in Ontario. A circular economy is one where waste streams can be harnessed to produce value-added products, such as clean renewable fuels. Some feedstocks in biofuel production may be supplied from Ontario’s waste streams (e.g. animal fats, used cooking oil and organics).

“The proposed domestic renewable content requirement would help maintain and sustain a circular economy in Ontario by supporting the continued operations of Ontario biodiesel facilities, which have a key role to play in effectively managing Ontario’s waste streams.

“I think that you could argue there is sustainable palm oil and there is palm oil that wouldn’t be considered sustainable, and I think in some parts of the world there it’s too black and white,” he said.
We need to have a much more “nuanced approach” to the usage of palm oil as a feedstock and “much more detailed assessment of the sustainability of the feedstock”, he added.","The head of global aviation representative organisation The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has attacked the EU on its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, saying the policy is proving too costly and is not helpful to the environment, as SAF stocks remain low across Europe.

“The idea that you’re buying sustainable fuel and then transporting it to use in Europe isn’t the right way to do it, because you’re clearly increasing the carbon footprint of that fuel as a result of the transportation costs,” IATA director-general Willie Walsh said.

IATA estimated in June that production of SAF, which is considered a low-carbon replacement for traditional jet fuel, is expected to reach 2 million metric tons, or 0.7% of airlines’ fuel consumption, in 2025.

“Mandating the use of a product that isn’t available doesn’t lead to any environmental benefit,” Mr Walsh said, adding that fuel companies that have an obligation to produce SAF are also increasing the cost of traditional jet fuel.

By IATA’s assessment, he said “the cost that they’re charging is way in excess of the actual cost of the limited supplies of sustainable fuel.”

“The EU in effect has facilitated monopoly suppliers to increase prices with no environmental benefit,” said Mr Walsh, adding that the region needs to re-evaluate its SAF targets.

Under the ReFuelEU Aviation requirement, airlines need to have a 6% SAF blend in their jet fuel usage by 2030. The EU is offering some subsidies for SAF purchases by airlines, Reuters reported in June.

On the supply front, at least five SAF projects in Asia, outside of China, have started up or are earmarked to start production this year, targeting exports regionally and to Europe. Singapore is among key exporters of the green fuel to the EU.

Mr Walsh also questioned the use of palm oil as a means to produce sustainable fuel.

Despite contributing only 2.5% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions, aviation faces intense scrutiny due to its significant challenges in decarbonization. The industry's dependence on energy-dense fossil fuels and the current technological constraints of alternative energy sources make it particularly difficult to reduce its carbon footprint. As part of global efforts to meet international climate goals, such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), aviation has become the center of attention in the climate change mitigation effort. Industry stakeholders are under increasing pressure to adopt sustainable practices that can reduce environmental impact. Among these solutions, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as one of the most promising, offering the potential for substantial emission reductions without requiring major technological modifications to aircraft. This paper examines SWISS International Airline's initiatives to implement Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as a component of its comprehensive sustainability strategy. With this case study, this research analyzes the integration of SAF into the airline's operations and assesses the challenges and opportunities encountered during the process. The methodology employs qualitative research techniques, combining primary data obtained from interviews with corporate responsibility executives with secondary data from corporate sustainability reports to provide an in-depth understanding of the adoption of SAF. Being a contemporary and under-researched phenomenon, qualitative and exploratory research was employed to facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the complexities inherent in the adoption of SAF. While focusing primarily on SWISS, the research examines the broader implications of SAF implementation within the aviation sector. It investigates the tecno- economic, environmental, and regulatory factors that influence the viability and scalability of SAF, as well as the role of market-based mechanisms, such as emissions trading systems. The findings of this innovative study provide insights how SAF can contribute to mitigating the aviation industry's carbon footprint and enhance its sustainability, thus establishing a foundation for the future of sustainable aviation.",https://ojs.southfloridapublishing.com/ojs/public/journals/1/favicon_en_US.png,N,,2025-07-19 02:49:32.180147

Heat to build over the next week, some crop stress likely... Changes are coming to the weather pattern that will produce hotter temps and high relative humidity across areas of the U.S. through next week, inducing some crop stress. World Weather Inc. says hot temperatures are likely in the Central and Southern Plains, Delta, lower Midwest and interior southeastern states from this weekend through the end of next week, with heat indices of 95 to 115 likely. A westward shift in the heat and dryness is likely in the last days of July, allowing some cooling and rainfall back into the lower Midwest and southeastern states. Northern and eastern Midwest crop areas will be sufficiently moist to carry on normal crop development during the next two weeks.

China is facing an Aug. 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with the U.S. after Beijing and Washington reached a preliminary deal last month to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs. Commerce Minister Wang Wentao aid the current overall tariff level imposed by the U.S. on China was “still high” at 53.6%. “Both sides have come to understand that they need each other, as lots of the goods and services that we exchange are irreplaceable, or at least difficult to exchange in the short-term,” Wang said. “China does not want a trade war, but it is not afraid of one,” he reiterated.

Lula won’t bow to Trump, calls tariffs ‘unacceptable blackmail’... Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he would not take orders over tariffs from a foreigner and later called President Donald Trump’s threatened duties “unacceptable blackmail.” Trump attributed the tariffs, set to start Aug. 1 to Brazil’s treatment of former President Jair Bolsonaro and to trade practices against U.S. companies that he said are unfair. Brazil’s government has been holding discussions with industry groups and companies that will be affected by the U.S. tariffs, while also readying potential retaliatory measures if a deal isn’t reached.

LanzaJet’s pioneering ethanol-to-jet fuel plant set to launch by fall... The world’s first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet fuel plant, owned by LanzaJet Inc., is expected to begin operations in Soperton, Georgia by the end of September, after multiple delays due to equipment issues. The $200 million project, funded in part by the U.S. government, will initially use Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), even though it won’t qualify for the U.S. 45Z tax credit due to feedstock origin rules. CEO Jimmy Samartzis said the company is pushing to start with available low-carbon ethanol and transition to qualifying American sources once they become more viable. The Georgia facility is projected to produce 10 million gallons of SAF and renewable diesel annually.

WSJ: Union Pacific eyes Norfolk Southern in potential megamerger... Union Pacific is in early-stage discussions to acquire Norfolk Southern, according to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ). The potential merger would mark a massive consolidation in the railroad industry, combining Union Pacific’s $140 billion market value with Norfolk Southern’s $60 billion footprint. WSJ sources familiar with the matter cautioned that the talks are preliminary, and there’s no certainty a deal will materialize—or clear regulatory hurdles. The possibility remains that other suitors could emerge. If completed, the deal would reshape North America’s freight rail landscape.

China’s pork imports steady... China imported 90,000 MT of pork during June, unchanged from the previous month and year-ago. Through the first half of 2025, China imported 540,000 MT of pork, up 4.9% from the same period last year.

Canada and New Zealand resolve dairy trade dispute... Canada and New Zealand have reached a “mutually satisfactory” resolution to a long-running dispute over access for dairy products, the Canadian government said. New Zealand launched a claim against Canada in May 2022, arguing that Ottawa’s implementation of dairy tariff rate quotas under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) trade agreement were against its rules. Under the new agreement, Canada has committed to make commercially meaningful changes to the way it administers its dairy quotas under CPTPP, according to the New Zealand government. The Canadian government added that this means there are technical policy changes but these are limited to quotas administered under the terms of CPTPP and does not amend Canada’s market access commitments.

""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable.""","Syzygy Plasmonics has announced a significant leap forward in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production with the unveiling of its NovaSAF 1 facility in Uruguay. This pioneering commercial project, now bolstered by the expertise of Velocys as its Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technology licensor, is set to transform dairy waste and biogas into 500,000 gallons of drop-in jet fuel annually. What sets this venture apart is its reliance solely on renewable electricity and waste gas, completely circumventing the need for green hydrogen or complex gasification processes.

At the core of the NovaSAF 1 project is Syzygy's proprietary light-driven GHG e-Reforming technology. This innovative process is capable of directly producing the ideal 2:1 syngas ratio, crucial for efficient Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis, from biogenic methane and carbon dioxide. This breakthrough eliminates the energy-intensive and water-demanding steam reforming, along with the costly electrolyzers traditionally associated with syngas production.

To efficiently convert this syngas into high-yield jet fuel, Syzygy has strategically partnered with Velocys, integrating their renowned microFTL technology. Velocys' expertise is critical for maximizing fuel output and ensuring the reliability of the conversion process, both of which are paramount in driving down the overall production cost of synthetic fuel.

Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics, emphasized the project's significance, stating, ""This project proves that profitable SAF production doesn't have to wait on future infrastructure. With Velocys, we're bringing in a complete, modular solution that drives down overall production costs and is ready to scale. Uruguay is only the start."" His remarks highlight the project's potential to establish a new paradigm for SAF production that is both profitable and readily deployable.

Echoing this sentiment, Matthew Viergutz, CEO of Velocys, expressed his company's enthusiasm for the partnership. ""We're proud to bring our FT technology into a project that's changing the game,"" Viergutz said. ""This is what innovation looks like—fast, flexible, and focused on making SAF production affordable."" This joint effort represents a pivotal moment in the industry, showcasing how technological innovation and strategic partnerships can accelerate the transition to sustainable aviation.

The NovaSAF 1 project is poised to achieve a nameplate capacity of 500,000 gallons per year of ASTM D7566-compliant SAF. Its feedstocks, dairy waste, biogenic methane, and CO2, combined with 100% renewable electricity as its power source, firmly position it as a leader in environmentally responsible fuel production. With the Final Investment Decision (FID) anticipated in Q4 2025 and the start of operations slated for Q1 2027, the project is moving forward swiftly.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-18 16:57:02.098912

Eagle-eyed viewers will notice detailed paper engines throughout “The Biggest Dream,” which were created in consultation with skilled paper artists.
“I want people to see that at GE Aerospace we are committed to the future of flight — to a better, more innovative future,” says Rizk.","A stop at hair and makeup isn’t typically part of the GE Aerospace workday. But little was routine for two GE Aerospace engineers who helped create “The Biggest Dream,” the company’s new brand film.

Debuting this month, “The Biggest Dream” depicts the next generation of innovators — kids of today — collaborating with GE Aerospace engineers as they harness the power of imagination to shape the future of flight. The brand film captures the act of creative thinking and serves as an ode to GE Aerospace’s 106-year legacy of empowering bright minds to bring amazing new ideas to life.

Roman Seele and Maysaa Rizk, colleagues at the GE Aerospace Advanced Aviation Technology (AAT) Center of Excellence, in Munich, Germany, were on hand to serve as expert consultants, providing real-world engineering details from their real-life workplace. They also appear in the film, joining a cast of professional actors.

Along with U.S.-based engineer Craig Higgins, all three work on some of the most innovative technologies in aerospace, including those being developed as part of the CFM RISE program. A demonstration program of CFM International, a 50-50 joint company between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, the RISE program is advancing open fan technologies for a future commercial aircraft engine that prioritizes safety, durability, and efficiency, aiming to be 20% more fuel efficient than current engines.

It’s a tall order, they acknowledge, but they have a vision, one shared with thousands of collaborators at sites around the world. As “The Biggest Dream” conveys, that’s what it takes to accomplish the extraordinary.

“We are committed to the future of flight,” says Rizk. “We believe in it, and we want others to believe. With innovation, nothing is impossible.”

Formulas for Success

Creating “The Biggest Dream” involved two days of filming, along with five weeks of lightning-speed post-production work. Editing teams used computer-assisted visual effects (VFX) to complete a magical final scene. (Spoiler alert: It features a giant paper airplane, roughly the size of an actual passenger plane, launching gracefully into the air.)

Much of the film shoot took place at Circa, a domed structure near Amsterdam Schiphol Airport that once served as the National Aviation Museum of the Netherlands (aka the Luchtvaartmuseum Aviodrome). Set designers transformed the light-filled space into an engineering “innovation lab” complete with transparent dry erase boards, which Seele and Rizk covered with mathematical equations.

“We found formulas that are fundamental, that you might actually use in a brainstorming session,” Seele says. “The formula governing the principle of propulsive efficiency is specifically important in the CFM RISE program’s Open Fan technology.”

An open, or unducted, fan — a key component in the company’s efforts to reinvent the future of flight and a significant change in the world of engine design — operates without a heavy nacelle, so it can be made much larger with less drag, Seele explains. “The general idea is that you can take in more air and accelerate it less quickly, making the overall process more efficient,” he says.

“Unducted fan technologies were originally envisioned in the 1980s, but we’ve made some very significant changes and advancements in the technology since then,” says Higgins, one of the engine architects for the Open Fan. Although he doesn’t appear in the brand film, Higgins is part of the team developing the Open Fan’s underlying structure, and he has played a critical role in moving the game-changing concept forward. “The big unlock for us has been figuring out a way to keep the efficiency benefits that bring the fuel-burn advantage while also working to reduce the noise, the weight, and the complexity of the engine,” he says. “We’ve come up with a concept that we’re very excited about.”

Seeing that concept celebrated in “The Biggest Dream” makes this an important moment for Higgins, who has worked at GE Aerospace and in the aviation industry in numerous capacities over the past 40 years. “The value that the RISE program will bring to the flying public, the environment, the airlines, and to advancing the efficiency and reducing the cost of aviation — it’s the pinnacle of my career,” he says.

Eagle-eyed viewers will notice detailed paper engines throughout “The Biggest Dream,” which were created in consultation with skilled paper artists. Viewers should also keep their eyes peeled for a scale model of an Open Fan engine, an addition that inspired questions from curious non-engineers on the set. Seele and Rizk were only too happy to talk about their work, as well as the immense team effort being made by everyone involved in the RISE program, which involves advances being made on a range of projects — from hybrid electric power systems and adaptive cycle engines to high-pressure turbines and durable compact engine cores — aided by the world’s most powerful supercomputers.

“People were commenting about how passionate we seemed,” says Rizk. “I am always going to be excited around a RISE engine model. There’s no way you’re going to stop this excitement.”

Next-Gen Innovators, Next-Gen Dreams

The kids in the film are the real stars. They represent the young minds that will one day take aerospace engineering to even higher levels. For the engineers involved in the film, the young peoples’ curiosity and openness to new ideas while filming struck a chord.

Seeing the kids playing with paper airplanes was particularly meaningful for Rizk, who recalls being asked to build them and film them in flight when she was a student. “I got this flashback to when I was at university, and I was so passionate. I never thought I would be doing what I do today,” she says. “I thought to myself, This is really how it starts. Big ideas start as simple ones.”

While still waiting to see the film’s final cut, both Seele and Rizk expressed excitement at the story “The Biggest Dream” will be telling audiences.

“I want people to see that at GE Aerospace we are committed to the future of flight — to a better, more innovative future,” says Rizk. “It’s not only for us, but also for future generations.”

Seele adds another powerful takeaway. “What we’re working on now will be real someday,” he says.",https://www.geaerospace.com/news/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail/public/Maysaa_Roman_TheBiggestDream%20Hero.jpg?itok=jJXFKP2y,N,,2025-07-18 16:57:06.489934

The cellulosic ethanol business was just not going to be able to fight the corn ethanol folks no matter what they did.
Stephen Lacey: So you describe the rise of corn ethanol as this well-intentioned disaster, and now here we are in search of sustainable aviation fuels with another looming disaster potentially ahead.
Michael Grunwald: That’s a great question, and one thing I would point out is to go back to the alternative proteins a little bit.","The story of climate change is usually told through fossil fuels — pipelines, coal plants, oil companies. But there’s another story that accounts for nearly a third of global emissions: agriculture. And we’ve barely begun to grapple with it.

In this episode of Open Circuit, we’re joined by Michael Grunwald, longtime journalist and author of the new book “We Are Eating the Earth: The Race to Fix Our Food System and Save Our Climate.” Grunwald spent years investigating why agriculture lags decades behind energy in decarbonization, and what it would take to catch up.

First, we tackle food-based fuels. Grunwald profiles researcher Tim Searchinger, who discovered that biofuels accounting ignored land use. While ethanol was hailed as a homegrown climate solution, it was actually worse than gasoline once you factored in the “carbon opportunity cost” of using land for fuel instead of food. Why did it take so long to recognize?

This land use blindness persists today. Despite the science showing the climate impact of biofuels, the government is backing a sustainable aviation fuel program with tens of billions in new biofuel subsidies — including explicit language preventing regulators from considering land use impacts.

Then, we tackle feel-good agricultural solutions like regenerative agriculture, vertical farms, and local food systems that may have ethical benefits, but often don’t have meaningful emissions impacts.

Finally, we ask what ag tech can learn from energy’s scaling playbook: How do we deploy high-yield agriculture and synthetic biology solutions in a rapid, ethical way?

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: So there’s this little nuance to the production side of things. It’s very common to ask when testing microphones what the guest had for breakfast. So this is the first time I actually get to air the answer. Michael, what did you have for breakfast?

Michael Grunwald: I had nothing for breakfast. It’s 7 A.M. in San Francisco.

Stephen Lacey: That is the most climate-friendly breakfast I have ever heard of.

Michael Grunwald: Exactly. No emissions, yet.

Stephen Lacey: From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. The story of climate change is often the story of fossil fuels, of pipelines and coal plants of oil companies and electric cars. But there’s another story. It’s about agriculture and land use and it’s one we’re only just beginning to grapple with. A new book, We are Eating the Earth, tells that story. Agriculture accounts for nearly a third of global emissions and we’ve barely begun to grapple with them.

This week we’re going to talk about the hidden cost of biofuels and what they tell us about land use. We’ll explore why other feel-good solutions we’ve championed, regenerative egg, vertical farms, localization, are not enough. And we’ll look at some of the technologies and practices that could take a bite out of emissions.

Oh my god, these food puns are too easy. Our conversation with author and journalist Michael Grunwald is coming right up.

Welcome, I’m Stephen Lacey. I’m the Executive Editor at Latitude Media. I’m here, as always, with Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah. Catherine is the co-founder and chair of 38 North Solutions. How are you?

Katherine Hamilton: I’m doing great. And I’m sitting of course in Virginia farm country, so I’m really excited to talk to Michael this week.

Stephen Lacey: You were up very late last night finishing Michael’s book.

Katherine Hamilton: Yes, I was determined to get to the gory finale of, are we actually going to do anything? But it was a great book, just super impressed and I learned a ton.

Stephen Lacey: Oh, you look very well rested. No worse for the wear. Jigar Shah is the co-founder of Multiplier. He’s the former director of the Department of Energy’s loan programs office. Hello, Jigar.

Jigar Shah: Hello.

Stephen Lacey: Did you sit on the beach reading Michael’s book?

Jigar Shah: No, but I did stay in a Holiday Inn Express last night and took it all in. But no, it was a great book and I actually did finally use that AI thing that you told me to try to use, but I also caught the Monty Python references and so I did a number of things to get through the book and it was frankly an amazing book.

Stephen Lacey: And the author of that book is with us. It’s Michael Grunwald. He’s a longtime journalist. I have been following him for a long time. I started reading him nearly two decades ago when he was writing about policy, politics, and energy, and he’s got a few books under his belt. The newest is We Are Eating the Earth, the Race to Fix Our Food System and Save Our Climate. Michael, welcome.

Michael Grunwald: Oh, thanks. It’s so great to be back with you guys and thanks for all those kind words.

The hidden climate cost of biofuels

Stephen Lacey: So this show is devoted largely to energy, but we invited you here to talk about the book on food, land, agriculture because there is so much crossover with energy and you’re asking a pretty simple but profound question. What if we decarbonize the energy sector but still come up way short? So when did agriculture become your journalistic obsession?

Michael Grunwald: Well, it’s funny, I was one of you guys. I was an energy and climate nerd and I guess six or seven years ago I really realized, as you mentioned, food is about a third of the climate problem. It’s a much bigger percentage of our biodiversity problems, deforestation, water pollution, water shortages, and I didn’t know squat about it.

I tell the story in the introduction of how I had written a story about my own green life, how I had gotten solar panels and an electric vehicle. And the point of the story was that I wasn’t some eco-saint that I was doing this because it was really economically sensible and that this stuff was ready to go mainstream. And so I had a line in there about how I didn’t line dry my laundry, I don’t unplug my computer at night, I still eat meat to show I wasn’t an eco-saint, just this eco-mercenary.

And I realized I wasn’t even sure if meat is actually bad for the climate. So I called this guy I knew who worked on agriculture and climate, Tim Searchinger, and I asked him, “Is meat really that bad?” And he said. “Yes,” and then he said, “duh.” And I figured if I was this spectacularly ignorant, then probably other people were, too, and that was really the beginning of the journey.

Jigar Shah: You clearly still are one of us.

Michael Grunwald: In my heart, Jigar, in my heart.

Stephen Lacey: So Michael Pollan’s rules of eating weren’t enough for you?

Michael Grunwald: It’s funny, my wife is a psychedelic counselor, so I always say that we have a mixed Michael Pollan marriage. He unfortunately writes so beautifully about food that I think he’s convinced a lot of people of a lot wrong ideas.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. Well, we’re going to get to what some of those ideas are a little bit later in the show. But let’s turn to Tim Searchinger. This is not a heavy-handed book where you’re scolding people. You have strong character development and good story, and Tim is at the center of this book. He’s a former environmental lawyer turned carbon accounting obsessive who helped reframe how we understand the true climate cost of farming.

And one of his insights was that the land itself carries this carbon opportunity cost and that using it to grow fuel or inefficient food unlocks hidden emissions that we’ve long ignored. And so I want to start to where this revelation began, which was with the rise of corn ethanol. Obviously this is something that has been long hailed as this homegrown environmental savior. Ethanol became this case study of good intentions gone wrong in a lesson in land use accounting. So who is Tim? Why does he matter? And what was this moment that changed his perspective?

Michael Grunwald: Let me start with a little bit about Tim because he is a unusual, maybe a protagonist for a book like this. But to step back to where we started, the energy and climate problem, which is a really big crop problem and you guys do an awesome job talking about it every week, but it is at this point, we know what we need to do. We got to electrify the global economy and run it on clean electricity, and we’ve actually started to do that. We’re not doing it fast enough or consistently enough, and obviously the mess in Washington right now has been a setback, but energy is now a political problem.

While food, particularly when I started this, we didn’t even know what we needed to know, so it’s really an analytical problem. And Tim is, above all, an analyst. He’s a facts guy, a data guy, a science guy on his front porch, the doormat says, “No dogmas allowed.” So he’s not into groupthink, he’s not swayed by ideology. He’s just a guy who does all the reading, gets into the details and doesn’t understand why everybody else doesn’t.

So that’s the backstory. Used to be he was a wetlands’ lawyer when he stumbled into ethanol and he was fighting to protect, basically, Midwestern wetlands from cornfields. And he saw that they were talking about a new ethanol mandate and he said, “Huh, that’s going to mean more cornfields and that could threaten wetlands.” So he looked into it and he thought maybe climate would be a way in.

He didn’t know anything about climate, but he saw the big study that had been done at the Argonne National Laboratory that found that ethanol was maybe 20% better for the climate than gasoline. And he was like, this is super weird because most of the study was talking about how inefficient ethanol was and how producing ethanol through fertilizing corn and running the tractors and harvesting the corn and then brewing the ethanol that it produced way more greenhouse gas emissions than just producing gasoline.

And you realize that the trick was that while gasoline, you burn it in a car and the carbon goes up into the sky, corn, you burn it in the car and the carbon goes up into the sky, but then you grow corn in the field and that absorbs carbon from the sky. And so therefore, ethanol was better. And Tim’s insight was, wait a minute. It was already absorbing carbon from the sky when it was just a corn field growing food. And if you grow fuel instead of food then somewhere else you’re going to have to grow more food. And that’s probably not going to be a parking lot. It’s going to be a forest or a wetland or something that stores a lot of carbon already that you’re going to lose it.

And that basic insight that climate analysis was completely ignoring land use was really the beginning of this long dive, first into biofuels and all bioenergy and ultimately into the larger problem of agriculture and meat.

Stephen Lacey: And it sounds so simple in retrospect. Catherine, you were involved in the biofuels industry around this time. Do you want to reflect on what was happening and how this debate unfolded?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, it’s interesting. When I started reading the book, I was like, well, I’ve been a vegetarian for 30 years and I don’t even have that much dairy. And then I was like, oh no, I’m part of the problem. I started reading about biofuels and I was working, I was co-directing the American Bioenergy Association with Megan Smith from 2000 to 2003. So it was early, it was even earlier than this book started.

And our hypothesis was there were a lot of ways to make things incrementally better, one of which was to make corn ethanol better by using cellulosic biofuels. And this was about taking all the junk that wasn’t being used, the corn stovers, all of the sugar cane bagasse, all of the waste, the wood waste that was out there and turning it into something useful. And that could have been cellulosic ethanol. We had both come out of NREL, so NREL was doing a lot of work on that, that we were taking to the hill. Megan was testifying before Congress about this.

We also looked at and biomass power, I was working on co-firing with coal just to reduce the emissions of coal, because we knew coal was bad. It’s like, all right, well maybe we can clean it up by using biomass, too, or using gasification, making biomass into chemicals or using it for refining.

And what ended up happening was that the corn ethanol industry is just huge. The cellulosic ethanol business was just not going to be able to fight the corn ethanol folks no matter what they did. And the big plant in Jennings, Louisiana that was touted as like this is the first big plant. It was eventually bought by BP and then closed about 10 years ago and it had been a ten-year project trying to get it going and trying to create a market out of it.

The gasification stuff is like this is the McNeil plant in Burlington, Vermont that everybody hates and it’s like the most polluting plant that they have in the state. It’s still considered a renewable energy plant. So a lot of what we did early on was trying to make a difference around the edges and it was really hard to do because of existing industry. And I’m sure Michael, in reading through your book, that is a huge impediment.

Jigar Shah: The thing I don’t understand, though, is why California loves ethanol. When you think about the low-carbon fuel standard credit program, 80% of all of the proceeds basically goes to biofuels. And so they’re taking existing plans saying, we’ll ship the physical ethanol to California for the blending and giving the credit. And so what I don’t understand is that if this insight was so ubiquitous, and we certainly saw it at the loan programs office, there were lots of people who had great scores on their carbon intensity score in California. And when Nettle looked at it, we were like, no, this is worse for the planet. You’re not getting a loan. So we figured it out of the life cycle carbon analysis, but why is California ethanol pilled?

Michael Grunwald: Well, Katherine, you nailed it. I talk about in the book about how searching or went to the guy who was running the low-carbon fuel standard, he was really his baby. And that guy said to Tim, basically, “You are absolutely right on the substance, but it’s not politically realistic and that if we try to take on farm-based biofuels, we are going to lose our entire low-carbon fuel standard that the politics just won’t sustain it, even in California.”

So it was a combination of the farmers who wanted to make sure that basically, there was no real analysis of any farm-grown fuels, as well as some of the people pushing the advanced biofuels that Katherine talked about because they use land, too, and they don’t really pencil out. It turns out to be, in some ways, a good thing for the planet that some of these switch grasses and other ideas never really worked technologically and economically, but they were lobbying the Governor Schwarzenegger directly and saying, “You shouldn’t even be looking at indirect land use change, that’s going to hurt our products, too.”

And so as you said, I tell the story about how in Congress when Tim was trying to, early on, lobby against the early ethanol mandates, and he went to Senator John Corzine’s office and he figured, here’s a liberal Democrat from New Jersey, which doesn’t grow a lot of corn. He’s arguing to his aide that this is going to increase food prices and increase gas prices just to make some agribusinesses in the Midwest rich. And the guy says, “I got to stop you right there, Tim. We can’t do anything that’s going to offend Iowa farmers.”

And Tim is like, “Wait a minute. Corzine used to run Goldman Sachs, does he honestly think that he’s going to be President of the United States?” And the aid says, “Tim, they all think they’re going to be President of the United States.” So it’s just very tough taking on the ag industry in any state.

Stephen Lacey: Tim got pushed back from environmental groups. You mentioned that there was concern about pushing back against the ag industry, but they didn’t come around to these findings at first. When did his findings start to break through? Were there other factors that contributed to environmental groups sticking their heads in the sand, so to speak?

Michael Grunwald: Sure. Well, as you suggested, this is 20 years ago and at the time there really were no alternatives to fossil fuels. There was wind and solar were in their infancy, there was just been a documentary called Who Killed the Electric Car? GM had literally scrapped their initial EVs. And so there was this desperation for something new and different that I find understandable. And obviously, this was an alternative to fossil fuels and people were starting to understand the danger of fossil fuels. That said, it turned out to be when you did the math, it was worse than fossil fuels.

And Tim published, even though he was not a scientist, he published a piece in science that showed that it was about twice as bad when you incorporated the land use. He’s now published 10 articles in science or nature, the most prestigious journals, even though he is still technically not a scientist.

So I think there were, and I tell the stories of how there were some scientists and some environmentalists who realized they were wrong, and that is not something that humans are really great at. And so I wanted to call them out and give them some credit because that was not everybody’s reaction. And I think a lot of people who worked on biofuels as a climate solution, they didn’t want to say, “Oh wait, I just wasted 10 years of my life,” or, “all of my professional credentials are really useless because this is not going to be part of the solution.” It’s hard to get people to admit things like that and so there was a real circling of the wagons.

Stephen Lacey: So you describe the rise of corn ethanol as this well-intentioned disaster, and now here we are in search of sustainable aviation fuels with another looming disaster potentially ahead. Talk about the state of fuels policy today and why we haven’t learned our lessons.

Michael Grunwald: Well, this is a big problem for the corn and soy lobby because electric vehicles have panned out and they’re really a threat to we don’t really need to put corn and soy into our cars anymore. So they’ve realized that there’s another potential market and that’s putting corn and soy into our planes, but that doesn’t pencil out at all if you’re doing any kind of decent climate analysis.

And there were really intense fights inside the Biden White House and throughout the administration to basically how are we going to do these models? How are we going to account for land use with Secretary Vilsack and USDA pushing very hard to essentially ignore land use as much as possible to make corn and soy look better? And ultimately, it still didn’t pencil out corn in particular and soy barely.

So the big beautiful bill, which as you guys have done such a great job talking about cuts, about a trillion dollars worth of actual clean energy subsidies, has tens of billions dollars of new subsidies for sustainable aviation fuel. And at the same time has language essentially saying that since soy and corn aren’t penciling out, the government needs to put down their pencils. And that when they do these analyses of what’s actually sustainable, you cannot look at land use, which of course is the whole problem with biofuels. So it’s very depressing. And another example of what Catherine was talking about, the incredible power of the farm lobby.

Jigar Shah: But this time the EU isn’t on it. The markets here for sustainable aviation fuel is not the United States. There’s a little bit in California and a little bit in some of the other markets that have passed state policy like Illinois, but the vast majority of the volume is going to go into the EU requirements for sustainable aviation fuel blending. So all flights from the East Coast to the United States or anywhere in the United States that land in Europe will have to contain biofuels to land or they have to pay penalties. And so what I don’t understand is how the EU got into this whole racket.

Michael Grunwald: Well, I tell the story of the initial EU foray into biofuels everybody, or at least a lot of people behind the scenes acknowledged searching earth science and said that, “Oh, this land use is a real problem.” And back in early 2008, the guy who was putting together their renewable energy directive basically said, “Hey, we’re going to scrap this entire renewable energy directive and all your goodies for wind and solar if you insist on this language taking land use change seriously.”

So that really started the biofuels movement in Europe, though I will say that when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel, they have a rule that you can’t use crops.

Jigar Shah: No, I saw that, and so the facility-

Michael Grunwald: Which is a change to me, it’s an acknowledgement that, well then why are you using crops at all? And they’ve capped it for passenger fuels. But again, it’s like, well, if it’s bad to put it in a plane, why would it be good to put it in a car?

Katherine Hamilton: We work with a company called 12 that uses electrochemically, basically hydrogen produced fuel from CO2 water and renewables, and they use up to a thousand times less water, 30 times less land, of course with 30% more reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. And they have a partnership with Alaska Air, which hopefully can get us to at least begin to understand that there are solutions that do not involve using land.

Michael Grunwald: And that’s the problem. Look, biofuels, because of some of these concerns that have been raised, they haven’t taken off quite like people expected, but because of the aviation fuel stuff, they’re in Indonesia, in a lot of Asia, they’re looking at a massive expansion, and it’s a problem. Right now, biofuels are already eating about a Texas worth of the earth. Now, again, we will talk later, livestock are eating 50 Texases worth of the earth, agriculture is eating 75 Texases worth of the earth, but there are better alternatives. They shouldn’t be eating any of the earth.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I think one of the big challenges, as you correctly pointed out from 20 years ago, is that there does seem to be this desire for everybody to clinging on to hope. And so this is where a lot of this is coming from. People don’t really want to cut back on flights. And so they’re like, how do I make my flights feel better? I think one of the analysis that we did in the sustainable aviation fuel liftoff report was whether it was actually just cheaper to pay for DAC credits and just burn avgas. And I think it turned out basically, yeah, it’s basically better just to pay 400 bucks a ton for DAC credits. It was sort of on the bubble.

And so part of what I’m trying to understand is how much of this is really just a fight between people not wanting to make real changes to modern lifestyles and the free use of the ecosystem?

Michael Grunwald: Well, general, what I would say is, and this goes to what you just mentioned, is that I do think there is this desperation for change. There’s a sense that fossil fuels are bad and we need something different. But a lot of people who are looking at this stuff, and this is relevant to your audience, they’re energy people and they want to solve energy problems and they don’t think about the land sector problems.

So I would make the case for your listeners who are in this energy world that you can’t dump your problems onto the land sector. That has been a little bit of what’s behind a lot of this endless push, even after the numbers don’t work. I do think the hope is understandable, but at the beginning when I started writing about how biofuels suck and people would say, “Well then what should we use instead?” And I was like, I don’t know, gasoline. And now, of course, I can say electric vehicles.

It takes solar panels produce on one acre as much energy as if you can had 100 acres of ethanol to run a car. And actually because electric vehicles are so much more efficient, it would run about 250 miles for every mile of ethanol. So now we’re in the same situation with jet fuel, and people say like, “Well then what should we use in instead?” And I’m like, “Jet fuel.” Right now, and I think you can electrify some short flights and hopefully Katherine’s green hydrogen solutions will catch on, but we shouldn’t jump to a worse solution just because we want a solution.

Feel-good agricultural solutions vs. the carbon reality

Stephen Lacey: That moves us nicely into this broader menu of solutions, vertical farms, plant-based burgers, regenerative grazing. And I want to ask a question, which is, are we investing in what actually works or just what sounds good? Because for all the hype, as you point out, a lot of these ideas fall apart when you run the carbon math. And some of them, like meat alternatives, are not scaling in the way that we believe they would. So you write that agriculture is a couple of decades behind energy when it comes to decarbonization. Why?

Michael Grunwald: Well, that’s the good news, is that we see how far energy has come in 20 years and 20 years ago, as we said, energy was nowhere, there really weren’t alternatives to fossil fuels. And now with food, and this is why I dove into this topic, as you said in the introduction, this is not an issue that people have really grappled with. Agriculture is eating the earth. It’s now two of every five acres of this planet are either cropped or grazed. And it’s extraordinary. It’s like only one of every hundred acres are cities and suburbs.

So we are losing a soccer field worth of tropical forest every six seconds. And that is a huge climate problem, not only because those forests store carbon, but also they absorb the carbon that our fossil fuels are pumping into the atmosphere. So I always say that trying to decarbonize the planet while you’re continuing to vaporize trees, it’s like trying to clean your house while you’re smashing your vacuum cleaner to bits in the living room. You’re making a huge mess and you’re crippling your ability to clean up the mess.

So this is something that we need to deal with now. And as you said, I think it’s very exciting. I write about dozens of really promising solutions with incredibly smart people who are working on them, on the science, on the business, but also, I’m pretty upfront that none of these solutions really have a lot of traction, yet. And that particularly over these next four years in America where it doesn’t look like we’re going to have a lot of positive climate policy, this is a really important time to us to figure out what works, what’s never going to work, so that once there is climate policy, we can start as Jigar would say, “Deploy, deploy, deploy.”

Jigar Shah: But aren’t we back to culture change again? We wrote a bunch of work on this when I was running the Carbon war room. In Brazil, the big challenge is rotational grazing that they just need to put in some minor fences and actually do real rotational grazing and then they could get three times or four times the amount of cattle per acre of land that they’re currently getting. And folks are like, “Well, but why? Why don’t we just cut down more of the Amazon? It’s a lot easier than doing rotational grazing.”

I think that part of this is just understanding that some of the basic solutions that we’ve already come up with are just not palatable to the folks who are there. And that’s why, for instance, the United States, we have the Farm Bureau and all these things that we use to educate farmers around cover crops and all the other things that people could be using.

I guess I’m just trying to understand that it feels like that culture change is so weaponized in this political moment where people can say, “We don’t need to do any of this stuff at all.” And if you vote for this other person who’s asking you to change your multi-generational practices, then you’re basically a socialist. You should decide to stick with me. I won’t make any changes.

Michael Grunwald: Well, it is going to be hard. That is where I start. And certainly behavioral change is really hard. As a species, we don’t seem really awesome at making sacrifices for the good of the planet. We’re not great at being nice to each other, but we’re really good at inventing stuff and we’re pretty good at solving problems when we set our minds to it. So I think there is hope, but as you suggest, I think a lot of it is going to depend on having the right incentives in place and the politics will matter.

Look, just as electric vehicles a while back were seen as Obama mobiles and that made it really tough to get widespread adoption. I think right now you see fake meat is seen as Biden burgers, and that’s toxic. You don’t want to become woke meat or woke energy. You want this just to compete in the marketplace.

And when you point out that the politics suck on these sorts of things, all I can do is say, “Yeah, if it were easy, it would’ve been fixed already.” I do think when you, Tesla’s an example of, if you do build a better mousetrap, it doesn’t mean in solar, too. Not everybody’s going to instantly adopt it, but some people will, and that’ll help get to scale and drive down the costs and make it more attractive to consumers and ultimately, maybe change the politics, as well.

So I do think there are a lot of exciting technologies just as the government was important in the energy transition, I think that will be true in the transition to sustainable food and agriculture, as well. And I’m not going to pretend it’s easy. I do quote a democratic pollster in my book who says that taxes and other restrictions on meat are the least popular policies he’s ever polled. He said, “It’s up there with veterans benefits for ISIS.” So not easy.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I did a little poking around just to figure out how many people in the world are vegan and vegetarian and how many people in the US are. So the US, about 2% or around 2% are vegan, 4 to 5% are vegetarian. But interestingly, 41% say they’re reducing their consumption of red meat. So that’s a big piece and that is a big piece of emissions is folks switching the way they’re eating.

Eating is a very intimate thing. Telling people what they can and can’t eat is really difficult, but telling them something else, like it’s healthier for you to do this, it will help your body, it will reduce your cost, it’s still delicious. Those are things that I think some of the ways we need to approach solutions.

I also noted, Michael, in your book that all these folks who came up with all these different solutions, they’re all dudes. Sorry, they’re all dudes. And when I looked at the stats on women and who buys food, guess who buys the food and prepares the food in homes, for the most part? Women say between 56 and 78% say they’re the ones that make the food decisions. So we need to figure out how do we get to the people who are buying the food, who are preparing the food, in ways that are really approachable and don’t make it look like it’s a moral issue, but that there’s some other way to disrupt it.

Michael Grunwald: Katherine, that’s such a great point. I would also note that particularly in this alternative protein space, most of the people running these companies are also vegans and they’re trying to make meat for meat eaters, which is because making fake meat for vegans, what’s the point? That’s not, in terms of the environment, that’s not helping, vegans aren’t the problem. But yes, it’s absolutely they have really failed to meet the market and essentially, the dogs didn’t like the food.

I started my reporting for this book at the Good Food Conference in 2019, and this was the convening of all the different alternative meat. People are making it out of plants, out of animal cells, out of fungi, they’re making alternative dairy and they’re all there. And it was just absolute pandemonium because Beyond Meat had just gone public, it was suddenly worth a third as much as Tyson Foods, it stock was on its way up to $250 a share. There were serious conversations about whether it was going to take 10 or 20 years to get rid of meat. My joke was that I thought I was going to accidentally raise a series A round in the drinks line. It was just the exuberance was off the charts.

And then of course, it turns out that these initial plant-based burgers, they were better than those old vegan hockey pucks, but they weren’t better than meat. So people tried it, but then they didn’t keep buying it. And Beyond Meat went from $250 a share to $2 a share, and investors just ran for the hills.

And I went to the back when I was finishing my reporting to the Good Food Conference in 2023, and it was doom and gloom. It was, Ugh, this was a fad. What were we thinking taking on this trillion-dollar industry? But honestly, I think that’s a little excessive, too. I think as you guys know, that technologies tend to go through the Gardner hype cycle where you have the peak of inflated expectations and then the trough of disillusionment, which is, you are here, but cows are a pretty mature technology and this stuff is going to get better, it’s going to taste better, it’s going to get cheaper, it can even get healthier. And once there’s a compelling use case, I think then people are going to buy it.

But as you said, Katherine, it’s not just going to be because like, “Hey, this is better for the planet,” or even, “Hey, this is better for animals,” because every year there’s been a lot of new information about how meat is bad for the planet, and you see new videos about the horrible way that animals are treated, and every year the world eats more meat. We’re up to 350 million tons a year.

Katherine Hamilton: I do have a question here, which is how can farmers help us do better? I say this because I live in Culpepper, which is a farm community, and I go to farm days every year. I go to, just this weekend, I went to the farm show, which is Culpepper Madison, Rappahannock Counties. It’s like the 4H Club where all the young people, the kids bring their favorite cow, pig, sheep, goat, bunny, one of them had a peacock. They bring all of their animals and get awarded prizes, and they’re so proud of it. There’s a big cooperative extension network. There are land grant colleges in Virginia, like Virginia Tech, Virginia State, that are really helping these communities find new techniques.

I have, my neighbors are farmers. We buy all, any meat that we buy, we buy from them. And they use techniques like they move their cattle from every single day. So at the end of 30 days, they’re back to the original field. They never have to feed them grain. They don’t use that much space. And it feels like the farmers who are producing this and who love what they do and know the most about the land could help us find those solutions and use technology.

Michael Grunwald: Well, I agree with that, Katherine, in fact, and as Jigar suggested, some of that rotational grazing is really effective and can help increase stocking rates, which essentially increases productivity. And right now, beef is, from a land use and emissions perspective, about 10 times worse than chicken or pork. And I visited ranches in Brazil where they’re doing it way better. And so it’s only three or four times worse than chicken or pork, and that makes a huge difference. If they’re 10 times more efficient than the average degraded ranch in Brazil, then they’re using one 10th as much of the Amazon, and that’s really important.

Now, I should also say some of those ranches while they were doing rotational grazing and they were integrating their cattle with their cover crops in ways that Michael Pollan would really love, they’re also fertilizing their pastures and they have feedlots, which Michael Pollan wouldn’t like at all. And again, they didn’t read Michael, they’re just doing whatever they think it takes to create kick yields. But that is really what I would say to farmers is that, that is important. You need to make more food per acre because otherwise, you’re going to need more acres to make the same amount of food, and that’s what’s eating the earth.

So I do understand people love their old, the diverse farms with the red barns and they’re pastoral and they’re rustic, and they treat the soil nicely, and the animals have names instead of numbers, but if they’re not efficient, they’re not helping the earth because the real environmental tragedy of agriculture is not the transformation of those rustic, bucolic, kinder and gentler farms into the evil chemical drenched monoculture farms, the factory farms.

There is an environmental cost to that, don’t get me wrong, but the real disaster, the real loss of carbon, the real loss of biodiversity is when nature becomes those nice diverse farms in the first place.

Stephen Lacey: Well, this brings us to a more controversial topic, and that is around the role of industrial scale agriculture to solve the problem. And this brings us to one of those solutions that has been lionized regenerative agriculture. There’ve been tons of documentaries about it, and it’s in corporate ESG plans. And you say it’s mostly hype and that sort of coming out of the Michael Pollan era of writing about food, people thought that localization of food, getting their food from small farms, while it has tons of economic and ethical benefits, is not the climate solution if you’re just looking at the carbon math.

So can you talk about some of the feel-good agricultural solutions a bit deeper and why they have caught on and why people think that they’re a solution and what the actual reality is?

Michael Grunwald: Sure. What I would say is I try not to be prescriptive about how people should farm the specific practices, whether you should be regenerative or industrial, but I do think it’s really important that it needs to be productive and efficient and high yield because otherwise, we’re going to eat a lot more of the earth. We’re going to need 50% more calories by 2050. Right now we’re on track to deforest another dozen Californias worth of land to feed nearly 10 billion people, and we just don’t have another dozen Californias worth of forest to spare.

So what I do say is that you cannot hand wave away this yield problem and that these glorified gardens that are sometimes regenerative ag, it’s absolutely nicer for the soil, but if it is not the kind of regenerative ag that is promoting powerful yields, then it is. I think that is an ethical problem because remember, climate change, it isn’t just a question of whether your farm looks nice. That’s going to be devastating for indigenous people in the Amazon for smallholder farmers in Africa, for poor people living in the floodplains in Bangladesh.

So I do think that this idea… I did a debate at Berkeley with this professor of agroecology who was pushing a lot of these kinder and gentler more natural practices and was suggesting that yields don’t matter. And Alice Waters, the famous chef from Chez Panisse is like does part of this regenerative, slow food, organic movement. She was sitting in the third row glaring at me the whole time like I was the big evil industrial guy. But the fact is there are absolutely problems with these factory farms where they treat people badly, they treat animals badly, they use too many antibiotics, their politics suck, they’re lobbying against environmental regulation and climate action. But one thing factories are really good at is manufacturing a lot of affordable commodities.

And that is agriculture’s number one job over the next 30 years. We’re going to have to make more calories over the next 30 years than we made over the last 12,000. And so I think factory farms are going to have to change. They’re going to have to make a lot more food with a lot less mess. But this idea that we can just get rid of them and transform to a global agroecological paradise, I think that’s a faith-based transformation of agriculture that could sacrifice not only the wellbeing of billions of people in the developing world, but it’s going to tear down a lot of forest.

Jigar Shah: I think that we’re in this place right now where a lot of the narratives that were being sold to people around why they should be hopeful are turning out to be less ideal than, I think, were originally provided, whether it’s around solar, wind, and battery storage, or whether it’s around small farms where you’re paying three times the cost of what you normally pay at farmer’s markets to make yourself feel better.

I think one of the things I’m curious about, though, in this moment is the politics of it all. Because part of the challenge I see is that we are increasingly going into a place where the established providers of solutions have a huge amount of money to try to keep things the way that they are. And the folks who are promoting new solutions have a lot less money. So to the extent that they’re under the radar screen, they might get away with it or less objectionable to the people in power. But once you start becoming real, then you start getting in the crosshairs of some of these folks.

So when you think about the fossil fuel industry did try to tear down the biofuels industry in the first Trump administration. Remember they tried to get a lot more exemptions for the ethanol, blenders credit, et cetera, and they got their ass handed to them by the ethanol industry, and so I don’t think they’re trying to do that this time around. And so I’m curious how you think the power dynamics work? The other piece of this obviously was in the first Trump administration, you had this trillion trees effort that people were backing. And so how does this work, not just from a technology standpoint, but from a politics standpoint?

Michael Grunwald: Well, it’s hard. And the ag industry, yeah, they’re way more powerful than the oil industry or Wall Street or any of these lobbies that are often used as shorthand for power in Washington. They’re nothing compared to the 1% of Americans who grow food for the other 99% of us. I had an op-ed this weekend in the New York Times where I did call for a new kind of food and ag politics that’s more centered on eaters rather than growers, particularly for Democrats who at least, Republicans, you can understand why they’re sucking up to these farmers who are the biggest funders of their campaigns and are the biggest suppliers of their votes. Democrats are throwing money at these guys who will never vote for them in a million years. So you think they would be open to at least a grand bargain where, okay, we’ll keep giving you your money, but there are at least going to be some strings attached.

And I do think globally that is part of the answer, and it’s again an idealistic answer, but the agricultural industry gets $600 billion worth of subsidies worldwide every year. And I think it’s probably unrealistic to say that we’re just going to take them away, but it’s not entirely unrealistic to say that. Well, maybe we could try to steer some of that towards making them do some good stuff with it.

And I will point to what just happened in Denmark where they passed an agricultural reform that is essentially the Mike Grunwald dream reform, and I know it’s Denmark, they’re the model nation. It’s only 6 million people, but they could be a model for the world. And I would first say that they’ve done such a great job decarbonizing energy, that suddenly ag was an outlier, and they were the only ones with no path to zero emissions. And environmentalists there were starting to say, “Let’s shut down our pork industry. Let’s shut down our dairy industry.” So the ag guys came to the table, but they’re really powerful.

Denmark has a larger percentage of its land devoted to agriculture than any country except for Bangladesh. And they passed a tax on agricultural emissions. They passed a law that’s going to require a million acres of Danish farmland to return to nature, but they also have a lot of government assistance to help them increase yields so they can be even more efficient. They’re not forcing them to shut down their pig farms and their dairy farms and outsource all their pollution and deforestation to the developing world. Instead, they’re going to help invest in climate friendly technologies, the feed additives that’ll help their cattle burp less methane, and the gene edited crops that’ll grow with higher yields and drought tolerant and flood tolerant to feed to their pigs. So I think they’re going to do all the things, and it shows that it can be done, even if it isn’t being done in a lot of places.

Katherine Hamilton: And Michael, you want to appeal to the pocketbook, as well, the pocketbook of the farmers. So if you think about, of course, you want the footprint to be smaller, so you’re not just continually tearing up forestry to provide food, but getting more food per acre to fill more stomachs. That, to me, sounds like more money. Also generating fewer greenhouse gas emissions. So we got that covered, we can figure that out.

And I would just say there’s an interesting example from ALEC, the American Legislative Exchange Council, which is a right wing group, Coke brothers funded group that does legislative proposals in various states, and they have a resolution in support of farming and energy production. And this is all about community solar and farming and trying to get the greenhouse gas emissions down, but not because of greenhouse gas emissions, but because of productivity and because of being able to make money and doing two things for the price of one, being able to multi-use the land, be able to produce several things with one piece of land.

So I’m interested in how do you, from a policy standpoint, yes, you want to get the accounting rules right, but that feels like a stick for the farming folks. Putting tax on emissions is a stick and you’re saying we need to support. So all right, grants are fine. But also, how do you actually allow these folks to feel like, well, we’re going to actually do better and make more money if we can produce more?

Michael Grunwald: That’s a great question, and one thing I would point out is to go back to the alternative proteins a little bit. Companies like Cargill and Tyson, they’re all in on this stuff. They love it because particularly you look at the Cargill business model, they have unbelievably tiny margins. They’re just dealing with such massive amounts of grain and meat that they really do make it up on volume. But selling the feed to feed cells instead of cows, these high value, high margin commodities, they would love to get into that business. And JBS is building a cultivated meat factory in Spain. So I think that’s one example.

I do think you’re right, and the Biden administration did take an all carrots approach to dealing with the farm industry. Secretary Vilsack and his aides were just like, we are not going to convince these Republican farmers wearing John Deere caps that we are not going to tell them what to do. It just won’t work. We’re going to just pay them to try to do the right things. And they put $20 billion into climate smart agriculture. Now, I would argue that some of it was, most it was focused on these soil carbon solutions, these idea that if you do regenerative farming, that all that carbon that we pumped into the sky will magically be repatriated into the soil. And I think the science on that is terrible, and that’s not where I would’ve put the money.

But I think the idea that we are going to make it in farmer’s interest to do things that we consider climate friendly is certainly the right idea because as Jigar keeps pointing out, they are a very powerful lobby. And the idea that you’re going to muscle them on farm policy, which all the political science about how intense interests pay more attention to policy than the diffuse interests, the 1% of growers watch farm policy a lot more closely than the 99% of eaters. So I think you’re absolutely right that carrots are going to be very important.

Learning from energy’s scaling playbook

Stephen Lacey: So Michael, if we think about whether agriculture can learn from the scaling playbook in energy, are there any lessons that you have drawn over from your reporting and experience in energy that you think can be applied to some of these technological solutions in ag?

Michael Grunwald: Sure. Look, food we vote on three times a day, so it is really personal, but I do think some of those larger energy stories that we talked about where solar was nowhere for decades, before Jigar got involved, but also government got involved. And so the importance of research, the importance of figuring out what works and then deploy, deploy, deploy what works, that I wrote, my last book was about the Obama stimulus, which tried to let a thousand clean energy flowers bloom, poured $90 billion into all kinds of solutions and really helped with solar and wind and LEDs and electric vehicle batteries helped jumpstart that when the market wasn’t interested so that the market could get more interested.

And then also had a lot of failures with the famous Cylindra solar manufacturing.

Stephen Lacey: Wait, what company is that? Never heard of it.

Michael Grunwald: The guys doing the concentrated solar in the desert, and A123 with batteries, and the next gen clean coal plant, and a bunch of biofuel refineries that didn’t work out. But failure is part of it. And I think that you have to be okay with that. That’s certainly a lesson. And then that policy matters that you do have to get the incentives right.

If you look at, we talked a lot about the difference between productive ranches and degraded ranches in Brazil. Right now, if you are running one of those productive ranches that use 1/10th as much of the Amazon and can put 10 times as many cows per acre, the smartest thing you could do to access the carbon markets would be to re-degrade it. Because right now, the carbon markets think you have more emissions because you have more cows and you’re fertilizing your pastures, so you have nitrous oxide emissions and you’re getting no credit for the land use miracle that you’re creating and the savings that are outside the four walls of your property.

So I do think what I bang my spoon on my high chair about is this idea that land matters. Land is not free. Every acre is sacred and that we need to think about that when we do policy. And also in our individual lives. The average American eats the equivalent of three burgers a week. If we ate two burgers a week, we would save the equivalent of a landmass the size of Massachusetts every year. So I’ve cut beef out of my diet, not as good as going vegan, but we all find the level of hypocrisy that we’re comfortable with. And I think not everybody’s writing a book about food and climate, but like I said, maybe one meal a day, you don’t have meat, maybe you have a little less beef. And I do think even though these are drops in the bucket, the drops fill the bucket, particularly on food issues. So I think it’s not hopeless, but it’s really hard.

Jigar Shah: One of my best friends is Suzanne Hunt, who has been doing this kind of land issue work and biofuels research for a long time, was on the advisory board for Monsanto and Bayer and trying to figure that out, too. And look, I do think that one of the things that I’m taking away from this is that your book is seminal and everyone should read it, but more importantly that we actually don’t have a clear plan on how to reduce emissions here. And people actually need to start doing charrettes and gatherings locally to have this conversation because it does feel like people are bringing a lot of priors to the table that are not necessarily science-based, and they are not going to be happy reading an op ed from you or me or Katherine or anybody else, and rallying behind that as their policy prescription for two years from now.

I feel like people actually need a lot more education, a lot more engagement to get to a set of policy prescriptions that they believe are the right ones to work with Big Ag in some cases and work against Big Ag in other places, and work with Big Fossil in some places and work against Big Fossil in other places. I do think that part of what you’re bringing to the table is an entire rethink of the best practices that people thought were going to get us to a decarbonized ag sector.

Stephen Lacey: Well, that’s a really nice closing thought, Jigar, and I guess that brings me to one final question, Michael, which puts you on the spot a little bit. The people who listen to this podcast are overwhelmingly doers. They’re people in the industry, they’re inside companies building tech, they’re deploying tech. If you were to focus on any one part of the agricultural system or in food tech or whatever it is, where would you suggest, where would you put your attention and where are the areas that you think people need to put more attention?

Michael Grunwald: Well, beef is such an outsized part of the problem. In the United States, we use half our agricultural land for beef that provides 3% of our calories. And we’ve actually, there’s hope there, too, because we’ve reduced our per capita beef consumption by a third over the last 50 years because, not because we care about the climate, but because we’ve started to eat more chicken, but we still eat four times as much beef as the global average. So I think there’s so much room for change there, whether it’s through alternative beef on the demand side or better beef on the supply side. That, I think, is a really fruitful area to work.

Food waste would be another one where we waste a quarter of our food, which means we waste a quarter of the farmland and water and fertilizer and emissions we create to grow that food. And there are a lot of exciting technological and behavioral and political solutions that I think could, there’s no reason for us to be using a landmass the size of China to grow garbage. The average American family wastes $1,500 a year on food that doesn’t reach their stomachs. And so the incentives are nicely aligned. So I think that would be an exciting place to work.

And just generally, I think in the same way that the initial Green Revolution was about chemistry, and that’s how we tripled crop and livestock yields so that we’d otherwise use three times as much land to produce the amount of food we do, I think the 21st century is going to be about biology. So I think all of these synthetic biology solutions, whether it’s fertilizers or pesticides or crops, or even edited livestock, I think that’s where a lot of the excitement and opportunity is.

There are guys at the University of Illinois literally reinventing photosynthesis with artificial intelligence and gene editing and big data, and they think they can increase crop yields 50% just by editing out the inefficiencies in this three-billion-year-old process.

So I think there’s a lot of exciting things, and that’s one of the reasons I have hope is that you do see young people who want to change the world going into this field in a way, maybe 20, 25 years ago, more of them were saying, “Hey, I’ve heard that there are problems in energy and there ought to be an energy gang to talk about it.” Now that’s become a more mature field, which is awesome. And food is the start-ups.

Harnessing a procurement initiative, E.ON is making sure there is good progress in energy transition across Germany in this decade and the future.

To ensure this is done, the energy company has secured long-term contracts with manufacturers in Germany and across Europe for a range of core components to both expand and modernise the infrastructure of the grid.

Procurement volumes for transformers, switchgear and local network stations, as well as both medium and low voltage cables, have hit a total of more than €6bn (approx US$6.9bn).

The scope of this procurement operation includes a range of items, including over 100,000 kilometres of medium- and low-voltage cables, several 10,000 digital local network stations, more than 500 medium-voltage circuit breaker systems for substations and around 29,000 distribution and power transformers.

Through these components being integrated across the distribution grid in Germany, E.ON is enabling the connection of numerous wind and solar farms, the further ramp-up of electromobility and heat pumps, as well as battery storage systems and data centres.

Thomas König, Chief Operating Officer Networks in the Management Board of E.ON, says: ""Massive investments and at the same time consistent standardisation and digitisation are our central contribution as a grid operator to advance the energy transition in Germany and make it economical.”

How the NHS can Unlock Procurement Innovation

The Health Tech Alliance (HTA), a coalition of health technology companies and stakeholders across the NHS and the wider health system have published a report which outlines the need for reform in NHS procurement.

The HTA is a solutions-driven coalition of health technology (health tech) companies, united by the aim of driving up the adoption of health tech that are proven to improve patient outcomes and deliver cost savings to the NHS.

Its membership ranges from established global medical technology (med tech) firms to smaller-scale startups, developing innovative solutions for diagnostics, digital health and medical devices.

Following a series of findings with NHS leaders, clinicians, industry and policymakers, it has detailed how bureaucratic complexity and fragmented pathways are slowing the adoption of life-improving innovation across the health service.

The report, Unlocking innovation: recommendations for transforming NHS health tech procurement by the Health Tech Alliance, sets out an analysis of the current NHS procurement landscape, and a set of recommendations and solutions to help the NHS unlock sustainable transformation of the health system.

It has created a roadmap for forming a procurement system which will be more streamlined, transparent and innovation-friendly, all of which is essential for delivering better patient outcomes and long-term value for the NHS.

Within this 10 year health plan, it also explores the implementation of a standardised value-based procurement guidance for devices and digital products starting in early 2026, this report is an analysis of the current system and necessary practical steps for driving systematic change.

With a 40% investment from the Royal Schiphol Group, MST is guided by a strategy rooted in the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) programme, MST is laying the foundation for a greener regional aviation future.

A milestone in carbon management

In November 2024, MST renewed its Level 3 Optimisation status under the ACA programme, underscoring its commitment to reducing emissions across the board. The achievement was no small feat, especially given the airport’s control over all internal operations, including ground handling.

“We are proud to have successfully transitioned from Level 2 to Level 3 in a remarkably short time, demonstrating our strong commitment to sustainable aviation and environmental responsibility,” says Roel Ubaghs, Head of Innovation, Sustainability & IT at MST.

Level 3 accreditation has also prompted a broader view of emissions at the airport. In addition to Scope 1 and 2 emissions, MST is now actively managing Scope 3 emissions, including landing and take-off (LTO) cycle emissions, staff business travel, and passenger and employee access to the airport.

“Our strategy aligns with the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program, ensuring we remain an environmentally responsible airport and an attractive choice for airlines seeking a sustainable cargo hub,” Ubaghs adds.

“This reflects our dedication to being a responsible partner to airlines and other carriers.”

Scaling up solar and sustainable energy Central to MST’s energy transition is its solar energy programme. The airport already operates a solar park and is exploring an expansion to replace as much of its annual energy demand as possible with self-generated power. While the exact share of solar power is yet to be determined, MST is assessing the scale and phasing of future installations.

However, growth in renewables is tempered by grid constraints. “We must also consider current grid constraints and grid feed-in possibilities with our grid operator,” Ubaghs notes, acknowledging the logistical and infrastructural challenges that come with scaling solar production.

For now, there are no concrete plans for wind or hydrogen-based energy projects. The feasibility of such options is still under analysis, with MST opting for a measured approach that prioritises compatibility with its energy goals and regional conditions.

Greener ground operations Reducing direct emissions remains a critical focus area for MST. The airport has taken steps to electrify its handling equipment and fleet, improve building insulation, and gradually eliminate the use of gas for heating and other operational needs. It has also implemented restrictions on the use of Auxiliary Power Units (APUs) and is exploring alternative fuels where feasible.

A detailed Ground Support Equipment (GSE) fleet renewal calendar is also in place, guiding the airport’s transition to electric alternatives through to 2030.

“All new equipment will be sustainable, with a preference for electric options where available and deemed a sustainable investment,” says Ubaghs. “To provide for this, the airport must also have sufficient charging infrastructure in place. There is still a lot to research on this topic; a transition of this size has not been seen before in the history of the airport.”

Waste and push for circularity On the waste management front, MST has been working closely with external partners to boost recycling and minimise waste sent to landfills. Its waste contractor plays a key role in ensuring optimal sorting and processing, resulting in steadily rising recycling rates.

While the airport currently has no formal circular economy partnerships with airlines or tenants, it remains open to collaboration and is inviting stakeholders to join its sustainability journey.

“We believe that achieving sustainability goals can only be effective through collective action,” says Ubaghs.

Culture and collaboration Internally, MST is fostering a culture of awareness and accountability. Staff are encouraged to adopt sustainable practices, supported by visible cues such as clearly marked eco-friendly equipment and regular communications around policy changes, including APU restrictions, to ensure compliance.

Externally, the airport continues to play an active role in industry-wide initiatives. Last summer, it contributed to the Electrifly project, marking the first European cross-border electric flight available to the public. “We are proud to have played a key role in this pioneering innovation, testing the future of sustainable aviation, and we were thrilled with the success of the project,” says Ubaghs. Although it wasn’t a cargo flight, the outcomes provide valuable data on the feasibility of electric aviation. Our involvement reflects our strong commitment to innovations that drive the industry towards a more environmentally responsible future.”

MST, alongside Dutch regional airports, OEMs, and airlines, is part of the Power Up initiative, a platform helping airports prepare for the arrival of commercial electric aircraft. It is focused on preparing infrastructure, processes, and safety protocols for commercial electric aircraft.

Navigating the challenges ahead Transitioning to a fully sustainable airport operation presents a host of complex challenges. A key concern is ensuring that electric vehicles and equipment are not only available but also efficient and capable of supporting daily operations. While MST has committed to sustainable replacements, not all specialised equipment currently has viable electric alternatives.

The availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is another major hurdle. “The market for SAF is still developing, and availability remains limited,” says Ubaghs. “We work closely with our partners to explore all available options and have invested in measures that have enabled us to progress through the ACA certification levels.”

Building out charging infrastructure adds another layer of complexity. MST must navigate compliance requirements for integrating new energy sources while managing investments and potential wait times for new equipment.

Adding to these operational challenges is a broader structural issue: limited capacity on the public power grid in the Netherlands. This bottleneck complicates the airport’s ability to scale renewable energy usage and implement the necessary infrastructure for a full transition.

Despite these constraints, MST remains focused on finding innovative, scalable solutions to meet its sustainability goals.

A scalable vision for regional aviation

Looking ahead, MST is excited to play a leading role in shaping sustainable regional aviation in Europe. As demonstrated by the success of the Electrifly project—the first European cross-border electric flight available to the public—the airport is committed to innovation and to supporting the future of sustainable aviation.

By continuously improving and future-proofing its facilities, MST is confident in its progress toward meeting its 2030 net-zero commitments. Although it operates on a smaller scale, this gives the airport the flexibility to implement sustainable practices quickly and effectively, setting an example for other regional airports. MST remains eager to collaborate with industry partners to help shape the next generation of sustainable air transport.

It would fund global solidarity and climate change efforts.

The proposed ‘Premium’ tax levy

The initiative, supported by the European Commission and coordinated by the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, was launched June 30 at the U.N. Financing for Development conference in Seville. It aims to raise funds by taxing business- and first-class passengers, including private jet travellers, to support global climate and development efforts. The proposal, in line with global sustainability goals, has sparked debate over its potential impact on airline financial stability and international travel.

The travel levy would complement a broader list of proposed aviation-related taxes, raising substantial funds for climate change action. A June assessment from the GSLTF outlined several options, including ticket taxes such as frequent flyer and modular ticket taxes, commercial jet fuel charges, and private jet fuel levies. Environmental consultancy DE Delft estimated that ticket-based taxation alone could generate between €62 billion and €84 billion annually. Adding a premium levy would raise an additional €78 billion, according to its latest research.

The initiative, backed by the coalition and co-chaired by France, Kenya, and Barbados, aims to align with the UN climate finance and equity ambitions ahead of COP30. As one of the largest sources of emissions, the aviation sector would increase its contribution to what the GSLTF describes as a ‘fair transition and resilience’, offsetting the carbon footprint of premium travel toward development efforts, such as revenue mobilisation, climate crisis mitigation, and pandemic adaptation in developing countries.

The coalition is calling for broader international support. French President Emmanuel Macron highlighted the challenge of global financing at the FFD4. He said:

“We need those who benefited from globalisation to contribute more. European Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, Wopke Hoekstra, added, “I invite all partners to join and closely follow the important work of the Taskforce, especially as we approach COP30.”

IATA’s Counter Arguments: Global solidarity, but at what cost?

IATA rejected the proposed premium travel levy, expressing disappointment and warning it would make it challenging for airlines to meet climate targets. IATA called the tax disproportionate, raising the issue of airline financial sustainability. The group argues that the industry is already experiencing weak margins while investing $4.7 trillion to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. IATA also criticised the proposal for overlooking the existing systems, such as CORSIA, the ICAO-led framework for managing aviation carbon emissions and offsets.

IATA General Director Willie Walsh said:

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow. Yet governments casually suggest a tax on flyers that is three times the airline industry’s annual profit without considering the real-world side effects.”

The association also warned that the taxes could impact route viability, reduce connectivity, and lead to higher fares in general.

Walsh added:

“To be clear, airlines are not evading doing their part to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The industry is doing everything possible to achieve net zero carbon emissions with Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), more efficient operations, and better technology.”

According to a Savanta survey commissioned by IATA across fifteen countries revealed public scepticism towards aviation taxation was revealed. Nearly 80% of respondents said air travel is already overtaxed, while 78% viewed further taxation as an ineffective climate action strategy. Only 9% supported taxation, with most preferring alternative methods such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel investments (SAF), low-carbon technologies, and climate research.

France’s Blueprint and Greenpeace’s Support

France’s introduction of a premium travel tax on business and first-class tickets departing French airports, in late 2024, has already laid the groundwork for national action. The policy previously reported by Travel Radar aims to steer travellers’ choices toward lower-carbon modes of transportation, such as rail, to fund sustainable infrastructure.

Greenpeace International welcomed a broader push for premium flyer levies, calling it a crucial step in holding “binge users of this undertaxed sector” accountable. Rebecca Newsom, the group’s global political lead, said,

“With the cost of climate impacts surging in countries least responsible for the crisis, bold, cooperative action that makes polluters pay is not just fair—it’s essential.”

The proposal to tax premium air has sparked global debates over fairness, climate change responsibility, and aviation financial sustainability. With IATA pushing back and campaigners doubling down, the question remains: should premium travellers pay more?",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/private-jet-2360656-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1709&ssl=1,N,,2025-07-18 16:57:41.615728

The European aviation sector, represented by the DESTINATION 2050 partners*, along with fuel suppliers (Fuels Europe, Hydrogen Europe, Project SkyPower) and cargo and express delivery operators (European Cargo Alliance, European Express Association), have jointly issued an urgent call for stronger policy support to unlock the full decarbonisation potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF).

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reaching net zero emissions in aviation by 2050

The coalition highlights the major challenge of affordable Sustainable Aviation Fuel deployment in Europe. Currently, the SAF market is still in its early stages. HEFA-based fuels (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) are the only commercially available option and remain significantly more expensive than traditional kerosene. Meanwhile, next-generation SAF pathways such as e-SAF and advanced biofuels continue to face difficulties securing investment and reaching Final Investment Decisions (FID).

To address these barriers, the industry has proposed a 10 point action plan focused on reducing early mover risks and supporting the scale-up of SAF production. The plan identifies key regulatory and financial steps needed to de-risk investment, reduce the cost gap, and promote innovation in fuel technologies vital to aviation decarbonisation.

The joint call was formally presented to Apostolos Tzitzikostas, Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, during the Implementation Dialogue focused on scaling up renewable and low carbon transport fuels.

This initiative comes as the European Commission prepares to release its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan in Q3 2025, which is expected to provide crucial support for SAF deployment and infrastructure.

The Freedom Pines Fuels facility, developed by LanzaJet with $200 million in funding, will produce 10 million gallons annually of SAF and renewable diesel using ethanol as the primary feedstock. For India, this development holds deep strategic relevance as it pursues both energy self-reliance and aviation decarbonisation.

India’s ethanol ecosystem has seen significant progress in recent years, with ethanol blending in petrol rising steadily and production exceeding 4.5 billion litres in FY 2023–24. Backed by strong agricultural output, particularly sugarcane and grain, India has become a global leader in ethanol supply. While the country’s ethanol push has so far focused on road transport, this abundant feedstock can also be a launchpad for SAF production using ATJ technology, mirroring the model being executed in Georgia.

The government of India has laid out a roadmap to kickstart domestic SAF production by 2027, with the goal of adopting SAF blending mandates by 2030. An ethanol-based SAF facility could not only help airlines lower carbon emissions in line with global aviation targets but also reduce fuel import dependency. The Georgia plant demonstrates how ethanol-derived SAF can be commercially viable with the right partnerships, modular facility designs, and public-private funding. The US government has supported the plant through tax credits and USDA grants, offering a potential blueprint for India.

India's aviation sector is one of the fastest-growing in the world, and the need to align sustainability goals with fuel security is critical. A domestic ATJ facility could be integrated into existing ethanol supply chains, especially in states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu. This would create rural employment, build technical capabilities, and position India as a regional hub for SAF exports. However, India must act now by initiating policy incentives, ensuring carbon-eligible feedstock supply, and forging global tech partnerships with ATJ pioneers such as LanzaJet or Avina Clean Hydrogen.

The Georgia ethanol-to-jet fuel plant is more than a local infrastructure project; it is a global signal that SAF produced from ethanol is ready to scale. For India, which has already built the feedstock base, the next logical step is to invest in ethanol-to-jet technology and transform its energy and aviation sectors simultaneously.

Dear reader,

Financial Times columnist Stephen Bush wrote earlier this week about “how magical thinking came for net zero critics”. He talks of the “curious idea doing the rounds on the right: that climate change is real, that it is caused by human activity but that European countries cannot meaningfully shape whether the world reaches net zero and is thus able to limit warming”.

Within this framing, the UK Conservative party and many other rightwing politicians across the EU are undermining climate action and pushing policies they know will do nothing to reduce emissions and will ultimately likely contribute to wreaking more death and destruction on people and the economy.

Reacting to accusations by Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch that Labour’s focus on net zero is ideological, Stephen writes: “Genuine realism in politics is recognising that you have to deal with the circumstances you actually face, not the ones that you want to. The truly ‘ideological’ decision is to think that the pressures on our planet and our public finances can be deferred in favour of easier topics and smaller challenges.”

The European Commission would doubtless argue (given the short-term horizons of policymakers) that defence and competitiveness, currently top of the EU agenda, are not “smaller challenges” than climate change. They are also “easier topics” to sell to the rightwing politicians leading the charge in most European countries — and to a public fed on a diet of siloed social media posts and suffering from a sense of being left behind or ignored as others profit.

The ongoing omnibus proposals — with more simplification of environmental policies threatened for the autumn — and the next multiannual EU budget proposal are cases in point. The EU executive, like many national leaders, talks a good talk on climate change and biodiversity loss. Yet this week it proposed essentially axing LIFE, the bloc’s environmental support programme, and moving its focus solely to the clean transition and industrialisation, rather than nature.

Faustine Bas-Defossez, director for health, nature and the environment at the European Environmental Bureau, writing on LinkedIn also shows how the commission watered down its language on LIFE from a leaked draft to this week’s final version, removing any support for nature and climate advocacy.

In the face of all this, non-profits — including the EEB, the WWF and Transport & Environment — have published a letter underlining their “serious concerns” about the proposed multiannual financial framework. They believe if passed in its current form it will lead, in real terms, to a significant reduction in funding for climate and nature, “at a time where increased investments are essential to shield European people and businesses from the growing impacts of climate change”. The commission’s own analysis shows more, not less, public funding for climate and nature are needed.

Calls for pragmatism — French President Emmanuel Macron is a master of this — to justify decisions that do not match reality will not deliver for anyone. It is not ideology to demand action on, as Stephen says when it comes to its impact on the future, “the most significant of the crises facing the world”.

Latest sustainability news and views

The UK Reform party and Donald Trump’s administration in the US are also magical thinkers, believing they can ignore climate change and its impacts on people and business and will be lauded for doing so. This may win at the ballot box today as people continue to vote largely on other issues, but events such as the flooding in Texas could change voters’ moods.

VCM turns a corner

Elsewhere, Alexia Kelly, managing director of the Carbon Policy and Markets Initiative at the High Tide Foundation, explains why she believes recent reforms have helped the voluntary carbon market turn a corner.

She argues the next step is for policy to be rolled out in tandem to support investor confidence and buyer clarity in the next era of the VCM. This absence of policy is stymying further private sector investment in these nascent markets, writes Kelly, with the total value of credits traded last year — $530mn — about a quarter of 2021’s market size and the lowest transaction volume since 2018.

As part of efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and align with EU renewable energy regulations, INA successfully completed a pilot project processing bio-feedstock at its hydrocracking unit. In addition to SAF, a significant quantity of renewable diesel fuel (HVO – Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) was also produced.

The European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive mandates ambitious targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable sources in transport.

In response, INA plans to complete all preparatory activities and be ready for continuous market supply of SAF by 2029.

The project was carried out in cooperation with the refinery’s technology licensor, Chevron Lummus Global (CLG), with the goal of testing the processing of 5% POME (Palm Oil Mill Effluent - a by-product of palm oil production) mixed with fossil feedstocks.

The pilot project was run from 5 to 13 May 2025, during which 1,000 tonnes of bio-feedstock were processed.

The NovaSAF 1 facility will convert dairy waste and biogas into drop-in jet fuel with a nameplate capacity of 500,000 gallons annually, using only renewable electricity and waste gas—no green hydrogen, no complex gasification.

At the heart of the project is Syzygy's light-driven GHG e-Reforming technology, which produces the ideal 2:1 syngas ratio for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis directly from biogenic methane and CO₂.

This breakthrough eliminates the need for water-intensive steam reforming or expensive electrolysers, radically simplifying the SAF value chain.

To convert that syngas into high-yield jet fuel, Syzygy has selected Velocys and its microFTL technology, known for reliability and for maximizing fuel output, both critical factors in driving down the total cost required to produce synthetic fuel.

I rise to speak on clause 6 and new clause 6. As we have heard, clause 6 would create a levy on fuel producers. While I do not necessarily believe that to be the wrong approach, as with much of the Bill, the devil will be in the detail that is not available for us to scrutinise here, for obvious reasons. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam will make clear, there may be unintended consequences if the regulations are not designed correctly.

In my opinion, leaving much of the mechanism to a later date is not necessarily a bad thing—I agree with the flexibility that is being put in place. With a new, emerging technology and industry, ensuring that the Government’s hands are not tied at this early stage is a strength, not a weakness. That notwithstanding, some assurances should be given about how the mechanism will be designed, and how the potential flaws raised in the written evidence received by the Committee will be sidestepped. I point in particular to the written evidence from Valero.

Clause 6(3) implies that the levy will be based on criteria relating to the historical market share of fuel suppliers. That has been raised by those in the industry as potentially having unintended consequences. As I raised yesterday with the Minister, who I am not convinced gave me the clearest of answers, there have been worries that it may allow new market entrants not to pay any levy, as they will not have had a previous market share. Will he commit to ensuring that the levy regulations will account for such obvious loopholes?

It is clear that the challenge of decarbonisation, both in aviation and beyond, is great and will not be solved without collaboration with our closest international partners. I therefore tabled new clause 6, which would require the Government to review the differences between our approach to sustainable aviation fuel and that of our European partners in the European common aviation area. With 71% of international air passengers at UK airports travelling to or from Europe, it seems sensible that we should strive to be in broad alignment with Europe with regard to SAF.

I appreciate that there may be differences: in the case of the early part of our SAF mandate, we are going further and faster than the ECAA, but our European partners may accelerate beyond our thresholds later on. However, we believe it is important to remain mindful of what our partners across Europe are doing in an industry that has international competition at its very heart. The new clause would ensure that the Government are fully aware of differences in policy, and alive to any unintended consequences or differences that the Bill could result in for those in the aviation industry. We think that would be helpful.

I would welcome the Minister’s observations on both the mechanism that we have suggested and the broader issue of alignment with our European partners. This is, of course, a probing clause. Can the Minister assure the Committee that the Government will keep a watching brief on what the ECAA are doing with regard to SAF from here on?

Mr Kohler - Hansard - -

I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.

New clause 3 would require the Secretary of State to publish a report within six months of the Act’s passing, reviewing how we can better secure the supply of bioethanol for use in sustainable aviation fuel production.

The success of the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel ambitions will rely not only on bold targets and optimistic projections, but on the reliable availability of the resources needed for manufacturing. Bioethanol will be a resource that can be part of the manufacturing process for SAF, and help support a low-carbon industry in the UK, yet while the Government continue to laud their commitment to green aviation, they have stood by while domestic bioethanol production is at risk from Donald Trump’s bully boy tactics.

Since the signing of the UK-US trade deal, the owners of two UK bioethanol plants based in Hull and Teesside have threatened to close the sites as the trade agreement fundamentally undermines their business position. This Government have given US ethanol producers a 1.4 billion litre tariff-free quota—equivalent to the UK’s entire annual demand for the product—and completely undercut the industry, making the UK vulnerable to the whims of, to put it at its mildest, the mercurial Trump Administration.

The new clause would require the Government to assess the impact of plant closures on SAF production potential, set out options to mitigate supply risks and, crucially, recommend the policy steps needed to promote a stable domestic supply of bioethanol. We cannot afford to leave this to chance, or to the good will of a US President who, as we all know, simply cannot be trusted. If the Government are serious about scaling up SAF production, they must ensure that the raw materials are available. That means a proper strategy to support and stabilise the UK’s bioethanol sector.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - -

As we are all aware, aviation is one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise and one of the fastest growing sources of emissions worldwide. While other sectors benefit from mature, low-carbon technologies, aviation remains heavily dependent on fossil jet fuel, and is one of the few industries where there is not an alternative available already. The Bill will attempt to grow the alternative industry, but it is clear that its provisions are only the first steps on a long journey to reach net zero by 2050 in aviation. If we are serious about hitting net zero by 2050, we must be equally serious about tracking our progress and course-correcting where necessary.

New clause 4 would require the Secretary of State to conduct an annual review of what contribution the revenue certainty mechanism is making in helping the UK achieve its target of net zero aviation emissions by 2050. It is a simple step that would help us to understand further the impact our SAF policy is having on our net zero targets, and whether other changes or alterations will be needed in the jet zero plan. It would allow us to ensure we understand, year by year, whether we are making the progress the science demands. Are SAF volumes increasing fast enough? Are emissions falling across domestic and international routes fast enough? Are the technologies we are backing delivering real, verifiable carbon savings? To reach net zero, those are the questions we should ask, and we must ensure that we have the evidence base to do so. The new clause would help provide us with that information as a guard against complacency.

New clause 5 would also contribute to our net zero responsibilities. It would require the Secretary of State to, within six months of the day on which the Bill is passed, publish and lay before a Parliament a report that sets out a strategy for increasing greenhouse gas emission savings from SAF production in the UK. It would allow us to understand and ensure that we are implementing new technologies within SAF production. The point of SAF is to reduce the carbon cycle of jet fuel. We should be vigilant in ensuring that anything marked as SAF delivers just that.

New clause 5 consequently sets a minimum standard of the lifetime carbon emissions that can be classed as SAF, and ensures that that is monitored effectively. If we do not embed a culture of accountability, we risk drifting and passing legislation that sounds ambitious but fails to deliver at the pace required. With only 25 years left to decarbonise a sector that today remains overwhelming fossil fuelled, we cannot afford complacency. This Government have rightly set the bold target of net zero aviation by 2050, which the Liberal Democrats support, but targets must be matched with transparent measurement and a willingness to adapt. These new clauses would simply give us the tools to do just that, and I urge Members to support them.

Mr Kohler - Hansard - -

New clause 4 was of course a probing amendment, and the Minister has satisfied most of us that enough will be done to report on our progress towards net zero. I was less convinced by the Minister’s answer to new clause 5. With or without a chemistry degree, the point is a simple one: SAF is green, but some SAF is greener than other SAF. I am not convinced that the Government are yet embracing that or doing enough to work out which SAF should be pushed because it is the most beneficial to the environment. We will press new clause 5 to a Division, but not new clause 4. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion.

Clause, by leave, withdrawn.

New Clause 5

Increasing greenhouse gas saving potential of sustainable aviation fuel

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Western. We often discuss our bicycles and their technology, but today we have to talk about the revenue certainty mechanism, which I am glad we are doing.

The RCM is part of the Government’s agenda to decarbonise aviation in the United Kingdom. I will address the amendment moved by the hon. Member for Mid Buckinghamshire, but first I put on the record my thanks to him and other Opposition parties for their general support for what we are trying to do in the Bill.

This Government back synthetic power-to-liquid SAF, which is why we have introduced a separate power-to-liquid sub-obligation, the SAF mandate. We have a separate power-to-liquid pot in the advanced fuel fund, which we are funding up to £63 million. Any RCM contracts awarded will be on the basis of the design phase of the project, including technological pathway and feedstock designation. I hope that answers the hon. Member’s worries about redundancy, because the process will evolve.

Making changes to feedstock requirements or fuel type after contracts are awarded would be extremely challenging for producers. Instead, during our contract allocation process, it is for the Government to decide on the right mix of SAF that will be supported under the revenue certainty mechanism. Given that, I ask the hon. Member to withdraw the amendment.

The clause allows the Secretary of State to direct the counterparty to enter into a revenue certainty contract with a SAF producer. The Secretary of State will decide who gets revenue certainty contracts through an allocation process. Making the leap from lab to commercial scale is difficult for SAF producers—we heard that in the evidence sessions on Tuesday. Commercial plants typically cost £600 million to £2 billion, so they need to attract a lot of investment, yet first-of-a-kind plants often struggle to get investment because there is no clear, predictable market price for SAF. The revenue certainty mechanism will address that.

Under the revenue certainty mechanism a SAF producer will enter into a private law contract with a Government-backed counterparty that sets a strike price for SAF. If the producer sells SAF for less than the strike price, the counterparty will pay the difference. If the producer sells it for more than the strike price, it will pay the counterparty. This follows the example of similar schemes in the renewables sector, which showed that a private law contract with a Government-backed counterparty is a rock-solid commitment that will drive investment into projects.

As we heard in our evidence sessions on Tuesday, British SAF producers are ready. They have the tech and the innovation; they just need the final piece of support from the Government to take off. That is why SAF producers, airlines, environmental groups and investors back these measures.

A Government-backed counterparty will enter into the contracts rather than the Secretary of State, because investors value the day-to-day independence of a Government-owned private company and its insulation from political change. The counterparty will also have expertise in contract administration. This follows the model of contracts for difference schemes in other renewables sectors, where the Low Carbon Contracts Company, a Government-owned body, enters into the contracts, rather than the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero.

When we consulted on how the revenue certainty mechanism should be administered, stakeholders strongly supported having a counterparty. The clause ensures that the Secretary of State can exercise control over how and on what terms the counterparty enters into the revenue certainty contracts. This is consistent with the approach for similar schemes. The Government will set eligibility and assessment criteria for the competition to allocate contracts, which will focus on ensuring value for money, maximising the benefits of UK SAF production, and supporting viable projects. Any restrictions on our ability to decide which projects to allocate contracts to would affect those objectives and jeopardise the whole scheme.

The allocation process and the terms of the contract will need to be consistent with the requirements of the Subsidy Control Act 2022, which makes sure there is oversight of the mechanism by the Competition and Markets Authority through the mandatory referral process. The oversight will ensure that the objectives of the revenue certainty mechanism address the subsidy control principles set out in that Act. This includes ensuring that the scheme addresses an identified market failure, that any funding provided is proportionate to achieve that objective, and that any distortions of competition, investment or trade are minimised effectively.

Clause 2 provides that producers must be notified of a direction made under clause 1 that affects them. This provides transparency and ensures that producers are aware of any directions towards them. It also gives the Secretary of State powers to revoke a direction and its effect, which protects the Government from entering into a contract where a producer has not met the criteria defined during the allocation process due to unexpected circumstances. We need to ensure that the taxpayer and the sector are protected, and this clause ensures that we can remove ourselves from the contract negotiation process if any issues arise.

Clause 3 enables the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring the counterparty to maintain a register and publish the revenue certainty contracts, subject to any necessary redactions. This will ensure transparency by keeping a register of successful applicants and information on specific agreements, and make it clear which SAF producers have received contracts and on what terms. We will also continue to publish information on the volume of SAF supplied under the SAF mandate. These publication requirements will balance transparency and the commercial and confidential nature of contracts and negotiations. We believe that any stronger requirements to publish information may make producers reluctant to enter into negotiations or affect our ability to ensure value for money.

Mike Kane - Hansard - -

Clause 6 enables the Secretary of State to introduce, through regulations, a levy on aviation fuel suppliers to meet the costs of payments made by the counterparty to SAF producers and to cover the counterparty’s administrative costs. We plan to fund the revenue certainty mechanism through a levy on industry because it is right that the costs of decarbonising air travel are borne by the aviation sector rather than the taxpayer. We are levying aviation fuel suppliers because placing the levy higher up the supply chain spreads costs across the sector and reduces administrative burdens, and because aviation fuel suppliers will benefit from the greater volumes and lower prices for SAF that the revenue certainty mechanism will create.

Broadly, if the counterparty has incurred costs in a set period, we will cover those costs by levying aviation fuel suppliers based on their share of the fossil fuel market during that period. We are continuing to work closely with industry on the details of how the levy will operate. This approach is in line with the approach of other contracts-for-difference-style schemes, such as in the renewable electricity sector where there is a levy on electricity suppliers. The clause will also ensure that the counterparty’s obligations and activities in respect to the levy are appropriately regulated. I assure Members that the regulations under this clause will be subject to consultation and the affirmative parliamentary procedure, so there will be further opportunities for scrutiny in this area.

Clause 7 enables the levy regulations to require a person who is liable to pay the levy to provide financial collateral to the counterparty. This acts as a failsafe if there is cause for concern about non-payment. It ensures that if a levied party does not make a payment, the counterparty can take any owed money through the collateral. Without this power, there is a risk that non-payments to the counterparty lead to the Government needing to provide financial assistance to ensure that the counterparty can make payments under the revenue certainty mechanism contracts.

Clause 8 enables the levy regulations to include provisions to ensure that the levy is administered efficiently. It allows the Secretary of State to confer statutory functions on the counterparty, such as collecting levy payments and enforcing regulations. It is vital that the counterparty has the powers and functions it needs to operate efficiently and effectively.

Clause 9 will allow us to make regulations on who will calculate matters relating to the levy, and how—for example, how levy payments should be calculated and who is responsible for doing so. It ensures that calculations are made in an appropriate way by people who are qualified to do so. The regulations made under this clause will be subject to consultation and the affirmative procedure.

Mike Kane - Hansard - -

My hon. Friend is a doughty campaigner for Stansted airport, which is near his constituency. Stansted is part of Manchester Airports Group Ltd, or MAG, which I know is extraordinarily keen—along with other airports, AirportsUK, airlines and nearly all the other people who gave evidence—that we pass this legislation.

Coming back to the Bill, new clause 2, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam, would make it a requirement to carry out a review of the impact of levy regulations on sustainable fuels and the industry in the UK 12 months after they are introduced. The levy regulations will not have a significant impact in the 12 months after they are made. Contract payments will form the majority of levied costs. However, contracts need to be negotiated and signed, plants built, and SAF produced and sold before costs are incurred, which is very unlikely to happen in the first 12 months. Also, review clauses are commonly included in secondary legislation and we do not need separate powers in the Bill to include them in the levy regulations. The levy regulations will be subject to the affirmative procedure, which will allow Members of both Houses to scrutinise them. Given that, I ask the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam not to press the new clause when we come to it later.

I turn to new clause 6, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Wimbledon. I understand his concerns about the effectiveness of the SAF revenue certainty mechanism and how our policy aligns with the ECAA. I assure him that the UK’s overall SAF framework and requirements have many similarities to those of the EU, generally allowing the same certification schemes to be used, reducing administrative burden and minimising market access barriers. We actively monitor the SAF market including policies elsewhere in the world, just as the world is monitoring this Bill, to ensure that we provide the right level of support to the sector.

As I have said, I am proud that we will be the first country in the world to introduce a dedicated SAF revenue certainty mechanism. Alongside the implementation of the SAF mandate from 1 January 2025, we are leading the way in having clear and effective policies, grounded in legislation, that address the demand and supply of SAF. International Governments and stakeholders frequently point to the UK as an example to emulate, based on our forward-leaning and comprehensive SAF policy framework.

The UK plays a key role in international discourse on SAF and has cultivated strong bilateral relationships on SAF with countries worldwide. The UK promotes co-ordinated international action on aviation emissions through the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Given the active measures that we have in place, I ask the hon. Gentlemen not to press the new clause to a vote.

Question put and agreed to.

Clause 6 accordingly ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Clauses 7 to 9 ordered to stand part of the Bill.

Well done to the hon. Member for Mid Buckinghamshire; he pulled it out of the fire there with the amendments. He is right that we are putting SAF on the statute book. We should have put it on the statute book years ago, which is why it was in our manifesto and we are doing the right thing now. I will address the questions about £1.50 in a moment.

Amendment 4 tabled by the hon. Member would put a requirement on the counterparty to report on the effect of the introduction of the revenue certainty mechanism on air travel prices. Once operating, the revenue certainty mechanism is expected to make minimal changes to fares with an average ticket price, as we have said, decreasing or increasing by up to £1.50 on average per year. I remind him that that is less than a bus fare on Andy Burnham’s Bee Network in Greater Manchester where I live. I would offer to pay it, but it is quite cumulative over time and I do not have that type of resource—I am happy to fund the hon. Member for one year at £1.50 if he so wishes. That figure comes from a DFT analysis.

The costs of the scheme and the impact on ticket prices will be kept under continual review. The Government will also set the approach to the allocation of contracts, the number of contracts awarded and the scale of support they provide. Those controls will help to minimise any potential impacts on airfares. The costs of the scheme will also be reported in the DFT annual report and accounts in the usual way. I therefore ask the hon. Member to withdraw his amendment.

The hon. Member for Wimbledon asked whether the figure refers to the mandate or the revenue certainty mechanism. I assure him that it is just the revenue certainty mechanism.

Mike Kane - Hansard - -

I am extraordinarily proud that we have a Prime Minister and a Government who are rebuilding the UK’s reputation across the world once again, building trade deals with our closest partners across the planet, whether that be India, America or the recent agreement with the European Union. That is where Britain should be—leading and involved, not on the fringes as we have been for many years.

We are debating sustainable aviation fuel, but this is also about decarbonising the planes that will fly in our skies for generations to come. That US trade deal is zero tariff on aviation technology, which is a huge deal for this country, making it a world leader again in the future.

However, I am worried for the workers and families who have been affected by the trade deal. Ministers and officials, including the Business and Transport Secretaries, have met the companies consistently during this challenging time—those companies were struggling regardless of the time—to understand their concerns, discuss what action could be taken and to support them, because that is what good Governments do. The Department for Business and Trade is in discussions on requests for support from the UK bioethanol sector. As a responsible Government, there is a series of strict criteria and well-established due diligence processes that we must follow to consider such requests.

While I would like to see a thriving UK bioethanol sector, we would not expect a significant impact on the SAF mandate if there were to be a reduction in that sector’s production. That is because the UK bioethanol plants use crops that are not eligible for the SAF mandate. The SAF mandate, which is the framework for the supply of SAF in the UK, sets targets based on the availability of waste feedstocks rather than crop feedstocks. The SAF mandate is a global scheme and can use fuels from all around the world, providing an opportunity to draw upon a diverse pool of feedstocks.

However, we also want to encourage a UK industry. In January, the Chancellor announced £63 million of funding this year to help grow UK supply of SAF through the advanced fuels fund, which has been further extended in the recent Budget through to 2029-30. The SAF revenue certainty mechanism—the subject of the Bill—will also boost investment in UK SAF production.

Finally, under the SAF mandate, a formal review of the whole scheme has been built into the legislation, with the first review taking place in 2030. That will provide an opportunity to make an assessment on the availability of SAF supply. The above steps demonstrate how many of the recommendations set out in the hon. Member for Wimbledon’s new clause are already being undertaken by the Government. Given that, I ask him to withdraw it.

Mike Kane - Hansard - -

I do not have the answer in front of me, but I commit to providing the hon. Gentleman with an answer in due course. I thought the point he was making was about whether we are being open and transparent across all sectors in the UK in showing how we are decarbonising the aviation sector. [Interruption.] I do now have the answer. Who knew? The miracle of mobile telephony—it will save writing my signature to him with the electronic pen. The SAF mandate and statistics include details of feedstocks and the origin of the SAF. I hope that answers his question, but if he wants more information—we are all keen on this—I would ask him to please keep in touch.

New clause 5, entitled “Increasing greenhouse gas saving potential of sustainable aviation fuel”, was tabled by the hon. Member for Wimbledon. The SAF mandate is the UK’s key policy to decarbonise jet fuel. It does that by securing demand for SAF, by obligating the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix. The SAF mandate rewards SAF in proportion to the greenhouse gas savings its achieves. That will encourage SAF developers to improve continuously on their greenhouse gas savings. To ensure that the SAF mandate reflects the latest technological and commercial developments, there will be continuous monitoring of trends and the impacts of the mandate. Formal reviews will be conducted and published at least every five years, with a formal review in 2030. The formal reviews will already include certain elements of the new clause, namely the minimum greenhouse gas savings threshold and the minimum targets for supply of SAF. Following the review, there will be an opportunity to update the legislation as needed.",https://www.parallelparliament.co.uk/static/UK_Parliament/img/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-07-18 08:47:40.788235

Mr. Muir and Mr. Penner will be meeting with legislators, senior government policy advisors, and energy experts from both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.","Two well-known British Columbians will once again be present when the Pacific NorthWest Economic Region (PNWER) meets for its 2025 Annual Summit in Bellevue, Washington, from July 20 to 24.

Stewart Muir, president and CEO of Resource Works, and Barry Penner, chair of the Energy Futures Institute (EFI), are committed to the PNWER goal of working together, across industries and borders.

For more than 30 years, PNWER has brought together leaders from government, business, Indigenous groups, and academia from its ten jurisdictions. These include Alaska, Alberta, British Columbia, Idaho, Montana, Northwest Territories, Oregon, Saskatchewan, Washington, and Yukon. What brings them all together is the need to collaborate on the Pacific Northwest’s common economic and environmental challenges.j

The theme for this year, “Building a Resilient Future through Regional Collaboration, Innovation, and Trade,” aligns perfectly with the goals of both Muir and Penner.

Stewart Muir has long been a supporter of responsible resource development as a way for everyone to enjoy prosperity and quality of life. Muir has built a platform at Resource Works that focuses not only on economic outputs but also on public advocacy, reconciliation, and partnerships with Indigenous communities, aligning precisely with PNWER’s objectives.

Muir strongly supports Canada’s leadership in involving Indigenous communities in the natural resource sector.

“Canada is far ahead on Indigenous participation, not just consultation, but real equity and leadership,” says Muir. “The U.S. is catching up, but we’ve built frameworks here that others are watching. That said, we risk squandering it if we let delays and misguided activism derail Indigenous-supported projects.”

His perspective will complement sessions on Indigenous collaboration, infrastructure development, and sustainable trade practices, all central topics for the 2025 summit.

Additionally, Muir’s advocacy for practical energy policy reflects PNWER’s focus on new clean-energy technologies.

“B.C. is limiting energy choice at a time when we need more of it. The ban on nuclear and efforts to phase out natural gas ignore regional needs and technological progress,” says Muir. “On the U.S. West Coast, they’re at least leaving the door open to innovations like small modular reactors. The lesson? Don’t box yourself in when the stakes are high.”

Barry Penner, formerly the Attorney General and Minister of Environment of B.C., brings continuity and experience to PNWER. Penner previously led the organization as President of PNWER when he was the official representative of the B.C. government, attending his first PNWER meeting in 1996. He remains actively involved with PNWER to this day serving on their audit and finance committee, bringing a unique perspective to cross-border policy developments.

Penner’s current work at EFI focuses on smart policy choices, energy security, and infrastructure development.

“Energy policy in B.C. has been limited to a narrow range of options for the past few years due to the self-proclaimed ‘CleanBC policy roadmap,” notes Penner.

“This policy is explicitly premised on the erroneous notion that BC has an abundance of electricity, even as we have been relying on record amounts of imported power in recent years and have been forced to essentially ration electricity by choosing which industrial projects will be granted access to the grid,'” says Penner. “In contrast, the U.S. West Coast is currently discussing a wider range of options—nuclear, natural gas, renewables—while we’ve been closing doors to various options. We need domestic policy that reflects practical realities, not just aspirations.”

The 2025 agenda for PNWER includes discussions on hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, infrastructure, and technology, aligning well with EFI’s push for practical and diversified energy strategies. Mr. Muir and Mr. Penner will be meeting with legislators, senior government policy advisors, and energy experts from both sides of the Canada-U.S. border.

This year’s summit highlights the importance of continued collaboration. At a time when rhetoric often divides, their thoughtful, collaborative voices provide balanced and informed perspectives essential for effective cross-border policies.

“During a time of heightened trade tensions between our two great countries at the federal level, it is more important than ever to actively engage with opinion leaders directly to make sure Canada’s perspective is heard in the United States,” concluded both Mr. Muir and Mr. Penner.",https://resourceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_0983-scaled-e1752747709414.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 09:57:11.260067

By combining our renewable energy capabilities with Zaffra’s technological leadership, we are laying the groundwork for Spain’s first e-SAF facilities.","In a significant move set to bolster Europe's efforts to decarbonize air travel, Moeve (formerly Cepsa), a leading Spanish energy company, and Zaffra, a joint venture between Sasol and Topsoe specializing in e-SAF development, have announced the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).

The agreement outlines a joint assessment of the feasibility of developing cutting-edge e-SAF production facilities in Southern Spain. This region is particularly strategic for Moeve, as it is the site of one of Europe’s most ambitious green hydrogen projects, the Andalusian Green Hydrogen Valley. The synergy between Moeve's extensive renewable energy capabilities, particularly in green hydrogen production, and Zaffra’s advanced technology and asset development expertise, creates a powerful alliance poised to accelerate the commercialization and deployment of e-SAF.

Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel (e-SAF) is a highly scalable synthetic aviation fuel produced through an innovative process that utilizes renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide. Its production method offers a pathway to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of air travel, making it a crucial component in the aviation industry's transition towards climate neutrality.

This collaboration is directly aligned with the stringent ReFuelEU Aviation targets, which are integral to the European Union's broader ""Fit for 55"" package. Under these mandates, at least 6% of all aviation fuel supplied at EU airports must be Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030, with a specific sub-target of 1.2% mandated for synthetic fuels like e-SAF. The ""Fit for 55"" package aims to achieve a 55% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and ultimately reach climate neutrality across the EU by 2050.

Carlos Barrasa, EVP Commercial & Clean Energies at Moeve, expressed his enthusiasm for the partnership, stating, “Partnering with Zaffra marks a pivotal step in Moeve’s journey to accelerate the energy transition in aviation. By combining our renewable energy capabilities with Zaffra’s technological leadership, we are laying the groundwork for Spain’s first e-SAF facilities. This initiative not only supports the EU’s climate goals but also reinforces Moeve’s commitment to delivering clean, scalable solutions for the future of flight.”

Echoing this sentiment, Jan Toshka, Zaffra CEO, added, ""Zaffra is delighted to join forces with Moeve, aiming to develop Spain’s first e-SAF plants to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Our aligned vision and complementary strengths position us at the forefront of bringing e-SAF to market swiftly, sustainably and at scale.""",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-18 08:48:07.755563

“The Phantom 3500 is a transonic aircraft that fits squarely in the middle of the super mid business jet category.
The big win is the laminar flow performance on Otto’s proprietary wing design.
Laminar flow performance on the wing of the 500L was somewhere in the region of 30-40% coverage, the Phantom 3500 achieves 85-90% coverage.
Laminar flow has been well known for a long time; the first tests were conducted in the 1930s.","Spotting a UFO is not unheard of at 50,000ft, but how about if everything you set eyes on has something supernatural about it?

That is the plan for passengers flying on Otto Aviation’s latest aircraft project Phantom 3500, a windowless business jet that will provide those in cabin with “supernatural vision” using camera feeds and HD screens where the windows would be.

If Otto Aviation’s first experimental aircraft Celera 500L evoked steam-punk tinted memories of the films of renowned Japanese animators Studio Ghibli, then its latest project Phantom 3500 will fling you right back to present day.

The Texas-based company is targeting the super-midsize business jet market with its Phantom 3500 which has in-house built laminar flow technology at the heart of its design.

Laminar flow refers to the streamlined airflow over wings and other surfaces, where air molecules move in parallel layers with minimal mixing, greatly reducing drag and improving fuel efficiency versus turbulent airflow. Ever turned a tap on and the water appears to be completely still? It is the same principal.

Having closed its Series A earlier this year and with a Series B already kicked off, Otto has pencilled in a first test flight for mid-2027. The company hopes to certify with the FAA and enter service in late 2030.

According to Scott Drennan, president and COO, Otto Aviation, the two key performance improvements in the Phantom 3500 versus its predecessor are speed and range.

“The Phantom 3500 is a transonic aircraft that fits squarely in the middle of the super mid business jet category. We’re talking about cruise speeds of Mach 0.78 to 0.80. Our maximum mach operating speed [MMO] is about 0.80 and we’ll probably cruise around 0.78. So that’s a big change from the subsonic performance of the Celera.”

Otto is also targeting a 3,200nm range with five people on board, including NBAA reserves. Plus, a maximum range of 3,500nm.

“The other performance piece is the customer experience. It’s often seen as adjacent to performance, but in this space, it’s essential. The Phantom 3500 is a Part 23 aircraft, yet its unique fuselage geometry gives us the freedom to deliver cabin dimensions typically associated with Part 25 super-midsize jets—without sacrificing range or efficiency. The result is a cabin that not only matches the size of super-midsize jets but feels roomier.”

Phantom 3500 will feature a flat floor cabin which provides 6ft 5” of clearance at its max cross section and 7ft 2” across the bottom.

The big win is the laminar flow performance on Otto’s proprietary wing design. Laminar flow performance on the wing of the 500L was somewhere in the region of 30-40% coverage, the Phantom 3500 achieves 85-90% coverage.

“This is huge deal in itself, but at transonic speeds this becomes even greater,” says Drennan.

In terms of field performance, Otto is in the 3,200ft range for balanced field performance, which opens up more airports than the current roster of super mids can service.

“The improved balanced field performance, better climb and cruise performance is all down to our laminar flow wing design and its large size which provides increased lift.”

Learnings from Celera

Drennan believes the Celera programme was “super valuable” to the design and development of the Phantom 3500.

“It was actually the reason I joined Otto. The Celera had direct measurements of thrust fuel consumption and laminar flow transition lines that you could see and verify was real. To me, that’s been a huge bonus for bringing the right kind of people on to create a team that had the aerospace discipline to accomplish full blown design, build and production of this aircraft.”

The other piece is that it proved that laminar flow was pragmatic to have, says Drennan. Laminar flow has been well known for a long time; the first tests were conducted in the 1930s.

“But people have been asking themselves the question, how do we have it in a pragmatic design so that it’s designed in, built in and stays in? Something that has kind of become our mantra,” explains Drennan.

“The Celera showed you could actually build, design and keep laminar flow on an aircraft that has a good mission profile.The reason we moved out of the market segment the Celera 500L occupied was to get squarely in the sweet spot of the business jet market for our Phantom 3500.There was nothing wrong, per se, with the Celera and its mission.”

Entering the business jet market

Becoming a new business aircraft OEM is not easy. Embraer has done it effectively, but even a giant like Honda has had difficulties carving out any meaningful market share.

“When I first looked at Otto, the team and technical data was there. As I get further in my career, I want to ensure that both of those things go into a business case that really makes sense.”

Drennan says the total addressable market (TAM) in the super-midsize segment is about $24bn. “So no more of these market creation efforts as you see with eVTOL or eCTOL. There is a market there and you can attack it if you can do the technical things right.”

He says there’s also an opportunity to do well on the sustainability front. Super-midsize aircraft typically consume 300 gallons of fuel per hour. Phantom 3500 reduces that fuel consumption figure down to about 100–115 gallons per hour.

“We have been promoting this idea of the synthesis cycle, a virtuous cycle where less fuel means less fuel payload, which means smaller structures and smaller engines to produce the thrust.

“Suddenly you’re at half the gross weight of our competitors. Not only does the sustainability opportunity present itself, the economic opportunity does too. On top of having a market that you’re ready to attack, you can create much higher margins that you normally wouldn’t be able to do if you were a steady state OEM already in the business.”

In terms of price it is too early to give an exact figure, however Drennan says the Phantom 3500 will cost about 50% less to purchase and to operate than current midsize business aircraft.

Off the shelf eases regulatory burden

The mantra, as Drennan noted earlier, is laser-focused on achieving optimal laminar flow design, which also means the company is happy to use commercial off-the-shelf components for the rest of the aircraft where possible.

“Our design philosophy is one miracle at a time, and that is to achieve as much natural laminar flow as we can get. What I mean by that is if it’s not directly linked to the geometry of the OML and the Reynolds number that you fly at, everything else we can possibly acquire commercially off-the-shelf, we will do so.”

Otto has elected to use Williams’ FJ44-4 engines, a slightly modified fuel system from Secondo Mona, a landing gear and actuation system from Mecaer Aviation and avionics from Garmin.

“Concentrating on the laminar flow does a couple of things for us. It first and foremost allows us to go to the FAA and present a very secure certification path.”

In fact, when Otto held its familiarisation meeting with the FAA, the agency said there is nothing new and novel on the Phantom 3500. Drennan, a man who has forged a career in aerospace innovation, said that remark stung for about five minutes. But he soon remembered the Phantom’s innovation centres around a performance measure, not things that cause the FAA to worry about safety.

There is one exception to this rule, but it is not flight critical, says Drennan. The windows, or lack thereof.

“You’ve noticed that we have no windows on the passenger cabin. The FAA loves that from a structural safety standpoint. Inside we have supernatural vision instead, which are camera feeds and a digital window system. That’ll be a new system. But at most, it’ll be dial level A type software which means basic DO-178-160 certification.”

Otto benefits from weight savings of about 50-75lbs per window by taking them out. Also, if a fatigue crack is going to form, it’s going to form around the openings in the pressurised vessel. “So that helps us from a weight standpoint, doubly speaking, because we don’t have to worry about the endurance.”

The green discount

Aside from mantras and philosophies, Otto also has a mission — to reduce the energy required for flight. This leaves the company with a list of possible solutions to achieve this, including sustainable aviation fuel, hybrid-electric and hydrogen.

Otto has elected to focus first on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The Williams FJ44-4 engines it will use are already certified for SAF, as is the Secondo Mona fuel system. “Plus, we are using known coatings in our wet wing to make sure that fuel in combination with any small water content never creates biological agents. That’s one of the issues with SAF.”

“What I love about it most is we are offering a green discount. When you take our fuel burn and our operating costs into account, you can use some of those savings to put more expensive SAF on board because you believe in sustainability. But you’re still operating at a discount relative to competitors burning Jet-A or SAF.”

Target market

Otto would like to sell to big fleet operators such as NetJets, Flexjet and Vistajet. However, individuals or flight departments operating under Part 91 would also be a target.

Otto plans to go the classic OEM route and concentrate on selling its aircraft to customers. The company is hoping to “partner smartly” where it can on elements such maintenance, repair and overhaul and pilot training, says Drennan.

“We are not one of these startups that thinks we can do everything. We’re minimally vertically integrated.So to take on MRO across the globe or try to be an operator immediately, for us that’s not a good place to start. Let operators do what they do best and make sure we’re there for them as a world class OEM partner.”

Programme progress and Florida move

The company is in middle of a preliminary design phase (PDR) that is set to complete in November. The biggest milestone after the PDR and critical design phase will be a first flight of flight test vehicle one (FTV 1), slated for the second half of 2027. According to Drennan, FTV 1 will be a production and performance representative aircraft, but it will not be FAA conforming. The plan is conform through FTV 2 to its last prototype FTV 4.

As noted earlier, certification is planned for late 2030.

Moving to Florida

Recently announced at the Paris Air Show 2025, the Florida deal includes a 125,000sqft hangar at Cecil Airport, Jacksonville, Florida. Otto has also took down the rights to 200 acres of land that will initially be developed in a 90-acre section. There it will build its manufacturing and MRO facilities and customer delivery centre.

Site selection process was a two-and-a-half-year process, says Drennan. “The first conversation I had with Florida and at least a dozen other states started happening in late 2022, early 2023. They all have very strong aerospace infrastructure, talent, industry bases.”

Otto began life out in California where the Celera was developed, but due to challenges including high costs, the company decided to ship out to Texas.

“We set up shop in Dallas Fort Worth and got a hangar at Meacham International Airport. That’s where we operate out of today.We have about a third of the company there and the rest works remotely throughout the country.”

To decide on its new facility location Otto made a selection matrix including factors such as talent rating, the weather, proximity to an airport and liveability for staff. Out of that came two areas: Dallas Fort Worth and Jacksonville.

“Jacksonville came out on top because of things like the landmass they had available for us and the total financial package. Not to say Texas isn’t competitive, and we are still interested in speaking with them about further expansion. Plus, we will continue to operate out of Meacham until our five-year lease is up.”",https://www.corporatejetinvestor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-10.02.36.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 08:48:17.791102

According to Bloomberg, the US$200 million (S$257 million) plant, located in rural Soperton, Georgia, was initially slated to begin production in 2024.
However, more than a year later, it has yet to sell any of its green jet fuel on the open market.
Despite this, Mr. Samartzis confirmed that the Georgia plant will begin production using Brazilian ethanol, citing the limited availability of qualifying American alternatives.
“There just isn’t enough U.S. ethanol that meets the 50 per cent emissions reduction threshold right now,” he said.","After a series of delays, the world’s first commercial facility designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol is now expected to begin operations before the end of 2025, according to its developer, LanzaJet.

According to Bloomberg, the US$200 million (S$257 million) plant, located in rural Soperton, Georgia, was initially slated to begin production in 2024. However, due to equipment-related setbacks, the launch has been pushed to the end of September this year, LanzaJet chief executive Jimmy Samartzis confirmed in a recent interview.

“The modifications we’ve made to the equipment—which were unrelated to the core technology—should now enable us to move forward,” Mr. Samartzis said. “My hope is that by the end of the third quarter, we are fully operating.”

Backed by funding from the U.S. government, LanzaJet’s facility is being seen as a key test case for the emerging ethanol-to-jet fuel sector. In 2024, the company imported ethanol made from Brazilian sugarcane for trial production. However, more than a year later, it has yet to sell any of its green jet fuel on the open market.

Since President Joe Biden’s 2021 announcement calling for 11.3 billion litres of annual domestic SAF production by 2030, the U.S. market for sustainable aviation fuel has grown significantly—rising more than sevenfold to 146.4 million litres by 2024, according to official figures.

SAF can be derived from a wide range of raw materials, but not all feedstocks qualify for federal incentives. Under the new 45Z tax credit, only SAF made from North American sources and demonstrating at least a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions qualifies for support. This excludes Brazilian sugarcane ethanol—the very feedstock LanzaJet intends to use at startup.

Despite this, Mr. Samartzis confirmed that the Georgia plant will begin production using Brazilian ethanol, citing the limited availability of qualifying American alternatives.

“There just isn’t enough U.S. ethanol that meets the 50 per cent emissions reduction threshold right now,” he said. LanzaJet aims to transition to domestic feedstocks as soon as viable options become available. In the meantime, Mr. Samartzis is advocating for a more flexible emissions threshold of 30 per cent, which would broaden eligibility for the tax credit and provide a lifeline for early adopters in the SAF sector.

Once fully operational, the Georgia facility is expected to produce 37.8 million litres of SAF and renewable diesel annually, marking a critical step in the aviation industry’s transition to lower-carbon fuels.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-07-18 08:48:25.100854

“The EU has made progress in increasing the uptake of renewable fuels, and the sustainability of these fuels.
The EU must urgently create the conditions for biodiesel production, to expand in line with our climate goals.
For all types of biodiesel – FAME, HVO and HEFA combined – Germany remained the largest producer in 2024 with 24% of the EU-27 production, followed by the Netherlands (13%), Spain (11%), France (10%) and Italy (8%).
The top five leading producers collectively accounted for over 65% of the EU’s total biodiesel production, highlighting a strong concentration of output in Western and Southern Europe, the report said.","Published in July, the EBB’s 2024 Statistical Report gives an overview of biodiesel production, consumption, feedstock use and trade developments across the European Union (EU).

At a time when renewable fuel volumes were needed to scale up significantly to meet the EU’s 2030 climate targets, the EBB said the bloc’s production of biodiesel (FAME and HVO) was stagnating, with a hesitancy to invest in expansion, policy uncertainty and regulatory complexity playing key roles.

“Particularly, crop-based feedstocks face political scrutiny, constraining growth even though they remain the main volume contributors. There is also the aspect of fraud, and the urgent need to reform the verification system. Stronger verification will provide the credibility and predictability needed to drive long-term growth,” the EBB said.

In terms of market share, FAME continued to dominate (9.8M tonnes) and there had been moderate but consistent growth in HVO volumes, increasing from about 4.5M tonnes in 2019 to around 5.6M tonnes by 2024.

The use of hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was also taking off and was rapidly becoming the main pathway for decarbonisation of the aviation sector, although only produced in small volumes (0.26M tonnes) in the EU.

The report also reaffirmed the continued importance of crop-based biofuels in Europe’s renewable energy mix, with rapeseed oil remaining the dominant feedstock.

However, a key development highlighted in the report was the growing share of waste-based feedstocks (55%), which had now overtaken crop-based biodiesel (39%) in overall production.

“Use of feedstocks such as used cooking oil (24%) and palm oil mill effluent (POME) (13%) have grown steadily. The shift to waste-based [feedstocks] largely signifies to the diversification of the feedstock mix, likely resulting in enhanced greenhouse gas (GHG) savings across the sector,” the EBB said.

The report also showed that trade flows had also evolved with imports of FAME into the EU dropping by half between 2019 and 2024, from nearly 4M tonnes to just over 2M tonnes.

Although Asia remained the largest source of FAME imports, its contribution dropped from over 2M tonnes in 2019 to just above 1M tonnes by 2024.

Imports from China fell sharply in the second half of 2024 following the implementation of EU anti-dumping measures, initiated by EBB.

While the trade measures appeared to be effective, the report highlighted persistent challenges linked to circumvention practices and fraudulent claims of sustainability, which risked distorting the market and diluting the climate impact of renewable fuels.

“The EU has made progress in increasing the uptake of renewable fuels, and the sustainability of these fuels. However, we are moving in the wrong direction when it comes to producing these fuels in Europe. The EU must urgently create the conditions for biodiesel production, to expand in line with our climate goals. A stable regulatory framework and robust enforcement will be key to unlocking the sector’s full potential,” said EBB President Dickon Posnett.

For all types of biodiesel – FAME, HVO and HEFA combined – Germany remained the largest producer in 2024 with 24% of the EU-27 production, followed by the Netherlands (13%), Spain (11%), France (10%) and Italy (8%).

The top five leading producers collectively accounted for over 65% of the EU’s total biodiesel production, highlighting a strong concentration of output in Western and Southern Europe, the report said.

“Mandates and targets in EU policies continue to drive the uptake of sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, as governments are setting more ambitious climate targets in the transport sector,” the EBB said.

In 2024, Germany and France remained the leading biodiesel consumers, with Spain also taking up a significant share.

Taken together, the three countries consumed about half (48%) of market demand.

“The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

Funding and regulatory hurdles

LanzaJet received funding from the US government to develop the plant, which is being watched as a test case for the broader ethanol-to-jet fuel sector.

Although the company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol in 2023 to pilot production, it has not yet sold any of its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the open market.

Production will begin using Brazilian ethanol, despite the company being ineligible for the Inflation Reduction Act’s 45Z tax credit.

Under current rules, only SAF made from North American feedstocks qualifies, and the ethanol must reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 per cent. Most US corn-based ethanol does not meet this threshold.

“There is only a scant amount of US product that meets the required threshold,” Samartzis said. He added that LanzaJet plans to transition to American feedstocks and is advocating for a lower emissions-reduction requirement of 30 per cent.

In aviation, Syntholene Energy Corp is pioneering carbon-neutral synthetic kerosene, powered by a 20-megawatt geothermal agreement. Their first-of-its-kind demonstration facility aims to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) cost-effective at scale—producing fuel molecularly identical to traditional jet fuel and compatible with existing aircraft.

Meanwhile, FedEx secured 3 million gallons of SAF from Neste for use at LAX, covering 20% of its annual jet fuel needs there. Combined with fleet modernization and electrification efforts, the move brings FedEx closer to its 2040 carbon-neutral goal.

Wheels Up is also making SAF more accessible with an opt-in program for eco-conscious flyers, reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 80%.

Beyond the skies, nuclear-powered container ships, plastic-to-fuel incubators, and food waste fuel initiatives are redefining how we fuel the future.

,,2025-07-18 06:48:20+00:00,The Straits Times,World's first plant making sustainable jet fuel from ethanol to start operating in US after delay,Not Available,,,,,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/worlds-first-ethanol-to-sustainable-jet-fuel-plant-to-start-operating-in-us-after-delay,"GEORGIA – The world’s first factory designed to make green jet fuel from ethanol is expected to start operations before the end of 2025 after several delays, according to owner LanzaJet.
“My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” Mr Samartzis said.
Green jet fuel, or SAF, can be made from a range of raw materials.
Still, Mr Samartzis said production at the Soperton, Georgia, facility will start with Brazilian ethanol even if the company cannot benefit from the credit.
The company’s factory in Georgia will produce 37.8 million litres of SAF and renewable diesel a year when operations eventually start.","GEORGIA – The world’s first factory designed to make green jet fuel from ethanol is expected to start operations before the end of 2025 after several delays, according to owner LanzaJet.

The US$200 million (S$257 million) facility in rural Georgia, initially scheduled to start commercial production in 2024 , is now expected to begin operating by the end of September, LanzaJet chief executive Jimmy Samartzis said in an interview.

The latest delay was the result of equipment issues, he added.

LanzaJet, which received US government funds to build the facility, is being closely watched as a barometer for the success of the nascent ethanol-to-jet industry.

The company imported Brazilian sugar-cane ethanol in 2024 to pilot production, but more than a year later, it has not been able to sell its green jet fuel in the open market.

“My hope is that by the end of the third quarter we are fully operating,” Mr Samartzis said.

“The modifications we made to the equipment that was hindering us, unrelated to the technology itself, should satisfy what we need.”

A flurry of deals among airlines, fuel-makers and agriculture companies have been announced since 2021, when then President Joe Biden called for 11.3 billion litres of annual domestic sustainable aviation fuel production by the end of this decade.

The market has since soared more than sevenfold to 146. 4 million litres in 2024, according to US government data.

Green jet fuel, or SAF, can be made from a range of raw materials.

But most American corn-ethanol is not low-carbon enough to qualify for a tax credit aimed at boosting production of domestic renewable fuels, known as 45Z.

The new law also states that the tax credit applies only to producers of SAF made using ingredients from North America. That is freezing out the very sugar cane ethanol from Brazil that LanzaJet plans to use.

Still, Mr Samartzis said production at the Soperton, Georgia, facility will start with Brazilian ethanol even if the company cannot benefit from the credit.

That is because only a scant amount of US product meets the required threshold of lowering greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent.

LanzaJet said it plans to switch to American feedstocks as soon as possible, with Mr Samartzis now advocating for a threshold on emissions reduction of as low as 30 per cent.
