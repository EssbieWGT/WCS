That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels.” University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd is an expert on energy policy.
How can we say we have this sustainable aviation revolution?” She says that the technology exists for the transition to sustainable fuel sources.
Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernicus P2X project that announced advances in sustainable fuel production last week.
Dodd says that one way forward would be to encourage businesses and universities that require long-distance travel to function to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.","New research has shown how carbon-neutral aviation fuel can be made more efficiently. The development has been welcomed as attempts are being made to reduce the carbon emissions of the aviation sector.

But not all experts are as enthusiastic about the focus on so-called “eco-fuels” or “e-fuels” which are synthetic sustainable aviation fuels produced from fossil-free electricity and recycled carbon dioxide.

How to fly green

“There’s a collection of sectors such as aviation, long-distance maritime shipping, chemical industry, steel production. Making these sectors sustainable is not as easy as for other sectors, where you can just directly apply electrification,” chemical engineer Maartje Feenstra tells Cosmos. Feenstra is a senior research consultant at the University of Sydney’s Institute for Sustainable Futures in Australia.

“For instance, batteries are not viable technical solutions for airplanes,” she continues. “They don’t provide the right energy density. So that means that for aviation, we have a limited amount of technical possibilities for the energy transition. That means we have to rely on sustainable aviation fuels.”

University of Adelaide researcher Tracey Dodd is an expert on energy policy. She says in an interview with Cosmos that she believes the aviation industry is trying to lobby for the right policy environments for sustainable fuels.

“But I think even with the best projections, it’s only going to be 1% of fuel globally,” she says. “That’s a drop in the ocean. How can we say we have this sustainable aviation revolution?”

She says that the technology exists for the transition to sustainable fuel sources.

“There are a number of synthetic biofuels that can be used in existing aircraft, so they don’t need to change the fuels. … There’s also algae which has huge potential, but costs more because that feedstock can be used in other things, like pharmaceutical products. And there are new pathways that scientists are exploring, like hydrogen and carbon-neutral synthetic fuels,” she says.

“So every day we have a new innovation. The problem is scaling it up.”

What is sustainably produced aviation fuel?

The European Union (EU) roadmap for sustainable aviation fuels says these fuels will make up 2% of the supply in Europe by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050.

“The aviation sector in particular will rely on sustainably produced kerosene for the time being,” says Roland Dittmeyer from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany.

“Synthetic fuels that are produced by means of power-to-liquid processes with CO2 from the atmosphere or biogenic sources, water, and green electricity are particularly suitable,” Dittmeyer adds.

Dittmeyer is the spokesperson for the Kopernicus P2X project that announced advances in sustainable fuel production last week.

KIT, along with industrial partner Sunfire, say they have used water vapor and CO2 co-electrolysis technology to produce synthetic kerosene at a scale that could be used industrially.

“It’s nice to see this technology scaling up and getting sort of demonstration volumes,” says Feenstra, who is not involved in Kopernicus P2X.

Sunfire and KIT say this is a world first. Their “syngas” – a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide which are converted into long-chain hydrocarbons called “syncrude” – has a 220-kilowatt (kW) output.

A Boeing 777’s twin-jet engines have a total power output of about 130,000 kW.

“Co-electrolysis stands out in that it is a highly efficient process that electrochemically converts water vapor and CO2 directly into syngas in a single step,” says Hubertus Richter, senior engineer at Sunfire. “Up to 85% of the electrical energy used for this process can be recovered as chemical energy in the syngas.”

“In addition, we could demonstrate with this coupling that our co-electrolysis method features a very high plant availability and reliability and has the potential to produce syngas with the desired quality at any time,” Richter says. “This eliminates the traditionally separate hydrogen production process with downstream syngas production, significantly increasing the efficiency of the overall process for the production of synthetic fuels.”

Feenstra helps illustrate Kopernicus P2X’s output another way: “With a daily production of 300 L of syncrude, it would still take 796 days (over 2 years) to fill up a Boeing 747-400. For the next envisioned production of a tonne a day it would still take slightly over half a year to fill up a Boeing 747-400.”

So there’s some way to go yet.

A problem of soaring costs

“The challenge for the aviation industry is that the renewable fuels are more expensive than the normal fuel set. … The more sustainable aviation fuel we require, the more that price difference is going to hurt you,” Feenstra says. “If we want to make aviation sustainable, we’ll have to enable these fuels in one way or another.”

Dodd has been outspoken in her concerns about “flight shame” – the guilt caused by being a passenger on a CO2 emitting aircraft. While scientists have raised concerns about global tourism emissions, Dodd says we need to consider ways of tackling the issues collectively.

She says that people “shouldn’t necessarily have to stop doing what we love doing and what makes the world tick. We just need to be really innovative about how we can move forward. And in innovation, research shows us the only way you can move forward is if you understand the problem. And I think don’t talk about aviation enough.”

“It is a sector that’s really hard to abate, and everyone I know in that sector is really committed to it. I really want to support and encourage that work. And I know how hard it is, because I work in the renewable energy sector, that we do have to focus on decarbonising the electricity system in Australia.”

Feenstra says that conversations around sustainable aviation fuels in Australia tend to be based around biofuel alternatives.

Dodd says that one way forward would be to encourage businesses and universities that require long-distance travel to function to invest in sustainable aviation fuels.

“I think just even businesses being aware of and paying attention to how impacted their supply chain is by aviation and how for us to move forward, that perhaps they could be supporting and partnering the the airlines to scale up commercial availability of sustainable aviation field,” she says.

“You want to make sure that that we’re doing this in a way that is economically sensitive, and then it’s not going to price certain people out of the market to fly, or price certain people out of the market of things like flowers or coffee that we ship.”",https://cosmosmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-172190964.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 15:56:08.378733

Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations.
The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector.
About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.
Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services.","The global demand for electricity is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, outpacing prior forecasts and reshaping the energy landscape. Driving this surge are large corporations looking for reliable, low-cost energy solutions. Enter renewables, the cheapest source of bulk power in most regions of the world.

As a result, renewable power is playing a leading role in the “any and all” approach to increase generation capacity. Two decades from now, annual energy transition and grid investments must reach $7.8 trillion—a 3.7x increase from today’s annual investment—to achieve net zero (see Figure 1). For investors, we believe that renewables offer both immense growth potential and attractive risk-adjusted returns with embedded downside mitigation.

While some recent developments have caused some volatility in the renewable power industry—including shifting U.S. policy and the implications for a new artificial intelligence (AI) model from DeepSeek—they also have positive implications for energy and renewables demand that we believe markets have not priced in. Investors who focus on the lowest-cost, most mature renewable power and transition technologies—which are experiencing the greatest demand from corporate customers and are not reliant on government subsidies—are best positioned to benefit in the current environment, in our view.

Corporations are the single largest driving force behind this increasing demand for renewables. Large global technology companies have become the main buyers of renewable energy to power their data centers and operations. That, along with the electrification of a wide range of industries, has resulted in a 12-fold increase in corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) volumes since 2016.1 Today, corporate demand from these “hyperscalers” is exceeding, by far, the renewable projects that are available to supply it.

For example, Microsoft and Brookfield announced in May 2024 the signing of a global renewable energy framework agreement to contribute to Microsoft’s goal of having 100% of its electricity consumption, 100% of the time, matched by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030.2 The agreement provides a pathway for Brookfield to deliver over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity between 2026 and 2030 in the U.S. and Europe, and the scope could potentially expand to deliver additional renewable energy capacity within the U.S. and Europe, and beyond to other regions.

This corporate demand is mobilizing at dizzying speeds. In 2023, Amazon achieved its goal of matching 100% of the electricity it consumed across its operations with renewable energy, seven years ahead of its original 2030 goal; Meta is matching its electricity use with 100% renewable energy and has set a net-zero goal across its value chain by 2030; and Google aims to achieve net-zero targets across all of its operations and value chains by 2030 by reducing its emissions by 50% and investing in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions.3,4,5

These hyperscalers have committed to the most aggressive decarbonization targets across businesses in different sectors—and the fastest and easiest way to get there is through renewable power. But here’s the bottom line: Regardless of net-zero targets, companies will seek to secure as much renewable power as they can simply because it’s the cheapest.

The Race to Power Data Centers

AI is poised to transform every industry worldwide, fueling explosive growth in data center construction to compute and store the enormous volume of data created. Global data center power demand is expected to rise 15-fold by the end of this decade.

But access to power in high demand regions is increasingly the bottleneck hindering data center and AI development. Businesses are now ramping up their efforts to lock in supply to ensure they can achieve their growth targets—and they are looking to power all these new data centers with renewables.

Recently, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made headlines with the news that its advanced models reportedly achieved comparable results to leading U.S.-based AI labs while using less-expensive hardware, less computing power and less energy. The DeepSeek announcement surprised many in the industry, leading to initial market volatility in the renewable power sector. Yet, AI implementation was never expected to be linear, and AI deployment will continue to require significantly more computing power and energy for inference and model training than is currently available, in our view.

If DeepSeek and other models emerge to make AI cheaper, it will likely accelerate AI adoption for training and inference models, robotics and other promising technologies. In other words, cheaper AI is likely to spur more demand for AI—and subsequently more power. We view this as positive for continued long-term demand for data centers and new energy infrastructure.

Also, it’s important to remember that the expected increase in electricity demand is due to much more than just data centers—industry, buildings, transport and other sectors are all demanding more power (see Figure 3).

Clean Energy Solutions Are Stepping Up to the Plate

Solar has made incredible leaps and is on course to be the largest source of generating capacity for electricity by mid-2035. To put it in perspective, back in 2004, it took an entire year for solar sources to produce a gigawatt of power. Now it takes just half a day. But electricity grids always need to be balanced between supply and demand—and while sunshine and wind are plentiful and free, they’re not available 24/7.

Companies need access to stable, consistent baseload power. To complement wind and power, they require a diverse range of decarbonization solutions to mitigate the intermittency challenges from traditional renewable sources and to decarbonize hard-to-abate areas of their business. These decarbonization solutions are at various stages of scaling, ranging from well-established technologies like wind, solar and large-scale nuclear to rapidly maturing options such as batteries and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). And over the longer term, technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs), microreactors and hydrogen show a lot of promise.

But today, three technologies are making notable strides: nuclear, batteries and SAF.

Nuclear

Currently, nuclear is the only commercially viable provider of baseload carbon-free power. Over time, technological advances, shifting public sentiment, the need among governments for energy security and increasing corporate demand have resulted in a nuclear industry resurgence.

Indeed, several global technology players have recently announced plans to restart or enable the development of nuclear capacity. For example, Microsoft signed an agreement in 2024 to restart the Palisades reactor in Michigan, which had been decommissioned in 2022, to serve its data center footprint. And Meta announced that it is seeking up to 4 GW of new nuclear power to help meet its AI and sustainability objectives.6 Hyperscalers need reliable, low-cost, stable baseload solutions at scale—and they are increasingly looking to a small number of trusted partners to deliver what they need, where they need it and when they need it.

These tailwinds have resulted in life extensions for an increasing number of existing nuclear reactors as well as renewed interest from federal and local governments expanding nuclear power by building new plants. About 30 countries—ranging from sophisticated economies to developing nations—are considering, planning or starting nuclear power programs.

Looking ahead into the next decade, advances in SMRs and microreactors are opening up new possibilities for nuclear power applications—particularly for behind-the-meter and off-the-grid use by industrials, technology and mining companies, as well as remote communities. These innovative solutions are not only more flexible and scalable but also offer enhanced safety features. The development of long-duration energy storage systems further complements nuclear power, making it an even more attractive option for meeting future energy needs. While full-scale deployment is still several years out, we expect small-scale nuclear to form part of the long-term energy solution.

Batteries

Battery prices have dropped dramatically over the past few years, following a trajectory similar—but faster—than what we saw with solar. This was mainly due to improving technology, economies of scale, market dynamics and a fall in prices of critical battery metals like lithium, cobalt and nickel. For example, lithium carbonate prices fell from a high of approximately $70,000 per metric ton to well below $15,000 in 2024.7 Batteries now also require less time to plan and install than solar and wind systems (see Figure 4).

Renewables are expected to one day deliver enough capacity to meet electricity demand peaks and provide critical grid-stabilizing and ancillary services. Batteries will play a crucial role in achieving that, making energy production more efficient and creating value for renewable platforms. Today, growth in both solar and batteries is breaking records,9 a trend we expect to continue over the next decade.

Sustainable aviation fuel

SAF is considered one of the only viable near- and medium-term pathways to decarbonize the hard-to-abate long-haul air transport sector. It is produced by combining hydrogen generated from renewable electricity with captured carbon dioxide. It is considered a “drop-in” fuel, meaning the same jet engines can operate on either SAF or traditional jet fuel or a mixture of both. Crucially, it enables a significant reduction in carbon dioxide emissions relative to the same volume of conventional jet fuel.10

Similar to solar and wind, SAF is a proven technology seeing increasing demand from airlines and corporations seeking long-term take-or-pay contracts to secure supply to meet their net-zero targets and regulatory requirements. SAF benefits from significant policy tailwinds contributing to the supply demand. For example, under RefuelEU, a component of the European Union Green Deal, all planes refueling at European airports must use a blend containing a minimum percentage of SAF starting this year.

SAF is at the point where both the technology and the commercial uses are ready to go—and the tailwinds in this sector are strong. Fourteen airlines, controlling half of the market for jet fuel, have SAF targets,11 suggesting strong long-term demand for this technology. According to a study by the World Economic Forum and Kearney,12 global SAF demand is expected to reach 17 million tonnes per year by 2030, about 5% of total jet fuel consumption. By the end of 2024, production capacity was expected to be 4.4 million tonnes per year, with an additional 6.9 million tonnes per year expected from new refineries and facility expansions. However, to meet 2030 demand, an extra 5.8 million tonnes of production capacity is needed by 2026.

The Effects of Shifting U.S. Policy

The new U.S. administration has introduced some market uncertainty around renewables. However, we believe fundamentals for power remain exceptionally strong and we expect demand to continue to outpace supply, driving growth in required energy capacity—regardless of what happens in Washington.

Today, demand for clean power is driven by a “corporate pull” due to its position as the lowest-cost form of bulk power in most markets, which will continue to support new and existing projects. Certain industries, such as U.S. offshore wind, wind on federal land, and electric vehicles, will likely be affected by U.S. policy changes, but most technologies will not. In our experience, focusing on low-cost renewable power and decarbonization technologies and high-growth regions allows developers to mitigate impacts on their businesses from regulatory or subsidy changes.

The U.S. has indicated that it will take an “all of the above” approach to providing energy and solidifying its energy dominance. Given how integrated renewables are in the energy mix, they will continue to supply domestic energy as well as support exports of any potential surplus in the country’s oil production. With respect to fully repealing the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), we still feel it would be difficult because not all Republican lawmakers support such a drastic step. The IRA has generated significant investment in new clean energy projects while creating a meaningful number of jobs, directly benefiting Republican states.

While shifting U.S. policy does introduce some (manageable) risks into the renewable power sector, we believe that other positive developments have captured less attention in the markets. For example, the new administration is expected to drive significant growth in U.S. industries through its focus on manufacturing and data center development. This would likely generate incremental power needs on top of the already significant demand growth and supply-demand fundamentals that we are seeing today. The “any and all” approach in the U.S. will benefit renewables, as the lowest-cost source of power, as well as other forms of generation such as gas and nuclear.

The aviation industry is considered as one of the hard-to-abate sectors in the green transformation, and sustainable aviation fuels are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 % quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 % SAF in all EU airports from 2050. The BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels (RED EU definition), and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RED EU Definition, also called e-fuels). The technology brings proven process building blocks which have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium consisting of Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies nouvelles, Total Energies and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

The PRENFLO® gasification technology is part of thyssenkrupp’s Decarbon Technologies portfolio and will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, shared her thoughts:

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

Later, Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, continued:

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping up SAF production is the common goal, and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”

What is expected from CADO ?

CADO is a not-for-profit Canadian corporation established in Montreal. As a founding member, IATA will provide technical assistance and operational services to CADO on a regular basis. The company is prepared to:

Organisations operating in or supporting the SAF value chain and also organisations or groups affiliated with SAF stakeholders.

States or pseudo-state actors who have direct stakes in the SAF Registry’s operations and profits.

Interest groups indirectly benefiting from deployment in sustainable aviation fuel.

The system ensures that the environmental value of SAF is accurately recorded and allocated in the SAF value chain for airlines and corporate buyers so they can meet regulatory obligations and take advantage of voluntary decarbonisation schemes.

The SAF Registry is designed to mitigate the obstacle of limited availability of SAF by aggregating airlines, SAF suppliers and manufacturers together regardless of location. It also enables corporate customers to contribute toward funding in-sector emissions reductions by co-funding decarbonisation.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will transition to a cost-recovery model.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tall27vc-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 12:56:10.280642

This newly formed entity will oversee the management of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry, a critical tool designed to enhance the transparency and traceability of SAF transactions within the aviation sector.

CADO’s Role and Membership

CADO is officially incorporated as a not-for-profit organization based in Montreal, Canada. As the founding member, IATA will continue to play an integral role in CADO’s operations, providing essential technical support and contributing to its ongoing development. Membership in CADO is open to a variety of organizations, including those directly involved in the SAF value chain, governmental bodies with an interest in SAF operations, and other groups indirectly benefiting from the broader environmental impacts of SAF in the aviation industry.

The SAF Registry: Tracking Sustainability in Aviation

The SAF Registry, which is poised for launch, will serve as a global platform to record and track SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent manner. This system aims to address the complexities associated with SAF supply, which is currently limited and geographically restricted. By connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, the registry will facilitate greater access to sustainable fuel options, regardless of location, and will enable airlines to track the environmental benefits of SAF as they move through the value chain.

Supporting Regulatory Compliance and Voluntary Sustainability Goals

In addition to supporting regulatory compliance, the SAF Registry will also allow airlines and corporate customers to claim emissions reductions against voluntary sustainability commitments. This feature is particularly valuable as companies seek to co-finance the cost of decarbonization and contribute to a more sustainable aviation sector.

Free Participation Until 2027

To ensure accessibility, participation in the SAF Registry will be free of charge until April 2027. After this period, the registry will transition to a cost-recovery model, ensuring its long-term sustainability while continuing to provide a vital service to the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Conclusion: Empowering a Sustainable Aviation Future

By supporting the development of the SAF Registry and empowering a wide range of stakeholders, CADO plays a key role in the global push towards reducing aviation’s carbon footprint and advancing sustainable fuel solutions.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Speaking at the Airbus Summit 2025, Faury reflected on the evolving trajectory of the aviation industry, which he described as entering its “fourth transformation.” He outlined how the industry had evolved from simply achieving flight to becoming safe, then affordable, and now sustainable.

Making aviation sustainable

“We want to make it sustainable,” said Faury. “Because of its success—being a mode of transport that is safe, that is affordable—the impact on the global CO₂ emissions is 2–3%. It’s a sort of victim of its success.”

One of the critical elements in that transformation, according to Faury, is hydrogen. “It’s a very personal conviction,” he stated. “Hydrogen has a role to play. It is the energy of the future.”

Airbus launched its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft project more than five years ago, aiming to pave the way toward zero-emission aviation. While technological progress has been encouraging, Faury shared an update, “We’ve learned that we can develop and manufacture a hydrogen plane that works—a commercial aeroplane that works. [But] the competitiveness of such a plane would not be good enough to compete with others.”

Is hydrogen the solution?

Key barriers remain, including a lack of regulatory support and the absence of a green hydrogen production ecosystem. “We don’t have the development of decarbonised hydrogen at scale for when we need the plane to enter into service,” Faury added.

Still, Airbus isn’t backing down. “We continue to believe in hydrogen. We’re absolutely convinced that hydrogen is an energy for the future of aviation,” he emphasised. “But there’s just more work to be done—more work for purpose, more work for the others around us to bring that energy to something that is at scale, that is competitive, and that will lead to success.”

As the aviation industry charts a course toward decarbonisation, Airbus is urging governments, industry partners, and innovators to accelerate the development of hydrogen infrastructure and regulatory frameworks. The industry may not yet be ready to take on hydrogen-powered aviation—but Airbus is clearly determined to help it take flight.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/03/24/Guillaume-Faury-001-2048x1428-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 11:57:08.443356

IATA said that the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) would “turbo-charge the imminent launch” of the SAF Registry, which will track the emissions reductions from the use of what the airline industry calls “sustainable” aviation fuel (SAF).

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, added: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour.”

Walsh said that “ramping up” the production of alternative fuels was the “common goal” and the formation of CADO was “an important step in moving decarbonisation forward”.

One of the key roles of the registry will be to allow airlines and corporate customers to track the environmental benefits of using alternative fuels. This will enable them to claim emission reductions “against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes”, including Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, added that CADO would be a “separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders”.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Thomsen.

After launch, participation in the SAF Registry will initially be free until April 2027, after which IATA said it would be operated on a “cost recovery basis”.

Electricity drove surge in energy demand in 2024: IEA

London, 24 March (Argus) — Electricity demand drove a jump in overall global energy consumption growth in 2024, lifting it well above the average pace of increase in recent years, energy watchdog the IEA said today. Global energy demand rose by 2.2pc in 2024 — higher than the average annual demand increase of 1.3pc between 2013 and 2023 — according to the Paris-base agency's Global Energy Review . Global electricity consumption rose by 4.3pc, driven by record-high temperatures that led to increased cooling demand, growing industrial consumption, the electrification of transport and from data centres and artificial intelligence, the IEA said. Renewables and nuclear covered the majority of growth in electricity demand, at 80pc, while supply of gas-fired power generation ""also increased steadily"", it said. New renewable power capacity installations reached around 700GW in 2024 — a new high — while renewable power sources and nuclear together made up 40pc of total generation in 2024, it said. Global gas demand rose by 2.7pc in 2024, with an increase in ""fast growing Asian markets"", the IEA said. It noted growth of more than 7pc and 10pc in China and India, respectively. But ""growth in global oil demand slowed markedly in 2024"", the organisation said. Oil demand rose by 0.8pc — compared with 1.9pc in 2023 — and oil's share of total energy demand fell below 30pc last year ""for the first time ever"". A rise in electric vehicle (EV) purchases was a key contributor to the drop in oil demand for road transport, and this offset ""a significant proportion"" of the rise in oil consumption for aviation and petrochemicals, the IEA said. The rate of increase in coal demand slowed to 1.1pc in 2024, half the pace seen in 2023. ""Intense heatwaves"" in China and India ""contributed more than 90pc of the total annual increase in coal consumption globally"", for cooling needs, the IEA found. Renewables limit rise in emissions The IEA repeatedly noted the significant effect that extreme weather in 2024 had on energy systems and on demand patterns. Last year was the hottest ever recorded, beating the previous record set in 2023. ""Weather effects contributed about 15pc of the overall increase in global energy demand"", the IEA said. Global cooling degree days were 6pc higher in 2024 on the year, and 20pc higher than the 2000-20 average, it said. But the ""continued rapid adoption of clean energy technologies"" restricted the rise in energy-related CO2 emissions, which fell to 0.8pc in 2024 from 1.2pc in 2023, the IEA said. Energy-related CO2 emissions still hit a record high of 37.8bn t in 2024, but the rise in emissions was lower than global GDP growth, it said. ""The majority of emissions growth in 2024 came from emerging and developing economies other than China,"" the IEA said.

US strikes Houthis with eye on Iran — to what end?

Stoking regional tensions to get Tehran to the negotiating table appears unlikely to have Trump's desired outcome, write Nader Itayim and Bachar Halabi Dubai, 21 March (Argus) — As US president Donald Trump's administration intensifies its military campaign against Yemen's Houthis, it has issued yet another stark warning to Iran and its leadership — end support for the rebel group or face ""dire"" consequences. The ultimatum is in line with the ‘maximum pressure' approach Trump has adopted to force Iran back to the negotiating table. But success looks far from certain. This past week saw US forces carry out a series of air strikes against Houthi targets, soon after the rebel group said it would restart attacks on Israeli ships passing through the Red Sea and Arabian Sea, the Bab el-Mandeb strait and Gulf of Aden after Tel Aviv ignored a Houthi warning to resume the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Houthi threat since late 2023 has severely curtailed international shipping lanes in the Red Sea, impacting the global economy. The Trump administration says its campaign has set out to put an end to that. The US' ""economic and national security has been under attack by the Houthis for too long"", Washington says. And rising shipping rates, as a result, have probably increased global consumer goods inflation by 0.6-0.7pc, according to the White House. The diversion of oil and LNG flows has been stark (see charts). Trump's message to the Houthis is that their ""time is up"". Although Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, also carried out air strikes against the group, observers say the latest attacks are not just more of the same. ""Is this a different campaign? 100pc it is,"" says Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the US-based Basha Report security advisory. Some sites targeted in the Houthi-held capital Sana'a are ""a first"", he says, signalling that the Houthi leadership is now firmly in Washington's crosshairs for the first time since 2015, he says. The current campaign is also more proactive than the strikes that took place last year, says general Joseph Votel, a former commander of US Central Command, which is overseeing the attacks. ""Last year, our approach was more defensive, and focused on protecting ships passing through the area,"" he says. But this campaign is larger in scope, more geographically dispersed and more intense. Votel says the Trump campaign is more ""counter-terrorism focused"", which indicates a more targeted and sustained approach to degrade Houthi capabilities and put pressure on its network. Also, there is a subtle change in the strategic messaging, according to Votel. While the Biden administration mostly focused on preventing an expansion of the regional conflict, the Trump administration is making clear that its focus is on ""restoring freedom of commerce and navigation"". While slight, this change ""takes us from a defensive posture to an offensive one"", he says. Threats and opportunities Arguably, the biggest distinction between the two strategies is the degree to which Iran, the Houthis' main backer, appears to have featured in the administration's calculations before launching this latest campaign. ""The hundreds of attacks being made by [the] Houthis… all emanate from, and are created by, Iran,"" Trump wrote via his social media platform on day three of the strikes, by which point the Houthis had claimed two retaliatory attacks on the USS Harry S Truman aircraft carrier in the Red Sea. ""Every shot fired by the Houthis will be looked upon, from this point forward, as being a shot fired from the weapons and leadership of Iran, and Iran will be held responsible, and suffer the consequences, and those consequences will be dire!"" This kind of tough-talking rhetoric is in keeping with Trump's strategy of applying pressure on Iran's leadership to the point that it has no choice but to negotiate the future of its nuclear programme, and ideally, more than that. ""It's very clear the US wants to see sweeping concessions from Iran on the nuclear file, on the regional proxy file, and probably the missile and drone programme,"" says Gregory Brew, senior analyst at US consultancy Eurasia Group. ""Trump ultimately wants a deal. But he also wants to look tough and push the Iranians into a deal that aligns with his maximalist view."" After Iran's other regional proxies — Gaza-based Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah — saw their capabilities heavily degraded at the hands of Israel last year, the Houthis are one of the last remaining pieces in what Tehran calls its regional ‘Axis of Resistance'. In a letter sent to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, earlier this month, Trump says he encouraged Iran's ultimate decision maker to ""make a deal"" or face military action. Iran has since confirmed receipt of the letter, but is yet to formally respond, with foreign minister Abbas Araqchi saying this week that its contents are still being evaluated. ""Trump's letter is mostly a threat, but he also claims it has opportunities. We are evaluating it and paying attention to all points,"" he says. Iran's response ""will not take long"", Araqchi says. But the mood music coming out of Tehran over the past two weeks has not been positive. ""You've had Khamenei's tough rhetoric, laying out a tough line for everybody that [they] are not going to talk to the US,"" Brew says. But ""Araqchi and others have clarified that what they are really pushing back against is the sense of talking under pressure. They don't want to appear as if they are succumbing to Trump's pressure. They do want to talk, but from a position of relative strength"". Carrot and multiple sticks So long as Washington continues to turn the sanctions screw on Iran — just this week the Treasury for the first time imposed sanctions on a small Chinese refiner over its purchases of Iranian crude — prospects for de-escalation, or nuclear diplomacy, look slim. This raises the question — what next? For now, Trump's inferred threats of military action against Iran look premature, says Arman Mahmoudian, a research fellow at the Global and National Security Institute, especially in response to Houthi actions. Trump seems to be ""employing a Reagan-era ‘peace-through-strength' strategy… focused on demonstrating force, particularly by targeting the Axis of Resistance, which is currently in a fragile position"", Mahmoudian says. ""By launching the strikes, Trump is signalling he has both the capability and willingness to escalate if necessary. That said, I feel his ultimate goal is negotiations, not full-scale war."" Brew agrees, describing the Houthis as ""an easy target"". They ""have been redesignated a terrorist organisation [by the US] and are in an entrenched position. So bombing them gives this administration the chance to look tough, and appear to be applying pressure on Iran, without having to take action directly"". But if Washington expects such military action against the Houthis to trigger a change in posture or behaviour from the Iranians, they might be disappointed. ""The Iranians won't really care if the Houthis are getting bombed. [The group has shown] over the years that they can absorb these kinds of attacks,"" Brew says. ""But also, Iran doesn't have the same influence over, or relationship with, the Houthis as it does Hezbollah or the Shia militias in Iraq."" The commander-in-chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has suggested as much, insisting this week that the Houthis ""make their own strategic decisions"" and that Iran ""has no role"" in determining their policies or activities. With both sides seemingly keen to talk, a return to negotiations in the not-too-distant future cannot be ruled out. But the sudden escalation of tensions in the Mideast Gulf region, following the collapse of the ceasefire in Gaza, will almost certainly make things more difficult than they already were.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

About CADO

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations. CADO membership is open to:

Organizations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain

States or quasi-state organizations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry

Related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system

About the SAF Registry

IATA is developing the soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardized and transparent way. It ensures that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The SAF Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply —which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally —by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location. In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonization.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost recovery basis.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasted that the average return airfare in 2025 would drop by 1.8 per cent compared with 2024.
Mr Kadam Aggarwal, a partner at Asia-focused management consulting firm YCP Auctus who specialises in aviation and airports, forecasts that airfare will be cheaper in 2025 as a result of lower jet fuel prices.

To predict trends for the year ahead, travel companies often utilise vast amounts of data to identify pricing patterns and analyse traveller behaviour. Reports of late have listed more affordable airfare among their findings.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) forecasted that the average return airfare in 2025 would drop by 1.8 per cent compared with 2024.

In another report by flight-tracking company Hopper, it found that long-haul flights have become more affordable. Its data indicated that flights between the United States and Asia , for instance, cost 11 per cent less in the first half of 2025 than in the same period in 2024.

In February, travel booking platform Expedia released its 2025 Air Hacks Report for Singapore, stating that average economy class ticket prices dropped by 12 per cent, while premium travel was 8 per cent cheaper in 2024 than in 2023.

Its findings were based on a comparison of average round-trip ticket prices for January to October in 2024 and the same period in 2023 , sourced from Airlines Reporting Corporation’s (ARC) global airline sales database.

American company ARC manages the world’s most comprehensive airline ticketing dataset, with information from over 12 billion annual passenger flights operated by more than 480 airlines worldwide, according to Iata.

Referencing the Expedia report, Mr James Marshall, vice-president of global air partnerships at Expedia, says: “The data we have gives us a good indication of how trends are going, and usually, we can expect such trends to continue.”

Fuel prices drop, flight options rise

Experts say prices are largely dictated by supply and demand. When airlines struggle to fill seats, they lower fares to attract passengers. Conversely, strong demand allows them to charge higher prices.

However, multiple other factors – fuel cost, aircraft availability, geopolitical tensions and seasonality – also shape pricing.

Mr Kadam Aggarwal, a partner at Asia-focused management consulting firm YCP Auctus who specialises in aviation and airports, forecasts that airfare will be cheaper in 2025 as a result of lower jet fuel prices.

“It is expected that ticket prices this year should be similar to 2019’s prices , seeing as average jet fuel prices – the most critical parameter driving airfare – are becoming very similar to 2019’s levels ,” he adds.

Iata predicts jet fuel will average US$87 (S$116) a barrel in 2025 – US$12 less than in 2024.

One key area to watch, however, is the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is roughly three times the cost of conventional jet fuel, and is likely to affect ticket affordability in the future.

Still in the nascent stages of adoption, SAF is an alternative fuel produced from non-petroleum sources, such as waste oil and agricultural waste. It remains expensive due to limited production capacity and high feedstock costs.

Post-pandemic, travellers are venturing farther and airlines are responding by opening new routes and increasing flight frequencies to popular destinations.

Mr Marshall says: “People realise they have more choices now and can shop around for good deals.”

Mr Alan Lim, a director of management consultancy Alton Aviation in Singapore, agrees. “The business model for low-cost carriers (LCCs) is to run as many flights as possible and try to keep costs down, which can have an impact on overall airfare.”

More than 100 airlines operate out of Changi Airport, of which around a fifth are LCCs.

Mr Kadam says both the airport’s extensive network and the presence of multiple LCCs drive up competition among airlines in Singapore.

“Compared with Western markets, South-east Asia has a dominance of low-cost carriers simply because its markets are more price-sensitive. LCCs have thrived a lot more here,” he adds.

In other words, as flight options increase, one of the ways airlines will have to vie for travellers’ dollars is by keeping airfare competitive.

How travel patterns affect airfare

Business travel influences airfare patterns, especially when it comes to identifying the cheapest months and days to book flights for leisure travellers.

Expedia’s 2025 Air Hacks Report found that February is the most expensive month to travel for Singapore travellers – likely due to the Chinese New Year holidays.

In comparison, June and July are the cheapest months to fly premium and economy classes respectively.

Mr Marshall says corporate and leisure travel create distinct booking patterns, which are important levers of how airfare will be calculated.

He notes that corporate travellers typically book premium seats, while economy seats are booked by a mix of both leisure and business travellers.

He hypothesises that in June – Singapore’s school holiday season – leisure travel increases and more economy seats are snapped up by families or larger groups travelling together.

As such, demand for premium class seats in June may be relatively lower than in other months, and airfare for those classes of travel dips.

In July, as leisure travel slows and corporate travel picks back up after the June holidays, bookings for premium classes will likely increase with less demand in economy, resulting in lower airfare for economy seats.

While travel reports offer valuable insights, airfare largely remains unpredictable. Alton Aviation’s Mr Lim advises travellers to stay flexible.

“Stick to the basics, such as avoiding travel on peak days and timings by flying mid-week and being flexible with your choice of airline,” he says. “With so many carriers flying out of Singapore, shopping around can often make a difference.”",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/d1dafd144604541de042039f5fe1a287dc4dac22791736815d515c2925c37efb,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:07.218713

First, I helped introduce the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act with my colleague from Nebraska, Rep. Adrian Smith, to make E-15 permanently available year-round at gas stations in all fifty states. Homegrown fuels like E-15 lower gas prices for our families, support our farm producers, and reduce our dependence on foreign energy from countries like China, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. This simple amendment to federal law would not cost taxpayers a single penny but would deliver fuel savings for drivers to the tune of nearly $21 billion every year and generate more than $66 billion to our Gross Domestic Product annually. Reducing gas prices for Iowans means that our families can save at the pump and invest their money in other ways.

Second, I recently introduced the COST Act, which would direct the Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office and U.S. Secretary of Energy to compare the financial and environmental costs of replacing the entire federal gasoline-powered vehicle fleet with either electric vehicles or E-85 capable flex fuel cars and trucks. Back in 2021, President Biden pledged to replace the entire federal fleet with electric vehicles – a decree that would have been extremely costly and inefficient. That’s why we need to study the full cost of making the entire federal fleet electric because I am confident that vehicles powered by biofuel blends would be much more cost-effective and reliable.

Furthermore, I appreciate President Trump for ending the Biden administration’s radical electric-vehicle mandate on our families, farmers, and businesses. Electric vehicles are expensive, unreliable, and unworkable, especially in rural communities. The components needed to make EV batteries are also largely sourced from China, and we should not be bankrolling the Chinese Communist Party’s mission to undermine the United States and hurt our economy. By promoting flex fuel vehicles, we can support Iowa’s farmers and biofuel producers, prioritize homegrown U.S. fuels over foreign batteries, and strengthen our strategic position against China.

Third, I helped introduce the Farm to Fly Act with my colleague from Ohio, Rep. Max Miller, to advance the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and promote the role that Iowa agriculture plays in developing this future fuel. This legislation would add a definition of SAF to USDA programs, advance SAF research and development, and promote the use of the GREET model. It would also direct the Secretary of Agriculture to work collaboratively within USDA and with other federal agencies to find ways to promote the commercial adoption of SAF. By converting agricultural biomass into airplane fuel, Iowa farmers and producers will benefit from new markets, and we can use domestic energy – instead of foreign oil – to power our planes.

Finally, I helped lead the Renewable Fuel for Ocean-Going Vessels Act with my colleague from Iowa, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, to support the use of biodiesel and other biomass-based diesel for ships, boats, and other ocean-going vessels. Growing new markets for biofuels is crucial to increasing demand for Iowa agricultural goods and putting more money into the pockets of our producers. Just like we’re doing with jet fuel, we need to expand the use of renewable fuels across more transportation sectors, including boats and ships, to promote homegrown fuels and support our agricultural community.

As the only member of Congress serving on both the House Agriculture Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, I’ll continue to push for policies that open new markets for biofuels, lower energy costs for our families, and support our farmers, energy producers, and rural communities. Liquid fuels and homegrown energy will grow our economy, strengthen our energy security, and put American families and farmers first.

But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.
Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.
Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).
The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.","Britain has long punched above its weight in global aviation. The UK is home to cutting-edge technologies like Rolls-Royce engines and Airbus wings, and Heathrow is one of the world’s busiest airports – as proved last week when a power outage caused international travel upheaval. But speeding too far ahead of even the green-friendly European Union on so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could prompt carriers like easyJet EZJ, Wizz Air WIZZ and Ryanair RYAI to fly more elsewhere.

Decarbonising aviation, which accounts for around 2% of global carbon emissions, is a thornier problem than the electrification of cars. Getting an 80-tonne short-haul aircraft off the ground with existing battery technology is a fool’s errand. Using SAF, made from more sustainable feedstocks such as used cooking oil and often blended with conventional jet fuel, can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%.

Still, SAF accounted for just 0.3% of total jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). It’s also around three times as expensive as the conventional version, and while airlines want greater investment from energy majors to bring prices down, producers are reluctant to commit to higher output lest carriers spurn their pricey SAF. The EU and UK governments have aimed to tackle the demand side of the problem via so-called “mandates”: in 2025, 2% of jet fuel supplied at EU and UK airports must be SAF.

But it’s there that the flight paths begin to diverge. By 2030, the UK has a 10% SAF mandate, while the EU only has 6%. Moreover, the UK’s mandate increases linearly every year, whereas the EU has, on paper, a straightforward step up from 2% in 2029 to 6% in 2030.

UK-heavy carriers are therefore likely to be spending more on SAF than their European counterparts for the rest of the decade. That’s a competitive headwind in an industry that generally operates with tight profit margins – and in which fuel is usually the largest single expense. IATA estimated in December that global airlines would on average see net profit margins of just 3.6% in 2025.

Carriers could just lump part of the expense on to consumers – as with Deutsche Lufthansa’s LHA announcement of an “environmental cost surcharge” last year. But the industry is already battling stubbornly rising expenses elsewhere, from air traffic control fees to increased maintenance costs to emissions charges. In the UK, for all the fanfare around airport expansion, the government is also raising air passenger duty. There’s a limit to how much consumers will stomach.

As such, it’s quite possible carriers opt for a different solution. If flights that touch the UK incur a significantly higher cost, one simple workaround is to fly more within the EU. Unless Brussels wants to toughen up its own standards – or if the UK proves unsuccessful in its attempts to stimulate much more SAF production and help bring prices down – the likeliest outcome is fewer flights for holidaymaking Brits.",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:35.904486

In 2024, revenue will reach nearly 123,000 billion VND

BSR has just announced its audited financial report with positive results such as net revenue from sales and service provision reaching 122,986 billion VND; payment to the State budget reaching 13,554.5 billion VND and profit after tax reaching 316.7 billion VND.

Although the results are somewhat lower than in 2023, BSR's revenue in 2024 is still significantly higher than in the previous period, far exceeding the plan set by the board of directors.

This is an encouraging result in the context of strong fluctuations in crude oil prices, leading to narrowing profit margins in the oil refining industry. Many oil refineries in the world and in Vietnam have been forced to restructure or suspend operations.

Faced with that challenge, BSR has proactively and drastically implemented solutions to respond to the very complex market developments to minimize losses as well as seize opportunities when the market shows positive signs; continue to improve management capacity, market forecasting ability and proactively propose solutions to adapt flexibly.

Crude oil tanker arrives at the SPM.

Over the past year, Dung Quat Oil Refinery has always operated safely, stably and continuously at optimal capacity. BSR has also conquered new operational limits, at times the plant operated at 118% capacity and achieved an output of more than 6.6 million tons of various types of gasoline and oil.

BSR's closing equity for fiscal year 2024 reached VND55,491.5 billion. Regarding investment, during the year, BSR continued to disburse investment for the Dung Quat Oil Refinery Upgrade and Expansion Project, the Project to add crude oil tanks to Dung Quat Oil Refinery and other projects with a total value of VND1,352.5 billion.

In 2025, BSR set a target of output of 6.69 million tons; revenue of 114.5 trillion VND; budget contribution of about 12,992 billion VND; estimated after-tax profit of about 746 billion VND; investment value of about 1,740 billion VND.

This target has been adjusted higher, based on the results exceeding expectations achieved in 2024. However, given concerns about the development of crude oil prices in the world, the profit target is still calculated cautiously. Compared to the implementation level in 2024, BSR's leadership still expects the enterprise to regain profit growth momentum in 2025.

Build multiple scenarios and synchronized solutions

BSR always focuses on forecasting to be proactive in production and business, ensuring flexible response and adaptation to market fluctuations. Previously, BSR's professional department assessed that 2025 would continue to be a challenging year for the market.

Dated Brent crude oil prices reversed and fell sharply below $70/barrel on March 5, 2025, compared to an average price of more than $79/barrel in January 2025, after the US announced many new policies.

In addition, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to increase production again from April 2025 to 138,000 barrels/day. Oil prices are also under downward pressure from geopolitical and economic factors, including increased economic tensions due to US tariff policies, the Russia-Ukraine peace process promoted by the US, and signs of cooling down in the Middle East.

Dung Quat Refinery is always operated safely, stably, and continuously at optimal capacity. At times, the refinery's capacity has reached 118%.

At the latest meeting of the Steering Committee for responding to the decline in crude oil prices, BSR General Director Nguyen Viet Thang directed the activation of production and business operations from VUCA to BANI, clearly analyzed and proposed 3 sets of scenarios for BSR: Real scenario, management scenario and forecast scenario so that any fluctuations in oil prices will have specific response solutions.

In addition, Mr. Thang also emphasized that BSR needs to take advantage of the price difference between input materials and output products, which is still at a good level, to increase the capacity of Dung Quat Refinery, first of all, increasing the capacity of some workshops with room; continue to maintain good relationships with customers, apply flexible sales policies, compete with imported goods, and maintain Dung Quat Refinery inventory at a stable level.

At the same time, BSR synchronously deploys solutions on production operations, business - regulation and investment - finance. In which, production operations are guaranteed to be safe, stable, and maintain high capacity.

Regarding business and regulation, continue to purchase crude oil to optimize capacity, maintain low inventory, urge customers to receive goods on schedule, and consider suitable warehouse rental options. Promote production of new products such as plastic pellets and intermediate petroleum. Regarding investment and finance, optimize cash flow and investment activities, ensuring strong financial resources for the company.

Regarding management, continue to review and improve production processes to increase efficiency and cut unnecessary costs. Complete the quality management system according to international standards, ensuring high-quality products. Expand domestic and international cooperation, exchange experiences, acquire new technologies, and improve competitiveness.

In addition to 3 scenarios for coping with crude oil prices, BSR has also proposed a series of solutions to cope with fluctuations. These include focusing on adapting to crude oil and product prices to increase the operating capacity of the Dung Quat Refinery.

For scientific research and innovation, it is necessary to promote research and application of advanced technology to improve productivity, quality and production efficiency. Strengthen digital transformation, apply AI and information technology in management and operation. Research and invest in renewable energy, circular economy, towards sustainable development and environmental protection.

By flexibly applying appropriate solutions, combining solidarity and creativity, BSR is confident in overcoming challenges and proactively responding to oil price fluctuations. The company will continue to optimize production activities, control costs, improve operational efficiency and promote digital transformation. At the same time, it will take advantage of opportunities from the market and macroeconomic policies to ensure the completion of production and business targets in 2025, maintaining its core role in the Vietnamese petrochemical industry.",https://cdn.petrotimes.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2025/032025/24/16/croped/220250324162538.jpg?randTime=1742817400,N,,2025-03-24 07:56:45.653130

With society continuing to value environmental concerns, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from non-petroleum feedstocks is currently one of the only promising solutions to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of the aviation industry. Although there are other alternatives such as hydrogen-powered or electric aircrafts, they face major challenges regarding safety and weight. This project aims to design an SAF production process that produces aviation grade fuel with lower lifetime carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel.

The proposed plant is in Cattaraugus County, New York, and involves converting woody biomass waste from industries such as the pulp and paper industry into synthetic paraffinic kerosene via the Fischer-Tropsch process (FT-SPK). This conversion was accomplished with a design of three main steps; gasification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and refining. The gasification stage involves converting woody biomass pellets into syngas, followed by purification and adjustment in a water-gas shift reactor. The syngas is then transformed into heavy FT liquid which is refined further in a hydrocracker and distilled into various products including SAF. The proposed production plant offers both profitability and potential emission reduction, with a Net Present Value (NPV) of $27.05 million suggesting viability for future iterations.

As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem.
Looking forward, Airbus plans to continue to increase the use of SAF in its own operations, with a target of at least 30% SAF in its global fuel mix by 2030.","What do Toulouse, Hamburg, Mobile, Tianjin and Mirabel have in common? All of these Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites are now using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for their internal operations.

Thanks to this development, by the end of 2025, all Airbus customers, regardless of where they are taking delivery of their aircraft, can do so with SAF on board, free of charge. In 2024, 75% of the 766 aircraft deliveries used a SAF fuel blend, and this is expected to increase soon, once aircraft deliveries using SAF begin at Mirabel later this year.

SAF remains a key lever for the aviation industry’s decarbonisation goals. SAF is anticipated to provide the bulk of the emissions reductions needed by the aviation industry to reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimating that SAF could contribute around 65% of the reduction in emissions required.

In recent years, Airbus has been increasing the percentage of SAF used in its own operations to 16%, which includes business travel, delivery flights (where a plane is delivered to the home base of the purchasing airline following the transfer of title), and transportation of aircraft parts between different production sites.

To achieve this, Airbus has signed agreements with SAF providers like TotalEnergies, who have been providing SAF for aircraft deliveries in Toulouse since 2016. Thanks to a partnership signed in 2024, TotalEnergies supplies more than half the SAF to meet Airbus’ needs in Europe. We have also joined forces with airlines. Volotea, which operates a Hamburg-Toulouse flight for Airbus employees as part of our internal shuttle service, has been using a 34% SAF blend on this route since 2022. And following a successful pilot in 2023, since 2024 Air France-KLM and Airbus have had a “SAF fares agreement”, with Airbus purchasing SAF options for employee business travel connecting Paris with five locations: Hamburg, Madrid, Marseille, Munich and Toulouse.

Partnerships and pilots

Looking further afield, in 2024, Airbus launched a pilot scheme with easyJet, who operate flights on the Toulouse-Bristol route, a popular route for business travel due to the proximity to Airbus’ Toulouse and Filton sites. Running between November 2024 and January 2025, the scheme saw Airbus finance 106 tonnes of SAF, the equivalent amount of fuel necessary to run flights between Toulouse and Bristol on a 30% SAF blend during the period.

In January 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air and Moeve and Charleroi Airport completed a SAF operational trial. Airbus provided technical guidance and expertise during the trial, which saw Wizz Air operate more than 50 flights using a blend of SAF and traditional jet fuel. A survey was also completed during this period, which shone a light on passenger awareness of, and attitudes towards, low-carbon aviation including SAF.

Scaling the SAF ecosystem

Even though the quantity of SAF available has increased in recent years, demand remains suppressed due to the higher cost of SAF compared to kerosene – 2.8x according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency’s (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. The industry has to address this disparity and reduce the price gap with traditional fuel.

Although Airbus is not a SAF producer, there is a role it can play. As well as embedding the use of SAF in its own operations, Airbus invests and works with partners to scale the SAF ecosystem. In 2024, Airbus invested in SAFFA, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA focuses on SAF that is eligible for RefuelEU Aviation or CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) certification, although the investments can take place across different production pathways and regions. SAFFA’s first investment, in US-based Crysalis Biosciences, will help the company produce low-carbon intensity SAF and biochemicals.

In 2024, Airbus also made an investment in sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. Airbus’ investment supports LanzaJet in scaling its SAF production process which uses ethanol, known as the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet recently opened a new SAF plant in Soperton, Georgia, with the capacity to produce 9 million gallons of SAF each year.

“Since the launch of the National Energy Transition Roadmap (NETR), I have personally seen the surge of foreign interest into our OGSE , particularly from Japanese companies in our renewable energy (RE).

“Unfortunately, there is a mismatch in our supply as we do not have enough local players positioned to capture these opportunities,” said Economy Minister Datuk Seri Rafizi Ramli during the launch of the National OGSE Industry Blueprint 2021-2030 Mid-Term Review (MTR).

“By 2030, (the ministry) aims to have 10 OGSE companies that have successfully expanded into the RE space. We want to show how innovative projects like plastic to fuel, can be integrated and diversify revenue streams,” he pointed out.

He further mentioned that the ministry’s second vision is to sale the local OGSE players to becoming regional champions, as 80% of the OGSE companies are SMEs.

Participants in the ‘regional champions programme’ needs to be mid-tier size with over RM50 million in revenue in order to quality, and they must have a positive profit-before-tax (PBT) over five years with no legal issues.

“The idea is to play an identification and matchmaking role of opportunities. We support the deal making process by enabling access to financing and marketing.

“This can be in the form of mergers and acquisitions, management buyouts or joint ventures (JVs). The point is to increase commercial activity and boost export revenues to at least 50%,” he explained.

The COVID-19 pandemic – Razifi believes – exposed many of the financial vulnerabilities within the OGSE industry, with companies finding themselves trapped in overspecialized business models, burdened by excessive debt and diminishing profit margins.

Geopolitical shocks from wars have also triggered significant oil price fluctuations, creating an uncertain landscape that compromised the security of supply chains.

“If we look at pre-pandemic levels, the industry was able to attract approved investments amounting to RM3.3 billion in 2019. By 2022, investments dropped to RM363 million (-89%),” Razifi noted, saying that the MTR comes at a critical juncture in OGSE’s history.

Money for trees – Norway is providing NOK 70 mln ($7 mln) to strengthen Indigenous governance in the Colombian Amazon. The support aims to enhance the ability of Indigenous organisations to govern and protect their territories, which are vital for preserving biodiversity and mitigating climate change. The grant will be managed by the Amazon Conservation Team (ACT) in collaboration with Colombian Indigenous organisations. The funds will be channelled directly to Indigenous authorities for activities such as climate monitoring, territorial management, and community development. This initiative is part of Norway’s broader efforts to support Indigenous peoples as key stewards of tropical forests. It also aligns with Colombia’s commitments to reduce deforestation and strengthen Indigenous rights.

Auf Wiedersehen – Germany’s second chamber of parliament, the Bundesrat, has voted in favour of a spending package that loosens borrowing limits, allowing billions of euros of investments in defence, infrastructure, and climate change. The package includes €100 bln for climate action as part of a new €500 bln infrastructure fund, and a historic reform of the country’s debt brake, obtained by the Green Party in exchange for their support to pass the package in the outgoing Parliament. The amendment was backed in the Bundesrat with 53 out of 69 votes in favour, passing the 46-vote threshold, reports DW. Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia, and Rhineland-Palatinate abstained, with abstentions counted as opposition votes, reported the national news outlet. This means expenditures on defence, cybersecurity, intelligence, and civil protection exceeding 1% of German GDP can now be financed with new debt. (DW)

GDP growth – Goldman Sachs Research raised its forecast for the euro zone’s real GDP growth this year to 0.8%, up from 0.7%, driven by a new fiscal plan in Germany and higher defense spending on the continent. The fiscal plan from Europe’s largest economy includes a €500 bln off-budget infrastructure and climate protection fund and increased defense spending, estimated to boost economic activity across the region. Some €100 bln of the fund will be earmarked for climate action. Further out, the economists increased their 2026 forecast for the currency area by 0.2 percentage points to 1.3%, and boosted the 2027 numbers by 0.3 percentage points to 1.6%.

CCS – Porthos, the EU’s flagship CO2 transport infrastructure project in the port of Rotterdam, is progressing as planned, according to the European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency (CINEA). “CINEA visited the section of the onshore pipeline, which is already mostly completed,” the EU agency reported on Mar. 19. The Porthos project aims to develop an open access, 33 km long, onshore pipeline to transport CO2 across borders between the ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp, and Ghent. The captured CO2 will then be sent through a 20km offshore pipeline that will transport the compressed CO2 to depleted gas fields for storage in the Dutch section of the North Sea. “The designated site for the compressor station at Azieweg is also taking shape, with supporting infrastructure such as electrical buildings already in place, while the actual compressors will arrive later towards the end of the construction phase,” CINEA said. The offshore pipeline is still in its early stages, it added, but preparatory activities have already started. The project is expected to be fully operational and start operation “by 2026”, CINEA said.

England’s Western Forest – The UK government has announced plans to plant 20 mln trees and create 2,500 hectares of new woodland in the west of England as part of a ‘national forest’ drive. The new ‘Western Forest’ will consist of new and existing woodlands across Gloucestershire, Wiltshire, Somerset, the Cotswolds, and the Mendips as well as in urban areas such as Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. It will be the first of three new national forests pledged by the government to help meet a legally-binding target of achieving 16.5% woodland cover in England by 2050. England’s woodland cover currently stands at 10%. Across the UK, the aim is for 30,000 ha of woodland to be planted every year, with latest annual figures showing about 21,000 ha were planted, with the vast majority in Scotland and just 5,500 ha in England. The Western Forest, funded by £7.5 mln of public money, will particularly target urban areas like Bristol, Swindon, and Gloucester. (BBC)

CBAM for textiles? – An anti-fast-fashion bill is expected to be discussed by the French Senate in the week of May 19th, following its postponement at the start of the year, which prompted widespread discontent with environmental organisations. Article 6 of the bill states that within six months of the law’s promulgation, the government shall submit to Parliament a report examining the opportunity of extending the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to textile products manufactured outside the EU’s territory. Doing so would subject textiles imported into the EU to a carbon emission tariff equivalent to that applied to European makers of the same items. The bill would aim to penalise fast-fashion products on the basis of their environmental impact as well as their commercial practices. The bill is suggesting that penalties be placed on fast-fashion products, and that part of the monies collected will be used to finance collection and recycling in non-EU countries.

What farmers want – In a recent policy brief, the OptFor-EU research project examines challenges and opportunities through expert surveys and stakeholder workshops in alignment with the EU’s Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 and the European Green Deal. It lists financial constraints, information gaps, competing social priorities, fragmented governance, and differing perspectives based on gender and experience as the main threats in achieving forest-based carbon removal. However, the policy brief suggests there are opportunities to enhance forest resilience through improved data sharing, policy coordination, and innovative tools such as decision support systems and digital monitoring technologies. Moving forward, it recommends stakeholders to reinforce strategic priorities, adopt climate-smart forestry practices, and strengthen financial sustainability to support long-term climate resilience.

The Governor Sanjay Malhotra recently said that Indian banks and non-bank finance companies (NBFCs) have limited capacity and expertise which further limits their ability to assess and finance climate change mitigation projects well while increasing the risks associated with funding these projects. Having a pool or collection of financially viable and investment-ready projects can offer multiple benefits, said the governor, suggesting that experienced financial institutions that operate under RBI supervision can contribute to this pool of projects and exchange information, Mongabay reported.

Backwater credits – The Kochi Water Metro in the Indian state of Kerela, is eyeing a substantial additional revenue by monetising the carbon credits it earned through its contribution towards the reduction of GHG emissions, the New Indian Express reported. To facilitate this, the Kerala Water Metro (KWML) has floated a tender for the validation, registration, verification, issuance, and trading of carbon credits. Currently, the entity has deployed 18 ferries on five routes and the first phase of project proposes to connect 38 terminals on 15 identified routes spread across 78 km by operating a fleet of 78 fast, electrically-propelled hybrid ferries. The target is to achieve a reduction of 22,800 tonnes of CO2 emissions by the end of the first phase and the entity has already achieved nearly 20% of the target, KWML said. While the KMRL had entered into a pact with EKI Energy, India’s biggest developer, it has not yet materialised, the media outlet added.

Peak carbon – China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has added a batch of 27 regions to its pilot of cities and areas tasked with hitting peak carbon emissions early. The additions are primarily large industrial parks, including in Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as well as in provinces such as Jiangsu, Jilin, and Zhejiang. Regional DRCs are now asked to help draw up plans for reaching the goals.

Guide – China’s Guangdong province has issued a notice to provide more clarity for emitters to surrender their emissions permits under the local scheme by July 20, following an allocation plan published earlier this month. Companies are allowed to use offsets issued under the national CCER scheme and Guangdong’s regional voluntary programmes for compliance purposes, with an upper limit of 10%. Priority should be given to credits generated from projects within the Guangdong region, according to the notice.

Jet lagging – Japan’s oil refiners want concrete regulations that are needed to push airlines to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and support supply chain development, the head of the industry lobby said last week. Japan targets 1.7 mln kl of SAF by 2030 to replace 10% of jet fuel with cleaner alternatives by 2030. While refiners face mandates, no binding rules exist for airlines. Petroleum Association of Japan President Shunichi Kito said both suppliers and consumers need regulations, urging cost-sharing and government support for SAF supply chains.

New market – Japanese sustainability solution provider Asuene has formed a business partnership with two Taiwanese companies, Shin Chang Trading and InSynerger, for its expansion in the neighbouring country, it announced Friday. The three companies will support clients in their decarbonisation and ESG efforts as environmental regulations in Taiwan are expected to be strengthened in the coming years.

Domestic expansion – Project developer Bywill has secured a new partnership with Ogaki Kyoritsu Bank and Gifu prefecture’s Kobe town to promote the creation of domestically issued J-Credits. Bywill has formed more than 100 similar partnerships with financial institutions and local governments across Japan over the past two years, company data showed.

AMERICAS

Trump ‘hit list’ – The US DOE appears to be creating a “hit list” of clean energy projects awarded billions of dollars in government funding, according to sources who spoke to Politico. Journalists wrote Trump officials have requested the list by the end of the week, including projects under the IRA. Any programme or project that has spent less than 45% of its appropriated of awarded funding is required to be reviewed. Carbon Pulse reached out to the DOE for comment but did not receive a response.

Not on EDF’s watch – US environmental non-profit Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed a lawsuit on Friday challenging the US EPA’s extension of the reporting deadline for the federal Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. The EPA filed the extension on Thursday, shifting the deadline for reporting year 2024 from Mar. 31 to May 30. The measure did not take any public comment. EDF alleged that the delay was unlawful and filed a petition for review in the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The lawsuit is one of several that EDF has filed against the EPA under the Trump administration.

Big oil battle – A District of Columbia judge heard arguments on Thursday on whether Chevron and other major energy companies should be held financially responsible for climate change impacts. DC Superior Court Judge Yvonne Williams considered industry lawyers’ motions to dismiss the case, citing similar lawsuits dismissed in other state courts. Attorneys for oil companies argued that state courts are not the proper venue for such claims. If successful, the lawsuits could cost the fossil fuel industry hundreds of billions of dollars. Williams said she would issue a ruling in four to six weeks.

Rolling along – A proposed clean fuel standard is making its way through Hawaii legislature, according to bill filings published Thursday. SB 1120 was referred to the House Finance Committee after making its way through the House Energy and Environmental Protection Committee. The bill text currently proposes a 10% reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2035, and an at least 50% reduction by 2050, both relative to 2019 levels.

ECCC boasts climate gains – The Canadian federal government released its 2025 National Inventory Report Friday, showing that national greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 dropped by 8.5% from 2005 levels, equivalent to nearly 700 MtCO2. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) suggests that this data shows that Canada’s climate and pollution policies are working. “This year’s final National Inventory Report shows that even as Canada’s economy has become stronger, and more sustainable, the emissions intensity of our economic growth has decreased by 34%,” the agency said in a press release Friday. “Canada’s emissions are now the lowest they have been in 27 ears, excluding the pandemic years, and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels.”

Chemists weigh in – Canada’s Chemistry Industry Association (CIAC) has called for a review of industrial carbon pricing rules in light of ongoing trade and tariff tensions. While CIAC supports carbon pricing as a tool to drive emissions reductions and investment in low-carbon projects, it urged policymakers to reassess the system’s fit for energy-intensive, trade-exposed industries. The statement comes as Canada’s new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, has suspended the federal consumer carbon tax but pledged to retain and improve industrial carbon pricing.

Canadian energy poverty – A study examining energy spending by Canadian households, and the extent of energy poverty across the country, has found 11% of households were energy poor in 2021 — when in–home energy expenditures, such as electricity and natural gas, and gasoline were included. The study, by right-leaning think tank Fraser Institute, defined energy poverty as spending 10% or more on energy expenditures. Regional disparities in energy poverty appear pronounced. In 2021, Atlantic Canada had the highest incidence of energy poverty at 24.6% of households, while British Columbia had the lowest in the country, at 8.1%.

Passage on pause – The Panama Canal Authority has yet to provide guidance on its Low-Carbon Transit Slot initiative, set to launch on Apr. 1. Initially announced in Aug. 2024 as part of efforts to decarbonise shipping and achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050, the programme aims to encourage energy efficiency measures and low-carbon technologies. The delay, announced in Nov. 2024, followed an analysis of eligibility criteria, including energy efficiency indicators, fuel types, and regional infrastructure availability.

VOLUNTARY

New biochar system – French biochar developer NetZero has launched a new modular system for large-scale biochar production, which it said will halve land requirements and double output compared to its current technology. The company, a finalist in the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition, said the patented ‘Gen2’ system was designed to accelerate deployment, lower costs, and improve performance by reducing the need for concrete and steel by 90% and 80% respectively. The first units will be deployed this year in biochar projects using coffee and sugarcane residues in Brazil. NetZero aims to reach 1 mln tonnes of CO2 removal annually by 2030.

Mangrove permanence – Land uplift and related sea level changes could reshape blue carbon ecosystems, affecting their carbon storage potential and restoration strategies, according to a recent study published in ScienceDirect. The research highlights how a 2004 tsunami-driven uplift in Indian island North Andaman degraded large areas of mangroves and led to vegetation shifts that altered carbon dynamics across the region. As sea levels permanently dropped, terrestrial forests replaced mangroves in areas where tidal flooding ceased, while mangroves migrated seaward, colonising former reef beds now exposed by the retreating coastline. Blue carbon projects should factor in long-term geomorphological changes when assessing carbon stocks and ecosystem resilience, as land movement can create new carbon sinks but also disrupt existing ones, the research concluded.

AVIATION

Verification for Dummies – ICAO has provided guidance on verification of CORSIA-eligible fuel claims, providing VVBs bodies with a structured framework for assessing aeroplane operators’ emissions reduction claims related to the use of CORSIA eligible fuels (CEFs). Developed by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP), the guidance supports the implementation of Annex 16, Volume IV, and ensures consistency and integrity in emissions reporting under the international aviation offsetting programme. Verification follows a six-step approach: confirming sustainability certification through Proofs of Sustainability (PoS) or Compliance (PoC); tracing documentation back to the last certified entity in the fuel supply chain; validating the operator’s monitoring and reporting systems; checking the Emissions Report and supplementary CEF template for accuracy; ensuring no double claiming of emissions reductions; and reporting any post-verification findings to the State. Claims lacking a verifiable PoS/PoC or traceability to certified entities must be excluded. A key focus is on preventing double claiming of emissions reductions, especially for Scope 1 emissions. Operators must declare participation in other GHG reduction schemes and confirm that no claims have been duplicated. Verification bodies must assess both documentation and internal processes to ensure compliance. Risks associated with non-certified fuel traders, fuel resale, or overlapping claims across schemes must be thoroughly evaluated. The guidance also acknowledges challenges such as documentation time lags and evolving reporting systems. It outlines a variety of supporting documents – mandatory and optional – that may be used to substantiate claims.

AND FINALLY…

Melting away – Glaciers across many regions in the world may not survive this century if current melting trends continue, posing a threat to the millions of people living downstream, UN climate experts warned on Thursday. Ahead of the the first World Day for Glaciers, experts said there have been irreversible changes within the past few years, with the period over 2022-24 experiencing the largest-ever three-year loss. For instance, in central Europe, almost 40% of the remaining ice has melted, they said. “If this continues at the current rate, glaciers will not survive this century in the Alps,” Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS) at the University of Zurich, said in a statement.",https://carbon-pulse.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/favicon.png,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:38.674728

Le croisement entre le développement des technologies des piles à combustible et la volonté mondiale de rendre le secteur de l’aviation plus durable crée un espace sur le marché pour les avions à hydrogène, qui constituent une approche pour rendre les voyages aériens plus durables. Les rapports d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts » et « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », se concentrent sur les technologies émergentes liées à la décarbonisation de l’industrie aéronautique.

Les projets d’Airbus en matière d’hydrogène

Airbus, l’un des principaux constructeurs d’avions opérant en Europe, s’était fixé pour objectif de commercialiser un avion fonctionnant à l’hydrogène d’ici le milieu des années 2030, ouvrant ainsi la voie à un transport aérien plus durable. Cependant, des informations récentes ont indiqué que cet objectif serait retardé en raison d’une sous-estimation du temps nécessaire à l’installation des infrastructures et des technologies requises pour lancer l’aviation à hydrogène.

La nouvelle date de lancement prévue pour le projet se situe désormais dans les années 2040, ce qui met en évidence les défis liés à cette nouvelle technologie, en particulier dans un secteur aussi vaste que l’industrie aéronautique. Bien que ce projet d’avion ne soit qu’une goutte d’eau dans l’océan des objectifs de décarbonisation, son lancement ouvrirait la voie à d’autres entreprises.

IDTechEx propose différentes approches pour une aviation durable

Le dernier rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts », couvre le potentiel de diverses approches de la durabilité dans l’aviation, qui comprend les piles à hydrogène ainsi que la combustion d’hydrogène, les avions électriques à batterie, etc.

Le carburant d’aviation durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, SAF) est actuellement la principale approche de la durabilité dans le secteur, en attendant que les piles à hydrogène puissent être adoptées. Le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035: Technologies, Players, Forecasts », considère en détail les SAF comme la prochaine grande tendance dans la décarbonisation de ce secteur, avec des exigences réglementaires dans de nombreuses régions pour la mise en œuvre de certains pourcentages de SAF parallèlement au kérosène traditionnel. Issu d’huiles de cuisson usagées et de graisses végétales plutôt que de sources pétrolières conventionnelles, le SAF, dont les processus de production réduisent les émissions de carbone, constitue une approche plus respectueuse de l’environnement pour alimenter les avions.

Alors que les avions à hydrogène sont de plus en plus encouragés, le SAF semble être la meilleure solution d’ores et déjà disponible. Virgin a été la première à faire voler un avion alimenté à 100 % en SAF de Londres Heathrow à New York JFK, soulignant ainsi les capacités du SAF à fonctionner aussi bien que le carburant ordinaire, malgré les coûts de production, comme le détaille le rapport d’IDTechEx, « Sustainable Biofuels & E-Fuels Market 2025-2035 : Technologies, Players, Forecasts ».

Coûts environnementaux des nouvelles technologies

Les coûts environnementaux de la production d’hydrogène font l’objet d’un débat qui, à court terme, peut sembler s’opposer aux incitations à en tirer profit à long terme. Comme pour toute nouvelle technologie nécessitant des infrastructures et des investissements pour décoller, il existe un compromis entre les coûts initiaux et les avantages de la mise en œuvre à long terme, qui peut également être considéré comme prévalant avec les SAF.

The Cessna 172 is the most produced aircraft ever made, and the company also produces the popular Cessna 182 Skylane, 206 Stationair, and the 208 Caravan. These planes are propellor aircraft used for personal transport and for utility work in the case of the 206 as well as the turboprop-driven 208.

Then, there's the latest Cessna 408 SkyCourier , the largest propellor-driven Cessna has ever made. With two turboprop engines and a passenger capacity of up to 19, this is a plane so big that Textron Aviation, Cessna's parent company, had to redesign its manufacturing plant to assemble the plane.

But also in the Cessna lineup are the Citation business jets. Introduced in 1972, the Citation series is one of the most successful business jet families in history. While most of these planes are small, light jets or very-light jets designed for short flights with a handful of passengers, the Cessna Citation Longitude is not.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the biggest Cessna jet ever made, more than 50% longer than the Citation II. This and the SkyCourier are the biggest planes that Cessna has ever made from its two main types of aircraft. Today, we're going to explore Cessna's biggest propellor plane and its biggest jet aircraft.

The Cessna 408 SkyCourier

Cessna has produced the single-engine 208 Caravan since the 1980s. With over 3,000 units produced, the type has proved popular with militaries, air freight, and commuters. The Caravan has undergone numerous modifications to its basic design, and multiple variants have been developed. However, in 2017, Cessna unveiled a new entry into this market space.

At the request of FedEx Express, Cessna developed a clean-sheet design that would be both larger and more capable than the Caravan. Dubbed the Cessna 408 SkyCourier , nearly 50 have been constructed since the aircraft entered service in 2022, and Textron announced at the plane's launch that FedEx Express had ordered up to 100 examples to be used for its Feeder brand.

The Cessna 408 is nearly 20 ft (6 m) longer than the 208 Caravan, with a 20 ft (6 m) wider wingspan. Its Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) is more than twice that of the Caravan, and its two Pratt & Whitney Canada turboprops make nearly double the horsepower of the 208's single motor.

Flying with two engines as opposed to one makes the 408 far more capable and faster than the Caravan, all the while being operated by just a single pilot. Just like all Cessna propellor planes, the 408 SkyCourier features a high-wing design, and the plane is equipped with rugged fixed landing gear designed to tackle rough fields.

The 408 comes with many features to improve time efficiency, such as single-point refueling, which reduces turnaround time. The plane also comes in three versions, to capture different market segments.

A freighter version.

A passenger version for commuter airlines.

A ""combi"" variant that has nine seats in the front of the cabin and a cargo hold taking up the rear half of the aircraft.

Inside the 408

This Cessna plane features a Garmin G1000 NXI glass cockpit as standard, while 19 passengers can fit inside the passenger version. This plane is not pressurized, so while it can be flown up to 25,000 ft, most operators will typically cruise much lower.

Inside, the seats are removable in a process that can typically take less than an hour, permitting operators to use the plane for both passenger and cargo flights. The cabin is arranged in a three-abreast two-one layout and features a generous 32"" seat pitch. There's also enough headroom for most people to stand up straight, and the plane even features overhead bins, unlike the 208 Caravan.

The freighter version, meanwhile, features a huge cargo door with space inside the cabin for three LD3 containers. Cessna also offers a wide range of options to suit the needs of various customers, such as cargo nets and floor rollers.

The Cessna Citation Longitude

Cessna is best known for its iconic 172 Skyhawk, a plane with a smaller wingspan than the original Wright Flyer. But the company also produces the highly successful Citation business jet family. With thousands being delivered across 53 years and a dozen main variants, the Citation has brought Cessna great success over the years.

The Cessna Citation Longitude is the largest business jet ever made by the legendary company. Developed from the Citation Latitude, this all-aluminum plane was first announced in 2012 and entered service seven years later in 2019.

At 73 ft 2 in (22.3 m) long and weighing over 23,389 lb (10,609) empty, the Longitude is the longest, heaviest, and most capable aircraft that Cessna has ever made. Its two Honeywell turbofans can produce well over 7,000 lbs of thrust each, and the aircraft can fly a maximum distance of 3,500 NM (6,482 KM), meaning that it can operate short transatlantic flights, such as between London-City and Teterboro.

This jet actually has a narrower wingspan than the Cessna 408 SkyCourier, and its tail stands slightly below the 408. However, it has a wing area of 537 sq ft (49.9 meters squared), meaning that its wing is overall much bigger than the one on the SkyCourier. It was also given a low-wing design, which is typical of a jet aircraft.

Inside the Longitude

The Cessna 408 is a plane made for work. It was designed to carry paying passengers and containers for decades without compromising reliability, The Longitude is a different type of aircraft, designed with comfort in mind to appeal to wealthy buyers.

The Longitude can seat between eight and 12 people, which is less than the capacity of the 408. However, the SkyCourier is a utility plane first and foremost. The Cessna 408 in its passenger form essentially operates like a mini airliner, with rows of economy-style seats and overhead bins. It will carry passengers, cargo, or both across short distances, and it was designed to be both cheap to run and reliable.

The Longitude still features a row of seats, this time in a one-one layout, but these seats are designed with comfort and style in mind. The legroom is limitless, and the entire inch of the cabin can be customized to fit any customer's desires, such as changing the cabin sidewalls or adding a sofa.

Despite being powered by two noisy jet engines, passengers wouldn't be able to tell the difference, as the Longitude features one of the quietest cabins in its class. Onboard, passengers are also in for a more physically relaxing experience, as the Citation Longitude features an ambient cabin altitude of around 6,000 ft, similar to an Airbus A350 or Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

Flight crews meanwhile, are treated to a Garmin G5000 avionics system, with five main screens and an optional Heads-Up Display (HUD).

Cessna: A never-ending story of success

These two planes are another example of the success that Cessna has enjoyed. The company has not only followed up on making a larger complement to the utility-focused Cessna 208, but they also continue to iterate on the Citation business jet, with the Longitude being the biggest version yet.

The company originally started out making small, piston-powered aircraft for general aviation, but then they expanded into the business jet market, and then they entered another new market with the 208 Caravan. Now, they continue to find tremendous success in both categories.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/artboard-16_9-5-3.jpg,N,,2025-03-24 07:57:47.719392

The two-day event begins on March 24, 2025, in Toulouse, France, with speakers including Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury set to take to the stage.

On day one Faury will chat with Bertrand Piccard, Chairman of the Solar Impulse Foundation, about the “current state of global climate objectives” and explore the “balance between ambition and pragmatism in developing decarbonisation technologies”.

Airbus says the event is designed to bring together experts from around the globe to shape a “constructive dialogue about where aviation is today and where it is heading in the decades to come”.

“Airbus is committed to shaping the future of aerospace through innovative design, cutting-edge technologies and novel engineering. But we cannot do it alone. Cooperation and collaboration are the guiding lights that will keep the industry on track to achieve its decarbonisation goals,” said a spokesperson for Airbus.

On the agenda will be an update on the status of Airbus’ hydrogen-powered ZEROe aircraft project and news on the “promising technologies” the company are developing for the next-generation single aisle, the eventual successor to the A320 family aircraft.

Subjects under discussion include “Harnessing the power of responsible AI”, “SAF in focus: what’s next for aviation fuel” and “Identifying, investigating and mitigating non-CO2 emissions”.

Airbus will also showcase some of its recent innovations for attendees to experience firsthand, including the Racer helicopter demonstrator.

The distinctive high-speed Racer “aims to leverage increased speed to deliver significant added value for citizens and operators”.

This is the view of Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific and Middle East director general Stefano Baronci, who stressed the need for vital stakeholder engagements in prioritising sustainable growth.
He cited examples like the use of hybrid or electrical vehicles on the ground, renewable energy and solar panels for the region.
That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.
“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.","SWITCHING to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 will be a costly marathon for airports.

But it is possible.

This is the view of Airports Council International (ACI) Asia-Pacific and Middle East director general Stefano Baronci, who stressed the need for vital stakeholder engagements in prioritising sustainable growth.

The airport sector, he said, is the first to commit to net zero emission, a target shared by other aviation stakeholders and formalised at the last ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) assembly.

“From an airport perspective, we have to make sure the service on the ground can reach that level of due diligence from an environmental perspective; and you do that through the electrification of the service,” Mr Baronci told this newspaper in an interview in Suva yesterday.

He cited examples like the use of hybrid or electrical vehicles on the ground, renewable energy and solar panels for the region.

“And then of course, you have to create the right dialogue with the airlines to planning long term on how to reduce emissions of the aircraft.

“This is certainly a much more difficult challenge to win because it requires tools like SAF.

“The supply is still not there to meet the demand. The cost is still too high, and again, this is where partnership with supplier industries and authorities will be essential.”

Mr Baronci, who is in Fiji attending the 3rd Regional Aviation Ministers Meeting at the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Suva, said aviation stakeholders and authorities have been reaching a consensus, an area where industries, suppliers and authorities have to work together and prioritise their efforts.

That consensus has translated to the commitment during the last COP conference to reach 5 per cent of SAF by 2030.

“This is certainly a very important achievement,” he said. “As airports, we can do only to a certain extent but of course we have to create again the right environment, we have to prepare to install the right infrastructure when SAF will be ready.

“In my view it’s possible because it is the best way to reduce emissions. I don’t have the crystal ball for it but I think it requires the engagement of all.

“You need to work by adjusting your processes, by adjusting solutions, and this is what we have to commit to, all of us.

“At the moment it is very costly because supply is not enough, the price that is set for it is still very high.

The aspiration is that once the supply will be there, the cost will be lower and eventually will be economically sustainable.”

For the Pacific aviation sector to achieve this, he said coordination from the top was essential by having a policy framework, and to ensure to be able to monitor the price of SAF.

“We cannot play on our own, we cannot play in silos and this in my view is the most difficult part to manage but there is the commitment of the big airlines, the big airports of States to do so.”",https://www.fijitimes.com.fj/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/DSC_4603-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-23 22:56:15.669805

A closer look at the Dassault Falcon 7X So then, what can be said about Sir Richard Branson's private jet of choice?","Back in October 2024, an article was published on the private jet collection owned by Sir Richard Branson, owner of the Virgin mega-brand. It was explored in the article that the billionaire owned two Dassault Falcon private jets; the 50EX, the first of which flew in 1996, and the 900EX, which entered service in the same year. As a follow-up, and slight correction to that article, this piece will confirm which private jets Branson currently owns, and takes a deeper look at his history of private jet ownership.

Sir Richard Branson's history with Dassault

It turns out that Branson does not, in fact, currently own multiple Dassault Falcon private jets. Rather, the jet he currently owns, and the latest in his string of Falcons, is a 7X with the tail number M-GGAL, pictured above. Branson has owned a total of three Dassault Falcons, but two of those have since changed hands, according to Airport-Data, and corroborated by SuperyachtFan.

To provide a more comprehensive look at Branson's full list of private Falcons and what became of them, their models and designations are listed below in order of age, the 'youngest' jet first:

Dassault Falcon 7X: Tail number M-GGAL. Built in 2012, this jet is currently owned by Branson, and still registered under private ownership with this designation.

Dassault Falcon 900EX: Tail number G-GALX. This jet was built in 2006, and registered under this designation on July 13th, 2006. It was then sold and deregistered on July 12th, 2012. Currently, it is registered TVPX Aircraft Solutions Incorporated, in Utah.

Dassault Falcon 50EX: Tail number M-VGIN. This jet was built in 2001, and registered under this designation on September 29th, 2012. It has since been sold and deregistered, and since July 18th, 2017, it has been owned by Sky Helicopters Incorporated, Texas.

From a layperson's reading these jets' registration records, it does appear that the oldest 50EX was owned by Branson at the same time as the newest 7X, which he still owns, meaning that he did indeed own multiple Dassault Falcons between 2012 and 2017. Unless there are other Branson-owned private jets before the ones listed, the first one he owned outright was the 900EX, which served between 2006 and 2012.

The Falcon 7X, 50EX, and 900EX compared

With all three of these Falcon variants having three engines and being suitable for long-range executive travel, what is it that made these jets the choice of the globetrotting billionaire? Sir Richard Branson is no stranger to the aviation industry, having founded Virgin Atlantic Airways, and later making efforts to bring about commercial passenger travel via Virgin Galactic, as discussed in a BJTOnline interview. A brief overview of the three Falcons and their specifications follows:

The Falcon 7X is the second largest of all Falcon private jets designed thus far. After being developed from the Falcon 900, the7X was introduced in June 2007 and is still being manufactured today. The Falcon 7X, the extended-range 8X, and the 900 are the only three-engine jets still in production as of this year. As of 2020, 289 have been built thus far.

The Falcon 900EX EASy first saw service as the 900, which took its first flight in September 1984. After a longer-range variant, the 900B, was introduced in 1991, the 900EX replaced this variant, entering service in 1996. The plane would later be developed into the 900EX EASy, produced from 2004 to 2009, and eventually the 900LX, which is the current production model. Since the 900's introduction, it has featured multiple technological upgrades and aerodynamic tweaks, but its overall design has changed remarkably little. Between variations, over 500 have been built so far.

The Falcon 50EX is the oldest on this list, and the progenitor of the other two jets, its introduction dating all the way back to November 1976, when it debuted as the super-midsize Falcon 50. Loosely based on the even older Falcon 20, this jet was a clean sheet design that featured an original wing. The Falcon 50EX features improved engines and other enhancements to give further range increases, and was manufactured from 1996 to 2008. Between both versions, 352 were built.

Specifications of these Falcon models

Additional data from GlobalAir.

As shown by the reduced number of seats on the 7X compared to the 900EX, the more modern business jets are more executive than passenger-oriented in terms of configuration. However, the 7X is a much larger plane than the 50EX, meaning that while Branson owned both, he had two jets that could be used for different purposes, the 7X being suitable for trips to Europe and Asia from his home base in the UK, and the 50EX being more suitable for shorter trips.

How Sir Richard Branson made his millions

Sir Richard Branson first started the Virgin company in 1970, so named because he and his staff were so new to the world of business. The company began as a mail order service, selling records, but soon blossomed into the independent record label, Virgin Records. Two years later, Virgin Records was the biggest independent record label in the world, featuring the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols and Phil Collins, among many others.

In 1984, Branson founded Virgin Atlantic Airways, the first of many travel-related Virgin companies. As of 2021, he is still pursuing his vision of establishing a commercial space travel solution with the Virgin Galactic venture, the name of which played a part in the naming of his 900EX and 7X jets.

For a more detailed examination of how Virgin Atlantic became a global airline, read this article from August 2024.

In July of that year, Branson flew more than 50 miles above the New Mexico desert on the Virgin Galactic rocket plane VSS Unity, in the vehicle's first fully crewed test flight to space. The flight had been in the works for more than 17 years, and represented a major milestone for the project.

Space flight aside, Branson now has more than 11.5 million followers across online social networks, and spends a lot of time as a daredevil adventurer. He holds records for the fastest Atlantic Ocean boat crossing and hot-air ballooning across two oceans. He has written six books, and was knighted by then Prince Charles in 2000.

A closer look at the Dassault Falcon 7X

So then, what can be said about Sir Richard Branson's private jet of choice? Looking at an example available for charter via Clay Lacy, which has an interior finished in 2023. The plane comes with the following creature comforts and modern amenities:

11 seats, convertible to five beds

Two lavatories, the aft having a full vanity

SatCom Direct Wi-Fi with streaming speeds

HD monitors and an airshow moving map

Cabin environment controls

Power outlets & USB-C charging

Kitchen featuring microwave, oven, galley sink, and coffee-making facility

Easy in-flight access to the baggage compartment

With its long range, it makes a great plane for transcontinental or transatlantic travel. It can reach a cruising speed of 0.80 Mach, boasting a fuel consumption of up to 30 percent lower than other jets in its class. Plenty of light is provided by the 28 large windows, and the high-tech cabin management system, with multiple control points, allows passengers to set an appropriate mood for their time of travel.

How much is it to purchase one today?

While the video below may quote the new price of the Falcon 7X as being around $60 million, an article published in March shows the most recent price as closer to $55 million. As the newer 8X exists, pre-owned prices of the jet have begun to fall, ranging from $15 million to $48 million, with the earliest 2007 models being the cheapest.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-85.png,N,,2025-03-23 16:56:24.424140

Collaboration between Ethiopian and Etihad Airlines Boosts Travel Options

The joint venture features a codeshare agreement, which enhances flexibility for passengers travelling on both airlines’ networks. Travellers can now book single-ticket routes that combine Ethiopian Airlines’ reach into the Middle East and Asia. This simplifies the process of connecting through Addis Ababa and Abu Dhabi.

The CEO of Ethiopian Airlines described the significance of the deal as “a significant milestone in our efforts to enhance connectivity and provide exceptional service.”

With the increase in air traffic between these regions, the partnership enhances convenience while reinforcing economic connections, as Abu Dhabi’s tourist attractions and Ethiopia’s lively investments are set to attract more tourists.

Linking Africa and Asia via Abu Dhabi

The recently introduced flights represent a big step forward for Ethiopian and Etihad Airways, both airlines with strong growth goals. Ethiopian Airlines, the continent’s largest airline, will use its modern fleet, which includes Boeing 777s and Airbus A350-100s, on the Addis Ababa to Abu Dhabi route, expanding its footprint in the UAE across existing services to Sharjah and Dubai. Furthermore, Etihad Airways’ daily flights to Addis Ababa are its fifteenth new route in 2025. This highlights Abu Dhabi’s status as a worldwide aviation centre.

“This partnership connects our expanding networks, offering seamless access to a growing list of destinations,” said Antonoaldo Neves, CEO of Etihad Airways.

This strategic partnership enhances the presence of both Airlines’ in an expanding market and promotes greater economic and cultural interactions.

However, it did not factor in additional cost pressures such as increased aviation fuel taxes or the mandatory adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which was considerably more expensive than conventional jet fuel.
This means that the annual emissions from aviation fuel are equivalent to the annual emissions of 856,000 petrol-driven cars.
The RefuelEU Aviation mandate will gradually require airlines to use more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which will make fuel costs higher.
By the end of 2024, KM Malta Airlines will have modernised its fleet entirely, operating eight Airbus A320neo planes.","Flights to and from Malta are expected to get more expensive because of rising costs from the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Ticket prices could go up by about €10.10 per passenger if the cost of CO2 emissions is €80 per metric tonne. The price could go up by as much as €13.92 per passenger if the ETS cost rises to €110 per metric tonne of CO2.

This emerges from a Central Bank discussion paper authored by senior economist Kurt Sant.

The report considered ticket price adjustments if airlines passed on these costs entirely to passengers. However, it did not factor in additional cost pressures such as increased aviation fuel taxes or the mandatory adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which was considerably more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

The report revealed that scheduled passenger flights to and from Malta International Airport in 2024 consumed a staggering 351,977,437kg of fuel. This corresponds to 1,112,248 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions.

This means that the annual emissions from aviation fuel are equivalent to the annual emissions of 856,000 petrol-driven cars. This calculation, made by MaltaToday, is based on EU average emissions of 1.3 metric tonnes of CO2 per car per year. It would take roughly 18 million trees growing for 10 years to absorb this amount of CO2.

The cost of cutting emissions

By 2026, airlines will no longer receive free ETS allowances and will be required to purchase them in full, in line with the EU’s polluter-pays principle. This change will significantly raise operational costs for carriers, particularly those serving smaller and highly seasonal routes like those to and from Malta.

The EU’s Fit for 55 initiatives, which aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, are driving regulatory changes in the aviation sector. The RefuelEU Aviation mandate will gradually require airlines to use more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which will make fuel costs higher. Although the Single European Sky initiative is expected to help airlines save time and improve efficiency by better managing airspace, smaller airlines will still face challenges due to the overall rules and regulations.

Efficiency measures by the new national airline

The analysis also considered measures taken to enhance the efficiency of KM Malta Airlines, which replaced Air Malta as the country’s flag carrier. The new airline inherited a fleet of six Airbus A320neo aircraft from Air Malta, along with two older Airbus A320 models, which have since been replaced by additional A320neo aircraft. By the end of 2024, KM Malta Airlines will have modernised its fleet entirely, operating eight Airbus A320neo planes.

The shift to a fully A320neo fleet partly offsets rising operational costs and environmental obligations. The A320neo offers up to 20% better fuel efficiency than its predecessor and significantly reduces noise levels. The investment in a more fuel-efficient fleet has allowed KM Malta Airlines to cut emissions and fuel consumption, achieving a reduction of 36,367 metric tonnes of CO2 emissions in 2024 alone. If the airline had exclusively operated older A320 models, fuel consumption would have been significantly higher, resulting in additional emissions and costs.

The airline’s fleet renewal is also expected to yield financial benefits in the context of ETS changes. In a scenario where all flights were operated using older aircraft, KM Malta Airlines would have faced an ETS cost of nearly €23 million at an allowance price of €80 per metric tonne of CO2.

However, due to its transition to the A320neo, the airline has managed to reduce this expense to under €20 million. A complete shift to an all-A320neo fleet, including wet-leased flights, would further lower ETS-related costs to below €19 million, generating an additional €1 million in savings.

Total carbon footprint of aviation

The Central Bank report also estimated the total emissions of all flights operating to and from Malta at 1.24 million metric tonnes of CO2. Passenger flights, which accounted for 85% of total flights, were responsible for 1.1 million metric tonnes of CO2.

Cargo flights accounted for the highest emissions among non-scheduled services, releasing 44.8 million kilograms of CO2, closely followed by other commercial aircraft flights, which produced 44.5 million kilograms of CO2.",https://content.maltatoday.com.mt/ui_frontend/thumbnail/684/400/1.1_airport_passenger_pic.png,N,,2025-03-23 12:56:13.816039

The factors influencing private jet traffic.

There are many reasons why people decide to fly privately. Here is a breakdown of a few:

Economic factors such as wealth and spending power can result in higher amounts of private jets needed in operation, resulting in a demand for more pilots with a type rating for a private jet. According to Fortune, between 2012 and 2022, West Palm Beach, Florida and Miami, Florida experienced the most millionaire growth by 90% and 75% respectively. The other cities that made it to the top 5 in terms of millionaire growth were: Austin, Texas (102%); Scottsdale, Arizona (88%); and Greenwich and Darien, Connecticut (72%). Out of the 5 cities, Miami has the most billionaires, 12, and the highest number of residents, with a net worth of over $100 million.

Flying private allows individuals to optimise their air travel experience to their needs and preferences. Flying private allows individuals to save a significant amount of time compared to flying commercial. Additionally, there is more flexibility in terms of scheduling and the route of the flight. Owning or chartering a private jet allows for customization with regard to the interior of the jet so it can meet the needs and preferences of everyone's needs.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the desire to fly privately increased due to the travel restrictions as travelling privately allowed for more control over travel plans. This led to highlighting the flexibility and convenience of private jet travel, which in turn influenced more people to travel privately who before the pandemic, would most likely travel in a first-class cabin on a commercial flight.

Private Airports in Florida

There are over 120 airports in Florida, with many having a fixed-based operator (FBOs are terminals for private jet customers). With many airports having a FBO, shows the demand for private jet pilots in Florida. Here are some of the airports which have an FBO according to Air Charter Service.

Miami Executive Airport

Miami Executive Airport is the most popular private jet airport in Miami. It is one of the busiest airports in Florida, and comes with a discrete personalized service, allowing their private jet passengers to choose their VIP lounges, showers and concierge services.

Miami-Opa Locka Airport

Miami-Opa Locka Airport is located 10 minutes away from the Hard Rock Stadium, making it the ideal destination for NFL fans flying to Miami. The airport has four fixed-based operators and is equipped with a VIP lounge, well-appointed conference rooms, showers and sleeping rooms and excellent service.

Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport

Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport is a great option for people who want to avoid the high-speed atmosphere of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. With two runways, it is one of the busiest private airports in Florida. However, it never feels that way due to its 5 fixed based operators.

Palm Beach International Airport

Palm Beach International Airport is located 3 miles south-east of Palm Beach. The three FBOs are located on the south end of the airport, allowing its private jet customers that executive feel.

Boca Raton Airport

Boca Raton Airport is in between Palm Beach Airport and Fort Lauderdale. In 2018, it started to allow international flights to land directly at the airport instead of making a stop beforehand as it added an onsite Customs and Border Protection facility​​​​​​.

St Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport

St Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport is 9 miles from St Petersburg, 7 miles from Clearwater and 17 miles from Tampa. It is used as a hub for low-cost airlines, but over 70% of its traffic comes from general aviation. The airport comes with 2 fixed-base operators that offer passenger lounges, Wi-Fi, courtesy cars and business facilities.

Naples Airport

Naples Airport is located just over 2 miles from the central business district of Naples. The airport currently does not serve any commercial airlines and has one fixed-base operator. The airport's commercial service was at its peak during the 1990s.

What are the private jet pilot salaries globally?

The geographical location of where a pilot is based is one of the many contributors to their salary. Some areas will have more high-net-worth individuals, resulting in pilots having a higher salary. The cost of living in each area will also contribute to the costs.

United States

The United States is known for being the home for many wealthy people, and the U.S is a significant market for private jet services. On average, a private jet pilot in the U.S. will earn $131,000, with a salary ranging from $49,500 - $201,000.

Europe

Europe is home to many high-net-worth individuals and corporations. Countries with the most high net-worth individuals are Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Salaries in Western Europe can be between $76,000 and $164,000. Private jet pilots in Eastern Europe will usually receive lower salaries ranging between $44,000 and $98,000.

Middle East

The Middle East is known for its high concentration of wealth, making it one of the biggest hubs for private aviation. Salaries over here can range from $100,000 and $180,000. Pilots in Dubai or Abu Dhabi will have a salary towards the top end of the pay scale.

Asia

Asia's private aviation market is constantly growing. China has the highest private jet pilot salary, ranging between $80,000 and $160,000. In Southeast Asia, private jet pilots can expect to earn between $60,000 and $120,000.

Australia

Due to Australia being geographically remote, private jets are a viable option. Salaries in Australia range between $77,000 and $102,000.

Canada

There has been a growth in the need for private jets in Canada, especially in business hubs such as Toronto and Vancouver. The average salary for a private jet pilot in Canada can range between $70,000 and $105,000.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/main-image-16_9-71.png,N,,2025-03-23 11:56:40.501467

A Central Bank report estimates ticket prices could rise by €10.10 per passenger if CO2 costs reach €80 per metric tonne and up to €13.92 at €110 per metric tonne. These estimates assume airlines pass on the full cost but exclude factors like fuel tax hikes and the switch to costly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Malta’s aviation sector produced 1.1 million metric tonnes of CO2 in 2024, equal to the emissions of 856,000 petrol cars. From 2026, airlines must fully purchase ETS allowances, further increasing costs. EU regulations also require a gradual shift to SAF, which is far more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

KM Malta Airlines is mitigating costs by upgrading its fleet to Airbus A320neo aircraft, which are 20% more fuel-efficient. This transition has already cut CO2 emissions by 36,000 metric tonnes in 2024, reducing ETS-related costs from nearly €23 million to under €20 million.

The report also highlighted that while passenger flights are the main source of aviation emissions, cargo flights, business jets, and military aircraft contribute significantly."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.75761-15/485633647_18097156009534349_5206840070241409184_n.jpg?stp=c270.0.810.810a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=1rfVievPOaQQ7kNvgEhuDTt&_nc_oc=AdnX-pf_rkg4EKKJVnBsNFqPtepgySWBmymBAofJDT97ZYDhgmYNk1SxjPSHUfp2mA0&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-2.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=nRRfKNn_3y51-rtFppB2FQ&oh=00_AYHThl2Xlzw6bAYYKOsUs9QnDlko1twSprKHo8SxmOWylg&oe=67E61B62,N,,2025-03-23 12:56:16.691297

This article explores how airlines, governments, and innovators are accelerating the shift to cleaner skies.

Why Biofuels Matter in Aviation

Aviation currently accounts for about 2% of global CO₂ emissions, and airlines face growing pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Biofuels — particularly Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) made from renewable sources — can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional kerosene jet fuel (AFDC, 2024). This emissions reduction is a key driver behind SAF adoption.

The international aviation sector has set an aspirational goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2050, with SAF widely viewed as the best near-term solution. Airlines also see biofuels as a hedge against oil price volatility and supply disruptions. As Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Amelia DeLuca, put it: “SAF is the best-known lever we have to decarbonize aviation… we need as much SAF as we can get” (CARB, 2024).

In addition, SAF enhances brand reputation — helping airlines attract environmentally conscious travelers while signaling climate leadership to investors and regulators alike.

As SAF moves from early adoption to global momentum, several key trends are emerging across the aviation industry. From airline strategies and policy mandates to technological breakthroughs, these developments are shaping the future of biofuels in the aviation industry. The following five trends reveal how the sector is moving from ambition to implementation.

1. Airline commitments to biofuels in the aviation industry

Airlines across the globe have announced bold commitments to incorporate biofuels in their operations. Many see SAF as crucial for meeting industry climate targets (like the IATA pledge for net zero by 2050) and government mandates.

For example:

Delta & Southwest: Have publicly committed to replacing 10% of their jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

Oneworld Alliance (including American Airlines, British Airways, and Qantas): Collective 10% SAF target by 2030.

United Airlines: Leads the U.S. market with multiple SAF investments and off-take agreements, including a $200 million fund dedicated to SAF innovation.

KLM & Lufthansa: Pioneers in SAF adoption, with regular SAF use on select routes and long-term supply agreements.

These biofuel commitments aren’t just PR—many airlines are signing multi-year purchase deals with SAF producers (e.g., Delta with Gevo, Singapore Airlines with Neste). As of 2023, over 360,000 commercial flights have flown using SAF blends. That number is expected to grow exponentially as production ramps up.

Early adoption of biofuels also boosts an airline’s brand image among eco-conscious travelers, demonstrating leadership and innovation in climate strategy.

See Top 5 Advanced Biofuel Companies for key players behind these shifts.

2. The cost & scalability challenges of biofuels in the aviation industry

Despite growing momentum, cost and supply remain major hurdles to widespread SAF adoption. Currently, SAF is significantly more expensive than conventional Jet A fuel. According to industry reports, U.S. jet fuel averages around $2.85 per gallon, while SAF can range from $4.00 to $7.00 per gallon or more—often 2–5 times the price.

This price premium, or “green premium,” reflects high production costs, limited refining capacity, and expensive feedstocks. While SAF can deliver substantial emissions reductions, the economics still make large-scale adoption challenging for airlines operating on thin margins.

In 2022, SAF accounted for only about 0.1% of total jet fuel used in the U.S. The Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge aims to scale annual production to 3 billion gallons by 2030, a dramatic increase from roughly 16 million gallons produced in 2021. But even with aggressive investment, projections suggest the U.S. might reach only ~2.1 billion gallons without further policy and capital support.

“A lot of additional investment is needed to hit that target” – Gordon McManus

Meanwhile, producers are working to improve conversion efficiency, build larger refineries, and explore cheaper feedstocks such as municipal waste and used cooking oil. Many SAF pathways are also beginning to benefit from learning-curve effects, with the expectation that costs will decline as technology scales.

3. Government policies supporting biofuels in the aviation industry

Government support is one of the most important accelerators for sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is still in its early days, and clear policies can make the difference between pilot programs and industry-wide transformation.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) introduced a blender’s tax credit for SAF of up to $1.75 per gallon, depending on lifecycle carbon intensity. This helps narrow the price gap with fossil jet fuel. Additional federal incentives, grants, and Department of Energy (DOE) funding have supported new SAF projects and refineries.

California provides further support through its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), which offers SAF producers credits that can be sold to emitters, creating a direct financial reward for low-carbon fuel use at airports like LAX and SFO.

The European Union has taken a more regulatory approach. The ReFuelEU Aviation initiative mandates a minimum of 2% SAF blending by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. The regulation also requires e-fuels (made from green hydrogen and CO₂) to account for at least 2% by 2030, signaling a strong push toward synthetic fuels.

Other countries are also stepping up. Singapore has announced plans for SAF blending mandates by 2026, Japan has a 10% SAF goal by 2030, and Australia is funding domestic SAF production. Globally, the CORSIA scheme from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) sets emission caps and encourages airlines to adopt offsets or cleaner fuels.

As more governments implement mandates and incentives, they create stable demand signals that encourage investment and innovation across the SAF supply chain.

See The Pros and Cons of Advanced Biofuels for more context.

4. Can biofuels in the aviation industry replace kerosene?

Many stakeholders are asking the big question: Can SAF and other aviation biofuels fully replace fossil jet fuel?

While the answer is “not entirely”—at least not soon—there’s strong evidence that SAF can replace a substantial portion of aviation fuel over the next two to three decades. According to IATA, SAF could deliver up to 65% of the CO₂ reductions needed for the sector to hit net zero by 2050.

However, aviation demand is projected to grow significantly in that timeframe. This means that SAF will need to expand at an extraordinary pace to maintain or reduce emissions.

Short-haul flights may gradually transition to electric or hydrogen propulsion, but medium and long-haul flights, representing the majority of emissions, are expected to rely heavily on SAF.

Synthetic fuels, or e-fuels, made from renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured CO₂, are another piece of the puzzle. These can be blended with SAF or used as standalone fuels. The EU’s e-fuel mandate is already pushing this segment forward.

Blending levels are expected to increase: from today’s 1–2% SAF on most commercial routes, to 10–20% by the early 2030s, and 50% or more in the 2040s. Some pioneering flights have already flown on 100% SAF in test conditions, proving that the technology works even if it’s not yet widespread.

The consensus is that SAF will be the primary solution for decarbonizing long-distance air travel, but it must be paired with continued R&D, infrastructure investment, and supportive policy.

5. Innovation on the horizon for biofuels in the aviation industry

Although SAF is already viable today, the next generation of technologies and feedstocks will be essential for making it cost-effective, scalable, and truly sustainable. Here’s what’s coming:

Algae-Based Fuels: Algae can produce far more oil per acre than traditional crops, grow in brackish or saltwater, and don’t compete with food production. Companies are racing to commercialize algae as a low-impact SAF feedstock.

Municipal Waste & Captured Carbon: SAF is now being developed from household garbage and even direct air capture (DAC) CO₂ streams. These ultra-low-carbon pathways turn trash and emissions into flight-worthy fuel.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) Fuels: These synthetic fuels combine green hydrogen with captured CO₂ to create e-kerosene. Already in European pilot production, PtL fuels are expected to scale significantly in the 2030s.

Advanced Catalysts & Refining Tech: R&D is reducing energy input and increasing conversion efficiency, making fuel production faster, cheaper, and less resource-intensive.

New Feedstock Certification: The industry is working on certifying novel feedstocks like halophytic plants (which grow in saltwater) and volatile fatty acids from fermentation. More approved pathways = more flexibility and innovation.

In parallel, engine manufacturers like Rolls-Royce and GE are testing engines that can run on 100% SAF. Some OEMs are even considering aircraft optimized specifically for SAF use in the future.

As innovation continues, the barriers to SAF adoption—cost, feedstock availability, and conversion efficiency—will likely shrink. That means biofuels will play an even more significant role in the future of aviation’s clean energy.

The aviation industry’s journey toward net zero is just beginning—and SAF will be one of the jet engines powering that shift.

“Bagi kami, Indonesia akan selalu menjadi mitra strategis bagi LG Chem, terutama di sektor industri hijau,” ujar Vice President Kim.

LG Chem juga menyoroti peran mereka dalam rantai pasok kendaraan listrik global, termasuk kolaborasi melalui LG Energy Solution dan Hyundai yang telah membangun pabrik sel baterai kendaraan listrik di Karawang Jawa Barat. Pembangunan pabrik ini dilakukan dalam dua tahap.

Tahap pertama dengan kapasitas 10 GWh telah rampung pada 2024, sementara tahap kedua dengan kapasitas 20 GWh saat ini sedang dalam proses pembangunan. LG Chem juga mengapresiasi dukungan Pemerintah dalam merealisasikan grand package plan yang mendorong percepatan investasi di sektor ini.

Selain di sektor kendaraan listrik, LG Chem juga menawarkan potensi kerja sama di bidang biodegradable plastic dengan memanfaatkan teknologi yang dimilikinya. Tawaran ini disambut baik oleh Menko Airlangga, yang menegaskan komitmen Pemerintah dalam membuka peluang investasi di berbagai proyek energi bersih. Salah satu sektor yang menjadi perhatian adalah pengolahan kelapa sawit menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), di mana Indonesia memiliki potensi besar untuk berkembang.

Sejalan dengan itu, LG Chem yang baru-baru ini mengembangkan produksi SAF di Korea Selatan, menyatakan ketertarikannya untuk berkolaborasi dalam pengembangan SAF di Indonesia. Melalui pertemuan ini, Indonesia dan LG Chem semakin memperkuat kerja sama strategis di sektor energi bersih dan industri kendaraan listrik, sehingga akan membuka jalan bagi kolaborasi yang saling menguntungkan di masa depan.

Turut hadir mendampingi Menko Airlangga dalam pertemuan tersebut yaitu di antaranya Deputi Bidang Koordinasi Kerja Sama Ekonomi dan Investasi Kemenko Perekonomian Edi Prio Pambudi, Deputi Bidang Koordinasi Perniagaan dan Ekonomi Digital Kemenko Perekonomian Ali Murtopo Simbolon, Staf Khusus Menko Perekonomian I Gusti Putu Suryawirawan, dan Tim Ahli Menko Perekonomian Boo Hyung Lee.

Oltre a integrare l’uso del SAF nelle proprie operazioni, Airbus investe e collabora con i partner per ampliare l’ecosistema SAF.
Nel 2024, Airbus ha investito in SAFFA, il Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund.
Guardando al futuro, Airbus prevede di continuare ad aumentare l’uso di SAF nelle proprie operazioni, con l’obiettivo di utilizzare almeno il 30% di SAF nel suo global fuel mix entro il 2030″, conclude Airbus.","Airbus informa: “Cosa hanno in comune Tolosa, Amburgo, Mobile, Tianjin e Mirabel? Tutti questi Airbus commercial aircraft assembly sites ora utilizzano sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per le loro operazioni interne.

Grazie a questo sviluppo, entro la fine del 2025, tutti i clienti Airbus, indipendentemente da dove ricevano il loro aeromobile, potranno farlo con SAF a bordo, gratuitamente. Nel 2024, il 75% delle 766 aircraft deliveries utilizzava un SAF fuel blend e si prevede che questa percentuale aumenterà presto, una volta che le consegne di aeromobili che utilizzano SAF inizieranno a Mirabel più avanti quest’anno.

Il SAF rimane una leva fondamentale per gli obiettivi di decarbonizzazione del settore dell’aviazione. Si prevede che il SAF fornirà la maggior parte delle riduzioni delle emissioni necessarie al settore dell’aviazione per raggiungere il suo obiettivo di emissioni di carbonio nette pari a zero entro il 2050, con l’International Air Transport Association (IATA) che stima che il SAF potrebbe contribuire a circa il 65% della riduzione delle emissioni richiesta. Negli ultimi anni, Airbus ha aumentato la percentuale di SAF utilizzata nelle proprie operazioni al 16%, che include viaggi di lavoro, voli di consegna (in cui un aereo viene consegnato alla base della compagnia aerea acquirente dopo il trasferimento della proprietà) e trasporto di parti di aeromobili tra diversi siti di produzione”.

“Per raggiungere questo obiettivo, Airbus ha firmato accordi con fornitori di SAF come TotalEnergies, che forniscono SAF per le consegne di aeromobili a Tolosa dal 2016. Grazie a una partnership firmata nel 2024, TotalEnergies fornisce più della metà del SAF per soddisfare le esigenze di Airbus in Europa. Abbiamo anche unito le forze con le compagnie aeree. Volotea, che opera un volo Amburgo-Tolosa per i dipendenti Airbus come parte del nostro internal shuttle service, utilizza un SAF blend al 34% su questa rotta dal 2022. Dopo un programma pilota di successo nel 2023, dal 2024 Air France-KLM e Airbus hanno un “SAF fares agreement”, con Airbus che acquista opzioni SAF per i viaggi di lavoro dei dipendenti che collegano Parigi con cinque sedi: Amburgo, Madrid, Marsiglia, Monaco e Tolosa.

Guardando più lontano, nel 2024 Airbus ha lanciato un programma pilota con easyJet, che opera voli sulla rotta Tolosa-Bristol, una rotta popolare per i viaggi di lavoro grazie alla vicinanza ai siti Airbus di Tolosa e Filton. In esecuzione tra novembre 2024 e gennaio 2025, il programma ha visto Airbus finanziare 106 tonnellate di SAF, la quantità equivalente di carburante necessaria per effettuare voli tra Tolosa e Bristol con una SAF blend al 30% durante il periodo.

Nel gennaio 2025, Airbus, Wizz Air, Moeve e Charleroi Airport hanno completato un SAF operational trial. Airbus ha fornito consulenza tecnica e competenza durante il trial, durante la quale Wizz Air ha operato più di 50 voli utilizzando una miscela di SAF e jet fuel tradizionale. Durante questo periodo è stato inoltre completato un sondaggio che ha fatto luce sulla consapevolezza e gli atteggiamenti dei passeggeri nei confronti dell’aviazione a basse emissioni di carbonio, incluso il SAF“, prosegue Airbus.

“Sebbene la quantità di SAF disponibile sia aumentata negli ultimi anni, la domanda rimane sotto pressione a causa del costo più elevato del SAF rispetto al cherosene, 2,8 volte in base agli European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) 2024 Aviation Fuels Reference Prices for ReFuelEU Aviation. Il settore deve affrontare questa disparità e ridurre il divario di prezzo con il fuel tradizionale.

Sebbene Airbus non sia un produttore di SAF, può svolgere un ruolo. Oltre a integrare l’uso del SAF nelle proprie operazioni, Airbus investe e collabora con i partner per ampliare l’ecosistema SAF. Nel 2024, Airbus ha investito in SAFFA, il Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance investment fund. SAFFA si concentra su SAF idoneo per la certificazione RefuelEU Aviation o CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), sebbene gli investimenti possano avvenire in diversi percorsi di produzione e regioni. Il primo investimento di SAFFA in Crysalis Biosciences, con sede negli Stati Uniti, aiuterà l’azienda a produrre SAF e prodotti biochimici a bassa intensità di carbonio.

Nel 2024, Airbus ha anche investito nella sustainable aviation fuels producer and technology company LanzaJet. L’investimento di Airbus supporta LanzaJet nell’ampliamento del suo SAF production process che utilizza etanolo, noto come Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway. LanzaJet ha recentemente aperto un nuovo impianto SAF a Soperton, in Georgia, con la capacità di produrre 9 milioni di galloni di SAF ogni anno.

Guardando al futuro, Airbus prevede di continuare ad aumentare l’uso di SAF nelle proprie operazioni, con l’obiettivo di utilizzare almeno il 30% di SAF nel suo global fuel mix entro il 2030″, conclude Airbus.

Owning a Gulfstream G650 or a Bombardier Global 7500, ultra-long-haul private jets capable of flying from pretty much anywhere on Earth to pretty much anywhere else (with extremely limited exceptions), may seem like the ultimate status symbol. For the most part, this is true, as these jets are lavish, with massive cabins that can be configured in several different ways.

Get all the latest aviation news from Simple Flying!

However, for those looking for a private jet that will undoubtedly go above and beyond, one which will offer exceptional performance and unparalleled range, all while providing passengers with a cabin that is significantly larger than even that of a Gulfstream or Bombardier private jet. Even the largest, most lavish purpose-built private jets fall short of the capabilities, comfort, and flexibility that can be offered by a commercial aircraft that has been converted to serve an executive role.

While the market for such aircraft is actually extremely small, there are still a few buyers interested in exactly this kind of purchase. We are speaking, of course, about Boeing Business Jets (BBJs) and Airbus Corporate Jets (ACJs), both of which offer passengers an exceptional passenger experience. These aircraft offer unbelievable amounts of space for passengers, providing exceptional passenger comfort. As a result of their unbelievable size, however, these jets are almost always the most expensive private jets on the market.

For about a decade now, the ultimate prize in the world of private jets has undoubtedly been the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which is the most capable private aircraft to ever hit the market. With unprecedented range and game-changing efficiency, the Boeing 787 has fundamentally changed the commercial aviation industry and, at the same time, it offers private jet operators the most technologically advanced platform for their transport solutions. In this article, we will take a deeper look at the Boeing 787 private jet, and what makes this VIP aircraft so impressive.

A deeper look at Boeing Business Jets

Before diving deeper into the Boeing 787 business jet itself, it is important to understand what exactly a Boeing Business Jet is. These aircraft play a smaller role in the world of private aviation, but they are some of the most lavish to have ever entered the skies. By definition, a Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) is a private, corporate, or other VIP-configured aircraft modified from Boeing's popular series of commercial airliner models, with modifications made to offer passengers a luxury experience, extended range, and executive transport.

The BBJ brand was launched back in 1996 as a collaboration between Boeing and industrial conglomerate General Electric. The first BBJ model was rolled out in 1998, and it was a modified Boeing 737-700 model. Since the introduction of this model, Boeing has introduced BBJ variants of all the following aircraft:

Boeing 737 MAX

Boeing 777

Boeing 777X

Boeing 747-8

Boeing 787 Dreamliner

Boeing Business Jets offer spacious interiors that can be customized by their customers. These can be efficiently tailed for VIP transportation, government leaders, or even corporate offices, as the cabin can be configured to serve as a boardroom with offices. The aircraft's interior can be modified to include everything from conference rooms, lounges, master bedrooms with shower suites, and high-tech living spaces. The aircraft has an advanced cabin pressurization system which is designed to improve passenger well-being and provide a more comfortable flight experience, by pressurizing the cabin to a significantly lower cabin altitude.

One of the key selling points of Boeing Business Jet variants is that they offer extended-range capabilities and exceptional performance. These BBJ variants have larger fuel tanks and reinforced wings and landing gear, which allow them to handle the additional weight required for ultra-long-haul operations. The reinforced landing gear also allows Boeing Business Jets to handle the stresses of high-frequency operation, ensuring that they have a longer service life.

The Boeing Business Jet 737 MAX 7, for example, is set to have an extended range of 6,600 nautical miles, far beyond that of a commercially configured 737 MAX 7 that would be loaded up with passengers. An even more drastic example of this is true of the Boeing Business Jet 777X, which will be able to fly up to 11,800 nautical miles, making it one of the longest-range aircraft to ever enter the business aviation market. This allows the BBJ 777X to fly pretty much all the way around the world without stopping, making it ideal for high-profile executive travelers demanding operational flexibility.

Boeing Business Jets also offer a range of efficiency-oriented and operational benefits, primarily stemming from the historical reliability and efficiency of Boeing's proven commercial aircraft. With operating costs ranging from between $5,200 to $5,600 per flight hour, these aircraft offer significantly lower operating costs than many other business aircraft. These planes also benefit from the exceptional reliability that Boeing has historically been known for, with aircraft being subject to low-maintenance schedules, something which makes them ideal for long-term ownership.

A look at the different Boeing Business Jet series

The Boeing 737 MAX family offers an impressive balance of range and efficiency for operators, with three models (the BBJ 737-7, the BBJ 737-8, and the BBJ 737-9) all on offer. These aircraft all feature retractable airstairs, high-thrust engines, and custom-designed interiors.

The manufacturer does also offer a series of widebody Boeing Business Jets, the final of which will be the subject of this analysis. The Boeing 747-8 BBJ is the largest business jet ever made, and it offers passengers more than 4,700 square feet of cabin space. The Boeing 777X BBJ variants, as previously mentioned, will offer unheard-of range capabilities that could fundamentally change private aviation. The Boeing 787 BBJ, which offers a composite airframe and exceptional operational efficiency, offers a range of 9,960 nautical miles, according to the manufacturer.

As a result of these impressive capabilities, the Boeing 787 business jet has become popular with Fortune 500 companies, billionaires, and investment firms, as well as some high-net-worth owners. Other customers for this business jet include governments and heads of state, especially those from the Middle East.

How lavish is the Boeing 787 business jet?

The Boeing 787 BBJ is undeniably one of the most luxurious and spacious private jets to hit the market. Every feature of this game-changing aircraft has been exquisitely designed to provide passengers with unparalleled comfort, an unbeatable sense of exclusivity, and long-range travel capabilities. Featuring a cabin that is a full 18 feet wide, the aircraft offers an unparalleled sense of space in comparison to most traditional business jets, which are known for more cramped interiors. This flexibility allows customers to create custom interiors tailored to their specific needs.

Unlike the commercial Boeing 787 variants, which are designed to seat a maximum of 242 passengers, the Boeing 787 BBJ offers a maximum capacity of just 40 passengers, meaning it can provide impressive amounts of personal space and comfort. Those who buy the aircraft will receive a ""green"" model, one with no pre-installed interior. After being delivered by the manufacturer, the aircraft will go to a completion center, where owners can modify their aircraft to whatever specifications they would like.

Boeing 787 BBJ owners have been known to install all kinds of different features, including master bedrooms, private en-suite bathrooms, lounges, dining rooms, cabins for guests, and large boardroom-style seating areas. Known for offering an exceptionally quiet cabin, the Boeing 787 BBJ provides an excellent passenger experience, according to Corporate Jet Investor.

The cabin altitude is pressurized to just about 6,000 feet, significantly below the 9,000 that is standard on commercial aircraft.

The global aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its carbon footprint and meet stringent environmental regulations. Platts has observed growing interest in ETJ SAF since it provides a solution to lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with air travel. The capacity for ETJ SAF is projected to keep growing, driven by rising demand and ongoing investments in production processes.

The ETJ SAF values will reflect ASTM D7566 standard specification, with a relative density of 759.5 kg/cu m (at 15 degrees Celsius), basis USGC. The ETJ SAF values will be published in cents/gal. Platts will publish values with and without environmental credits by deducting the federal SAF tax credit and D4 biomass-based diesel RINs.

The values will reflect a reference Carbon Intensity of 33 gCO2e/MMBtu (31.278 gCO2/Mj).

Platts will calculate the credit by multiplying the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction percentage by the maximum credit price, $1.75/gal. Platts will calculate lifecycle GHG emissions reduction percentage as a fraction, the numerator of which will be the maximum carbon intensity -- 50 kgCO2/MMBTU -- minus the SAF CI of 33 kgCO2/MMBtu, and the denominator of which will be the maximum carbon intensity. The credit will be rounded to the nearest hundredth cent.

(50 - 33)/50 x 175 cents/gal = 59.50 cents/gal

Therefore, the total SAF tax credit Platts will use in its USGC ETJ SAF without credits prices is 59.50 cents/gal.

These calculated values will reflect the cost of SAF produced via the ethanol-to-jet pathway. Feedstock considered will be ethanol from Brazil's sugarcane and Gulf Coast hydrogen; coproducts will include renewable diesel and naphtha/gasoline; and utility costs will include Gulf Coast natural gas and electricity. Platts daily prices for feedstocks, coproducts, and utilities will also be taken into account.

The cost-based values will follow the Platts US publishing schedule. For days when Brazil there is a publishing holiday in Brazil but not in the US, Platts will take the last published Brazil ethanol price.

The launch of the new values was first proposed in a subscriber note published March 6, available here(opens in a new tab).

This impressive range allows the Bombardier Global 7500 to offer passengers the flexibility to fly nonstop between far-flung destinations, such as New York and Hong Kong or Los Angeles and Sydney. This jet currently stands as the longest-range private jet in active service, although its position as the market leader could be set to change in coming years with new market entrants preparing to make their impact on the industry.

American manufacturer Gulfstream, which is a subsidiary of the greater General Dynamics Corporation, offers a range of 7,500 nautical miles on its flagship business jet, the Gulfstream G650ER, according to Aviation Week. This jet, which is known more for its speed (it flies at Mach 0.925) and its lavish interior, has long been a favorite among executive travelers as it offers both efficiency and comfort when connecting long-haul destinations.

Some other aircraft also offer exceptional long-range capabilities

Another major ultra-long-range business aircraft is the Dassault Falcon 8X, which offers an impressive range of 6,450 nautical miles. While this plane is not able to fly to as many destinations as the Bombardier Global 7500 or the Gulfstream G650ER, the Falcon 8X is extremely versatile, and it is designed to access shorter runways, something which makes it ideal for travelers looking for flexibility when it comes to airport selection.

Some smaller aircraft also offer impressive long-range capabilities, with the added benefits of lower operating costs and more flexible operational requirements. Examples of such aircraft include the Cessna Citation X+, which is capable of traveling more than 3,400 nautical miles, and the Embraer Praetor 600, which has a range of 4,000 nautical miles. The aircraft offers exceptional performance for a mid-range aircraft, and it can reach a strong number of international destinations from a base like New York.

At the end of the day, the Bombardier Global 7500 and the Gulfstream G650ER stand out as the most dominant ultra-long-range aircraft, while mid-size flexible jets like the Praetor 600 do offer long-range capabilities in a more compact aircraft. The decision on which aircraft to purchase eventually just comes down to individual preferences. Let's take a deeper look at these extended-range aircraft and their capabilities.

A deeper look at the Bombardier Global 7500

The Bombardier Global 7500, and its upcoming successor, the Global 8000, are the longest-range business jets on the market. These aircraft offer unmatched speed and range capabilities, while also offering an impressive luxury experience. Developed by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier Aviation, the Global 7500 was originally designated as the Global 7000, before its range was extended beyond 7,700 nautical miles. The plane made its first flight in November 2016, and it quickly received certification in September 2018 before entering service in December 2018.

According to Business Jet Traveler, the aircraft featured a clean-sheet design, and it was fitted with a new transonic wing while also being the first business jet to ever be fitted with a four-zone cabin. As a result, the plane was able to offer superior comfort and operational flexibility to passengers. The aircraft's successor, the Bombardier Global 8000, is set to enter service in 2025 and expands upon the 7500's capabilities by offering an extended range of 8,000 nautical miles.

When this aircraft enters service, it will be the longest-range private jet on the market. The aircraft is also set to offer maximum operational speeds of Mach 0.94, which will make it the fastest civilian aircraft to fly since Concorde. While the aircraft was initially planned as a three-zone aircraft, the Bombardier Global 8000 was redesigned in 2022 to match the four-zone cabin offered by the Global 7500, which allowed for more passenger comfort and extended-range capabilities.

The Global 7500 faced serious delays as a result of its wing redesigns, which improved its performance and efficiency. The aircraft shares the same fly-by-wire controls (intriguingly) with the Airbus A220, which was originally designed by the Canadian planemaker. The aircraft features an airframe built out of aluminum-lithium alloys which were designed to reduce weight. The plane underwent extensive flight testing, with the plane logging more than 2,700 hours prior to receiving certification.

A deeper look at the capabilities of the Global 8000

While initially planned as a shortened version of the Bombardier Global 7500, the Global 8000 is set to be a game-changing aircraft, one which will push the limits of aircraft range while also not compromising on cabin space. The plane will be powered by a pair of General Electric Passport 20 engines, which collectively deliver nearly 19,000 pounds of thrust with reduced fuel emissions. The Global 7500 holds numerous speed records, while also having flown some of the longest individual flights in the history of business aviation.

Back in 2019, the aircraft completed an impressive 8,152-nautical mile experimental flight between Singapore and Tucson, which set a record for the longest individual flight flown by a business jet. Another record-breaking flight took place between Sydney and Detroit, which covered a distance of around 8,200 nautical miles.

The Global 7500 has been received well by the market, with more than 200 deliveries logged by December 2024. Notable customers for the aircraft include large-scale private jet charter companies, like NetJets, VistaJet, and Bellawings Jet. Here are some additional specifications for the upcoming Bombardier Global 8000, which is set to become the world's longest-range private jet:

A look at the Gulfstream G650ER

The Gulfstream G650ER, an ultra-long-range business jet intended to offer high-speed capabilities, offers an exceptional combination of luxury and efficiency. Despite being a long-standing favorite of corporate executives and high-net-worth individuals, the aircraft does fall slightly short of the Bombardier Global 7500 in terms of range. Nonetheless, it can still connect some of the world's most far-flung points to each other.

The aircraft offers a range of 7,500 nautical miles when operating at a speed of Mach 0.85, making it one of the longest-range jets on the market. It can still fly between far-flung city pairs, and it does not require refueling. Despite not being the longest-range jet on the market today, it is still important to take a deeper look at the Gulfstream G650ER and its capabilities, as it is an important competitive offering in the industry.

The Gulfstream G650ER extended the range of the earlier Gulfstream G650 by around 500 nautical miles, by adding fuel tanks that allowed for the plane's fuel capacity to be increased by around 4,000 pounds. This enabled passengers to bypass layovers and allowed them to reduce overall travel time, something which made the aircraft extremely marketable. This was especially appealing to corporate customers who wanted extremely efficient business travel solutions.

With a top operational speed of Mach 0.925, the Gulfstream G650ER allows executives to quickly travel across continents, and it minimizes the amount of time they have to spend in transport. The plane's advanced aerodynamics and its Rolls-Royce BR725 engines offer impressive operational efficiency and exceptional performance.

The Gulfstream G650ER's spacious cabin offers four different areas, including private sleeping rooms, a galley, and a state-of-the-art entertainment system. The plane also boasts large elliptical windows which let in large amounts of natural light and panoramic windows. The plane, which is pressurized to a lower cabin altitude of 4,850 feet, reduces passenger fatigue.

The plane can also effectively be used as a mobile office, and corporate leadership teams can configure the cabin in a boardroom-like setting. The ultra-long-range business jet is equipped with high-speed internet, satellite communication capabilities, and unique workspaces. The plane, as a result of this flexibility, has become popular with government and military agencies. The aircraft has become one of the most important business jets on the market, and it is designed for nonstop intercontinental travel, blending the best elements of multiple Gulfstream models that came before it. The plane's game-changing range has made it one of the most sought-after in private aviation.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/artboard-16_9-6-3.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 12:56:16.191206

Airlines are facing ongoing challenges, with hundreds of flights canceled or delayed, aircraft out of position, and crews scattered across Europe.

The chaos began late Thursday night when a fire broke out at the North Hyde electrical substation in Hayes, west London. This facility supplies power to Heathrow, one of the world’s busiest airports. The fire, now under investigation, knocked out critical systems and forced the cancellation of more than 1,300 flights on Friday, affecting an estimated 200,000 passengers.

By Saturday, operations had resumed and Heathrow declared itself “open and fully operational.” But the reality on the ground told a different story. British Airways, the airport’s largest airline, canceled nearly 80 more flights on Saturday. Other airlines have also struggled to return to normal schedules, with many planes, pilots, and cabin crews now stranded at airports they were never meant to be.

Sean Doyle, CEO of British Airways, called the fire “an unprecedented situation” and warned that the disruption would have a “substantial impact on our airline and customers for many days to come.”

The ripple effects have created a logistical nightmare. Aircraft are out of place, and the crews needed to operate them are bound by mandatory rest periods before they can fly again. This mismatch of people and planes has forced further cancellations and reshuffling of routes. Aviation experts say the domino effect could extend into the week ahead.

John Strickland, an aviation consultant, told the UK’s Press Association news agency, “All these long-haul aircraft—particularly BA’s—have ended up at airports they were never supposed to be at. If there are no crews there to pick them up, then airlines will struggle to get their aircraft moving again as normal.”

Heathrow has attempted to ease the strain by adding 50 extra takeoff and landing slots to accommodate up to 10,000 more passengers on Saturday. But for airlines still facing staffing and aircraft shortages, those extra slots offer little relief unless they can be filled.

While the airport’s runway lights and control tower systems remained functional thanks to backup power supplies, the wider electrical outage exposed a serious vulnerability in Heathrow’s infrastructure. The incident has sparked criticism from industry veterans and raised concerns about how a single substation failure could bring such a major airport to a standstill.

Willie Walsh, former head of British Airways and current Director General of IATA, called the outage a “clear planning failure” by Heathrow. Current airport CEO Thomas Woldbye acknowledged that while critical systems had backup power, they were never designed to run the entire airport. He added that the airport would be reviewing whether it needs a more robust standby power solution in the future.

National Grid, which owns and operates the affected substation, confirmed that power had been restored to all customers, including Heathrow. It also said steps were being taken to improve network resilience to avoid similar disruptions in the future.

Meanwhile, the investigation into the fire continues. While the Metropolitan Police’s counterterrorism command initially led the inquiry, they later confirmed there were no signs of foul play. The London Fire Brigade is now focusing on the substation’s electrical distribution systems as a possible cause.

The timing of the outage has only compounded the difficulties. With the travel season ramping up and airports already operating near capacity, the sudden blackout has placed additional strain on systems that were already stretched thin. Passengers across Europe and beyond have faced last-minute cancellations, rebookings, or overnight diversions to other cities.

For travelers hoping to pass through Heathrow in the coming days, patience may be necessary. Airlines continue to adjust flight schedules and reposition aircraft as quickly as regulations and staffing allow. Many passengers have taken to social media to express frustration, while others simply want to know when they’ll be able to fly.

The company launched its first B99 fueling station at its Decatur, Illinois location to mark National Biodiesel Day on March 18, 2025, reports Chemanalyst. News.

This initiative is the result of a partnership between Pilot, PepsiCo, and ADM. PepsiCo, which operates one of the largest private truck fleets in North America, and ADM, a global agricultural supply chain company, worked with Pilot to make this alternative fuel more accessible to long-haul truckers. The move is aimed at helping the transportation sector reduce carbon emissions, which has been a significant challenge.

B99 biodiesel is made from renewable sources like vegetable oils, animal fats, and recycled cooking grease. It produces fewer emissions than regular diesel while maintaining similar performance. By making this fuel available, Pilot is giving trucking companies an option to cut their environmental impact without making major changes to their existing vehicles.

A key part of the project is the involvement of Optimus Technologies, a company that develops technology to help diesel engines run on up to 100% biodiesel. Their system allows trucking companies to switch to B99 without needing expensive vehicle modifications.

Eric Fobes, Pilot’s Head of Renewables, said the company is committed to helping fleets transition to cleaner fuels. “We know sustainability is important to our customers, and we want to support their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Bringing B99 to our travel centres is a big step in that direction,” he said.

The initiative has also received support from organizations like the Iowa Soybean Association, Iowa Biodiesel Board, Illinois Soybean Association Checkoff Program, and the American Lung Association. Their involvement highlights the broader effort to make sustainable fuel a standard option in the trucking industry.

Para estimular o desenvolvimento de estudos sobre a aplicação do SAF no Estado, com o etanol como alternativa para o setor de aviação, o Sindicato das Indústrias do Açúcar e do Álcool de Pernambuco (Sindaçúcar-PE), com o auxílio de uma consultoria apropriada, iniciou um pré-projeto na área.

“O Estado de Pernambuco tem um potencial na área dos combustíveis renováveis limpo para aviação extremamente consistente. O objetivo é substituir o querosene de aviação por mecanismos da natureza do SAF que são os combustíveis limpos. No Brasil, isso pode vir de duas rotas principais: uma rota HEFA e uma rota ATJ, que é o querosene parafínico sintetizado por álcool, no caso o etanol”, afirmou o presidente do Sindaçúcar-PE, Renato Cunha.

Segundo Cunha, o Brasil tem quantidade suficiente de etanol para abastecer a demanda da aviação.

“O Brasil é autossuficiente no consumo de etanol, exporta etanol e terá etanol para abastecer essa necessidade dos combustíveis de aviação”, disse.

Ele ressaltou que, no Estado, o potencial de produção para fornecimento de etanol existe, o que pode ser um diferencial, com mais renda, empregos e tributos.

Diálogo

Para avançar nas pesquisas, o Sindaçúcar-PE está em diálogo com diferentes entes, como o Governo Federal, por meio dos ministérios de Portos e Aeroportos e Minas e Energia; o Governo do Estado, a partir da secretaria de Desenvolvimento Econômico; com a Aena Brasil; a Federação Nacional das Indústrias do Estado de Pernambuco (Fiepe); e o economista e sócio da Ceplan, Jorge Jatobá.

Na próxima semana, Renato Cunha se reúne com o secretário estadual de Desenvolvimento Econômico, Guilherme Cavalcanti. “Iremos procurar apoio para realizarmos estudos compartilhados com o Governo do Estado para que se lance em Pernambuco essa base do SAF para substituir o QAV dentro das rotas tecnológicas já aprovadas, como a ATJ”, explicou Renato Cunha.

Anteriormente, o Sindaçúcar-PE também realizou uma audiência com o ministro de Portos e Aeroportos, Silvio Costa Filho. No encontro, o ministro considerou fundamental unir a cadeia produtiva do etanol no projeto SAF, que integra a Lei do Combustível do Futuro (14.993/2024).

Outra reunião com o ministro, desta vez para entender as regras de certificação da Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (Anac), também está nos planos.

“Além do CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), que faz esse disciplinamento internacional, no Brasil já existe a resolução 496 da Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil (Anac) que verifica dados de emissão de CO2 relativos ao transporte aéreo internacional. A Anac é responsável por criar um plano de monitoramento dessas emissões e tem feito esse trabalho desde 2019”, destacou Renato.

Consumo

Em Pernambuco, as vendas de querosene de aviação, que será substituído pelo SAF, totalizaram, em 2024, mais de 300 milhões de litros, tornando o Estado o quarto maior consumidor do Brasil, ficando atrás apenas do Distrito Federal, Rio de Janeiro e São Paulo. No País, são quase 7 bilhões de litros consumidos.

“O Aeroporto dos Guararapes é um aeroporto moderno, com bons níveis de tecnologia, e faz vários voos internacionais. A gente sabe que o aeroporto tem um hub da Azul que tem sido um diferencial favorável desde fevereiro de 2026”, reiterou Renato Cunha.

Rick Whitaker invites decision-makers, investors, and practitioners to embrace this reimagined approach to foreign aid.
states Whitaker.","Regions across the globe are confronting post-conflict reconstruction needs born from prolonged instability and disruptive events. These needs manifest as demands to rebuild critical infrastructure, revitalize essential services, and ensure communities have the foundation to thrive even in challenging circumstances.

The United States finds itself at a critical juncture in its approach to foreign aid following this moment of recalibration. Significant structural changes highlight its dilemma, as the traditional role of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) is being reformed, with key functions now absorbed into the State Department.

Rick Whitaker, co-founder and managing partner of ViVA International, joins the conversation in this space. He possesses over three decades of operational and strategic experience, assuming leadership roles in major multinational corporations and hands-on projects in post-conflict and rapidly evolving regions. Whitaker's extensive experience at the policy level and in the field, spearheading fuel cell power plant initiatives, managing large-scale renewable energy and hydroelectric projects, and more informs his insights regarding reimagining how the US delivers infrastructure support overseas.

As a seasoned expert in international infrastructure development and institutional strengthening, Whitaker observes that the current global landscape presents immense reconstruction challenges and valuable opportunities. Outdated infrastructure and energy systems strain the capacity of local institutions to sustain growth and stability in many parts of the world.

Accompanying these challenges is the emergence of a consensus that traditional aid mechanisms require radical thinking. Whitaker stresses that this reimagining must move away from broad, unfocused spending and toward strategic, measurable investments in key sectors. This aligns with recent discussions and reports in policy and industry circles that advocate for an overhaul in how reconstruction projects are conceptualized, managed, and executed.

Given this context, Whitaker points to utilizing local talent and modernizing critical energy systems. He introduces a framework with a tripartite approach that emphasizes the role of the private sector, the indispensability of local partnerships, and the imperative of commercialization.

Whitaker argues that the future of effective foreign aid is in leveraging the expertise and efficiency of private enterprises to deliver specialized services through competitive contracts. This would ensure that projects are executed precisely and with accountability.

Similarly, building robust partnerships with local entities is needed. After all, these collaborations are essential for building capacity, generating employment, and ensuring that the community benefits from the reconstruction. The third principle focuses on commercial viability. What does this entail? It involves structuring projects in a way that clearly demonstrates return on investment for all stakeholders, such as public financiers, local organizations, and private investors.

Whitaker emphasizes that these elements converge around one non-negotiable foundation—the energy sector. ""Energy forms the backbone of any successful reconstruction initiative,"" he states. ""A modernized and resilient energy infrastructure—it doesn't matter whether through distributed generation, renewable energy integration, or modular systems—ensures other sectors can function, grow, and innovate.""

Whitaker's insights challenge conventional foreign aid paradigms. His framework that revolves around leveraging the strength of the private sector, bolstering local human capital, and prioritizing economic stability represents a unique view of how to utilize market dynamics to drive development.

""When I say we need to focus on energy infrastructure, I'm not just talking about power generation. I'm pointing to creating an ecosystem where efficient energy systems boost broader economic growth, support modern technology, and enable communities to become stronger and more resilient, even as they face adversity,"" Whitaker supplies.

Rick Whitaker invites decision-makers, investors, and practitioners to embrace this reimagined approach to foreign aid. He asserts that the US can set a new standard for international development by aligning public initiatives with the private sector's expertise and commitment to measurable outcomes. This can pave the way for the nation to deliver sustainable benefits to communities worldwide while strengthening the global economy, ""The ultimate goal is fostering peace and economic prosperity, country by country."" states Whitaker.",https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4588698/rick-whitaker.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 14:56:49.778482

But there’s a quieter, largely overlooked threat lurking above us — one that’s steadily impacting aircraft performance, operational efficiency and long-term sustainability.

This threat isn’t always visible. In fact, it’s often ignored until it disrupts visibility entirely or leads to unexpected maintenance issues. It’s not mechanical, or technological. It’s airborne dust.

Yes, airborne dust — tiny, mineral-rich particles lifted from deserts and drylands — is posing a growing risk to the global air cargo industry. As the total flight volumes are expected to hit over 40 million globally in 2025, this invisible adversary is increasingly degrading engine performance, shortening maintenance cycles, and undermining sustainability goals across some of the world’s busiest cargo routes.

While dust storms occasionally make headlines due to dramatic visuals and flight cancellations, the real issue lies in chronic exposure to fine dust particles. Numerous scientific research has confirmed what many aviation engineers and operators have long suspected: dust ingestion causes cumulative and costly damage to aircraft.

A global problem with local intensities

A 2024 study led by the University of Reading, supported by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), analysed 17 years of dust exposure data using CAMS reanalysis and NASA’s CALIPSO satellite. The study examined 10 major airports situated in regions with high dust activity, including Phoenix, Canary Islands, Marrakesh, Niamey, Dubai, Delhi, Beijing, Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Sydney.

Their findings were striking: aircraft engines routinely ingested up to 6.6 grams of dust per cycle, especially during takeoff, landing and holding phases. For a high-utilisation freighter operating 1,000 flight cycles in a dusty region, that equates to more than 10 kilograms of particulate matter funnelling through the engine. Even these seemingly small quantities can wreak havoc on high-performance turbofan engines over time.

Dust particles range from sub-micron to several hundred microns in size. The smaller particles can remain suspended in the atmosphere for days, travelling thousands of kilometres. These particles are not only abrasive but when exposed to high engine temperatures, can melt and resolidify, forming deposits that block nozzles, vents and cooling systems.

Invisible engine damage = Visible costs

Dust ingestion impacts nearly every part of the engine system:

Compressor blade erosion reduces aerodynamic efficiency, requiring more fuel to generate the same thrust.

Melted mineral buildup clogs cooling vents and fuel nozzles, increasing heat and wear.

Protective coatings corrode, accelerating the need for maintenance and part replacement.

These effects lead to higher fuel burn, increased emissions, shorter maintenance intervals, and ultimately, higher operational costs. For cargo airlines — whose profit margins hinge on load efficiency and tight schedules — this translates into a compounding threat to bottom-line profitability.

Even more concerning, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), dust and sand ingestion can reduce engine power and, in extreme cases, lead to complete engine failure. In addition, the infiltration of fine dust into avionics and cockpit instrumentation poses risks to electrical systems and sensors.

Holding patterns and hot zones

The vertical distribution of dust is also critical. The study found that aircraft are most vulnerable to dust ingestion during arrivals, particularly when flying in holding patterns at altitudes of 1–2 kilometres, where dust concentrations often peak.

Dust ingestion during arrivals was 24% higher than during departures.

In some cases, over 50% of dust exposure occurred while aircraft circled in holding patterns awaiting landing clearance.

This phase of flight, often overlooked in engine wear modelling, is now seen as a critical moment where operational changes can yield major sustainability gains.

Dust and sustainability: A clashing forecast

From an environmental perspective, the implications are concerning. Engine degradation from dust increases fuel consumption, which in turn drives up CO₂ and NOₓ emissions. As airlines invest in newer aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) among others to meet net-zero goals, the hidden drag from airborne particulates risks offsetting those gains.

Worse still, climate change may exacerbate the problem. Rising surface temperatures, changing wind patterns and desertification are contributing to more frequent and intense dust events. Satellite data and global models suggest dust activity could increase in coming decades, particularly in regions already prone to high particulate emissions.

According to the WMO, phenomena like haboobs—intense dust storms driven by convective downdrafts—can suddenly create zero-visibility conditions and expose engines to extreme loads of particulate matter. These localised events often escape broader weather models, making real-time monitoring even more essential.

Operational fixes: Simple changes, big gains

The good news? Practical solutions are available—and they don’t require expensive retrofitting or radical technology shifts.

The Reading-CAMS study suggests two mitigation strategies:

1. Night-time flight operations

Dust concentrations are significantly lower at night due to cooler temperatures and reduced convective activity. For example, at Dubai International, shifting landings to nighttime hours could cut dust ingestion by up to 41%.

2. Adjusted holding altitudes

By increasing the altitude of holding patterns, aircraft can avoid layers of peak dust. At Delhi, rising holding altitudes during the monsoon season reduced engine dust exposure by 44%.

Monitoring and forecasting: The next frontier

To make these adjustments work consistently, cargo airlines must adopt more data-driven operational planning. Integrating dust forecasts from CAMS, vertical profiles from ground-based lidar, and real-time satellite data (like CALIPSO and CATS) can help dispatchers, pilots, and ATC make smarter decisions.

Airport authorities in dust-prone regions could also invest in real-time air quality and dust layer monitoring, just as they currently do for wind shear or runway contamination.

Planning for a dustier future

The global air cargo sector is expanding rapidly, and with e-commerce, cold chain logistics, and pharmaceutical freight on the rise, the pressure for efficient, timely, and green operations will only grow. If the aviation industry continues to overlook the role of environmental particulates, it may find its climate gains and cost-control efforts eroded — literally and figuratively — by a cloud of dust.

Mitigating airborne dust exposure isn’t just about prolonging engine life. It’s about safeguarding sustainability pledges, ensuring reliable delivery, and keeping costs manageable in an increasingly volatile environment.

As cargo fleets crisscross dusty skies from Phoenix to Delhi, the industry must adapt with smarter flight paths, predictive planning and atmospheric awareness. What’s invisible to the eye today could become a visible cost tomorrow.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/03/22/80203-dubai-airport-dust-arabia-weather.jpg,N,,2025-03-22 11:57:29.945950

EgyptAir is pressing ahead with its modernisation and expansion efforts, aiming to boost its market share locally and compete with international carriers in Egypt. The national airline is set to receive its first Airbus A350 by the end of this year, as part of a deal for 10 aircraft. It is also working to introduce 18 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, with deliveries expected to be completed by 2026.

Beyond fleet expansion, EgyptAir is aligning with European Union aviation regulations by adapting to the REFUEL E directive and negotiating with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) providers. The airline has secured an offer from Sky NRG, backed by Microsoft, covering up to 70% of SAF costs.

Strengthening digital services, customer engagement

EgyptAir has upgraded its website and frequent flyer program while expanding its call center operations. Currently covering Saudi Arabia and the UAE, the service is set to extend to the United States, Canada, France, the UK, Kuwait, and Jordan to increase revenue from foreign currency sources.

The airline is also actively forming partnerships with major corporations to attract new customers and boost its market share amid growing competition in Egypt’s aviation sector.

A strategic expansion plan

EgyptAir’s long-term growth strategy, running until 2028, seeks to position Cairo International Airport as a key hub connecting Africa with the rest of the world. The airline plans to launch new routes across Europe, the Middle East, the Far East, North America, and Africa, targeting key tourism markets.

By 2028, EgyptAir aims to handle 22 million international passengers annually–double the 11 million recorded in the 2023/24 financial year. To achieve this, the airline is increasing its European destinations from 25 to 33, its Middle Eastern routes from 19 to 25, and its Asian destinations from 9 to 17. North American services will also expand from 4 to 9 destinations, while African routes will grow from 26 to 30. The airline’s fleet is expected to reach 97 aircraft.

Advancing maintenance, technical capabilities

EgyptAir’s maintenance division is expanding its aircraft servicing capacity through the construction of Hangar 9000, which will include a dedicated aircraft painting facility. The company is also upgrading its repair workshops, modernising tools and equipment, and expanding daily maintenance stations across Africa and the Middle East.

Investing in human capital is another priority, with intensive training programmes in line with international aviation standards. Engineers and technicians are being trained to service new aircraft models, such as the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, while recruitment efforts are underway to support the growing fleet.

Enhancing catering, cargo operations

EgyptAir’s catering services aim to produce 60,000 meals daily over the next three years to meet the airline’s expanding operations. The company is also working on infrastructure improvements, including new storage facilities and the renewal of equipment at its Cairo, Hurghada, and Sharm El Sheikh facilities.

Meanwhile, EgyptAir Cargo is operating 20 weekly freighter flights to European airports during peak agricultural export seasons. The company has also introduced competitive shipping rates to maximise Egypt’s export opportunities.

A fleet expansion plan is in motion, with two Airbus A330-200P2F freighters set to join operations, increasing daily cargo capacity from 740 to 1,180 tons. EgyptAir Cargo is also investing in digitalisation, implementing AI-driven customer service tools and upgrading cargo management systems to improve efficiency and streamline bookings and tracking.

As EgyptAir pushes forward with its modernisation strategy, the airline is looking to cement its position as a leading player in the region’s aviation industry, enhancing its global connectivity and service offerings.",https://egyptian-gazette.com/media/2025/03/1-11.webp,N,,2025-03-22 11:57:34.615108

And when asked what the business community needed to do to meet net zero targets, panelist Frans Calje OBE, the CEO of PD Ports, felt Teesside was in a great position.

He told delegates: “Change is going to come, so what’s going to happen? A reality check is inevitable but there’s a positive side for Teesside.

“If you understand the infrastructure, there’s no way on this green earth that you can replicate the requirement and the intensity of energy that we need – especially if you go into renewables – anywhere else than Teesside.

“Look at the north bank and south bank of the River Tees – the infrastructure is about two tunnels beneath the river. You can walk underneath the Tees from one end to the other.

“But by that very integrated nature and the landbank and skills we’ve got, it aligns Teesside as the only place in the UK you can do energy transition on an industrial scale.

“Things like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen, carbon capture – the government is going to spend £8bn on the carbon capture scheme, for example. Is it going to work?

“The Norwegians have been doing it for years. So, when you see that spin-off in terms of where energy transition is going to go and the work that’s forthcoming for SMEs,

“Teesside is going to be the energy hub of the UK and I think it’s incredibly exciting.”

He was also bullish about the Tees business region as a whole, adding: “The way the Tees Valley has continually bounced back I find incredibly fascinating.

“No matter how bad things get, there is always a sense of pride and belonging. The ability of Teesside to continually reinvent itself is inspiring.”

Elaine McLaine-Wood, managing partner of Punch Robson Solicitors, said she wanted the next 10 years to see Teesside “remain successful, continue to grow and have independence within the region.”

She added: “What I personally want to achieve is to have a legacy of an independent firm and brilliant people coming through.

“At the end of the day, we can all be in charge of our own destiny and it’s that wish that we can give to youngsters – that they can be owners and not necessarily just employees.”

Alluding to the major defence contracts his firm is currently working on, Wilton Engineering CEO Bill Scott OBE DL said: “We have a 10-year contract at the moment which involves a significant amount of work.

“Defence is really important for the country so it is allowing us to focus on our apprenticeships and our next leaders within the business.

“The next contract I’m currently negotiating would take us to 2060 – and when you get into it, building submarines is more difficult than building a spaceship, so you can imagine what goes in there.

“It covers literally everything Zoe (Middlesbrough College CEO and principal Zoe Lewis CBE DL) can do in her college.”

As well as more defence contracts, Zoe hoped that by 2035, the region would be celebrating a full Teesworks site, a thriving digital cluster, a health innovation hub and “huge changes in social media right across the country to protect our young people.”

She also urged employers to take on more apprentices so that the number who do goes from one in five to four in five.

She said: “That’s the future and how we will get our growth and development in our area is more investment in young people – by giving them that bit of experience they need when they come out of education.”

“Now that many tariffs that hit construction materials are in effect, with more measures pending, construction costs are likely to rise much more.” The producer price index for inputs to new nonresidential construction—a weighted average of all materials and certain services used in new construction—increased for the second month in a row, AGC reported.
A variety of materials, especially metals, contributed to the increase in the price index for inputs.
Association officials noted that materials prices are likely to continue increasing, especially as a variety of threatened tariffs go into effect.
“The irony is that the tariffs’ impacts on construction costs might just price some manufacturers out of their decision to expand or add plants in the U.S.,” AGC CEO Jeffrey Shoaf said.","The price of materials and services used in nonresidential construction rose 0.5% in February, following an increase of 0.7% in January, according to a recent analysis of government data by the Associated General Contractors of America.

Association officials noted that materials prices began increasing before most of the threatened new tariffs were put in place.

“It’s a bad sign that construction costs have been rising significantly even before most of the Trump administration’s tariffs have taken effect,” Ken Simonson, the association’s chief economist, said in a news release. “Now that many tariffs that hit construction materials are in effect, with more measures pending, construction costs are likely to rise much more.”

The producer price index for inputs to new nonresidential construction—a weighted average of all materials and certain services used in new construction—increased for the second month in a row, AGC reported. Meanwhile, the index for new nonresidential building construction—a measure of what contractors report they would charge to put up a specific set of buildings—dipped by 0.1% in February, following an increase of 0.3% in January. The fact that input costs are outstripping bid prices implies that contractors have not been able to pass along the cost increases enough to maintain profit margins, Simonson said.

A variety of materials, especially metals, contributed to the increase in the price index for inputs. The index for steel mill products jumped 2.7% in February. The index for copper and brass mill shapes rose by 1.8%, following a 1.3% gain in January. Aluminum mill shapes rose 1.0% in price for the month. In addition, the index for diesel fuel climbed 2.3% and the index for lumber and plywood rose 1.7%.

Prices used to calculate the indexes were collected around Feb. 11, Simonson noted. Since then, the administration has imposed new tariffs of 25% on steel and aluminum imports, 25% on many goods from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on imports from China. These tariffs are in addition to a 10% tariff on China that took effect on Feb. 4 and numerous tariffs already in effect. In addition, the administration has threatened to impose additional tariffs in early April and potentially steep fees on ships delivering cargo to U.S. ports.

Association officials noted that materials prices are likely to continue increasing, especially as a variety of threatened tariffs go into effect. They said this would make the cost of construction more expensive, forcing some manufacturers to rethink plans to establish or expand facilities within the United States, undermining the intent of many of the proposed tariffs.

“The irony is that the tariffs’ impacts on construction costs might just price some manufacturers out of their decision to expand or add plants in the U.S.,” AGC CEO Jeffrey Shoaf said. “That is why we urge the administration to quickly resolve the underlying disputes behind the tariffs.”","https://img.bulktransporter.com/files/base/ebm/bulktransporter/image/2025/03/67dd7dbc9a4fb64fd4dc3f18-adobestock_204126360.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-03-22 11:57:46.758340

The long-awaited Project Willow study, which itself cost £1.5m, sets out nine options for the future of the industrial cluster in central Scotland.

Hundreds of jobs are set to be lost this year when the oil refinery there closes – and the report has identified nine “feasible” proposals which could attract private investment.

These include plastic recycling, fermenting timber into bioethanol, and hydrogen production, and the Scottish and UK governments say these schemes could create 800 jobs by 2040.

This month, the Just Transition Commission warned it could take years to close the “jobs gap” left by the refinery’s closure.

A summary of the report says the nine projects “have the potential to significantly enhance low-carbon manufacturing across the UK and create a positive future for Grangemouth”.

It adds: “However, the report also underscores the challenges of this transformation as low-carbon fuels and chemicals remain more expensive to produce than fossil alternatives.

“This will require substantial capital investment from the private sector [£3.5bn capital expenditure] and development of new supply chains.”

‘No stone unturned’

Commenting on the report, UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “We committed to leaving no stone unturned in supporting an industrial future for Grangemouth delivering jobs and economic growth.

“This report and the £200m investment by the UK government demonstrates that commitment.”

And Scotland’s First Minister John Swinney, cited the Scottish government’s own £87m investment commitment, and said: “Grangemouth is home to over a century of industrial expertise and employs thousands of highly skilled workers, placing the site at a massive competitive advantage and creating a unique opportunity for investors.

“Everyone working at Grangemouth’s refinery – and in the wider industrial cluster – is a valued employee with skills that are key to Scotland’s economic and net zero future.”

One of the nine options is to use low-carbon hydrogen to produce methanol, which would be converted into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Union leaders have suggested this as a way forward which could save jobs, with Unite saying the plant could be converted “relatively easily” over a few years to produce SAF, which the report said could commence in 2035, needing up to 270 staff and some £2.1bn.

A spokesman for the refinery’s owners Petroineos said: “The publication of the first Project Willow report is a milestone event for Grangemouth that could mark the beginning of a transformation for the whole cluster and, in time, create many more jobs and growth opportunities across a variety of related industries in Scotland.

“We look forward to continuing to support both UK and Scottish Governments as they implement the recommended policy, regulatory and fiscal changes required to unlock the opportunities identified in our report.”

Airline startet neue Verbindungen ab Flughafen Frankfurt – zwei Metropolen als Ziel

Von: Erik Scharf

Condor fliegt vom Flughafen Frankfurt aus wieder Berlin und Hamburg an. Mit modernsten Fliegern soll dabei ordentlich Kraftstoff gespart werden.

Frankfurt – In nur einer Stunde von Frankfurt nach Berlin reisen: Die Condor City-Verbindung macht es möglich. Ab März bietet die Fluggesellschaft Flüge vom Flughafen Frankfurt zum Flughafen Berlin-Brandenburg (BER) sowie zum Flughafen Hamburg (HAM) an. Dabei setzt Condor auf die neuesten Flugzeugmodelle.

Condor bezeichnet in einer Pressemitteilung diese Entwicklung als ein kleines Stück Firmengeschichte. Nach langer Zeit bietet die Airline wieder Inlandsflüge innerhalb Deutschlands an. Mit den sogenannten City-Verbindungen verbindet das Unternehmen Frankfurt mit Berlin und Hamburg. Zudem hat Condor eine Erweiterung des Streckennetzes für den Sommer 2025 angekündigt.

Erste Flüge von Flughafen Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg gestartet

Bereits am 1. März startete der erste Linienflug seit Jahren von Frankfurt nach Berlin um 10.30 Uhr mit der Flugnummer DE409. Nur 15 Minuten später hob der Flug DE4179 nach Hamburg ab. Seit dem 2. März fliegt Condor zweimal täglich, morgens und abends, zwischen Frankfurt und den Städten Hamburg und Berlin.

„Mit unseren City-Verbindungen passen wir unseren Flugplan an die Bedürfnisse unserer Gäste an“, erklärt Peter Gerber, CEO von Condor. Berlin und Hamburg sind sowohl für private als auch geschäftliche Reisende attraktive Ziele. Die Flüge werden in einer Zwei-Klassen-Konfiguration angeboten: Economy und Business-Class.

Moderne Flugzeuge von Frankfurt nach Berlin und Hamburg sollen Treibstoff sparen

Condor setzt auf die neuesten Flugzeugtypen Airbus A320neo und A321neo, die mit modernsten Triebwerken von Pratt & Whitney ausgestattet sind. Diese Flugzeuge verbrauchen 20 Prozent weniger Treibstoff und werden mit Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) betrieben, einem nachhaltig hergestellten Treibstoff aus nichtfossilen Rohstoffen.

Die neuen Maschinen reduzieren laut Condor die CO₂-Emissionen um 20 Prozent und sind zudem 50 Prozent leiser. Der Kerosinverbrauch pro Passagier beträgt an Bord einer A320neo umgerechnet 1,9 Liter auf 100 Kilometern.

Matin Sarfraz reports 🗳️ There’s a new prime minister — but we’re already on our way to a new, new prime minister.","If the hints are correct, tomorrow Prime Minister Mark Carney will call an election, sending voters to the polls as early as April 28. Media outlets are already in high gear, making coverage plans and budgeting for the significant related costs. This time, the price tag will be lower; the Conservatives announced this week that media are not welcome on Pierre Poilievre’s campaign voyage.

It’s the first time in recent memory that one of Canada’s major parties has banned journalists from travelling with the leader on the campaign bus and flights. And why?

The initial reason given by Conservative campaign director Jenni Byrne was because travel costs have escalated and digital and remote access to public events have improved so much that ample coverage is available that way. Let’s dig into this a bit.

Although it may be true that the federal parties partially subsidize campaign travel costs for the media, having been on the budgeting side of the equation, I can tell you the outlets that spring to send reporters on the leaders’ buses and planes pay plenty. So much so, that many outlets have now opted out. They are forced to cover the campaign remotely, where their questions can be easily ignored, and rely on wire services for live campaign coverage.

It would be interesting to know exactly how much opening the doors to media who can afford it would cost the party. Likely, not much.

And given Poilievre’s massive fundraising success, you have to question why they couldn’t spend just a little bit of their war chest to provide voters with insight that comes from access for journalists and their pesky questions.

When pressed, Poilievre qualified Byrne’s excuse, saying he would prefer to give opportunities for local media outlets to ask questions during the campaign. Sounds good. But the reality is the number of local media outlets has shrunk so precipitously that in some places, Poilievre might not face reporters at all. A new study by the Centre for Canadian Policy Alternatives has found 2.5 million Canadians are now without a local news outlet.

And being able to make election pronouncements without having to field questions would suit Poilievre just fine. There’s a bigger truth here. Poilievre has a decidedly testy, if not combative, relationship with journalists. He is quick to anger when faced with questions he doesn’t like, and he has used his skill as a bare-knuckled Parliamentary debater to belittle reporters who annoy him.

He holds press conferences where questions are kept to a minimum and only occasionally grants one-on-one interviews with friendly right-wing commentators like Jordan Peterson and former National Post columnist Sabrina Maddeaux, who became so enamoured with the Tory agenda she tried to run for the party in the upcoming election.

This relationship with the press extends to policy priorities, too. One of his primary campaign promises is to defund the CBC. He has also mused about extending federal journalism funding to far-right outlets like Rebel Media, which was denied in the past for failing to provide enough original content.

Now, all politicians have their testy moments. Newly-minted Prime Minister Mark Carney bristled at questions over his financial assets, accusing the media of assuming “ill will” on his part. There will no doubt be more moments like this when the honeymoon period that has him rising in the polls starts to wane. We are all human.

But there seems to be a fundamental difference in personality type between the leaders. Poilievre boasts about his aggressive nature, pitching it as a selling point to deal with the current trade war started by U.S. President Donald Trump, a politician who also loathes mainstream media and is as nasty as they come.

Carney seems determined to rise above the muck. He seems, from the outside, a decent person, confident in his ability to take on adversaries by demanding respect and extending that same courtesy to others. No surprise then, that his campaign is open to the media.

Canadians will soon be asked to choose which political party and leader they think is best suited to guide the country through these troubled times. Factual, reliable information will be crucial for voters, business leaders and local governments facing difficult decisions.

There are hugely troubling signs for press freedom south of the border where Trump has called journalists “monsters,” and “horrible, horrible, dishonest people” and threatened to go after media he dislikes with the power of the government. Some of the nation’s most respected newspapers are beginning to self-censor, causing respected life-long journalists to resign in protest.

One has to wonder what would play out here under a government run by Poilievre, who struggles to contain his contempt for the media. Booting journalists off the campaign bus seems like only the first step.

🎈 The consumer carbon tax is dead. Why aren’t the Conservatives celebrating? After all, “axe the tax” has been the central slogan of Conservative Party Leader Pierre Poilievre’s pitch to Canadians. But as Max Fawcett explains, that’s the problem — Poilievre wanted to be the one to swing the axe, and with new Prime Minister Mark Carney having beaten him to it, the Conservatives have lost a major plank of their platform. With an election coming as early as Sunday, the move has dealt yet another serious blow to what once seemed an inevitable Tory win. The Conservatives have run headlong into a political trap.

Max Fawcett writes.

Quote of the week

“We shouldn’t be subsidizing fossil fuels at a time when we’re facing an affordability crisis and a climate emergency.” — Mike Schreiner, leader of Ontario's Green Party and MPP for Guelph, regarding the “free ride” gas companies get in Ontario municipalities.

🚧 The maze of gas pipelines Enbridge owns beneath the streets, buildings and parks of Guelph, Ontario, are free of charge to the gas giant. Elsewhere, those rights are worth millions to municipalities, but not in Ontario — thanks to provincial legislation and an agreement the city signed 20 years ago. Now, with that agreement up for renewal, the city is trying to make sure it doesn’t give away those rights for free again. The city wants a provision stating that if the legislation ever changes, Guelph won’t have to wait two decades to start collecting. Toronto and Ottawa are thinking along the same lines.

🗳️ There’s a new prime minister — but we’re already on our way to a new, new prime minister. An election is expected to be called on Sunday, just before the House was set to begin its spring session. It will be the next test for newly sworn-in Prime Minister Mark Carney, who does not yet have a seat of his own in Parliament, and a test for the Liberal Party’s unprecedented rise in the polls against the Conservatives’ huge war chest. The vote is expected to take place as early as April 28, but there’s wiggle room.

Nick Murray reports

🪨 One mine’s trash could be all of our treasure. In decades past, miners in search of one metal may not have looked to extract other metals that exist in those same rocks. It may not have been worth the cost and effort — until now. With critical minerals increasingly in demand, there’s a new push to re-mine waste rock piles for what else can be extracted from them, and the benefits go beyond the minerals themselves. Removing waste rock can mitigate the dangerous impacts of acid rock drainage and other nasty environmental legacies.

Darius Snieckus reports.

✈️Emissions from flying are rising sharply. And most of the carbon being burned by planes is used to fly the wealthiest one per cent of people on the planet to far-flung destinations. The airline industry and governments answer is to promote “sustainable aviation fuel” produced from non-fossil fuel products, such as municipal waste, wood scraps or waste grease and oil, among others. Yet, because it is more expensive, airlines are buying only tiny amounts. A shame because their customers could probably afford to pay a little more to help reduce carbon emissions from travel.

Through philanthropic investment, we are accelerating the transition to a sustainable aviation sector that spares the climate and human health.

The challenge

If the aviation sector were a country, it would rank among the top 10 global emitters of greenhouse gasses, surpassing Brazil, Mexico, and the UK. Burning fossil jet fuel not only emits carbon dioxide but also releases byproducts including nitrogen oxides, water vapor, soot, and aerosols. At cruising altitude, these byproducts react with the atmosphere, amplifying their contributions to global warming.

Beyond its staggering climate impact, the aviation industry poses severe public health risks, disproportionately affecting communities of color and lower-income groups. Air pollution from air travel causes 16,000 premature deaths annually and is directly linked to heart disease, asthma, and elevated blood lead levels. For decades, industry workers, airport-adjacent communities, and military personnel have borne the brunt of harmful exhaust exposure. Decarbonizing the aviation industry is critical to safeguarding these communities.

We cannot afford to delay. As flight demand soars, unchecked fossil fuel emissions from aviation will intensify the climate crisis. Despite the urgent need, philanthropic funding for addressing aviation’s impact has been minimal. Now is the time to invest in transformative action that changes the trajectory of this high-emitting sector.

The opportunity

The aviation sector is at a critical turning point, and we have a unique opportunity to accelerate its transformation toward a net-zero future. To most effectively do so, we have gathered a community of aligned funders and are implementing a shared comprehensive philanthropic strategy for aviation. By bringing together climate philanthropy, airline industry leaders, civic society, and the scientific community, we are building a powerful coalition to achieve our shared goal of decarbonizing aviation.

One of the most promising pathways to net-zero aviation is the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which could deliver 65 percent of the CO2 reductions needed for the sector. Among SAF options, e-SAF stands out as the most viable long-term solution. Unlike biofuels, eSAF requires minimal land use and significantly reduces the public health burden on airport workers and frontline communities. We partner closely with our Carbon Dioxide Removal Program to explore the opportunity to use direct air capture technology to remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere and combine it with green hydrogen to create e-SAF that can be used in jet engines today. ClimateWorks has played a pivotal role in helping advance and promote the scaling of e-SAF adoption in Europe and the United States, laying the groundwork for global implementation

Equally critical is transforming how people engage with the aviation sector. Just 1% of the global population is responsible for 50% of emissions from flying, presenting a pivotal opportunity to drive significant pollution reductions. By shifting the behavior of this small but influential group, we can create a disproportionately large impact in reducing aviation emissions, protecting both vulnerable communities and the planet. At the same time, we must prioritize the voices and needs of frontline communities disproportionately impacted by aviation emissions. We are committed to co-creating strategies alongside these communities to reduce air pollution, eliminate air toxics, and scale SAF adoption. By combining behavioral change with equitable climate solutions, we can unlock a sustainable and inclusive future for aviation.

Our approach

There is no silver bullet to solve aviation’s climate and pollution impacts, rather a combination of solutions will be required. We focus on the decarbonization levers with the highest potential to get the sector to net zero:

Scaling sustainable aviation fuel

We are driving the transition to low-carbon aviation by scaling the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Through policy wins in Europe, the U.S., and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), we’ve helped lay the foundation for global change. Our focus is on expanding SAF use in the U.S., ensuring ethical production that protects forests and farmland, and centering frontline communities.

Reducing demand for air travel

We aim to cut aviation emissions by raising awareness of flying’s climate impact, pushing industry and policymakers to act, promoting alternative modes of transport, and targeting high-emission groups such as corporate travelers and frequent flyers.

Exploring emerging opportunities

In addition to these two core focus areas, we see potential in addressing the non-CO<sub>2</sub> impacts of aviation, specifically contrail mitigation which could have near-term success without requiring drastic sectoral change. Current estimates are that 3% of contrails cause 80% of the warming, meaning interventions can be targeted based on geography. Through supporting policy intervention, we can clean up contrail hotspots, like the North Atlantic, by adjusting flight paths.

Impact

These are the outcomes we’re working to achieve:

Aviation transitions to sustainable fuel

By 2030, 10% of global aviation fuel is sustainable, with the industry on track to reach 100% by 2050. Airlines now operate on clean, low-carbon alternative fuels, setting a new standard for decarbonization.

Public awareness drives change

Corporate travelers, frequent flyers, and private jet users now widely understand the climate impact of flying. This awareness has reduced demand, creating pressure on the industry and policymakers to accelerate transformative action.

Short-haul flights are replaced by alternative modes of transport

In Europe, short-haul flights have been largely replaced by efficient trains, buses, and video conferencing. These alternatives are widely accessible, publicly embraced, and recognized as climate-smart solutions to aviation’s outsized climate impact.

Sustainable fuels scaled without harm

Biofuels are no longer a default solution, as the industry recognizes their risks to forests, farmland, and Indigenous communities. E-fuels created from excess carbon dioxide combined with green hydrogen comprise the majority of the sustainable aviation fuel supply, avoiding deforestation and displacement. E-fuels in this way scale methods to remove carbon dioxide from the air while displacing oil.

Where we work

To date, we have primarily supported action in Europe, the United States, and at the UN agency for aviation, the ICAO. However, as action on aviation expands globally, we are carefully building geographically relevant strategies in Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa.
