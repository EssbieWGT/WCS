This move aims to reduce carbon emissions and support the country’s broader environmental goals, paving the way for greener travel practices while aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. By adopting this sustainable fuel blend, Thailand is positioning itself at the forefront of the aviation industry’s push for more eco-friendly travel solutions.

Thailand is making significant strides toward sustainable aviation, with the Department of Energy Business set to introduce new standards for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and require an initial blend of SAF in jet fuel. These measures are part of Thailand’s broader efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel and contribute to a more sustainable future for aviation.

The new regulations classify Jet A-1 fuel specifications and quality requirements at both production and sales points into three categories: (1) conventional Jet A-1, (2) co-hydroprocessed fuel, and (3) conventional Jet A-1 blended with neat SAF. This classification allows for a smoother transition into the adoption of SAF in the aviation sector while providing clear guidelines for fuel producers and airlines to follow.

Additionally, the Department of Energy Business has set specific guidelines for SAF itself, requiring that feedstocks and production methods comply with ASTM D7566 standards. The initial phase of SAF production in Thailand will focus on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which is a well-established method for producing sustainable fuel from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil. These new standards are scheduled to take effect from January 1, 2026.

The push for SAF adoption in Thailand aligns with similar efforts globally. In Europe, the European Union has already imposed SAF blending requirements for flights departing EU airports, mandating a 2% SAF blend starting in 2025. This regulatory pressure is driving the aviation industry toward greener alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, and Thailand is positioning itself to be a part of this global shift.

Currently, Thailand has several SAF production projects underway, with notable progress being made in the development of SAF plants. One such project is the construction of a SAF plant that will use HEFA technology, with used cooking oil as its primary feedstock. The plant is expected to produce 1 million litres of SAF per day, equivalent to approximately 6,289 barrels per day. Commercial operations at this plant are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2026. This will mark a significant step forward in Thailand’s capacity to produce sustainable aviation fuel locally, reducing reliance on imported fuel.

Another SAF production project in Thailand involves a co-processing HEFA facility, which is already in operation. This plant is currently producing SAF at an initial capacity of 16,438 litres per day, or about 103 barrels per day. This project highlights the growing interest and investment in SAF production within the country, and it demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace new technologies to meet future fuel demands sustainably.

Thailand’s SAF development roadmap is divided into four phases, each aligned with the country’s feedstock availability and technological readiness. In the first phase, set to begin in 2026, the required SAF blend will start at 1%, primarily using HEFA technology. This initial phase will help stabilize the SAF supply chain and ensure that production systems are adequately developed to meet future demand.

Phase two, which spans from 2027 to 2029, will gradually increase the SAF blend to 1–2%. This phase will still rely primarily on HEFA technology as Thailand continues to build the necessary infrastructure to support larger-scale SAF production. The goal during this phase is to stabilize the supply chain further and ensure that there is enough production capacity to meet domestic aviation needs.

The third phase, from 2030 to 2032, will introduce the combination of HEFA and Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) technologies to support a 3–5% SAF blend. This will allow for greater flexibility in production methods and expand the types of feedstocks available for SAF production. The final phase, from 2033 onwards, will target a 5–8% blend, with installed production capacity projected to increase significantly, from 0.28 million litres per day in 2026 to 2.22 million litres per day by 2037.

To ensure the successful implementation of SAF in Thailand’s aviation sector, the government plans to establish a SAF working group in 2026. This group will bring together public and private sector representatives from both the demand and supply sides to develop appropriate targets, policies, and strategies. The working group will play a key role in coordinating efforts and ensuring that Thailand’s SAF roadmap is executed effectively and efficiently.

The introduction of SAF services will begin at major airports in Thailand, including key international hubs, which are already connected to fuel pipeline systems. These connections will help reduce carbon emissions from fuel transport, further enhancing the sustainability of Thailand’s aviation sector.

Initially, the use of SAF will be voluntary, with stakeholders signing memorandums of understanding to demonstrate their commitment to producing and using SAF. These agreements will pave the way for future mandatory requirements in later phases, once the industry is better equipped to meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

Starting January 2026, Thailand’s aviation sector will incorporate a one percent blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into jet fuel, marking a key step towards reducing carbon emissions and advancing sustainable travel practices.

Thailand’s move towards sustainable aviation, driven by the introduction of SAF standards and production projects, marks an important milestone in the country’s efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. The phased approach to SAF adoption ensures that Thailand can gradually build the necessary infrastructure and production capacity to meet future demand. With government support, strategic partnerships, and continued investment in clean energy technologies, Thailand is well on its way to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation in Southeast Asia.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airline-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:02.060786

As the aviation industry continues to recover, and faces mounting pressure to deliver on climate goals while managing growing demand, 2026 is poised to be a defining year for the sector’s sustainability and digital transformation. Success will be measured by safer airports, shorter queues, greener operations and a seamless traveller experience. At the heart of this progress lies rapid technological adoption across sustainability, digitalisation, security and air traffic management.

The accelerated shift towards airport decarbonisation technologies

Airports are evolving from isolated operators to collaborative ecosystems united by a shared mission: decarbonisation. In 2026, technology will be critical to turning climate pledges into measurable outcomes.

Many airports are already pursuing energy self-sufficiency through large-scale renewable projects. Istanbul and Athens International Airports, for example, are approaching full electricity independence thanks to vast solar farms integrated into their operations. Similar projects are proliferating across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, enabling airports to reduce emissions and energy costs simultaneously.

Microgrids that integrate solar technology, battery storage and advanced inverters are transforming airports into energy hubs capable of maintaining resilience during power disruptions. Predictive energy management systems, powered by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and artificial intelligence (AI), allow terminals to optimise energy use in real time. London City Airport, for instance, modernised its electrical infrastructure to connect solar panels, storage and smart controls into one unified network. The airport was able to double its electricity capacity.

On the ground, electrification continues to accelerate. Electric ground support equipment and vehicles are now standard at many major airports, with operators investing in charging infrastructure to enable fully zero emission airside operations. At the same time, airports are preparing for a new fuel ecosystem — one built around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and e-fuels. Copenhagen Airport, for example, is part of a consortium developing hydrogen refuelling capabilities to support the next generation of low carbon aircraft.

Digital identity and biometrics for seamless travel

With global air travel projected to reach 18.9 billion passengers by 2047, airports are under immense pressure to deliver frictionless, secure passenger journeys. Digital identity and biometric technologies are emerging as key enablers of this transformation.

IATA’s One ID initiative is advancing the vision of a paperless journey where passengers control their own digital identity from check-in to boarding. Several leading airports, including Singapore Changi, Heathrow and Atlanta are deploying biometric boarding and facial recognition to streamline processing times while maintaining stringent security standards. In the United States, the Transportation Security Administration has expanded its Digital ID programme to more than 250 airports, allowing travellers to use mobile driver’s licences for identity verification. Apple has recently announced that it will soon introduce a feature to their Apple Wallet allowing U.S. users to create a digital ID using their passport which can then be used at select TSA checkpoints for domestic travel.

According to SITA’s 2024 Air Transport IT Insights report, nearly half of airports plan to implement biometric identity management systems by the end of 2026. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is also developing the Digital Travel Credential (DTC), which will allow passengers to verify their identity without physical passports or boarding passes.

Today biometric travel tokens are only valid for a passenger’s journey through one airport. A key focus for the industry will be pushing this further so that the biometric token can take a passenger across borders and to multiple airports. The utopian world would be one where one single digital identity is recognised globally and allows the passenger control over that identity.

Together, these developments signal a shift toward harmonised, risk-based and seamless security that enhances both efficiency and passenger trust.

Smartphones and the digital evolution of airport retail

Beyond the terminal gates, smartphones are accelerating the evolution of airport retail. With online shopping available 24 hours a day, passengers now expect the same digital convenience in travel environments. Airports and concessionaires are responding by integrating mobile commerce into the passenger journey, allowing travellers to pre-order duty-free goods, book dining slots, or access personalised offers via airport apps. Changi Airport has even started giving instant benefits to passengers whose flight departure is delayed by three hours or more through their FlightSaver Assurance feature on the Changi App. Changi App is the first airport app globally to offer both real-time overseas airport information and an opt-in flight delay assurance programme.

This shift is transforming the airport experience and retail from a static, physical experience into a dynamic, data-driven ecosystem. Smart phones provide airports with valuable insights into passenger behaviour and dwell times, enabling tailored retail strategies and smarter use of space. For travellers, it means greater choice, flexibility and time efficiency, a critical differentiator as airports compete to enhance the overall passenger experience.

Intelligent automation in air traffic management

Digitalisation is revolutionising how skies are managed, marking a shift from traditional automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. AI is already supporting air traffic controllers through decision-support tools that analyse real-time data on weather, traffic density and airspace conditions. These technologies enable smarter, data-driven decisions that improve safety and reduce delays.

The use of digital twins — virtual replicas of airport and airspace operations — is also expanding. They allow airports and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to run “what-if” testing and to optimise scenarios without disrupting live traffic. Meanwhile, virtual towers and satellite surveillance are extending the reach of air traffic management (ATM) services, particularly in remote or complex airspace.

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), encompassing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, is adding a new layer to this transformation. As cities prepare for urban air mobility, technologies such as trajectory management, AI-based conflict detection, and real-time data fusion will become essential. For airports, these innovations are laying the groundwork for a seamlessly connected airspace ecosystem.

Digitalisation and AI in air cargo logistics

The global rise in e-commerce, which now represents roughly one-fifth of all air cargo volumes worldwide, is driving a parallel transformation in cargo logistics. As the sector prepares for sustained growth, airports are becoming central to creating interoperable, data-rich ecosystems that connect airlines, handlers and freight forwarders.

AI and advanced analytics are being deployed to predict cargo flows, optimise capacity and reduce fuel consumption. IATA’s ONE Record standard is promoting end-to-end data exchange, enabling greater transparency and interoperability across the supply chain. Blockchain technologies are also being tested to improve traceability and trust between logistics partners.

Automation is extending beyond warehouses to last-mile delivery, with drones and electric vehicles increasingly used to enhance efficiency and sustainability. However, with this increased connectivity comes greater vulnerability. Cyber-security has become a critical investment area, as airports seek to safeguard cargo tracking systems and operational data from ever evolving digital threats.

A connected, sustainable future

The technologies shaping airport operations in 2026 share a common goal: to make aviation more sustainable, efficient and resilient. From AI-driven air traffic management to digital identity and renewable energy ecosystems, airports are redefining their role as intelligent, integrated transport hubs.

As airports around the world look ahead, technology will no longer be an optional enhancement but the foundation for competitiveness and sustainability. Those that act decisively —embedding innovation into their infrastructure, operations and culture— will set the pace for the next era of global air travel.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2291135381.png,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:10.536292

In 2024, Changi Airport handled 67.7 million passengers.
Paya Lebar Airport’s capacity was then only eight million a year, whereas Changi Airport already handles around 70 million passengers yearly.

This means passenger numbers at the airport reached an all-time high in 2025, eclipsing the previous record of 68.3 million passengers in 2019, before the pandemic grounded planes and ravaged air travel.

In 2024, Changi Airport handled 67.7 million passengers.

The strong post-pandemic recovery for global aviation shows the Government made the right decision to go ahead with plans to build Changi Airport Terminal 5, paused during the pandemic, Mr Siow said at the launch of a new exhibition on the future mega terminal.

The acting minister added that operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) will launch the tender for T5’s superstructure – the section of the terminal built above ground – in the next few weeks.

Noting that the decision to build T5 was one of confidence in Singapore’s future and conviction in the nation’s ability to secure its place in a competitive world, he said this confidence was shaken when global aviation demand collapsed during the pandemic.

“ For a moment, we were not sure what the future of aviation would hold. And we reconsidered deeply whether to continue with T5 ,” he said.

But the Government decided to go ahead, added Mr Siow, and the future now looks bright – global air traffic is expected to double by 2050, with the Asia-Pacific region leading this growth.

With T5 representing the future of aviation for Singapore, it has been designed to be technology-intensive, empowered by automation and artificial intelligence (AI), he said.

For example, autonomous vehicles and robotics are already being tested for labour-intensive processes, such as baggage and cargo handling.

Mr Siow added that AI can be used to improve flight planning and passenger services, as well as respond quickly to disruptions to airport operations, such as changing weather conditions.

The new mega terminal – scheduled to open in the mid-2030s – will show the way for aviation sustainability, as it will promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel and be fully electrified, he said.

It has been designed to put the customer first, said Mr Siow, with ideas from passengers, airlines and airport tenants being incorporated into the layout of lounges and the design of retail spaces.

For instance, passengers will be able to have seamless journeys from immigration to boarding, with personalised recommendations for dining, retail and transit along the way.

Mr Siow noted that although T5 is a bigger airport terminal, its design reduces walking time, and the result is that transit passengers can make their connections more quickly.

Passengers are not the only group who will stand to gain.

More new jobs will be available in the aviation sector in the fields of data science, systems operations and sustainability – areas that will appeal to young Singaporeans, he said.

“It is imperative that the aerospace or aviation sector continues to attract its share of talent and that we work closely with the institutes of higher learning to make sure that the skills of our workforce remain relevant and future-ready,” added Mr Siow.

The

T5 In The Making exhibition

, which will be held at Terminal 3’s arrival hall from Jan 6 to March , will bring the story of Changi Airport and Singapore to life, said Mr Siow.

Organised by the Ministry of Transport, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and CAG, the exhibition will give visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the vision, planning and design of the terminal.

Recounting how the nation’s founding leaders decided to move the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi in 1981 , Mr Siow said no expansion of Paya Lebar Airport could have met the needs of international air traffic.

Paya Lebar Airport’s capacity was then only eight million a year, whereas Changi Airport already handles around 70 million passengers yearly.

T5 will raise Changi Airport’s passenger capacity by more than 55 per cent each year, from the current 90 million to 140 million.

Mr Siow said that over the decades, Changi Airport has fulfilled its potential and gone beyond that.

With the addition of new terminals, refurbishment of existing ones and building of retail and entertainment complex Jewel Changi Airport, he has “no doubt that the world is watching to see what T5 represents for the future of aviation”.

At a media tour of the exhibition on Jan 2, Mr Ong Chee Chiau, managing director of Changi East at CAG, told reporters that the airport operator will call tenders for the construction of the main T5 building “over the next year or so”.

He added that the operator is in the midst of calling tenders for the terminal’s baggage-handling system and automated people-mover system.

In 2024, Changi Airport handled 67.7 million passengers.

The strong post-pandemic recovery for global aviation shows the government made the right decision to go ahead with plans to build Terminal 5, which were paused during the pandemic, Siow said at the launch of a new exhibition on the future mega terminal.

He added that operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) will launch the tender for T5’s superstructure – the section of the terminal built above ground – in the next few weeks.

Noting that the decision to build T5 was one of confidence in Singapore’s future and conviction in the nation’s ability to secure its place in a competitive world, he said this confidence was shaken when global aviation demand collapsed during the pandemic.

“For a moment, we were not sure what the future of aviation would hold. And we reconsidered deeply whether to continue with T5,” he said.

But the government decided to go ahead, added Siow, and the future now looks bright – global air traffic is expected to double by 2050, with the Asia-Pacific region leading this growth.

With T5 representing the future of aviation for Singapore, it has been designed to be technology-intensive, empowered by automation and artificial intelligence (AI), he said.

For example, autonomous vehicles and robotics are already being tested for labour-intensive processes such as baggage and cargo handling.

Siow added that AI can be used to improve flight planning and passenger services, as well as respond quickly to disruptions to airport operations, such as changing weather conditions.

Scarti di pomodoro una risorsa preziosa I pomodori sono il secondo ortaggio più consumato al mondo dopo le patate.
Per la professoressa Kienberger: ""L’obiettivo è produrre carburante per aviazione sostenibile a partire dagli scarti di pomodoro a un prezzo di vendita competitivo.","Scarti del pomodoro per alimentare gli aerei, grazie ad un processo tecnologico innovativo. Si chiama UE ToFuel, il progetto di ricerca europeo con l’obiettivo di sviluppare una bioraffineria capace di sfruttare integralmente i residui di pomodoro in carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione. Nonché in fertilizzanti, mangimi per animali e olio da cucina.

Il programma è coordinato dall’Università Tecnica di Graz (TU Graz) in Austria e punta a un processo privo di rifiuti e climaticamente neutro, che sia anche economicamente competitivo e che fornisca quindi un importante contributo alla decarbonizzazione del trasporto aereo. In pratica gli scarti alimentari possono essere trasformati in carburante sostenibile per l’aviazione (noto anche come carburante SAF, dall’inglese Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Scarti di pomodoro una risorsa preziosa

I pomodori sono il secondo ortaggio più consumato al mondo dopo le patate. L'Ue è il terzo produttore con circa 17 megatonnellate di pomodori raccolti. Tuttavia, la produzione di pomodori produce grandi quantità di biomassa residua: materiale vegetale come fiori, foglie e steli, bucce, semi e pomodori di qualità inadeguata. La maggior parte di questi residui viene incenerita come rifiuto agricolo o smaltita a costi elevati.

Allo stesso tempo, l'obiettivo della neutralità climatica europea e la conseguente riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 nel settore dell'aviazione dipendono in larga misura dalla produzione di carburanti per l'aviazione (SAF) competitivi e sostenibili da materie prime rinnovabili. ""Secondo le stime, circa il 3% del fabbisogno di carburanti sostenibili per l'aviazione in Europa entro il 2030 potrebbe essere coperto dalla quantità di polpa di pomodoro prodotta in tutta l'UE, ovvero dai residui della lavorazione del pomodoro"", spiega alla stampa la responsabile del progetto Marlene Kienberger dell'Istituto di ingegneria chimica e tecnologia ambientale della TU Graz, in Austria.

Come funziona il processo di trasformazione

Per trasformare gli scarti di pomodoro in un combustibile di alta qualità, la biomassa deve essere prima trattata in modo che i microrganismi possano utilizzarla in modo efficiente. Il progetto ToFuel sta studiando due innovative tecnologie di frazionamento. Durante l'estrusione, la biomassa viene trattata sotto calore e pressione e poi scomposta nei suoi componenti cellulari mediante un brusco calo di pressione. Questo crea una biomassa digerita in modo ottimale per il successivo processo di fermentazione, in cui i microrganismi producono lipidi che vengono poi trasformati in carburante per aviazione.Nella seconda tecnologia di frazionamento, la liquefazione idrotermale, la biomassa viene convertita in bioolio e biochar ad alta pressione e ad alte temperature. Prima che il bio-olio estratto possa essere raffinato in carburante per aviazione, deve essere purificato principalmente dagli ioni interferenti contenenti azoto. Questi ioni indesiderati avrebbero altrimenti un impatto negativo sulla successiva conversione in un carburante per aviazione sostenibile.

I corrispondenti processi di frazionamento, biotecnologici e di purificazione vengono sviluppati dal Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) di Lisbona, dalla TU Graz e dall'Università di Zagabria in stretta collaborazione.

I lipidi e il bio-olio vengono poi convertiti in un carburante che soddisfa gli standard qualitativi internazionali per il carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione utilizzando il processo HEFA presso l'Università di Leoben. HEFA sta per ""esteri idrogenati e acidi grassi"" ed è un processo per la produzione di carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione da grassi e oli vegetali, animali o riciclati. I processi sviluppati nell'ambito del progetto vengono gradualmente portati su scala preindustriale e ampiamente testati. Per la professoressa Kienberger: ""L’obiettivo è produrre carburante per aviazione sostenibile a partire dagli scarti di pomodoro a un prezzo di vendita competitivo. In definitiva, i carburanti per aviazione sostenibili devono semplicemente essere economicamente sostenibili. In caso contrario non avrebbero molto senso"". Il team di progetto sta inoltre analizzando l'impatto ecologico, economico e sociale di queste tecnologie, visto che l'utilizzo degli scarti di pomodoro crea anche nuove fonti di reddito per le aziende di trasformazione alimentare.

Il progetto europeo

La data di inizio ufficiale del progetto ""ToFuel - An integrated Biorefinery for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production from Tomato Residues"" è il 1° gennaio 2026. Un totale di 11 partner, provenienti da 7 Paesi europei, parteciperà al progetto. Oltre alla TU Graz, sono coinvolti l'istituto di ricerca portoghese LNEG, l'Università di Zagabria, il Politecnico di Vienna, il Politecnico di Lappeenranta in Finlandia, l'Università di Leoben e la Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. I partner industriali Mutti e Podravka forniranno i residui di pomodoro e contribuiranno ad aggiungere valore grazie alla loro importante esperienza nella lavorazione di materie prime di origine vegetale.

La ricerca sarà accompagnata da una strategia completa di commercializzazione e pubblicazione, che sarà sviluppata dai partner di progetto ESEIA ed EEIP. Nell'ambito del progetto saranno formati almeno 6 dottorandi, 12 studenti di master e 15 studenti di laurea triennale. Il budget del progetto ammonta a 3,5 milioni di euro in quattro anni, di cui un milione destinato al capofila del consorzio, l’Università TU Graz.

Dal concetto di economia circolare, in cui nulla si butta ma tutto si trasforma, in un mondo ancora dominato da un modello di economia ""lineare"": produci, usa, getta, il progetto guidato dall’Università TU Graz propone di recuperare energia e materiali di scarto per creare prodotti ad alto valore, come il carburante.",https://www.repstatic.it/content/contenthub/img/2026/01/02/163950238-39edb188-08a4-49a8-b207-e6f8b3dd4172.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:20.573257

The report employs a rigorous, data-driven methodology that integrates validated data modeling with comprehensive primary interviews and secondary research. This approach provides precise forecasts and actionable insights at both global and regional levels.

Market Overview and Dynamics

The aviation biofuels sector is positioned for significant expansion, propelled by rising demand for sustainable fuel alternatives and continuous innovation within the industry. Key players identified include Neste, Gevo, Fulcrum BioEnergy, LanzaTech, World Energy, SkyNRG, AltAir Fuels, Biothane, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. These companies are heavily investing in research and development, forging strategic partnerships, and striving to improve the cost-efficiency of biofuels to remain competitive against conventional aviation fuels.

The market is segmented by type and application, encompassing a broad spectrum of aviation categories. Types include commercial, military, general, cargo, business, regional, helicopter aviation, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Applications extend to commercial and military aviation, cargo transport, general aviation, flight training, agricultural aviation, emergency services, and research and development. This segmentation reflects the diverse potential uses of biofuels across the aviation industry.

Regionally, the report provides an in-depth analysis covering North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, and South America. It examines economic, social, environmental, technological, and political factors influencing market growth in each region, supported by revenue and sales data to assist investors in evaluating regional opportunities.

Despite the optimistic outlook, the report acknowledges several challenges that could impede market growth. Regulatory complexities, fluctuating raw material prices, and competition from traditional aviation fuels remain significant barriers. The market is also vulnerable to broader economic conditions and policy shifts. For example, Goldman Sachs projects ""sturdy"" global economic growth in 2026, which may bolster industry expansion. Conversely, volatility in the U.S. stock market—stemming from Federal Reserve policy disagreements and elevated market valuations—could undermine investor confidence and restrict funding for biofuel initiatives.

In response, industry competitors are expected to intensify investments in innovation, establish strategic alliances, and focus on reducing production costs. These measures aim to address regulatory demands and enhance the cost competitiveness of biofuels relative to fossil-based aviation fuels.

Global SAF demand is estimated to reach 450 billion liters per year by 2050, while production only reached around 2.5 billion liters by 2025. A long road ahead requires various routes to achieve NZE by 2050, as current production is only around 0.5%. Feedstocks are a major obstacle to accelerating the fulfillment of this demand, so some suggest initially using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) production route, as it is the most commercially mature and cost-effective option. However, by 2035, HEFA growth is constrained by the limited availability of waste oils and fats. Alternative bio-SAF routes such as Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) are expected to emerge later this decade, though they also face feedstock limitations. e-SAF is projected to begin scaling in the 2030s and expand significantly in the 2040s as supply chains mature and production costs decline. The last one, e-SAF (electronic Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is made from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, essentially creating synthetic jet fuel from air and power. This is an ideal solution because it eliminates the feedstock constraint. However, electricity supply for H2 production may also be a constraint, given that H2 production through water electrolysis is highly energy-intensive. Current technology still requires 39.75 kWh to produce 1 kg of H2, which only produces around 33 kWh of energy. This is where technological innovations like Airpatek and X Process come into play. These technologies allow for rapid and efficient H2 production from various types of biomass, whether solid or liquid, including sewage sluge. For example, with these technologies, aquatic plants, currently considered pests due to their rapid growth, can be cultivated as H2 feedstock. The availability of affordable H2 in sufficient quantities is key to SAF production from CO2. The pathway begins with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS), nCO2 + nH2 -> nCO + nH2O, followed by Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS), nCO + (2n+1)H2 -> CnH(2n+2) + nH2O. Because H2 sources can be anything that is abundant in this country, let alone CO2 sources, we have around 480 million tons/year from 55 GW coal-fueled power plants alone, approximately 10 times what the world needs for SAF production in 2030, namely 17 million tons/year, but it takes a leader who has the guts to realize this big idea!",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHbsRYAdUWajg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZuMOQ3WJ8As-/0/1767584110185?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=czwu6bcwkC5wOONP2e9YmLCY30mcilUtH5KWEhakbvQ,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:29.608818

Por ejemplo, el mecanismo de precisión que sirve para que la antena de los róveres (vehículo robótico) que están hoy operando en Marte apunte a la Tierra ha sido diseñado, fabricado e integrado por la compañía.

Con esta seña de identidad, Sener crece en todas las áreas, pero los segmentos de aeroespacial y defensa, junto con energía y movilidad, son los que más traccionan la facturación y el posicionamiento internacional del grupo.

Familiar y vasca

Sener, primer grupo español de ingeniería registrado como tal, nació en Bilbao en 1956 gracias a los hermanos Enrique de Sendagorta Aramburu y José Manuel de Sendagorta Aramburu.

Su idea de salir a Europa en una década en la que España aún vivía en autarquía se inspiraba en los modelos industriales de países como Alemania y Suiza.

Y todavía sigue en manos de la familia fundadora en un 100% del capital, pasando de padres a hijos hasta la cuarta generación.

Actualmente su presidente es Andrés Sendagorta, que asume la presidencia del grupo desde 2020 dentro del relevo generacional de la familia fundadora, y su consejero delegado (CEO) es Jorge Sendagorta Cudós.

Y en un mercado tan exigente como el alemán, Sener actúa como socio tecnológico para proyectos complejos de descarbonización y redes energéticas, especialmente en el desarrollo de plantas de ciclo combinado (térmicas de gas natural), en almacenamiento, en plantas de desulfuración y cogeneración.

También diseña infraestructuras hydrogen‑ready (hidrógeno) y terminales de GNL preparadas para futuros gases renovables, además de proyectos de desarrollo de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, es decir, combustible sostenible de aviación), y su nueva línea de negocio: los centros de datos.

En mayo de 2023, la compañía se convierte en el accionista mayoritario de la empresa de centros de datos Quark para aprovechar las sinergias a nivel tecnológico, operativo y de innovación (en sectores como movilidad, energía o digital).

""El objetivo en el negocio de los centros de datos es diseñar la infraestructura física del edificio, los servicios de suministros, anti-incendios o la refrigeración"", puntualizan desde la compañía a este periódico.

Permitirá al país introducir en su red de gasoductos el combustible que llega por vía marítima, convirtiéndose en una alternativa al gas proveniente por vía terrestre.

Esta planta está ubicada al norte del país, en la localidad de Brunsbüttel, justo en la desembocadura del Elba y conectada al ChemCoast Park, un gran polo industrial del norte del país.

Podrá producir hasta 8.000 millones de metros cúbicos por año (BCMA, según sus siglas en inglés) de gas natural, que podrán ampliarse hasta los 10 bcma. Esto, representa aproximadamente el 10% del consumo anual actual de Alemania.

Esta terminal se comenzó en paralelo al uso de una FSRU -Floating Storage and Regasification Unit o Unidad Flotante de Almacenamiento y Regasificación-. En concreto, el buque Höegh Gannet , que se emplea como solución rápida para el suministro energético del país, después de que en 2023 se encendieran todas las alarmas por la falta de gas ruso tras la invasión de Ucrania.

Junto a la terminal terrestre se espera contar con dos grandes tanques de almacenamiento y todas las instalaciones portuarias y de distribución asociadas.

El diseño del proyecto prevé que la terminal pueda adaptarse en el futuro al manejo de derivados de hidrógeno (como amoníaco o e‑metano) y de ""green LNG"", de forma que sirva de nodo para combustibles bajos en carbono en el norte de Europa.

Una línea de negocio que espera que siga creciendo en 2026 con el plan del Gobierno alemán para subastar apoyo público a nueva potencia de centrales de gas “hidrógeno‑ready” como respaldo al sistema eléctrico, dentro de su “estrategia de centrales” y del futuro mercado de capacidad.

El esquema más reciente apunta a subastas para unos 10 GW de potencia controlable, de los que 8 GW serían centrales de gas preparadas para hidrógeno y 2 GW se abrirían a otras tecnologías flexibles (baterías, etc.).",https://s3.elespanol.com/2025/12/31/actualidad/1003744074907_260725447_1706x960.jpg?fmt=jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 21:56:34.819876

While Malaysia has identified SAF as a cornerstone to the country’s pathway of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 through the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) that was unveiled in September 2024, BIMB Securities said the roadmap laying out the adoption of this fuel lacks binding enforcement mechanisms or interim milestones.

“This absence of clear mandates may delay adoption by domestic airlines, potentially weakening Malaysia’s alignment with global climate policies and undermining its competitiveness in international aviation markets,” it said.

It noted that Singapore had mandated a 1% SAF blending requirement by this year for all departing flights.

Singapore’s requirement would rise from 3% to 5% by 2030, while Japan and South Korea, which have been investing heavily in SAF, have targets of 10% by 2030 and 1% by 2027, respectively.

With SAF integrated into the National Energy Transition Roadmap, the indicative targets for its blending into aviation fuel starts at 1% in the near term to scaling up progressively to 47% by 2050.

Under the MADB, SAF has been projected to contribute to the largest share of carbon reductions, accounting for up to 46% of aviation emission savings by mid-century.

The brokerage pointed out that the primary obstacle to more SAF adoption remains its high cost, as it can be from two to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

Supply, meanwhile, remains another obstacle as global production continues to be limited despite countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and China expanding production capacity.

“On the supply side, Malaysia is preparing for significant SAF production capacity by 2027,” it said.

The country’s SAF industry would see two significant producers, Petroliam Nasional Bhd with a 650,000-tonne refinery in Pengerang, Johor, and EcoCeres Inc, a Hong Kong-based renewable fuels company with a 350,000 tonne facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor.

It said while the supply side has gathered momentum, costlier SAF that can be three times higher limits voluntary intake from airlines based in the country, with a comprehensive framework on certification, blending rules and cross-sector coordination still under development, creating uncertainty over market access and demand visibility.

“Malaysia’s policy choices over the next five years will determine whether SAF ambitions align with domestic decarbonisation and regional competitiveness,” it said.

It added that despite production capacity scaling significantly by 2027, domestic consumption may remain limited without robust mandates, subsidies or corporate commitments.

“For investors and corporates, this gap underscores both the risk of stranded assets and the opportunity to influence policy direction, ensuring that Malaysia’s SAF industry supports local demand as well as export markets,” it said.

“The interplay of regulatory clarity, production capacity and adoption costs will shape the trajectory of several sectors, particularly aviation, energy, plantations and infrastructure,” it added.

It suggested that one effective strategy could be collective advocacy through the forming of alliances by stakeholders to present a unified voice to policymakers.

“Such coalitions can demonstrate the commercial readiness of SAF supply chains while highlighting the risks of inaction, such as stranded investments and loss of competitiveness against regional peers,” it said.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/05/3704576.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:57:55.870975

Strong Start on Regional Jets

Starlink service debuted on Alaska’s Embraer E175 regional jets in late 2025. Early reports show it is much faster than older satellite Wi-Fi, enabling seamless video streaming, gaming, and video calls mid-flight. This good performance has led Alaska to accelerate the installation of Starlink on its larger Boeing 737 and 787 planes. In a recent statement, Todd Traynor-Corey, Vice President of Guest Products and Experience, said:

“We’re moving ahead of schedule, and will rapidly continue installations across our entire E175, 737, and 787 fleet through 2026.”

Entire Fleet Ahead of Schedule

Alaska first announced the Starlink plan in August 2025. The original goal was to finish by 2027. The updated plan will see Starlink feature across all aircraft types sooner.

This move also brings Alaska in line with Hawaiian Airlines, which it merged with in 2024. Hawaiian already offers free Starlink on its Airbus fleet. Alaska’s rollout will make sure all flights under the Alaska Air Group have the same fast Wi-Fi, whether flying domestically or on long-haul international routes.

Starlink’s Perks for Passengers

Beyond improved connectivity, Alaska is positioning Starlink as a core competitive advantage. The airline has partnered with T-Mobile to offer the service free of charge to eligible members of its Atmos Rewards loyalty programme. This move is designed to attract frequent flyers and differentiate Alaska from competitors relying on slower, legacy satellite systems.

The new Starlink terminals also support Alaska’s sustainability goals. The aerodynamic antenna is lighter and uses less fuel.

Market timing considerations favour early entrants in white hydrogen exploration, with limited competition in emerging sector providing first-mover advantages.","White hydrogen exploration represents a revolutionary approach to clean energy development, where naturally occurring geological processes generate hydrogen gas through mechanisms that have operated beneath Earth's surface for millions of years. The mineral exploration importance becomes particularly evident when examining how subsurface hydrogen formations challenge conventional resource extraction methodologies and present unprecedented opportunities for sustainable energy development.

Understanding how Earth's geological systems produce hydrogen naturally requires examination of deep subsurface environments where specific chemical reactions occur continuously. The convergence of water, iron-rich minerals, and optimal temperature conditions creates natural hydrogen factories beneath our feet, potentially containing vast reserves that dwarf current global energy consumption patterns.

Geological Forces Driving Natural Hydrogen Generation

Serpentinisation: The Primary Hydrogen Production Mechanism

Water-rock interactions form the foundation of natural hydrogen generation through serpentinisation processes. When subsurface water encounters iron-rich minerals, particularly olivine formations, at temperatures ranging from 200-350°C, chemical reactions split water molecules and liberate hydrogen gas as a byproduct.

This geological process operates most effectively in:

• Mid-continental rift systems where tectonic activity exposes iron-rich crustal materials

• Ocean floor hydrothermal systems providing optimal temperature and pressure conditions

• Iron-rich crustal reservoirs containing sufficient olivine mineral concentrations

• Deep geological formations with sustained water circulation patterns

According to a 2024 U.S. Geological Survey assessment, subsurface hydrogen reserves are estimated between 1 billion and 10 trillion tonnes globally, representing a potentially massive untapped resource base that could transform energy economics if successfully accessed.

Radiolysis: Alternative Hydrogen Generation Pathways

Radioactive decay mechanisms provide continuous hydrogen production through radiolysis, where uranium, thorium, and potassium isotopes in deep geological formations split water molecules through radiation exposure. Furthermore, this process operates independently of serpentinisation and continues producing hydrogen over geological timescales.

The uranium market trends influence understanding of radiolysis potential, particularly where radioactive elements provide continuous hydrogen generation. Radiolysis occurs most prominently in:

• Granite formations with elevated radioactive mineral content

• Sedimentary basins containing uranium-bearing rock layers

• Deep aquifer systems where radioactive elements interact with groundwater

• Basement rock formations providing long-term radioactive decay environments

Hydrogen Accumulation and Geological Trap Systems

Natural hydrogen accumulation requires specific geological conditions preventing upward gas migration. Low-permeability cap rocks function as sealing mechanisms, allowing hydrogen concentrations to build within subsurface reservoirs analogous to conventional oil and gas accumulations.

Critical accumulation factors include:

• Structural traps preventing lateral and vertical hydrogen migration

• Cap rock integrity maintaining reservoir pressure and preventing seepage

• Source rock proximity ensuring continuous hydrogen generation

• Porosity and permeability balancing storage capacity with retention capability

Surface indicators of subsurface hydrogen presence create observable patterns including vegetation die-off zones called ""fairy circles"" and anomalous plant growth patterns indicating hydrogen seepage through overlying rock formations.

Advanced Detection Technologies and Exploration Methodologies

White hydrogen exploration requires sophisticated technological approaches combining traditional petroleum exploration techniques with specialised hydrogen detection equipment. In addition, the industry leverages decades of oil and gas exploration expertise while developing novel methodologies specifically designed for natural hydrogen discovery and characterisation.

Technological convergence between petroleum and hydrogen exploration creates cost advantages for companies with existing subsurface expertise. Oklahoma's positioning as a potential white hydrogen development leader stems from its established oil and gas infrastructure, which Professor Prem Bikkina describes as providing both ""subsurface potential and above-ground readiness"" for natural hydrogen development.

Specialised Detection and Sampling Equipment

SysMoG probe systems represent cutting-edge French technology capable of sampling dissolved gases to depths of 1,200 metres with real-time hydrogen purity analysis through integrated spectrometer systems. Moreover, these detection capabilities range from surface-level concentrations around 14% to maximum depth concentrations approaching 90%.

Key technological specifications include:

• Real-time spectrometer integration for immediate hydrogen purity determination

• Multi-depth sampling capability providing vertical concentration profiles

• Dissolved gas detection measuring hydrogen in groundwater systems

• Precision monitoring tracking concentration variations over time

Large-Scale Geophysical Survey Implementation

2D seismic mapping enables comprehensive subsurface imaging across extensive areas. Gold Hydrogen's 650 km² seismic survey in South Australia demonstrates the scale required for effective white hydrogen exploration, mapping potential reservoir locations and structural controls.

Furthermore, 3D geological modelling enhances understanding through Mantle8's 4D geological imaging technology, which integrates multiple data sources to create comprehensive subsurface models:

• Geological data integration combining rock property information

• Geophysical survey information providing structural interpretation

• Geochemical sensor data measuring surface hydrogen signatures

• Advanced computational modelling generating dynamic Earth mantle imagery

The company secured €3.4 million in February 2024 funding to develop this technology, with exploratory drilling planned for southwestern France in 2028.

Multi-Point Surface Monitoring Networks

Continuous monitoring systems deployed across potential hydrogen seepage zones enable real-time tracking of:

• Hydrogen concentration variations indicating subsurface activity

• Temporal seepage patterns revealing production and migration cycles

• Subsurface pressure dynamics affecting hydrogen accumulation

• Gas composition fluctuations distinguishing hydrogen from other gases

Consequently, drilling results interpretation becomes crucial for Gold Hydrogen's Australian operations, which achieved 96% purity hydrogen extraction in 2025 test wells, demonstrating technical feasibility of high-purity natural hydrogen recovery and validating exploration technologies.

Economic Analysis and Production Cost Structures

White hydrogen exploration economics present both unprecedented opportunities and significant uncertainties, with production cost estimates ranging dramatically based on geological conditions, extraction depths, and technological requirements. However, current market dynamics suggest substantial potential for cost-competitive hydrogen production if technical challenges can be overcome.

Global hydrogen demand projections indicate market expansion from current 1 million tonnes per annum to nearly 200 million tonnes per annum by 2050, according to Wood Mackenzie research. This explosive growth creates substantial market opportunities for cost-effective white hydrogen production.

Comparative Production Cost Analysis

Hydrogen Type Production Method Cost Range ($/kg) Carbon Intensity Market Maturity White Hydrogen Natural extraction $0.50-$20.00 0.4-1.5 kg CO2e/kg Early exploration Green Hydrogen Renewable electrolysis $6.00-$12.00 Near-zero emissions Commercial deployment Grey Hydrogen Natural gas processing <$2.00 High emissions Mature commercial Blue Hydrogen Gas + carbon capture $3.00-$8.00 Low emissions Emerging commercial

Cost variance explanations for white hydrogen exploration reflect uncertainty in extraction complexity. For instance, operational projects like Hydroma's Canadian operations achieve $0.50 per kilogram production costs, while exploratory ventures face significantly higher extraction expenses.

Economic Drivers and Investment Incentives

U.S. Inflation Reduction Act provisions offer tax credits up to $3.00 per kilogram for qualifying low-carbon hydrogen, creating substantial economic incentives for white hydrogen exploration development. These policy frameworks significantly improve project economics compared to unsubsidised alternatives.

French Lorraine/Moselle discoveries represent 92 million tonnes of reserves valued at approximately $92 billion, assuming $1 per kilogram average pricing. These discoveries demonstrate the scale of potential economic value contained in natural hydrogen deposits.

Investment Activity and Market Positioning

Early-stage investment activity indicates growing investor confidence in white hydrogen exploration potential:

• Oklahoma State University received $25,000 for state-wide natural hydrogen surveys through July 2026

• Mantle8 secured €3.4 million seed funding for 4D geological imaging technology

• Koloma reportedly raised substantial funding for Kansas and Nevada exploration

Infrastructure adaptation advantages position existing oil and gas regions favourably for white hydrogen exploration development. As Professor Bikkina notes regarding Oklahoma's status as the fifth-largest crude oil-producing state with adaptable infrastructure systems.

Global Industry Leaders and Pioneer Operations

White hydrogen exploration remains in nascent stages globally, with limited commercial operations and predominantly research-focused initiatives. However, emerging patterns indicate concentrated development in regions with favourable geology and existing energy infrastructure.

Eric Gaucher, French geochemist and International Energy Agency white hydrogen expert group co-lead, emphasises potential for commercially viable discoveries to catalyse exploration expansion comparable to historical oil development. Furthermore, Gaucher projects discovery timelines of three to four years for major commercial breakthroughs whilst advocating measured expectations regarding white hydrogen exploration's role in global energy transition.

Operational Projects and Proof-of-Concept Facilities

Bourakébougou field in Mali represents the only currently operational commercial white hydrogen exploration project globally, providing electricity to local village populations through natural hydrogen extraction and conversion. This facility demonstrates technical feasibility of white hydrogen utilisation at community scale, though production volumes remain limited.

Mali's operational success provides critical proof-of-concept validation that natural hydrogen extraction and utilisation achieves commercial viability when appropriately matched to local energy demands and infrastructure capabilities.

Advanced Exploration and Technology Development

Gold Hydrogen's Australian operations demonstrate significant technical progress through:

• 96% purity hydrogen extraction achieved in 2025 test wells

• 650 km² seismic mapping across South Australian prospects

• Multiple prospect identification through large-scale geophysical surveys

• Ramsay project development targeting commercial production timelines

In addition, Mantle8's technology development focuses on revolutionary 4D geological imaging systems integrating multidisciplinary data sources. The company's 2028 drilling timeline for southwestern France represents significant milestone for advanced exploration technologies.

Research Initiatives and Academic Partnerships

Oklahoma State University's research programme under Professor Bikkina's leadership emphasises Oklahoma's unique positioning for natural hydrogen development, leveraging existing petroleum infrastructure and subsurface geological knowledge. The $25,000 funding allocation supports state-wide deposit surveys through July 2026.

Regional exploration hotspots demonstrate global interest patterns:

• France's Lorraine basin with 92 million tonnes discovered reserves

• U.S. Mid-continental Rift systems targeting Oklahoma formations

• Australian basin systems through Gold Hydrogen's extensive surveys

• Mali's proven production providing operational benchmarks

Technical Challenges and Infrastructure Requirements

White hydrogen exploration faces substantial technical obstacles that differentiate it from conventional petroleum exploration, requiring specialised solutions for unique geological and engineering challenges. These complexities contribute significantly to cost uncertainties and development timelines.

Depth-related extraction complexity increases exponentially below 3,000 metres, where conventional drilling technologies encounter limitations in hydrogen-specific applications. Unlike oil and gas extraction, hydrogen's molecular properties create unique handling, storage, and transportation challenges requiring specialised infrastructure modifications.

Geological Access and Recovery Constraints

Hydrogen migration patterns through porous rock formations reduce recoverable volumes significantly compared to initial resource estimates. Similarly, natural hydrogen's tendency to seep upward through geological formations requires precise understanding of trap integrity and reservoir dynamics.

Critical technical challenges include:

• Molecular hydrogen properties requiring specialised containment systems

• Reservoir characterisation with limited understanding of accumulation mechanisms

• Extraction efficiency varying dramatically based on geological conditions

• Gas purity requirements necessitating complex separation and purification processes

Trap integrity assessment represents fundamental challenge as hydrogen molecules are significantly smaller than hydrocarbon molecules, potentially escaping through rock formations that effectively contain oil and gas. Consequently, this characteristic necessitates enhanced geological modelling and monitoring capabilities.

Infrastructure Adaptation and Safety Protocols

Flammability management requires comprehensive safety protocols for handling highly combustible gas extraction, transport, and storage. Hydrogen's wide flammability range and low ignition energy create unique safety considerations compared to conventional energy extraction operations.

Pipeline compatibility challenges existing oil and gas infrastructure, as hydrogen can cause embrittlement in steel pipelines and equipment. Infrastructure modifications include:

• Material compatibility ensuring hydrogen-resistant pipeline systems

• Compression technology adapted for hydrogen's physical properties

• Storage solutions preventing hydrogen loss and maintaining purity

• Safety systems addressing hydrogen's unique combustion characteristics

Environmental Monitoring and Regulatory Compliance

Subsurface disturbance prevention requires careful management of extraction processes to avoid environmental impacts. Unlike conventional fossil fuel extraction, white hydrogen exploration must maintain ecosystem integrity while demonstrating genuine environmental benefits.

Extraction byproduct management involves monitoring and controlling associated gases and geological disturbances resulting from hydrogen extraction processes.

Environmental Impact and Clean Energy Positioning

White hydrogen exploration presents unique environmental profile combining ultra-low carbon emissions with minimal processing requirements, positioning it favourably within clean energy transition strategies. However, comprehensive lifecycle assessments remain limited due to industry infancy.

Carbon intensity measurements for white hydrogen exploration range from 0.4-1.5 kg CO2e per kilogram hydrogen at 85% purity standards, representing significant environmental advantages over conventional hydrogen production methods while requiring minimal energy-intensive processing.

Lifecycle Environmental Assessment

Direct extraction advantages eliminate energy-intensive electrolysis processes required for green hydrogen production, reducing overall environmental footprint through simplified processing requirements. Furthermore, mining industry innovation in white hydrogen exploration operates through mechanical processes rather than energy conversion systems.

Land use efficiency provides substantial advantages over renewable energy installations required for green hydrogen production. Natural hydrogen extraction requires smaller surface footprints while potentially providing higher energy output per unit area compared to solar or wind installations.

Environmental benefits include:

• Minimal processing requirements reducing energy consumption

• No water consumption for production processes

• Reduced infrastructure compared to renewable energy systems

• Lower material intensity requiring fewer manufactured components

Industrial Application Potential and Market Integration

Steel production applications offer direct replacement opportunities for coking coal in metallurgical processes, potentially eliminating significant industrial carbon emissions. White hydrogen exploration's purity levels achieved in test operations support direct industrial utilisation without extensive purification.

Ammonia synthesis for fertiliser production represents major market opportunity, replacing natural gas inputs in agricultural chemical manufacturing. Current ammonia production accounts for substantial global hydrogen demand, creating established market pathways for white hydrogen exploration integration.

Sustainable aviation fuel production provides long-haul transportation decarbonisation opportunities through hydrogen-based fuel synthesis, addressing aviation sector's limited electrification options.

Future Market Outlook and Investment Considerations

White hydrogen exploration stands at early development stages with substantial potential for market transformation if technical and economic challenges can be successfully addressed. Investment opportunities exist within high-risk, high-reward framework characteristic of emerging energy technologies.

Market timing considerations favour early entrants in white hydrogen exploration, with limited competition in emerging sector providing first-mover advantages. However, substantial technical uncertainties require careful risk assessment and diversified exploration portfolios.

Production Scaling Projections and Market Development

2050 production targets suggest potential 17 million tonnes per annum with supportive policy frameworks, representing significant portion of projected global hydrogen demand. These projections assume successful technology development and commercial discovery confirmation.

Technology maturation expectations indicate 3-4 year timeline for major commercial discoveries, according to industry expert projections. Nevertheless, scaling from discovery to commercial production requires additional development phases and infrastructure investment.

Market development factors include:

• International cooperation through cross-border research initiatives

• Technology sharing agreements accelerating development timelines

• Investment incentive programmes supporting early-stage exploration

• Regulatory framework adaptation from oil and gas to hydrogen applications

Investment Risk Assessment and Portfolio Strategies

Geological uncertainty represents primary investment risk, as subsurface hydrogen accumulations remain poorly understood compared to conventional petroleum resources. Successful exploration requires diversified portfolios across multiple geological formations and regions.

Technology development risks include uncertainty regarding extraction methodologies, cost optimisation, and commercial scalability. Investment strategies should account for extended development timelines and substantial capital requirements for technology advancement.

Risk mitigation approaches include:

• Diversified exploration portfolios across multiple geological basins

• Technology partnership strategies reducing development costs

• Government incentive utilisation improving project economics

• Market development timing aligning with hydrogen demand growth

Competitive advantages for white hydrogen exploration include potentially lower production costs than green hydrogen, established industrial applications, and policy support for low-carbon energy development. However, success depends on overcoming current technical limitations and proving commercial viability.

Investment consideration timing favours cautious optimism with measured expectations, as emphasised by leading researchers like Eric Gaucher. While potential exists for transformative discoveries, substantial research and development requirements precede commercial implementation.

Disclaimer: White hydrogen exploration involves significant technological and geological uncertainties. Projected production costs, reserve estimates, and development timelines should be considered speculative pending further research and commercial validation. Investment decisions should account for substantial technical risks and extended development timelines characteristic of emerging energy technologies.

Once known for giving helicopters a distinctly frosty reception (palace insiders joked he would “raise an eyebrow” at the very suggestion), the King has now embraced the aircraft as a surprisingly green solution for a modern, working monarchy.

The shift became official in June 2024, when Buckingham Palace confirmed the household would take delivery of two newly leased helicopters designed to be cleaner, efficient, and compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Royal Family’s twin AugustaWestland AW139 helicopters have logged around 58,000 miles in just nine months, clocking more than 420 flying hours as they ferried senior royals across the UK.

Far from joyrides, aides stress the aircraft are being used strategically allowing multiple engagements in a single day.

Princess Anne has emerged as the most frequent flyer, with data showing 68 landings at Gatcombe Park, her Gloucestershire home.

Prince William follows closely behind, with 47 stops in Windsor and several more at Forest Lodge as he settles into family life there.

Sandringham, Dumfries House, Lacock and Buckingham Palace have also featured heavily on the flight map.

William, whose Earthshot Prize has placed environmental leadership at the heart of his public role, has used the helicopters to attend everything from England women’s football training sessions to rugby matches and climate-focused events.

Tim Fauchon, chief executive of the British Helicopter Association, has praised Charles for “leading by example,” noting that the Royal Flight actively seeks out airfields able to supply SAF, even when it comes at a higher cost.

Critics, meanwhile, have raised eyebrows at the sheer volume of flights with data suggesting as many as 700 individual journeys if short stops are counted separately.

But palace officials are unapologetic. Helicopters according to them they are essential for reaching remote communities and ensuring the monarchy remains visible “throughout the length and breadth of the UK.”

As one official put it bluntly: invest in the asset, then “sweat it.”",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2026-01-05/l_643243_012806_updates.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 16:56:11.787751

GE Aerospace und Safran versprechen gegenüber Vorgängergenerationen (CFM56) eine Treibstoffersparnis im Bereich von rund 15 Prozent, reduzierten Lärmpegel und niedrigere CO?-Emissionen. Möglich wird das durch fortschrittliche Werkstoffe wie Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), 3D-gedruckte Komponenten und optimierte Aerodynamik im Verdichter und in der Turbine. Für Airlines ist diese Effizienz ein unmittelbarer Hebel für die Betriebskosten pro Sitzkilometer.

Im Langstreckensegment setzt GE Aerospace auf die GE90- und GE9X-Triebwerke, die vor allem an Boeing-Großraumflugzeugen wie der 777 und 777X zum Einsatz kommen. Das GE9X wurde mit Fokus auf geringeren spezifischen Verbrauch und hohe Zuverlässigkeit entwickelt und ist maßgeblich für die Versprechen der Flugzeughersteller hinsichtlich Reichweite und Effizienz verantwortlich. Hinzu kommen Produkte wie die GEnx-Serie für Boeing 787 und 747-8, die ebenfalls eine verbesserte Wirtschaftlichkeit gegenüber älteren Aggregaten bieten.

Parallel dazu investiert GE Aerospace massiv in die nächste Technologiestufe: Unter dem Programm RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines), das gemeinsam mit Safran läuft, wird an einem Open-Fan-Konzept gearbeitet. Ziel ist, den Treibstoffverbrauch gegenüber der heutigen LEAP-Generation nochmals zweistellig zu senken und damit künftige Klimavorgaben zu erfüllen. RISE ist derzeit zwar noch ein Technologie-Demonstrator, zeigt aber, wohin sich das Portfolio langfristig bewegt – hin zu noch radikaleren Effizienzgewinnen und alternativen Treibstoffen inklusive SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Ein weiteres zentrales Differenzierungsmerkmal ist die Digitalisierung des Betriebs. GE Aerospace setzt seit Jahren auf Sensorik, datengetriebene Wartung (Predictive Maintenance) und cloudbasierte Analytics, um Triebwerksdaten nahezu in Echtzeit auszuwerten. Airlines können Wartungsintervalle besser planen, Ausfälle reduzieren und Triebwerke näher an ihren technischen Leistungsgrenzen betreiben, ohne Sicherheitsrisiken einzugehen. Die Kombination aus Hardware, Software und langfristigen Serviceverträgen schafft hohe Kundenbindung – und wiederkehrende Umsätze.

Im militärischen Bereich ist GE Aerospace mit Triebwerken wie der F110- und F414-Serie (unter anderem für F-16, F/A-18) und künftigen Antrieben für Next-Generation-Kampfflugzeuge präsent. Diese Programme sind nicht nur technologisch anspruchsvoll, sondern auch strategisch relevant, da sie von langfristigen Regierungsbudgets abhängen und in Zeiten geopolitischer Spannungen eine zusätzliche Wachstumsbasis bilden.

Der Wettbewerb: GE Aerospace Aktie gegen den Rest

Im globalen Triebwerksmarkt trifft GE Aerospace auf drei gewichtige Rivalen: Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney (Raytheon Technologies / RTX) und für einzelne Programme auch Safran außerhalb des CFM-Joint-Ventures. Im direkten Vergleich werden die Stärken und Schwächen von GE Aerospace klarer.

Im Mittelstreckensegment konkurriert das LEAP-Triebwerk mit dem Pratt & Whitney PW1000G „Geared Turbofan“ (GTF), das an Teilen der Airbus-A320neo-Familie, der Airbus A220 und der Embraer E2-Serie hängt. Pratt & Whitney verspricht mit dem GTF ähnlich hohe oder teils höhere Effizienzgewinne, setzt jedoch auf ein anderes technisches Konzept mit einem Untersetzungsgetriebe. Im direkten Vergleich zum Pratt & Whitney GTF punktet GE Aerospace aktuell mit einer höheren Flottenzuverlässigkeit: In den vergangenen Jahren hatte Pratt & Whitney immer wieder mit technischen Problemen, Inspektionen und Groundings zu kämpfen, was zu Ausfällen und Mehrkosten bei Airlines führte. LEAP-Triebwerke gelten als robuster im Alltagsbetrieb und sorgen damit für weniger ungeplante Stillstände – ein wesentlicher Faktor in einem Umfeld knapper Kapazitäten.

Im Langstreckenmarkt steht GE Aerospace vor allem Rolls-Royce gegenüber. Das britische Unternehmen ist mit dem Trent XWB an der Airbus A350 und dem Trent 1000 sowie Trent 7000 an Boeing 787 und Airbus A330neo stark vertreten. Im direkten Vergleich zum Rolls-Royce Trent XWB konzentriert sich GE Aerospace mit dem GE90 und GE9X vor allem auf die Boeing-Plattformen. Rolls-Royce hatte in der Vergangenheit Qualitäts- und Haltbarkeitsprobleme bei einigen Trent-Varianten, was das Vertrauen mancher Airlines belastete. GE-Triebwerke genießen den Ruf, in puncto Lebensdauer und Wartbarkeit besser planbar zu sein, was sich positiv auf die Total Cost of Ownership auswirkt.

Ein weiterer Wettbewerbsaspekt ist die Daten- und Servicekompetenz. Während auch Rolls-Royce mit „TotalCare“ und Pratt & Whitney mit umfassenden Wartungsverträgen auf Serviceerlöse setzen, verfügt GE Aerospace über eine besonders tiefe Integration in digitale Plattformen. Die unternehmenseigenen Analytics-Tools sowie der Rückgriff auf langjährige Erfahrungen aus unterschiedlichen Flotten liefern einen Vorsprung, wenn es um datenbasierte Optimierung geht. Airlines, die starke operative Kontrolle wünschen, tendieren daher häufig zu einem Partner, der sowohl Triebwerk als auch Analyseumgebung bietet.

Wichtig ist aber: Der Wettbewerb bleibt intensiv. Airbus verfolgt bewusst eine Dual-Source-Strategie, um nicht von einem einzigen Triebwerkshersteller abhängig zu sein; gleiches gilt in Teilen für Boeing. Für GE Aerospace heißt das: Der Markt ist groß und wachstumsstark, aber hart umkämpft. Investoren sollten die Wettbewerbsdynamik berücksichtigen, insbesondere, wenn neue Programme wie RISE in die kommerzielle Phase gehen und Kapitalbedarf verursachen.

Warum GE Aerospace die Nase vorn hat

Die zentrale Stärke von GE Aerospace liegt in der Kombination aus Skaleneffekten, technologischer Tiefe und Serviceorientierung. Mit einer global installierten Basis von Zehntausenden Triebwerken erzielt das Unternehmen erhebliche Skalenvorteile in Entwicklung, Produktion und Ersatzteilversorgung. Diese Basis ermöglicht es auch, riesige Datenmengen aus dem Betrieb zu sammeln – ein entscheidender Input für weitere Effizienzsteigerungen und neue Serviceangebote.

Technologisch punktet GE Aerospace vor allem mit seinem Fokus auf Materialinnovationen und Fertigungstechnologien. Der Einsatz von CMC-Materialien erlaubt höhere Betriebstemperaturen bei gleichzeitig geringerem Gewicht. 3D-Druck (Additive Manufacturing) ermöglicht komplexe Geometrien, die zuvor nicht herstellbar waren, sowie eine Reduktion der Teileanzahl. Beides verbessert Wirkungsgrad und Zuverlässigkeit. Im Vergleich zu Rolls-Royce und Pratt & Whitney hat GE frühzeitig und umfassend in diese Technologien investiert und sie im LEAP-Programm in die Breite gebracht.

Ein zweiter USP ist das integrierte Ökosystem. GE Aerospace liefert nicht nur Triebwerke, sondern auch Avionik- und Power-Systeme, etwa für elektrische Bordnetze, Energieverteilung und Kontrollsysteme. Damit rückt das Unternehmen zunehmend in die Rolle eines Systemintegrators, der das Zusammenspiel von Antrieb, Flugsteuerung und Bordelektrik orchestrieren kann. In einer Zukunft, in der hybride oder vollelektrische Antriebe, neue Flugzeugkonzepte und Urban Air Mobility eine Rolle spielen, ist diese Fähigkeit, Systeme ganzheitlich zu denken, ein strategischer Vorteil.

Drittens hat GE Aerospace eine vergleichsweise balancierte Aufstellung zwischen zivilen und militärischen Programmen. Während der zivile Markt stark von Passagiernachfrage und Airline-Investitionszyklen abhängt, werden militärische Beschaffungen häufig von längerfristigen Sicherheitsdoktrinen getragen. In Phasen wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit stabilisiert diese Diversifikation tendenziell Umsatz und Cashflows – ein Argument, das sowohl im Wettbewerb mit rein zivil fokussierten Playern als auch aus Sicht der Kapitalmärkte zählt.

Nicht zu unterschätzen ist außerdem die Konsequenz des Spin-offs. Als eigenständiges Unternehmen kann GE Aerospace seine Kapitalallokation klar auf Luft- und Raumfahrt ausrichten, ohne interne Konkurrenz zu anderen Industrie- oder Energiegeschäften. Das erleichtert strategische Entscheidungen – etwa höhere F&E-Quoten für Dekarbonisierungstechnologien oder M&A in komplementären Software- und Sensorikfeldern – und macht die Story für Investoren leichter lesbar.

Bedeutung für Aktie und Unternehmen

Die Produkterfolge von GE Aerospace spiegeln sich zunehmend in der Wahrnehmung der GE Aerospace Aktie (ISIN US3696043013) wider. Nach dem Börsenstart als eigenständiges Unternehmen wird das Papier an den US-Börsen vor allem als reiner Luftfahrt- und Verteidigungswert gehandelt – und nicht mehr als Teil eines diversifizierten Industriekonglomerats. Das erleichtert die Einordnung im Vergleich zu Konkurrenten wie Rolls-Royce oder RTX.

Nach aktueller Marktlage notiert die GE Aerospace Aktie laut Daten von unter anderem Yahoo Finance und Reuters im Bereich der jüngsten Höchststände. Zum Handelsschluss des letzten vollständig abgeschlossenen Handelstages wurde die Aktie bei rund US$ 147 bis 149 je Anteilsschein gehandelt (Spanne aus mehreren Datenquellen; genaue Intraday-Werte variieren je nach Anbieter und Zeitpunkt der Kursstellung). Die Kursinformationen stammen aus einer Echtzeitrecherche am heutigen Tag, mit Abgleich mehrerer Finanzportale, der Zeitpunkt der herangezogenen Schlusskurse liegt in der Regel am Ende des jeweils letzten US-Handelstages (Ortszeit New York).

Der Kursverlauf reflektiert die Erwartung, dass GE Aerospace über Jahre hinweg von mehreren Wachstumstreibern profitieren könnte: dem Aufbau der LEAP-Flottenbasis, dem Wiederhochlauf des Langstreckenverkehrs, der Stärkung militärischer Programme und den laufenden Serviceerlösen. Besonders wichtig: Die Margen im Servicegeschäft sind traditionell höher als im Neugeschäft mit Triebwerken. Je mehr installierte Basis GE Aerospace aufbaut, desto größer wird dieser wiederkehrende Umsatzanteil – ein Punkt, der von Analysten häufig positiv hervorgehoben wird.

Für Investoren ist entscheidend, wie gut das Unternehmen den Spagat zwischen kurzfristiger Profitabilität und langfristigen Investitionen in neue Technologien wie RISE und nachhaltige Antriebe meistert. Hoher F&E-Aufwand drückt kurzfristig auf die Marge, ist aber Voraussetzung, um auch in den 2030er-Jahren führend zu bleiben. Bisher honoriert der Markt diesen Ansatz, was sich im Bewertungsniveau niederschlägt. Gleichzeitig bleiben Risiken: Verzögerungen bei OEM-Programmen, mögliche technische Probleme im Feld oder konjunkturelle Dämpfer im Flugverkehr könnten die Wachstumsdynamik temporär bremsen.

Unterm Strich lässt sich sagen: Der Erfolg von GE Aerospace im Produktgeschäft – allen voran die starke Position im Single-Aisle-Segment mit LEAP, kombiniert mit einem ambitionierten Technologiepfad Richtung Dekarbonisierung – ist ein wesentlicher Treiber für die Attraktivität der GE Aerospace Aktie. Wer in diesen Wert investiert, setzt weniger auf einen Generalisten und mehr auf einen fokussierten Technologieführer, dessen Produkte im wortwörtlichen Sinn das Rückgrat des globalen Luftverkehrs bilden.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405002_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:56:15.632495

By OneArabia

The UAE aviation sector strengthens its role as a core pillar of the national economy. In 2025, the sector supports trade, tourism, logistics and supply chains, and contributes up to 18 percent of gross domestic product. It also advances global aviation governance, climate action and innovation through projects, international roles and record passenger traffic.

The UAE secures a seat on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation for the seventh consecutive term. The organisation re-elects Hamad Salem Al Muhairi as Chairperson of the ICAO Aviation Security Panel for the third year. Engineer Maryam AlBalooshi becomes Chair of ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, the first person from the Middle East in this role.

Environmental policy remains a central focus for the UAE aviation sector during 2025. The General Civil Aviation Authority submits the third edition of the UAE's State Action Plan to Reduce Aviation Emissions to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The Cabinet approves this plan, which supports national climate commitments while maintaining growth in aviation activities and related economic sectors.

The updated State Action Plan follows ICAO Assembly Resolution A37-19 from 2010 and later Assembly decisions. It uses a ""basket of measures"" approach to address emissions. The plan includes 42 projects focused on operations and technology. It also lists 13 projects linked to sustainable aviation fuel and low-carbon fuel deployment across the industry.

The election of Engineer Maryam AlBalooshi to lead ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection reinforces this approach. The role covers international work on aviation’s environmental footprint. It seeks to balance emission reductions with the need for continued economic development. It also supports the long-term expansion of this vital global industry, including growing markets in the Middle East.

Besides policy leadership, the UAE aviation sector advances digital regulation and new air mobility solutions. In January 2025, the General Civil Aviation Authority launches a unified national platform for unmanned aerial vehicles. The interactive digital system manages drone registration, clarifies usage rules and supports compliance with aviation safety laws and technical regulations.

The national drone platform aims to improve operational safety and efficiency for unmanned aircraft. It also supports investors and businesses using drone services. By centralising approvals and information, the platform helps integrate drones into national airspace. It supports the wider aviation ecosystem, including logistics providers, survey firms and service companies using remote aircraft.

Another project highlights the UAE’s focus on advanced air mobility. In April, the General Civil Aviation Authority grants Design Acceptance for the country’s first hybrid Heliport at the Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal at Zayed Port. The facility is part of the Abu Dhabi Air Taxi project and supports integrated, lower-emission air transport within the emirate.

UAE aviation sector global events, GSAM initiative and passenger growth

The UAE aviation sector also hosts and shapes key international discussions. Abu Dhabi welcomes the ICAO Global Implementation Support Symposium and the first edition of the UAE initiative, ""Global Sustainable Aviation Market"". These events bring together regulators, airlines, manufacturers and financiers to discuss sustainable fuels, technology and climate-related investment in aviation.

During its 235th Session, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation formally adopts the UAE's Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace as an institutionalised annual event under ICAO’s official calendar. This decision turns a state-led concept into a recurring global platform supported by member states and industry stakeholders focused on practical decarbonisation measures.

First held in Abu Dhabi in February 2025 alongside the ICAO Global Implementation Support Symposium, the Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace aims to speed up sustainable practices in world aviation. It convenes airlines, manufacturers, regulators and investors. Its agenda includes sustainable aviation fuels, low-carbon aviation fuels and climate finance solutions under the ICAO Finvest Hub framework.

While policies and new platforms develop, passenger demand through UAE airports continues to grow. During the first nine months of 2025, Abu Dhabi Airports, Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport together handle about 108.59 million passengers by the end of September, reinforcing the country’s position as a key global air transport hub.

{TABLE_1}

The UAE aviation sector, supported by strong institutions and international partnerships, continues to shape global aviation standards and sustainability efforts. Through regulatory innovation, infrastructure projects, high-level ICAO roles and hosting major summits, the sector deepens its economic contribution. Growing passenger figures further underline its importance for national development and connectivity across the Middle East and beyond.

Galp Energia SGPS SA is not a gadget, a car, or a line of code. It is, effectively, a multi?billion?euro, multi?decade infrastructure product: a full?stack energy platform that Portugal’s Galp is betting will carry it from oil refiner to low?carbon powerhouse. In an era where investors are increasingly skeptical of fossil?fuel incumbents, Galp’s strategy isn’t just a corporate slide deck. It’s a stress test of whether a mid?sized integrated oil and gas company can realistically turn itself into a profitable, scalable clean?energy business without blowing up shareholder value.

Galp Energia SGPS SA sits at the top of the group’s portfolio, orchestrating exploration and production, industrial and refining, renewables, and downstream businesses under a single transition narrative. The promise is clear: use existing assets, cash flows, and Iberian footprint to build out advanced biofuels, green hydrogen, and large?scale renewables while gradually shrinking the carbon intensity of each unit of energy sold.

That makes Galp Energia SGPS SA something like a platform product: it’s not about one refinery, one solar farm, or one offshore field. It’s about how all of those assets interlock into a new value proposition for customers, regulators, and investors: low?carbon molecules at industrial scale, backed by oil?like reliability and utility?like visibility.

Inside the Flagship: Galp Energia SGPS SA

To understand Galp Energia SGPS SA as a product, you have to look at how the company is rewiring its asset base. The core pillars are relatively clear from recent strategy updates and investor presentations: upstream oil and gas, a transforming Sines industrial hub, a fast?growing renewables portfolio, and an electrified, digital retail and mobility network.

On the upstream side, Galp remains heavily exposed to high?margin, low?lifting?cost projects, particularly in Brazil. Its interests in the prolific Santos Basin pre?salt fields provide cash flow that effectively bankrolls the transition. This is a key feature, not a bug: unlike pure?play renewables developers that rely on cheap capital, Galp Energia SGPS SA still has a powerful internal cash engine.

The real innovation, however, is in the industrial and renewables architecture:

1. Advanced biofuels at Sines: Galp is converting its Sines refinery in Portugal into a flagship low?carbon fuels complex. A dedicated advanced biofuels plant is under development, designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel via co?processing or standalone hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) routes. This directly targets airlines, heavy transport, and logistics players facing tightening EU emissions rules.

2. Green hydrogen and e?fuels: Alongside biofuels, Sines is being positioned as a green hydrogen hub, leveraging Portugal’s strong solar resources and port infrastructure. Electrolyser capacity is being phased in, with hydrogen aimed at both internal refinery use (replacing grey hydrogen and lowering the refinery’s carbon footprint) and external sale into industrial and mobility sectors. Over time, this unlocks e?fuel opportunities for maritime and aviation customers.

3. Large?scale utility?style renewables: Galp Energia SGPS SA supervises a rapidly growing portfolio of solar and wind assets, particularly in Iberia and Brazil. The company has plotted a multi?gigawatt development pipeline with a focus on grid?connected solar farms and hybrid solutions. These projects serve two masters: long?term contracted power sales for predictable returns and cheap, captive electricity for its own green hydrogen and industrial processes.

4. Retail, EV charging, and low?carbon mobility: On the customer side, Galp operates one of Iberia’s most visible fuel station networks. Under Galp Energia SGPS SA, this downstream retail layer is being retooled with high?power EV charging corridors, digital payment and loyalty platforms, and an increasingly diversified offer of fuels—from conventional gasoline and diesel to LNG, biofuels blends, and eventually hydrogen. The goal is to avoid being disintermediated as mobility electrifies.

5. Carbon?intensity as a product metric: A key differentiator in Galp’s narrative is its focus on carbon intensity, not just absolute emissions. The company has laid out roadmaps to reduce the carbon intensity of its energy products over the coming decade, tying capital allocation to decarbonization trajectories. This positions Galp Energia SGPS SA as a solution set for customers with their own net?zero targets: airlines, shippers, industrials, and utilities wanting a partner that can deliver compliant molecules at scale.

The net result: Galp Energia SGPS SA is engineered as a hybrid product—part legacy hydrocarbons, part green infrastructure builder, and part digital retail platform. That hybrid nature is the whole sales pitch: it offers energy transition upside without sacrificing the near?term resilience associated with oil?linked cash flows.

Market Rivals: Galp Energia Aktie vs. The Competition

No energy transition strategy lives in a vacuum. Galp Energia SGPS SA is competing directly with other European integrated energy companies that are also packaging themselves as low?carbon transition platforms. The closest benchmark products come from Repsol in Spain and Eni in Italy, with BP and TotalEnergies providing the scale benchmarks.

Repsol’s integrated low?carbon platform is one of the most obvious rivals. Compared directly to Repsol’s transformation product—centered on its own advanced biofuels projects in Cartagena and Puertollano, an expanding renewables arm, and a growing EV charging network—Galp Energia SGPS SA competes head?on in Iberia for the same decarbonizing industrial and mobility customers.

Repsol has an edge in diversification and scale: its low?carbon business already includes large biorefining capabilities, significant wind and solar assets across Europe and North America, and a public target to make all its operations net?zero by mid?century. It has also carved out a separate low?carbon generation and customer solutions unit, which some investors value as a quasi?utility.

However, Galp’s relative nimbleness and concentrated geographic focus simplify execution. Where Repsol has to coordinate across multiple jurisdictions and legacy businesses, Galp can concentrate capex and political capital into a smaller, more controllable footprint. That makes Galp Energia SGPS SA feel more like an agile, fast?pivot product, while Repsol’s platform resembles a diversified portfolio play.

Eni’s evolving transition platform offers another telling comparison. Eni has created a range of semi?independent transition products—such as Plenitude (integrating retail power, renewables, and EV charging) and Enilive (focused on biofuels and mobility)—wrapped inside a wider upstream and gas?infrastructure giant. Compared directly to Eni’s Plenitude and Enilive product ecosystem, Galp Energia SGPS SA is more centralized: instead of spinning off pieces, it keeps the transition inside the main corporate stack.

Eni’s advantage lies in sheer optionality: exposure to African gas, CCS (carbon capture and storage) initiatives, and a much broader industrial base. But that complexity also risks diluting the clarity of its low?carbon narrative. Galp’s more focused playbook could resonate with investors who want a simpler story: an Iberian and Brazilian?rooted company that uses Brazilian upstream and Portuguese industrial assets to scale renewables, biofuels, and hydrogen.

BP’s integrated energy company model is the more global, heavyweight rival product. BP has been reframing itself as an “integrated energy company,” bundling offshore wind, EV charging via BP Pulse, bioenergy, hydrogen, and traditional oil and gas assets. Compared directly to BP’s integrated energy platform, Galp Energia SGPS SA operates at a different scale but chases a similar thesis: vertically integrated energy systems that pair molecules and electrons for large customers.

Where BP leans on its global trading arm and deep capital markets access, Galp leans on geographic specialization and lower political complexity. BP is already deeply embedded in offshore wind in the UK, the US, and beyond; Galp has instead focused on solar and on leveraging sunny Portugal and Brazil. For investors, that means BP’s product looks like a global macro bet on energy transition, while Galp Energia SGPS SA looks more like a regional growth story with asymmetric upside if its industrial bets at Sines and in Brazil pay off.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Against this backdrop, why might Galp Energia SGPS SA outperform its rivals as a product proposition?

1. A tightly coupled industrial?renewables stack

The heart of Galp’s edge is the industrial cluster at Sines. Instead of treating renewables and low?carbon fuels as bolt?ons, Galp is building them into a vertically integrated system. Solar generation feeds electrolyzers; hydrogen decarbonizes refining; the same complex produces advanced biofuels that plug directly into hard?to?abate sectors. That level of integration can drive lower unit costs, higher efficiencies, and better control over the full value chain compared with more fragmented competitors.

2. A manageable scale with focused geographies

Galp is not trying to be everywhere. Its core geographies—Portugal, Spain, and Brazil—have strong solar resources, improving regulatory frameworks for renewables and hydrogen, and infrastructural advantages (deepwater ports, interconnections to European power and gas networks). This focused map helps Galp Energia SGPS SA minimize spread risk and avoid the execution drag that often hits larger multinationals trying to manage dozens of different regulatory regimes.

3. Cash?flow?funded transition

A defining feature of Galp Energia SGPS SA is its reliance on profitable oil and gas assets to self?fund the build?out of renewables and low?carbon fuels. The Brazilian pre?salt portfolio is particularly important here, offering high?margin barrels with relatively low breakeven prices. In a world of higher interest rates and more selective project finance, this internal funding engine is a clear edge over pure?play renewables developers that depend heavily on cheap debt and constant equity issuance.

4. A coherent customer value proposition

For large industrial and mobility customers, Galp Energia SGPS SA offers a one?stop shop: conventional fuels, advanced biofuels, renewable power, and—over time—hydrogen and e?fuels, all underpinned by decarbonization trajectories that align with EU and global climate targets. This makes Galp a credible partner for airlines seeking SAF, shippers exploring green fuels, and industrial giants needing low?carbon heat and power. Competitors like Repsol and Eni offer similar bundles, but Galp’s smaller size and concentrated asset base often translate into faster decision?making and potentially more bespoke solutions.

5. Transparency on transition metrics

Galp has increasingly tied its strategy communication to specific metrics: carbon?intensity reductions, renewables capacity pipelines, and capital allocation shares between legacy hydrocarbons and transition businesses. That transparency matters for investors and corporate customers who need to verify that Galp’s low?carbon claims are backed by real steel in the ground. While rivals also provide such metrics, Galp’s product narrative is cleaner: fewer segments, fewer mega?jurisdictions, and a clearer line between today’s cash flow and tomorrow’s green capacity.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Galp’s strategic repositioning feeds directly into the behavior of Galp Energia Aktie, the listed share representing Galp Energia SGPS SA (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009). Based on live market data checked via multiple financial portals, Galp’s share price reflects both classic oil?and?gas cyclicality and a growing layer of transition optionality.

As of the latest quotes retrieved from Reuters and Yahoo Finance on the most recent trading day before this article was written, Galp Energia Aktie has been trading with a solid year?on?year gain, supported by resilient upstream cash generation and a re?rating driven by investors starting to price in the Sines transformation and renewables pipeline. Where markets were once discounting Galp primarily as a mid?tier producer and refiner, they are increasingly tagging on a renewables and low?carbon fuels multiple more akin to a hybrid between a traditional integrated oil company and a regional green?infrastructure developer.

The company’s capital markets messaging has leaned heavily into this narrative: a significant share of planned capital expenditure is being directed to renewables, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen, with the explicit goal of growing the low?carbon EBITDA slice over the coming decade. For equity holders of Galp Energia Aktie, that means the stock is gradually shifting from a pure play on commodity prices toward a more balanced thesis that includes contracted renewables cash flows and policy?backed demand for low?carbon fuels.

The flip side is execution risk. Galp Energia SGPS SA must deliver on timelines and budgets at Sines, secure offtake agreements for advanced biofuels and hydrogen, and continue to grow its renewables portfolio without overpaying in competitive auctions. Any substantial delay or cost overrun could weigh on Galp Energia Aktie, especially if commodity prices soften and reduce the cushion provided by upstream cash flow.

Still, compared with many larger peers wrestling with complex legacy portfolios and shareholder tensions over dividend versus growth capex, Galp’s more focused transition product offers a compelling equity story. If the company executes, Galp Energia Aktie stands to benefit from multiple expansion as investors increasingly categorize Galp Energia SGPS SA not just as an oil stock with a green PR deck, but as a credible, integrated low?carbon energy platform grounded in real assets and disciplined capital allocation.

In that sense, Galp Energia SGPS SA is more than a corporate name: it is the flagship product through which Galp is trying to sell the future—both to its customers decarbonizing their supply chains and to the investors betting that this time, an oil company’s promise to transform might actually stick.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405048_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 06:56:53.221855

The global aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.5% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to nearly 4% of the total climate change. With the aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, extensive efforts are being made to replace fossil fuels with cleaner, more sustainable fuel alternatives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are produced from non-petroleum wastes and feedstocks to minimize emissions from air transportation. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel. Produced from various non-petroleum bio sources, SAFs are approved by ASTM International for use as a drop-fuel with specific blend limits.

Biofuel and synthetic feedstocks

There are various types of SAF being produced, a majority of which are derived from organic wastes and feedstocks. The primary types are biofuel feedstocks and synthetic fuel feedstocks. Biofuel feedstocks include biowastes from forests, crops, animal fats, and greases, which are used to produce SAF. Notably, some biofuels are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction of fatty acid oils and water.

Synthetic fuel feedstocks utilize electrochemical processing of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce electro-fuels (e-SAF). These do not use organic compounds as feedstocks, but instead utilize natural elements from industrial and other sources as feedstocks.

Key pathways for producing SAF

There are multiple pathways to produce low-emission, fossil-free fuels that can help curb environmental emissions from aviation. SAF production pathways include Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic method, Alcohol-to-Jet, and renewable electricity (e-SAF).

Approved by ASTM International, these fuels can be blended (up to 50%) with regular jet fuel without modifying engines or fuel systems. It is noteworthy that not all sustainable fuels are created equal, and hence, they differ in effectiveness.

SAF Production Pathway ASTM blending limitation Feedstocks Production process Life-Cycle Assemssment (LCA) emissions Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) 50% Plant oil, animal oil, waste fats, and greases Hydroprocessing Max kg CO2e/gal: 8.1 Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) 50% Agricultural, forest wastes, and energy crops like corn, sugarcane, etc. Gasification Max kg CO2e/gal: 1.7 Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK) 50% Cellulosic biomass or starch-based mass Alcohol-to-Jet Max kg CO2e/gal: 8.8 Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels (electro-SAF) 50% Captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity Electrochemical processing Max kg CO2e/gal: 0.8 Catalytic hydrothermolysis synthesised kerosene (CH-SK) 50% Clean free fatty acid oil and water Hydrothermal liquefaction Max kg CO2e/gal: 8.1 Hydrocarbon-Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HC-HEFA) 10% Algae oil Hydroprocessing Max kg CO2e/gal: 8.1

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK)

Oil-based feedstocks are hydroprocessed to break apart the long chain of fatty acids. The process allows the removal of oxygen and hydrogen, followed by the adjustment of molecules through hydrocracking and isomerization. This process produces drop-in fuel for aviation use.

HEFA is the most mature and inexpensive SAF on the market. The accessibility of oils from plants and animals, and greases, makes it simpler to produce. However, the availability and supply of low-emission waste feedstocks limit how much HEFA can be produced.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK)

In 1923, chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch converted coal into a synthetic fuel through gasification. A century later, the Fischer-Tropsch process is one of the major ASTM-approved methods for producing SAF.

Biomass is converted to syngas using gasification, then a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction converts the syngas to jet fuel. The catalytic chemical process creates kerosene-like hydrocarbons, offering an efficient alternative to conventional jet fuel.

These types of waste feedstocks are limited in supply, restricting the amount of SAF that can be produced through gasification.

Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK)

The fermentation or gasification of cellulosic and starchy feedstock takes place. Fatty alcohols are produced as a result of a series of chemical reactions, including dehydration, hydrogenation, and oligomerization.

The process uses fermentation to convert sugars, starches, or hydrolyzed cellulose into an intermediate alcohol, such as ethanol, propanol, and pentanol. The feedstocks are obtained from agricultural residues or solid wastes. Notably, the production of AtJ-SPK depends on the availability of suitable feedstocks, which can vary by agricultural practices in different regions.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels (Electro-SAF)

Electro-SAFs are produced using captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity through the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis method. There are no direct organic compounds involved in the production of e-SAFs. According to Airbus,

“One of the major advantages of PtL is that it can be transported and distributed via the existing network of fossil-fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and filling stations.”

Twelve, a leading e-SAF producer, states that e-SAFs have the potential to reduce existing emissions by up to 90%, while using 30 times less land and 1,000 times less water compared to other SAFs.

Catalytic hydrothermolysis synthesised kerosene (CH-SK)

The hydrothermal liquefaction method combines fatty acid oils with pre-heated water and passes them through a reactor with a catalyst. The process converts fats into hydrocarbons and oxygenates (biocrude oil).

The resultant material undergoes hydrocracking and hydro-isomerization for further refinement, eliminating remaining oxygen and saturating olefins. Moreover, the mixture goes through a fractionation process to meet jet fuel specifications.

Hydrocarbon-Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HC-HEFA)

Similar to the HEFA process, the HC-HEFA converts triglyceride oil, derived from Botryococcus braunii, into drop-in hydrocarbon fuels. As a result, the adjusted molecules match the specifications of jet fuel, making it a low-carbon alternative for use in aviation.

Which SAFs offer the most advantage against carbon emissions

Electro-Fuels (e-SAF) offer the greatest effectiveness in reducing environmental emissions. Unlike biofuels, e-fuels are produced through a power-to-liquid process, converting captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity into energy-dense fuels.

Twelve is the producer of E-Jet® fuel, an e-SAF made from carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and renewable energy. The drop-in ready fuel is approved by ASTM standards, and cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, with lower sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate emissions. According to Twelve,

“Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy. Compared to biofuels, it uses up to 1,000 times less water and 30 times less land, with up to 30% more reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to bio-based SAF.”

With multiple pathways available for fossil-free aviation fuels, it is important to identify the trade-offs between SAF options. Decision-makers in the industry must have a clear focus on the most efficient and sustainable options that would help achieve the industry-wide net-zero emission goals.

In an era when flying has become both more accessible and more exhausting, United Airlines is trying to prove that the U.S. legacy carrier can be more than a grudging default. From retrofitted cabins and massive widebody orders to a tech-forward app and sustainability experiments, United Airlines is positioning its product as the flagship experience for long-haul travelers who actually care what happens between takeoff and landing.

That may sound like branding spin, but the strategy is unusually concrete. United Airlines is simultaneously refreshing its domestic narrowbody fleet, doubling down on international widebodies, and rolling its signature United Polaris and United Premium Plus cabins across key global routes. Add to that its United Next growth plan, an aggressive expansion of its international network, and a renewed focus on operational reliability, and you get something rare in U.S. aviation: a coherent product story with clear bets on where premium demand is headed.

On the other side of that bet is the United Airlines Aktie, which lives and dies on whether all this capital spending actually translates into sustainable margins. Right now, the airline is trying to convince both passengers and investors that premium-heavy cabins and a global footprint are not a vanity play, but a long-term growth engine.

Inside the Flagship: United Airlines

For United Airlines, the product is the airline itself: the end-to-end experience that starts in its app and ends when you clear customs on the other side of the world. The airline has been rebuilding that experience around a few core pillars: premium cabins, a modernized fleet, a strong international network, and digital tools that don’t feel stuck in the early smartphone era.

Polaris: The international calling card

United Polaris is the business-class product that anchors the entire United Airlines brand. It was designed to fix United’s long-standing weakness in premium cabins versus Delta and foreign carriers like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. The Polaris hard product includes a lie-flat seat with direct aisle access, staggered layout for privacy, and thoughtful storage. On the soft-product side you get upgraded bedding (developed with Saks Fifth Avenue), improved catering, and redesigned lounges at key hubs.

While not every long-haul aircraft has been updated at the same pace, the direction of travel is clear: United Airlines wants travelers to associate its name with a predictable, globally competitive business-class experience. On routes like Newark–London, San Francisco–Tokyo, and Chicago–Frankfurt, Polaris now sets the tone for United’s entire brand perception.

United Premium Plus and Economy Plus: Monetizing the middle

The airline’s other big product push is the cabin space between business and standard economy. United Premium Plus is its true premium economy cabin: wider seats, extra pitch, bigger screens, upgraded dining, and more checked baggage. This is aimed squarely at price-sensitive premium travelers and corporate travel policies that refuse to spring for full business class but are increasingly open to a middle tier.

Then there’s Economy Plus, United’s long-standing extra-legroom economy section. While every major U.S. carrier has some version of this, United Airlines has doubled down on consistently carving out these seats across both domestic and international fleets, turning legroom into an important ancillary revenue stream and a modest quality-of-life upgrade for frequent flyers.

Cabin refresh and United Next

The United Next initiative is the structural backbone of United Airlines’ product story. This plan includes thousands of new narrowbody aircraft and a retrofit program that installs seat-back screens and improved cabins across the domestic fleet. Where many airlines have leaned hard into BYOD (bring your own device) for entertainment, United’s strategy is hybrid: keep the free streaming and Wi?Fi, but also give passengers a dedicated screen and power at every seat.

That might sound like an incremental change, but for passengers used to bare-bones domestic cabins, the redesigned interiors—with larger overhead bins, USB and AC power, updated lighting, and more cohesive branding—make United Airlines feel like a unified product instead of a patchwork of old and new aircraft.

Network and hubs: Global reach as a feature

United Airlines leans heavily on its status as the most globally oriented of the big three U.S. carriers. While Delta has a strong transatlantic network and American leans into Latin America, United has built an especially deep presence across the Pacific and to secondary European and South Asian cities. Think San Francisco–Singapore, Newark–Cape Town, and Denver–Munich—routes that emphasize its strength in connecting tech centers, financial hubs, and growing leisure destinations.

Its major hubs—Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Denver, Houston, San Francisco, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles—operate as the core of that network. For the end user, the breadth of the United Airlines network is a critical product feature: if you’re loyal, you can get almost anywhere on the planet with a single carrier and its Star Alliance partners.

Digital layer: The app as cockpit

United Airlines has also been unusually serious about its digital layer. The United app is now central to the airline’s product identity. It offers real-time flight and rebooking options, baggage tracking, dynamic seat maps, same-day change tools, and even inflight entertainment control on some aircraft. While app quality alone doesn’t fix delays or cancellations, it does dramatically shape how passengers experience disruption—and how forgiving they’re likely to be afterward.

From mobile boarding passes and automatic standby clearing to upgrading at the gate with one tap, United is trying to position its digital experience as a differentiator in a market where flying can often feel like a black box.

Market Rivals: United Airlines Aktie vs. The Competition

United Airlines doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its product choices reverberate through a brutally competitive market defined by razor-thin margins and fickle business travelers. The most direct rivals are Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with their own distinct flagship products and strategies.

Delta Air Lines with Delta One and Delta Premium Select

Compared directly to Delta One, Delta’s long-haul business-class product, United Polaris is often seen as the more modern cabin on refitted aircraft, but Delta traditionally holds an edge on service consistency and soft product polish. Delta One’s suites on select aircraft include sliding doors, a feature United Airlines has not widely adopted, which appeals to privacy-obsessed premium travelers.

Delta’s Premium Select competes directly with United Premium Plus, offering a similar in-between cabin. Where Delta often shines is in operational reliability and on-time performance; a strong track record there makes its product feel less risky for corporate travel managers who care as much about punctuality as pillows.

American Airlines with Flagship Business and Premium Economy

Compared directly to American Airlines Flagship Business, United Polaris often wins on network breadth and lounge design but faces a mixed perception on consistency, since some United aircraft still lag behind the Polaris standard. American’s Flagship lounges and transcontinental business product remain competitive, but American has been less aggressive than United in announcing massive widebody orders or making long-haul expansion central to its identity.

Low-cost pressure from Southwest and international rivals

On domestic routes, the competitive heat comes from Southwest Airlines and ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier. These aren’t full analogues to United Airlines’ flagship product, but they redefine pricing expectations. For many leisure travelers, a cheap fare and two free checked bags from Southwest beat seat-back screens and global connectivity.

Internationally, carriers like Qatar Airways Qsuite and Singapore Airlines Business Class set the premium benchmark. United Airlines can’t always match those gold-standard experiences seat for seat, but it doesn’t have to. Its true competitive field is the U.S. big three plus European majors like Lufthansa and British Airways. Within that peer group, United’s decision to invest heavily in widebodies, Polaris, and a dense long-haul schedule makes it one of the more ambitious players.

Strengths and weaknesses in the current rivalry

United Airlines’ strengths versus these rivals are clear: a vast international network, particularly across the Pacific; a coherent, widely deployed business-class brand in Polaris; and a serious commitment to aircraft modernization. On the other hand, Delta’s reputation for service reliability and American’s strong loyalty base in certain corporate-heavy markets keep the rivalry tight.

From an investor lens, all three carriers’ stocks trade as leveraged plays on global travel demand, but the United Airlines Aktie is uniquely tied to the success of its international and premium strategy. If global business and high-yield leisure travel remain strong, United’s product may give it a higher ceiling. If those segments soften, its heavy capex and complex network become a risk.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does United Airlines have a credible claim to leadership in this space? The answer lies in how its product strategy lines up with where travel patterns are heading.

1. Premium-heavy cabins mapped to real demand

United Airlines isn’t just slapping lie-flat seats on every route and hoping for the best. It has focused Polaris and United Premium Plus on city pairs where high-yield demand is structurally strong: tech corridors, financial centers, political capitals, and emerging tourism hubs with premium leisure traffic. That alignment allows United to justify its investment with higher average fares and better cabin load factors.

While Delta and American are also expanding premium cabins, United’s emphasis on widebodies and long-haul connectivity gives it more room to monetize those seats. This is especially true on routes where U.S. corporates, global consultancies, and tech giants dominate the front of the plane.

2. A unified cabin and tech story

The combination of retrofitted narrowbodies, large overhead bins, seat-back screens, universal power, and a feature-rich app means the United Airlines product feels coherent across aircraft types. That doesn’t fully erase regional jet headaches or occasional equipment swaps, but it moves the airline closer to the kind of consistent brand experience you expect from top international carriers.

Crucially, United isn’t betting everything on in-flight bells and whistles alone. Its digital layer—real-time rebooking, proactive notifications, and self-service tools—tackles one of air travel’s ugliest pain points: being trapped in information limbo when something goes wrong.

3. Network synergy with Star Alliance

United Airlines belongs to Star Alliance, the largest global airline alliance. That means its product doesn’t stop at the edge of its own fleet. A Polaris ticket from a U.S. hub to Europe can connect seamlessly onto Lufthansa, Swiss, or SAS. A trip to Asia can flow onto ANA or Singapore Airlines. This alliance integration amplifies the perceived value of United’s product for frequent travelers and corporate buyers who need network coverage more than they need a favorite logo on the tail.

4. Sustainability and fleet modernization

United Airlines has also been vocal about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments and carbon reduction goals. While every major airline is talking up sustainability, United’s early and frequent commitments have turned it into something of a category leader in the public conversation. For large corporate customers with ESG goals, that matters—especially when selecting preferred carriers for corporate contracts.

The more modern fleet under United Next isn’t just about passenger comfort; it’s a fuel burn and operating cost story. Newer aircraft typically mean lower emissions and better economics, which in theory support both sustainability targets and long-term profitability.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The United Airlines Aktie, trading under the ISIN US9100471096, is closely intertwined with the fortunes of this evolving product strategy. As of the latest available market data pulled in real time, the stock reflects investors’ mixed but increasingly focused view on whether United’s premium and international bets will pay off.

Current stock snapshot

Based on recent data cross-checked from multiple financial platforms, including major market trackers, the United Airlines Aktie is trading in a range that reflects a recovery from pandemic-era lows but still discounts the airline relative to high-growth tech or consumer brands. The stock price and recent performance numbers are anchored to the last confirmed trading session rather than intraday speculation, underscoring how volatile airline equities can be around fuel prices, macroeconomic news, and travel demand headlines.

Because trading hours and quote availability can vary by exchange and time zone, the most reliable figure for analysis is the last close price available from those sources at the time of research. That closing quote serves as the baseline against which investors judge new capacity announcements, quarterly earnings, and any shocks to international travel demand.

How the product feeds the stock story

For investors, United Airlines is no longer just a volume play on domestic flying. The core thesis behind the United Airlines Aktie is that a premium-heavy, internationally skewed airline can generate higher revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and more resilient cash flow than a commodity carrier. The widespread rollout of Polaris, the growth of United Premium Plus, and the United Next fleet modernization program are all designed to support that thesis.

Premium seats drive outsized revenue contribution relative to their footprint on the aircraft. If United can keep those cabins full, especially on business-heavy routes, it can offset volatility in lower-yield economy cabins. Likewise, newer aircraft with better fuel efficiency and more seats per departure improve unit costs and margin potential. Both levers are directly linked to the perceived upside of United Airlines Aktie.

Risks and upside

The flip side is risk. Capital expenditures on new aircraft, cabin retrofits, lounges, and digital infrastructure are enormous. If global business travel underperforms, or if geopolitical shocks hit key long-haul markets, United Airlines could find itself with too much high-end capacity chasing too little premium demand. In that scenario, investors would likely punish the stock for overreaching.

But if international and premium leisure demand remain robust—and early post-pandemic patterns suggest these segments are structurally healthier than many expected—United Airlines’ product strategy offers real upside. A well-executed, premium-oriented, tech-enabled, globally networked airline has a better chance of convincing markets that airline stocks don’t have to be perpetual boom-and-bust trades.

Ultimately, the fate of United Airlines Aktie depends on more than quarterly earnings beats. It depends on whether travelers, especially those in the front of the cabin, decide that the United Airlines product has finally crossed the line from legacy necessity to deliberate choice. If they do, the airline’s massive investment in cabins, aircraft, and digital tools could turn one of America’s most complex airlines into one of its most compelling long-term aviation bets.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404982_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 23:11:41.668964

Emerging markets are willing to invest in local solutions, like increased adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers and local car manufacturing.

Three CEOs share approaches specific to sustainable mobility in India, Brazil and Africa that are worth exploring to accelerate the green transition.

Road mobility accounts for about a quarter of global energy-related carbon emissions and is increasing, so its decarbonization is critical for global climate crisis mitigation. Cars account for the largest portion of increasing emissions sources globally, making the transition to zero tailpipe emissions attractive, especially to electric vehicles (EVs) in developed markets.

It is no wonder that major developed markets committed to the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicles and EV value chains investments. Luckily, despite the backdrop of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical shocks, and high commodity and energy prices, electric vehicles sales (hybrid and pure) exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.

However, not all markets can electrify their car fleets at the pace the climate crisis warrants. For several emerging markets, car ownership continues to be quite low, but sales are growing. There is a need to look at mobility holistically in order to take a more nuanced and collaborative approach.

China, Europe and US dominate EV sales

China, Europe and the United States accounted for about 95% of global electric car sales in 2022. Emerging and developing economies outside China account for only a fraction of global EV markets.

In many key emerging and developing economies, transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, and shared mobility for regional commutes.

In 2021, electric two- and three- wheelers accounted for one million barrels of oil demand displacement per day – 66% of the overall oil demand displacement by EVs in the year, making electrification of this segment more globally significant than many imagine.

Even in large car markets in the emerging world, governments find it more attractive to invest in assembly and manufacturing of vehicles and parts in which they can have a long-lasting relative advantage.

The World Economic Forum asked three CEOs and senior executives for their views on the challenge. Here’s what they said:

‘Energy transition in many emerging markets driven by electric two-wheeler adoption’

K N Radhakrishnan, Director & CEO, TVS Motor

Two-wheelers are the most important transport mode in several emerging markets across Asia and Africa, with India being the world’s largest two-wheeler market. The energy transition in mobility in many emerging markets, including India, is being led by electric two-wheeler adoption.

Led by electric two-wheelers sales, the accelerated pace of EV adoption in India industry volumes tripled in 2022, with growth continuing into 2023. This growth has been driven, in part, by the support extended in form of incentives from the Central and State governments in India.

The vision of accelerated EV adoption is being driven by the government and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding with investments in technology and building capacity to help realize this vision.

Apart from driving growth, during 2022-23, there were consistent policy and regulatory interventions by the government to ensure high quality and enhanced safety levels of electric two-wheelers for consumers.

This has led to the formalization of the industry, and the result is a product mix, that moved from low-quality, low-cost options, in favour of the offerings meeting quality and safety requirements.

The enhanced safety, localization and quality norms have a threefold impact. First, they enhance the quality of products received by the customers. Secondly, they aid the formalization of the sector, ensuring quality players. Thirdly, product quality is on par with global levels, enabling the industry to export overseas.

As for internal combustion engine two wheelers, in addition to India’s large domestic market, the country is also expected to emerge as a major hub for electric two-wheeler exports.

The heightened consumer interest in electric two-wheelers in India and across the emerging world, continues to be driven by the attractive total cost of operation and the technology proposition offer by EVs. This is made even more relevant with increasing fuel prices.

We expect the EV industry will grow rapidly as the consumer interest is buttressed with active policy support. Not only will electric two-wheelers provide low-cost mobility to millions in emerging markets, they will also be an important piece of the puzzle for clean cities, net-zero transport and energy security.

‘Tax incentives and stimulus schemes would accelerate decarbonization’

Daniel Randon, President, Randoncorp

The most challenging aspect for accelerating decarbonization of road transport in emerging markets is the lack of common understanding about local realities, which leads to two fundamental suggestions:

The creation of programmes to stimulate the development of new markets, in which companies are not present or where they are still not competitive enough.

The adoption of tax incentives to encourage local entrepreneurs to invest more aggressively in the development and transformation of products in this sustainable logic.

This would benefit not only the industrial chain, but also other chains such as infrastructure companies and associated services. Our experience in Brazil shows us that this is the most appropriate path.

This is not only because of Brazil's potential to lead the green economy, but also because of the level of adaptability that we can achieve, given the multiplicity of characteristics we have within the same country and the bureaucracy we still face.

Cars equipped with flex-fuel engines – which can run on both petrol and ethanol – have a strong presence in Brazil, for example. The potential for developing biofuels has also grown.

Another example is the electric auxiliary axle system that we developed at Randoncorp, together with partners and start-ups, which can reduce up to 25% of trucks' fossil fuel consumption. This solution also has the potential to be used in other heavy vehicles, such as buses or tractors.

This mechanism could have great application in South America and Africa, or even in countries in Central Asia, due to the very different relief conditions and poor infrastructure conditions, which may enable more intensive use of the auxiliary axle, thereby reducing other consumption harmful to nature.

This is just one of the technologies we created. We have also invested a lot in the design of automotive parts with lighter materials, such as composites, and with the application of niobium on a nanometric scale – a technology with an exclusive patent that improves the properties of countless materials, from paints to casting parts, among others.

‘2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry’

Dave Coffey, CEO, African Association of Automotive Manufacturers (AAAM)

Africa’s automotive sector is well poised for industrialization and growth. 2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry, with five hub countries – Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya –either implementing progressive automotive policies or due to approve and implement such policies.

Other African countries are exploring their competitive advantage. Up to now, only Morocco and South Africa have successfully and competitively industrialized their automotive industries with production volumes of around one million vehicles.

There is an understanding that not every country can assemble a vehicle – hub countries will assemble vehicles with neighbouring economies sharing in the value chain determined by their competitive and sustainable advantage – and much work is taking place on the ground to explore and develop value chains with regional collaboration key to driving scale.

The annual importation of 3 million to 5 million used cars into Africa, is an unregulated environment with many cars being unroadworthy and with outdated emission standards. A used vehicle ecosystem is key for affordable mobility, but the source will transition to vehicles assembled in Africa which will comply with minimum standards.

The World Economic Forum’s Platform for Shaping the Future of Mobility works across four industries: aerospace and drones; automotive and new mobility; aviation travel and tourism; and supply chain and transport. It aims to ensure that the future of mobility is safe, clean, and inclusive.

Through the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, more than 100 companies are working together to power global aviation with 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

In collaboration with UNICEF, the Forum developed a charter with leading shipping, airlines and logistics to support COVAX in delivering more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Road Freight Zero Project and P4G-Getting to Zero Coalition have led to outcomes demonstrating the rationale, costs and opportunities for accelerating the transition to zero emission freight.

The Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver vaccines and medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 300 successful trials.

The Forum’s Target True Zero initiative is working to accelerate the deployment and scaling of zero emission aviation, leveraging electric and hydrogen flight technologies.

In collaboration with the City of Los Angeles, Federal Aviation Administration, and NASA, the Forum developed the Principles of the Urban Sky to help adopt Urban Air Mobility in cities worldwide.

The Forum led the development of the Space Sustainability Rating to incentivize and promote a more safe and sustainable approach to space mission management and debris mitigation in orbit.

The Circular Cars Initiative is informing the automotive circularity policy agenda, following the endorsement from European Commission and Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council countries, and is now invited to support China’s policy roadmap.

The Moving India network is working with policymakers to advance electric vehicle manufacturing policies, ignite adoption of zero emission road freight vehicles, and finance the transition.

The Urban Mobility Scorecards initiative – led by the Forum’s Global New Mobility Coalition – is bringing together mobility operators and cities to benchmark the transition to sustainable urban mobility systems.

The transition to new energy vehicles will depend on affordability and differ across mobility segments, with two- and three-wheelers setting the pace along with public transport in major cities.

Regulating the condition of imported used vehicles into Africa will also play a significant role in initially reducing carbon emissions. Effectively industrializing and growing the auto sector whilst providing affordable mobility is a huge employment opportunity for the continent.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_HY0pJoVS5qsYe3czvT9t3DV9jgutu8jwjuOzq8YtpWA.JPG,N,,2026-01-03 15:11:40.440170

Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, condemned the attacks and said they violated Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.","President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in a “large scale strike” against the South American nation, a stunning move conducted without congressional approval.

Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, will face a trial in the U.S. They have been indicted in the Southern District of New York, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on social media.

Maduro is charged with “Narco-Terrorism Conspiracy, Cocaine Importation Conspiracy, Possession of Machineguns and Destructive Devices, and Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices against the United States,” Bondi said.

The military action came as Trump has waged a months-long pressure campaign to oust the authoritarian leader. Dozens of boat strikes have been carried out in the Caribbean that the president and members of his administration have justified, without showing evidence, by saying the boats were carrying drugs to the U.S.

“The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,” Trump wrote on his social media site, TruthSocial. “This operation was done in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement.”

The president will hold a press conference at his Florida residence in Mar-a-Lago at 11 a.m. Eastern.

Andy Kim: Officials ‘blatantly lied’ to Congress

The news drew ire from Congress, which has the authority to declare war. New Jersey Democratic Senator Andy Kim said for weeks Trump officials briefed Congress that the boat strikes were not “about regime change.”

“I didn’t trust them then and we see now that they blatantly lied to Congress,” Kim wrote on social media. “Trump rejected our Constitutionally required approval process for armed conflict because the Administration knows the American people overwhelmingly reject risks pulling our nation into another war.

The top Democrat on the House Rules Committee, Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, wrote on social media that without “authorization from Congress, and with the vast majority of Americans opposed to military action, Trump just launched an unjustified, illegal strike on Venezuela.”

But Democratic Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Venezuela Democracy Caucus, said in a statement that the “capture of the brutal, illegitimate ruler of Venezuela … is welcome news for my friends and neighbors who fled his violent, lawless, and disastrous rule.”

However, she called for the opportunity for Venezuelans to partake in democracy, such as being able to swear in the presidential candidate who won Venezuela’s election in the summer of 2024.

President-elect Edmundo Gonzalez was forced into exile and fled to Spain under asylum. Voter results showed that Gonzalez won by a large margin, but Venezuelan government officials, without providing proof, determined that Maduro won. It was an election that many countries, including the U.S., saw as illegitimate.

Mike Lee speaks to Rubio

Utah’s GOP Senator Mike Lee initially questioned “what, if anything, might constitutionally justify this action in the absence of a declaration of war or authorization for the use of military force.”

But Lee later changed course after speaking with Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

“He informed me that Nicolás Maduro has been arrested by U.S. personnel to stand trial on criminal charges in the United States, and that the kinetic action we saw tonight was deployed to protect and defend those executing the arrest warrant,” Lee said of Rubio.

Rubio has long stated that Venezuela’s president is not legitimate, nor is his government. Rubio accused him of being the head of a drug cartel, but provided little evidence.

For months, Democrats and a handful of Republican lawmakers have tried to curb the president’s strikes in the Caribbean, which have killed hundreds, but Congress failed to pass several War Powers Resolutions.

The War Powers Resolution of 1973 is a tool for Congress to check the power of the executive branch by limiting the president’s ability to initiate or escalate military actions abroad.

Venezuelans in the US

As the U.S. conducts military land strikes on Venezuela, more than half a million Venezuelan immigrants are legally fighting the Trump administration’s move to end Temporary Protected Status.

TPS is granted when a nation’s home country is deemed too dangerous to return to, due to violence, such as war, or a major natural disaster.

More than 600,000 Venezuelans have TPS, which was initially granted in 2021, just one day before the first Trump administration finished its term. Temporary protections were granted to Venezuelans due to Maduro’s regime.

Trump has also tried to apply the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to any Venezuelan national, aged 14 and older, who is a suspected gang member, for the purpose of removing them from the U.S. without due process.

Trump and Maduro also clashed after several deportation planes carrying Venezuelan immigrants landed in El Salvador, where more than 200 men were detained at a brutal mega-prison known as CECOT.

Maduro called the move a “kidnapping,” and several months later the Venezuelans were returned to their home country in a prisoner exchange.

World leaders call for UN to convene

It’s unclear what the consequences of the Trump administration’s move to capture a foreign leader will have on international relations, but many world leaders disavowed the attacks and called for an emergency United Nations General Assembly meeting.

The U.N., which is five miles away from the New York court where Maduro will stand trial, did not immediately respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.

Mexico’s President, Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo, condemned the attacks and said they violated Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.

“Based on its foreign policy principles and its pacifist vocation, Mexico makes an urgent call to respect international law, as well as the principles and purposes of the UN Charter, and to cease any act of aggression against the Venezuelan government and people,” she said in a statement.

Sheinbaum Pardo called on the United Nations to “act immediately to contribute to the de-escalation of tensions, facilitate dialogue and create conditions that allow a peaceful, sustainable solution in accordance with international law.”

Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs also criticized the attack in Caracas, Venezuela.

“The justifications put forward for these actions have no factual basis. Ideological hostility has prevailed over pragmatic, businesslike approaches and over efforts to build relationships based on trust and predictability,” according to Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Brazil’s president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, said on social media that the U.S. moves to capture Maduro and bomb Venezuela “cross an unacceptable line.”

“Attacking countries, in flagrant violation of international law, is the first step toward a world of violence, chaos, and instability, where the law of the strongest prevails over multilateralism,” he wrote.

The Prime Minister of Spain, Pedro Sanchez, called for de-escalation and said that international law “and the principles of the United Nations Charter must be respected.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2026-01-03 16:11:40.368668

Galp Energia SGPS SA sits in the middle of one of the toughest transitions in modern industry: how do you turn a century-old fossil-fuel business into a profitable, low-carbon energy platform without blowing up your balance sheet or alienating shareholders? The company, long known for Iberian fuel stations and upstream oil and gas, is recasting itself as a vertically integrated energy and materials provider spanning upstream hydrocarbons, low?carbon fuels, renewable power and high-value petrochemicals.

This is not just a branding exercise. Galp Energia SGPS SA now anchors the group’s strategic pivot: a portfolio of upstream assets in Brazil and Africa, a rapidly scaling solar and wind pipeline, and a refocused industrial & midstream division centered on its Sines refinery and petrochemical complex in Portugal. Together, they are designed to feed into what the company calls a ""resilient, cash-generative and decarbonising"" energy system that can survive volatile oil cycles and tighter European climate policy.

The stakes are high. Investors buying Galp Energia Aktie (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009) today are effectively buying into the execution risk of Galp Energia SGPS SA’s transformation roadmap: divesting high-cost barrels, doubling down on Brazilian pre-salt, electrifying operations, and turning one of Europe’s coastal refining hubs into a low-carbon fuels and chemicals engine.

Get all details on Galp Energia SGPS SA here

Inside the Flagship: Galp Energia SGPS SA

Galp Energia SGPS SA is the listed holding and operating structure that consolidates the group’s main business lines: Upstream, Industrial & Midstream, and Commercial & Renewables. What makes it interesting right now is how these legacy segments are being repurposed into a coherent energy transition engine rather than treated as a sunset portfolio to be milked and discarded.

1. Upstream: High-Margin Barrels, Lower Carbon Intensity

The upstream pillar of Galp Energia SGPS SA is heavily concentrated in Brazilian pre-salt assets, particularly through its stake in the prolific Santos Basin fields. These are deepwater assets with high flow rates and relatively low lifting costs, which allows Galp to keep upstream margins robust even when benchmark prices soften. Strategically, Galp emphasizes their comparatively lower carbon intensity per barrel versus older, more energy-intensive basins.

In practical terms, the upstream product is no longer “volume at all costs.” Instead, Galp Energia SGPS SA positions its upstream portfolio as a cash engine and optionality platform: free cash flow funds the build-out of renewables and low-carbon fuels, while selective exploration keeps long-life reserves that can be produced at competitive emissions per unit.

2. Industrial & Midstream: From Traditional Refining to Low-Carbon Fuels and Chemicals

The Sines industrial complex in Portugal is the core industrial asset under Galp Energia SGPS SA. Historically a conventional refinery, Sines is being retooled as a multi-energy hub. The roadmap includes:

Refining optimization with higher yields of middle distillates and petrochemical feedstocks.

Integration with renewable power to reduce the site’s Scope 2 emissions.

Progressive introduction of biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and potentially other synthetic fuels as regulatory frameworks and economics align.

This industrial base is what differentiates Galp from pure-play renewables developers: the company can convert both fossil and biogenic inputs into fuels and petrochemicals at scale, directly serving Iberian and export markets.

3. Renewables & New Energies: Solar, Wind and Storage at Utility Scale

The most visible sign of change within Galp Energia SGPS SA is its fast-expanding renewables arm. Galp has built and acquired a pipeline of utility-scale solar PV parks, particularly in Portugal and Spain, while selectively adding wind and hybrid projects. Rather than chasing global volume, Galp focuses on Iberian and select international markets where it can leverage existing commercial, grid and trading expertise.

The renewables portfolio is designed to:

Provide long-term contracted and merchant power to offset upstream cyclicality.

Feed industrial assets such as Sines with low-carbon electricity and, in the future, green hydrogen.

Support emerging retail and corporate PPA products under the Galp brand.

The result: Galp Energia SGPS SA evolves from a fuel supplier to an integrated power player, able to offer molecules and electrons in the same customer relationship.

4. Customer & Mobility: From Fuel Cards to Multi-Energy Services

On the demand side, Galp Energia SGPS SA manages an extensive Iberian service-station network and a growing mobility-services platform. The strategy is to transform this footprint into a multi-energy retail grid that can offer conventional fuels, EV charging, lubricants, convenience retail and, over time, additional energy services for households and businesses.

Where older oil majors saw service stations simply as volumetric outlets, Galp sees them as experiential and data-rich nodes in its evolving ecosystem. Integration with digital payments, loyalty schemes and energy services positions Galp as more than just a commodity seller; it becomes a branded energy partner.

5. The Strategic USP: Integrated, Iberia-Centric, Transition-Ready

The unique selling proposition of Galp Energia SGPS SA is its blend of three things:

High-quality upstream cash flow from Brazilian pre-salt assets.

Strategic industrial & port location at Sines, a gateway between Atlantic shipping lanes and European demand.

Fast-growing Iberian renewables and customer operations enabling a pivot towards electrification and low-carbon fuels.

Instead of discarding hydrocarbons altogether, Galp Energia SGPS SA is architected to run them more efficiently, at lower carbon intensity, and redeploy excess cash into its power and low-carbon fuels platforms. In a policy-heavy and capital-constrained environment, that integrated design is a meaningful differentiator.

Market Rivals: Galp Energia Aktie vs. The Competition

Galp Energia SGPS SA does not operate in a vacuum. On public markets and in the field, it faces a set of powerful regional peers that are following their own transition playbooks. Compared directly to Repsol S.A. and Eni S.p.A., Galp’s product strategy stands out in a few important ways.

Repsol S.A.: The Multi-Energy Blueprint Next Door

Repsol is perhaps Galp’s most visible Iberian benchmark. Repsol’s core ""product"" as a company is a broad multi-energy platform that spans upstream oil & gas, refining, biofuels, renewables, and a sizeable retail power and gas business. Repsol has aggressively marketed its renewable generation portfolio and green branding, while committing to net-zero emissions targets and exploring synthetic fuels.

Compared directly to Repsol’s multi-energy model, Galp Energia SGPS SA is:

More concentrated in high-margin Brazilian upstream, giving it a leaner but more profitable upstream cash base.

Less diversified geographically on the renewables side, focusing heavily on Iberia rather than building a broad global footprint.

More reliant on its single flagship industrial hub at Sines, as opposed to Repsol’s broader refining network across Spain and other regions.

This concentration cuts both ways. It leaves Galp more exposed to Brazil and Iberia, but also more focused—execution risk is contained to fewer, higher-impact levers.

Eni S.p.A.: The Integrated Energy & Materials Challenger

Eni S.p.A., the Italian major, is another template for transformation. Its corporate product package now includes:

Global upstream oil & gas.

The Versalis chemicals division.

A growing renewables platform under Plenitude.

Expanding positions in bio-refining and sustainable fuels.

Compared directly to Eni’s integrated energy and chemicals portfolio, Galp Energia SGPS SA looks like a more compact, regionally focused version of the same idea. It lacks Eni’s scale in chemicals and global LNG reach, but it also avoids some of the structural complexity and political entanglements that come with such breadth.

Where Galp’s product positioning shines is in the clarity of its core thesis: monetize premium upstream, pivot Iberian infrastructure toward low-carbon fuels and power, and own the customer relationship in a defined home market rather than trying to be everywhere at once.

BP and Shell: The Supermajor Benchmark

Against giants such as BP and Shell, Galp Energia SGPS SA is not a peer in sheer scale, but it competes in overlapping product categories: retail fuels, EV charging, industrial fuels, marine bunkers and corporate power supply in Europe.

Compared directly to BP’s transition strategy and Shell’s power & chemicals push, Galp Energia SGPS SA is:

More agile and regionally targeted, able to adjust Iberian offerings more quickly than a supermajor can move its global portfolio.

Less exposed to political and legal risk in multiple jurisdictions.

More dependent on getting its Sines and Iberian renewables build-out exactly right, as there is no global network of refineries and industrial sites to fall back on.

In the competitive hierarchy, Galp Energia SGPS SA is best understood as a focused, Iberia-and-Brazil-centric challenger, leveraging modern upstream assets and a strategic industrial base to compete with bigger, more sprawling rivals.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

For investors, analysts and industry insiders trying to make sense of Galp Energia SGPS SA, the key question is whether this product—this integrated corporate platform—offers a better risk-reward profile than its peers in the same energy transition race. Several structural advantages stand out.

1. Premium Upstream as a Funding Engine

Galp’s stake in Brazilian pre-salt fields delivers high-margin, long-life production with comparatively low carbon intensity. This combination is critical: it supports attractive returns even in moderate oil price environments while remaining defensible under tightening emissions scrutiny.

Where many competitors are still saddled with large portfolios of mature, higher-cost assets, Galp Energia SGPS SA can credibly argue that its upstream isn’t just a legacy drag; it’s a deliberately pruned engine that underwrites its transition investments.

2. Strategic Geography: Iberia and the Atlantic Gateway

Portugal and Spain are among Europe’s most attractive markets for solar generation, with strong irradiation and an increasingly supportive regulatory landscape. Galp’s core renewables roll-out is essentially happening in its home backyard, where it already understands the grid, permitting and customer behavior.

On the industrial side, Sines offers deep-water access, links into the European fuels and chemicals markets, and potential for exports of low-carbon fuels in the future. That single hub, if successfully upgraded, can function as a central node in regional decarbonisation value chains.

3. Integrated Molecules-and-Electrons Offering

Unlike pure-play renewables or upstream-only producers, Galp Energia SGPS SA can design integrated offers across molecules (fuels, petrochemicals, gases) and electrons (renewable power). This integrated offering creates:

Stickier customer relationships across mobility, industrial and corporate segments.

Operational synergies in trading, balancing and hedging across the value chain.

Better risk distribution between commodity-exposed and contracted revenue streams.

In a world where both demand and regulation are unpredictable, that kind of optionality is valuable.

4. Focus over Bloat

Perhaps Galp’s least obvious edge is its scale: it is large enough to execute multi-billion-euro industrial projects, but small enough to maintain strategic focus. While supermajors wrestle with sprawling legacy portfolios and competing internal agendas, Galp Energia SGPS SA can direct capital and management attention toward a few high-impact bets—Brazilian production, Sines industrial transformation, and Iberian renewables and mobility.

This tightness can make execution risk more binary, but it also offers a cleaner story to regulators, partners and investors.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The transformation of Galp Energia SGPS SA into an integrated, transition-ready platform is already reflected in how markets treat Galp Energia Aktie (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009), even if the journey is far from complete.

Based on live market data checked across multiple sources, Galp Energia Aktie is actively traded on Euronext Lisbon. As of the latest available session data (cross-checked between at least two major financial portals on the same day), the share price reflects a market view that Galp is a leveraged play on both premium upstream cash flows and European decarbonisation policy. Day-to-day, the stock still moves heavily with oil prices and macro sentiment, but the medium-term narrative is gradually shifting from “small oil major” toward “Iberian energy transition platform.”

When markets are open, investors parse each operational update from Galp Energia SGPS SA for signals on:

Upstream delivery: production volumes, lifting costs and capital discipline in Brazil.

Industrial transformation: progress on Sines upgrades, low-carbon fuels projects and energy-efficiency gains.

Renewables growth: commissioning schedules, capacity additions, load factors and PPA coverage in solar and wind.

Capital allocation: dividends, buybacks and the balance between shareholder returns and growth capex.

For periods when markets are closed or intraday pricing is unavailable, investors fall back on the last close price as a snapshot of sentiment. That last close embeds expectations not only about oil and gas markets but also about how convincingly Galp Energia SGPS SA can execute its roadmap without destroying value.

If the company manages to keep upstream free cash flow robust while steadily increasing the share of earnings from renewables and low-carbon fuels, Galp Energia Aktie has a pathway to rerating: investors could begin to price it less like a traditional cyclical oil stock and more like a hybrid infrastructure and energy-transition vehicle. Conversely, delays at Sines, cost overruns, or underperformance in the solar and wind portfolio would likely see the stock trade back toward a discounted, higher-risk profile.

In essence, Galp Energia SGPS SA is now the single most important variable in the valuation of Galp Energia Aktie. It encapsulates the group’s transition risks and opportunities, turning abstract net-zero commitments into concrete industrial projects, power plants and mobility services. For shareholders, that makes watching the evolution of this product—this integrated corporate platform—every bit as critical as tracking the next move in Brent or Henry Hub.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405049_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 16:11:46.187628

With SAF costing significantly more than conventional jet fuel, airlines in a price-sensitive market cannot absorb the transition alone, making policy design and shared risk critical to scaling adoption.

India has the feedstock potential and industrial base to become more than a SAF consumer, but without coordinated governance and timely policy clarity, value creation and investment may shift to markets that move faster.

India’s aviation sector continues to grow steadily, supported by rising passenger numbers, a large aircraft order pipeline, and the ongoing expansion of airport infrastructure across the country. Yet alongside this growth sits a structural challenge that is becoming harder to ignore: how to decarbonise aviation without undermining its commercial foundations.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is now firmly embedded in aviation decarbonisation plans worldwide. However, in India, adoption has progressed cautiously, constrained by pricing, limited availability and the absence of a fully developed market structure.

The issue is not ambition. It is execution.

Policy, Cost and Scale

India has made its intent clear. Policymakers have acknowledged SAF as part of the country’s long-term aviation and climate strategy, and indicative blending targets have been outlined, beginning with low single-digit blending later this decade. However, unlike Europe or the United States, these targets are not yet backed by a comprehensive regulatory or financial framework.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates SAF blending starting at 2 per cent in 2025, rising progressively to 70 per cent by 2050.

In the United States, the Inflation Reduction Act and related clean fuel tax credits have created a strong incentive structure that directly supports SAF producers.

These frameworks do not eliminate cost challenges, but they reduce uncertainty and provide clear investment signals.

India’s approach remains more cautious. While this flexibility allows room to adapt, it also delays market formation.

Without defined incentives, pricing mechanisms or long-term offtake clarity, investors face difficulty committing capital to large-scale SAF projects.

This matters because SAF economics remain challenging. Depending on the feedstock and technology pathway, SAF can cost between two to five times more than conventional aviation turbine fuel. In a price-sensitive market like India, airlines cannot absorb this premium indefinitely, nor can passengers be expected to shoulder it through higher fares.

The result is a familiar stalemate: producers wait for assured demand, airlines wait for affordable supply, and financiers wait for policy certainty.

Aviation operates on thin margins even in strong market conditions. Fuel already accounts for a significant share of operating costs, and any sustained increase directly affects network planning, pricing and profitability.

Unlike fleet renewal, which often delivers fuel efficiency gains over time, SAF does not yet offer a cost-offsetting benefit.

Its value lies in emissions reduction, not operational savings. Expecting airlines to absorb this premium indefinitely is neither realistic nor sustainable.

This is where policy intervention becomes unavoidable. In markets where SAF adoption has advanced, governments have provided early support through mandates, fiscal incentives, or structured offtake arrangements, to reduce risk during the initial scaling phase and allow costs to moderate over time.

India faces a different challenge. The market is large, competitive and highly price-sensitive. While demand growth is strong, margins are thin. Any transition that significantly increases operating costs risks slowing growth or shifting capacity decisions.

This does not mean SAF is unviable; it means the transition must be carefully sequenced. Shared responsibility across government, producers, financiers and airlines becomes essential.

India’s long-term potential to produce SAF is widely acknowledged. The country has access to multiple feedstock pathways, including used cooking oil, agricultural residues and municipal waste. It also has a growing renewable energy base that could support advanced production routes over time.

However, potential does not automatically translate into supply.

Feedstock aggregation remains fragmented, logistics networks are still evolving, and robust traceability systems, critical for certification and compliance, are yet to be fully established.

Long-term offtake contracts, which are essential for financing, remain limited. These are not technological barriers as much as organisational and commercial ones.

Even if production capacity were to increase quickly, challenges would persist around standardisation, quality assurance and distribution. Without coordinated planning, scale alone will not resolve these constraints.

This is where institutional alignment becomes crucial. Sustainable Aviation Fuel sits at the intersection of aviation, energy, agriculture and environmental policy. Fragmented decision-making slows progress and raises costs, while coherent governance, rather than isolated initiatives, will determine whether India can move from pilot projects to a functioning market.

Risk and Opportunity

No major energy transition has occurred without early public-sector involvement. The role of government is not to replace markets, but to enable them, particularly in the early stages when risk is high and returns are uncertain.

For SAF, this could take the form of time-bound incentives, risk-sharing mechanisms, or clearly defined blending trajectories that provide visibility to investors. The objective is not a permanent subsidy, but confidence.

Without this, capital tends to flow to jurisdictions where policy signals are clearer. That does not mean aviation demand disappears in India, aircraft will still fly, but it does mean production, innovation and value creation may occur elsewhere.

This distinction matters. Being a consumer of SAF is not the same as being a producer. The latter brings industrial capability, jobs and strategic resilience.

India is not late to the conversation, but the window for shaping outcomes is narrowing.

Global SAF capacity is beginning to take form, and early movers are securing investment and partnerships that will define supply chains for decades.

The opportunity for India lies in acting decisively, not through grand declarations, but through practical frameworks that align policy ambition with market realities.

If that alignment is achieved, SAF can evolve from a compliance concept into a viable industrial pathway. If not, the transition will still happen, just on terms shaped elsewhere.

The question is no longer whether sustainable aviation will become part of India’s future. It is whether India will help define that future or simply adapt to it.",https://www.aviationjeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9pdKwzbgAA-eRg.jpeg,N,,2026-01-03 14:56:53.920299

Istraživači sa Tehničkog univerziteta u Gracu (TU Graz) pokrenuli su projekat pod nazivom ToFuel čiji je cilj da razvije integrisanu biotehnologiju koja može da pretvori biomasu paradajza u održivo avio gorivo (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel), uz istovremenu proizvodnju sporednih proizvoda kao što su đubrivo, stočna hrana i ulja pogodna za ljudsku ishranu.

THE FUTURE OF FLIGHT NEEDS MORE THAN USED COOKING OIL!

Aviation is racing to cut carbon emissions, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is one of its strongest paths forward. But relying on used cooking oil alone won’t take us far, the supply is limited, unstable, and tied to human consumption rather than the industry’s urgent need to fly cleaner.

That’s why new feedstocks matter. Converting palm oil empty fruit bunches (EFB), a material often treated as waste, into SAF creates a path that is scalable, sustainable, and far more dependable. If aviation wants real progress, diversification isn’t optional. It’s essential.

Chicago soybean futures eased in the latest session, trimming earlier advances, but still closed the year with their first annual gain in three years, marking a turnaround after a prolonged period of price pressure driven by ample global supplies and volatile demand signals.

Prices on the Chicago Board of Trade moved lower during the session as traders locked in profits following weeks of upward momentum. Despite the pullback, soybeans finished the year higher, a development widely attributed to shifting trade flows, tighter-than-expected inventories in key exporting countries and renewed buying interest from major importers.

A central factor supporting the market has been the re-emergence of China as a significant buyer of US soybeans after a late-October trade truce eased tensions between the world's two largest economies. Purchases by state-linked and private importers helped stabilise demand expectations at a time when growers in the United States were marketing the bulk of their harvested crop. Market participants said the return of Chinese buying improved confidence in export prospects, particularly for shipments scheduled in the first half of the new year.

Soybean prices had struggled to find sustained traction over the previous two years, weighed down by record or near-record harvests in Brazil and the United States, alongside sluggish demand growth and logistical disruptions. The annual gain therefore stands out as a shift in market sentiment rather than a simple technical rebound.

Weather developments in South America also played a role. Periods of dryness in parts of Brazil and Argentina earlier in the growing season raised concerns over yield potential, prompting risk premiums to be added to prices. Although rainfall later improved conditions in some regions, uncertainty around final production figures continued to underpin futures markets.

In the United States, farmers harvested a large crop, but export sales accelerated more than anticipated during the latter part of the year. Traders pointed to competitive US pricing and improved river logistics as factors aiding shipments. Domestic crushers also maintained strong demand, supported by steady margins in the production of soybean meal and oil.

Soybean oil prices benefited from broader trends in the energy and biofuels sectors. Demand for vegetable oils used in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel has been expanding, adding a structural layer of support to oilseed markets. While policy clarity varies across jurisdictions, the long-term outlook for biofuel feedstocks has become an increasingly important consideration for investors and producers alike.

The pullback in prices during the session reflected broader weakness across agricultural markets. Corn and wheat futures also edged lower, pressured by favourable harvest results in several exporting regions and by a stronger US dollar, which can make American commodities less competitive on the global market. Analysts noted that funds reduced long positions ahead of year-end, a common feature of thin holiday trading.

Currency movements remained a key variable. A firmer dollar tends to weigh on dollar-denominated commodities, while shifts in South American currencies influence export competitiveness. Brazil's real, in particular, is closely watched by soybean traders, as its fluctuations can alter selling behaviour by producers and exporters.

Looking ahead, attention is turning to planting intentions in the United States and to final crop outcomes in South America. Early indications suggest farmers may reassess acreage allocations between soybeans and corn, influenced by relative price signals and input costs. Fertiliser prices have moderated from previous peaks, but remain a significant factor in planting decisions.

Trade policy remains another area of focus. While the late-October truce helped reopen channels between Washington and Beijing, market participants remain cautious about the durability of improved relations. Any disruption to trade flows could quickly alter demand dynamics, given China's dominant role in global soybean imports.

Shell plc sits at the center of the modern energy dilemma. On one side, the world still runs on hydrocarbons: oil, gas, and the vast infrastructure built over a century. On the other, governments, investors, and consumers are aggressively demanding decarbonization, cleaner power, and electrification. Shell is attempting to live in both worlds at once.

Unlike a single physical gadget or app, Shell plc is a globally integrated energy platform: upstream oil and gas fields, liquefied natural gas (LNG), refineries, petrochemicals, power trading desks, EV charging networks, biofuels plants, and carbon management projects. The company’s product is energy itself, wrapped in logistics, software, and risk management.

That dual identity is exactly what makes Shell plc so important to watch: it is a real-time case study of how a legacy supermajor tries to become an integrated energy company without breaking its cash machine. The company’s latest moves in LNG, power trading, chemicals and renewables, together with portfolio simplification and cost-cutting, are shaping not just Shell plc’s future, but the broader energy transition.

Get all details on Shell plc here

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

Shell plc today is best understood as a stack of four tightly linked product pillars: LNG and upstream gas, oil and refining, marketing and mobility, and low-carbon solutions built around power, biofuels, and carbon management.

1. LNG & Upstream Gas: Shell’s crown jewel

Shell plc has quietly become one of the world’s most important liquefied natural gas players. It operates an integrated LNG value chain spanning gas production, liquefaction, shipping, regasification, and trading. Flagship assets such as its Qatari LNG interests, Australian projects, and positions in North America underpin a portfolio that can dynamically reroute cargoes to wherever prices spike.

This LNG footprint functions like a high-bandwidth global energy API for countries trying to exit coal quickly without fully committing to intermittent renewables. When Europe scrambled to replace Russian pipeline gas, Shell plc’s LNG trading and flexible contracts turned into a strategic advantage, feeding directly into higher margins and cash flow.

Technologically, Shell’s edge here is not just in steel and concrete but in software: sophisticated market analytics, fleet optimization, and risk management systems that turn volatile gas markets into an opportunity rather than a threat. In energy terms, Shell’s LNG desk is the equivalent of a hyperscale cloud region dynamically shifting workloads across regions.

2. Oil, refining, and chemicals: Fewer, bigger, more integrated

On the liquids side, Shell plc has been pruning aggressively. The company has been shutting or selling less competitive refineries and turning its most advantaged sites into integrated energy and chemicals ""parks"" that can co-process biofeedstocks, produce lower-carbon fuels, and feed high-margin petrochemicals. The logic: fewer, more complex sites with better returns and lower unit emissions.

These integrated hubs are being redesigned around digital twins, predictive maintenance, and energy efficiency optimization. Shell plc is using advanced process control and data analytics to squeeze more product per barrel and more profit per ton of CO2 emitted, while building in the optionality to process sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) components, renewable diesel, and bio-naphtha.

3. Marketing, mobility, and EV charging: Owning the customer interface

Shell’s retail and mobility business is its most visible consumer-facing ""product."" Across more than 70,000 branded retail sites globally, Shell plc is selling fuels, lubricants, convenience retail, and increasingly, electrons.

Shell plc has been building and acquiring public EV charging networks in Europe, the UK, North America, and Asia, folding them into a unified Shell Recharge brand. In dense urban environments, the company is repositioning traditional forecourts as multi-energy hubs where drivers can fuel with gasoline, charge EVs, grab food, and in some markets even work or receive delivery services.

The USP here is ecosystem: loyalty apps, payment integration, and data about how customers move, charge, and shop. Shell plc is using that behavioral data to drive cross-sell across fuels, EV charging, lubricants, and convenience retail, turning physical sites into a high-frequency customer platform.

4. Low-carbon energy and carbon management: From optics to optionality

Shell plc’s low-carbon portfolio has shifted from ""grow at all costs"" to ""grow where it pays."" The company has been more selective in new wind and solar projects, preferring positions where it can bolt on its trading, optimization, and industrial customer relationships to lift returns.

Key focus areas include:

Power trading and optimization: Using Shell’s global trading engine to manage the intermittency of renewables for utilities and large industrials.

Biofuels and SAF: Large-scale renewable fuel plants targeting aviation and heavy transport, where electrification is hard.

Hydrogen: Early-stage green and blue hydrogen projects tied to industrial clusters and heavy mobility.

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS): Cluster-based projects that help hard-to-abate sectors decarbonize, effectively selling ""carbon infrastructure"" as a service.

The through line is optionality: Shell plc wants to be positioned for whichever decarbonization technologies mature fastest, without destroying near-term returns.

Market Rivals: Shell Aktie vs. The Competition

Measured as a tradable equity, Shell Aktie (ISIN GB00BP6MXD84; ticker typically SHEL on major exchanges) lives in a brutally simple peer group: global energy supermajors. The real product battle, however, is between Shell plc’s integrated energy platform and competing architectures at BP, TotalEnergies, and ExxonMobil.

BP plc: The ""greenest"" supermajor pivot

Compared directly to BP plc and its evolving portfolio, Shell plc looks more conservative but more disciplined. BP’s product narrative centers on rapidly expanding renewables capacity, e-mobility, and bioenergy, while deliberately shrinking oil and gas over time. BP's equivalent ""product"" stack features:

BP Pulse: An EV charging and e-mobility brand competing directly with Shell Recharge in the UK, Europe, and selected other markets.

Massive renewables pipeline: Offshore wind and solar farms where BP positions itself as an integrated developer and operator.

Bioenergy and hydrogen: Similar thematic bets to Shell, but with more aggressive public decarbonization targets.

BP’s competitive strength is its willingness to rebrand as a lower-carbon champion, which appeals to some ESG-focused investors and certain regulators. But that same ambition has raised questions about returns and execution risk. Shell plc, by contrast, is making smaller, more targeted green bets while leaning harder into LNG and trading as near-term profit engines.

TotalEnergies SE: The closest structural rival

Compared directly to TotalEnergies SE, Shell plc faces a competitor that has fully embraced the language of being a ""multi-energy"" company. TotalEnergies’ rival product suite includes:

TotalEnergies Renewables: A fast-growing portfolio of solar and wind assets with integrated power marketing.

Saft and energy storage: Battery and storage technologies that support grid services and renewable integration.

Expanding LNG portfolio: A serious competitor to Shell in the global LNG trade, with strong positions in the US and the Middle East.

TotalEnergies positions itself as slightly more aggressive than Shell plc on renewables while still very committed to oil, gas, and LNG. In practice, both are betting heavily on gas as a ""transition fuel,"" but Shell’s trading and scale in LNG arguably give it a sharper commodity toolset.

ExxonMobil: The fossil-first counterprogramming

Compared directly to ExxonMobil, Shell plc looks like a more diversified transition play. Exxon’s core product proposition remains heavily skewed towards upstream oil and gas, petrochemicals, and mega-project execution, with lower direct exposure to retail mobility and less visible consumer branding than Shell plc. Exxon is investing in carbon capture and low-carbon solutions, but its narrative is more about ""emissions reduction from hydrocarbons"" than full electrification or consumer-side transition.

In this rivalry, Shell plc’s advantages are its retail and EV charging presence, a bigger LNG and power trading platform, and a more developed low-carbon customer offer. ExxonMobil’s pitch, by contrast, is mechanical and chemical engineering at scale, running very large, long-lived projects with strong returns.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Shell plc’s competitive edge is not that it is the greenest, nor the purest fossil play. Its edge is that it has built a hybrid, cash-generating energy stack that can flex between hydrocarbons and electrons faster than most of its peers.

1. LNG plus trading as the central spine

By anchoring its strategy in LNG and gas, Shell plc has placed itself at the heart of how many countries plan to decarbonize: get off coal, then add renewables, with flexible gas in the middle. This is not just a resource play; it is a sophisticated logistics and software play where Shell’s trading desks, shipping fleet, and market analytics effectively function as the orchestration layer.

Competitors like BP and TotalEnergies are strong in LNG too, but Shell plc combines that with unmatched retail and mobility reach, letting it push molecules and electrons across both wholesale and consumer channels.

2. A disciplined, returns-first approach to low carbon

Shell plc’s pivot away from volume-based renewables targets towards returns-focused projects is polarizing but rational. Instead of chasing gigawatts of capacity for headlines, Shell is increasingly insisting on returns that compare respectfully to its fossil portfolio. That means fewer vanity wind farms and more integrated deals where Shell contributes trading, industrial customer access, or infrastructure know-how.

This discipline arguably gives Shell plc a better chance of maintaining dividend support and buyback capacity, while still building a scalable low-carbon product stack in power, biofuels, and carbon management.

3. The physical-plus-digital ecosystem

The combined impact of Shell’s retail sites, EV charging, convenience stores, and digital loyalty programs is powerful. Unlike ExxonMobil, and even more so than BP in some markets, Shell plc owns a dense network of high-traffic physical nodes that double as data capture points.

As EV adoption accelerates, those sites become multi-energy experience centers: drivers can charge, fuel, shop, and interact with the Shell brand. On top of that, Shell plc can bundle services for fleet operators, logistics firms, and ride-hailing platforms, selling them integrated packages of fuels, charging, lubricants, and carbon offsets. That ecosystem story is hard to replicate quickly.

4. Optionality without an identity crisis

Where BP and some European peers have sometimes appeared to lurch from fossil to green narratives, Shell plc is leaning into a more pragmatic identity: a cash-obsessed, transition-aware energy major. It is not promising to abandon oil and gas overnight; instead, it is promising to run them harder and more efficiently while selectively building businesses that can thrive in a lower-carbon system.

For investors, that translates into a product that is easier to model: strong free cash flow from hydrocarbons plus carefully curated growth in scalable, adjacent low-carbon segments.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Shell Aktie (ISIN GB00BP6MXD84) is the financial manifestation of this entire strategic stack. How is the market pricing it today?

Using two major financial data sources, recent market data for Shell plc indicates the following. As of the latest available trading data retrieved from Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, Shell Aktie last closed at approximately the mid?$60s per share on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker SHEL), with a market capitalization firmly in large?cap territory. The specific last close price and intraday moves depend on the current trading session, but the key takeaway is that Shell plc is valued as a high-yield, cash-rich energy major rather than a high-growth tech-style transition stock.

Note: Figures referenced are based on the latest reported ""last close"" and recent trading range at the time of research, cross-verified across at least two financial data providers. Exact intraday quotes will vary with market conditions.

From a product perspective, the drivers behind Shell Aktie’s valuation are clear:

Hydrocarbon cash engine: Upstream oil and gas, LNG, and refining still deliver the bulk of earnings and cash flow, supporting a strong dividend and buyback program. When oil and gas prices are firm, Shell Aktie tends to benefit disproportionately due to its scale and trading capabilities.

LNG and gas premium: The market increasingly treats LNG-heavy majors like Shell plc and TotalEnergies as slightly differentiated from pure oil players. That gas and trading combo is viewed as a medium-term growth and resilience driver.

Measured low-carbon exposure: Shell plc’s pivot to a more returns-focused low-carbon strategy reassures income-focused investors. The company is not sacrificing short-term returns for long-term optics, which supports valuation multiples relative to peers that have more aggressively pursued renewables at lower returns.

Transition risk discount: At the same time, Shell Aktie still trades with a visible energy-transition risk discount. Regulatory actions, climate litigation, and potential demand destruction for oil over the long term weigh on how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings versus less carbon-intensive sectors.

In this context, Shell plc’s product strategy is directly tied to shareholder value. The more the company can demonstrate that LNG, power trading, low-carbon fuels, and EV charging can grow profitably alongside a leaner hydrocarbon base, the more it can compress that valuation discount. Conversely, any stumble in executing the hybrid model—whether a major stranded-asset write-down, a regulatory shock, or consumer rejection of Shell’s mobility offers—would feed quickly into Shell Aktie’s risk profile.

For now, Shell plc is positioned as a high-cash-yield energy transition platform: not a clean-tech pure play, but a disciplined, data-driven supermajor betting that it can ride and shape the transition instead of being run over by it.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405009_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 18:11:41.815076

The latest financial outlook for the global airline industry, released by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), has confirmed a stabilization in airline profitability despite facing persistent global challenges. According to IATA’s 2026 projections, the airline industry is expected to achieve a 3.9% net profit margin, with a net profit of $41 billion USD, up slightly from $39.5 billion USD in 2025. This marks a record-high for the industry, despite facing hurdles such as supply chain bottlenecks, geopolitical conflicts, and sluggish global trade.

With a continued strong performance from key regions such as the U.S., China, Russia, and Europe, airlines are adjusting to an evolving market and consolidating their recovery from earlier disruptions. However, despite the stable growth, the industry still faces significant challenges, particularly related to cost of capital and operating margins.

1. 2026 Airline Profit Outlook: Stabilization and Record-Breaking Revenue

The global airline industry is on track to surpass $1 trillion in revenue in 2026, a 4.5% increase from 2025. Passenger numbers are expected to reach 5.2 billion, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase, while cargo volumes are set to grow by 2.4%. With strong passenger demand across all regions, airlines are expected to set new records in both operating profit and revenue.

Despite the record-setting net profits, the net margin remains relatively unchanged at 3.9%, signaling that while airlines are thriving, operating profitability is still a key challenge. This is particularly significant when compared to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), expected to be 8.2% in 2026, which still puts pressure on airline profitability.

2. Airlines Continue to Face Operating Challenges: Supply Chain and Geopolitical Pressures

Airlines have been able to show resilience despite ongoing headwinds, such as rising costs, bottlenecks in the aerospace supply chain, and the impacts of geopolitical tensions. These pressures have contributed to airlines’ efforts to maintain profitability, but operating expenses are rising steadily, with fuel costs and labor expenses leading the charge.

In 2026, operating profits are expected to reach $72.8 billion USD, improving from $67 billion USD in 2025, while operating margins are projected to improve slightly to 6.9%, up from 6.6% in 2025. This improvement is a testament to the industry’s ability to adapt, particularly with fuel cost stabilization and a recovery in cargo operations.

3. Air Cargo Resilience: A Bright Spot Amid Challenges

While passenger services are showing stable growth, air cargo has become a standout performer in 2025, defying early predictions of a downturn. Air cargo volumes are expected to reach 71.6 million tonnes in 2026, with a 2.4% increase compared to 2025. This growth is largely attributed to the resilience of the air cargo industry, particularly in e-commerce and the semiconductor sectors, which have seen increasing demand due to the global rise of artificial intelligence (AI) investments.

The air cargo sector has played a critical role in global trade by enabling timely deliveries, especially in the face of the protectionist US tariff regime. The global supply chain adjustments have positioned air cargo as a vital industry player in maintaining international trade.

4. Regional Outlook: Profitability Varies Across Global Markets

The regional profitability outlook varies significantly. Europe is expected to show the strongest financial performance, with airlines reporting the highest net profit margins of 4.9% in 2026. The Middle East follows closely behind, continuing its strong performance with 9.3% margins.

North America, however, saw a slight decline, as U.S. domestic travel faced contraction due to policy uncertainty and labor shortages. Yet, Asia-Pacific continues to show robust growth, with China and India contributing significantly to the region’s expansion.

5. Airline Costs: Fuel, Labor, and Compliance Pressures

The cost landscape for airlines in 2026 points to a more balanced environment, but non-fuel costs remain a significant concern. Fuel costs are expected to see a slight decline, but rising labor costs and maintenance costs driven by the aging fleet remain prevalent.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) will continue to affect airlines, with compliance costs rising to $1.7 billion USD for 2026. Additionally, the purchase of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will cost airlines around $4.5 billion USD.

Conclusion: A Stable, Yet Challenging 2026 for Airlines

The 2026 financial outlook for the global airline industry reflects both resilience and challenges. Despite record revenues and stable profitability, airlines continue to face pressures from rising costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and supply chain constraints. While passenger demand remains robust, airlines must navigate a complicated environment that includes rising fuel and labor costs, as well as regulatory challenges.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/US-Russia-UK-China-and-Australia.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:51.080530

“We knew we needed to act quickly to keep the World Cup safe from the rising threat of unmanned aircraft systems, and that’s exactly what we did,” said Karen Evans, acting FEMA administrator.
The World Cup presents a massive stage for bad actors to disrupt proceedings.","The eleven U.S. states scheduled to host matches during the FIFA World Cup this summer may be the first to exercise newly granted authority to jam, intercept, and take down uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS), or drones.

During past World Cups, stadium security teams focused primarily on stopping pitch invaders and other threats on the ground. Now, they are paying more attention to the airspace above and around stadiums, which in the U.S. has become increasingly vulnerable as more drones take to the skies.

During a counter-UAS (C-UAS) summit in December, the Washington National Guard simulated a drone attack on Seattle’s Lumen Field—a World Cup host venue—in anticipation that one could actually take place.

To address that contingency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) on Tuesday awarded $250 million to help state and local law enforcement detect, identify, track, and mitigate UAS. The money comes from FEMA’s $500 million Counter-UAS Grant Program, established in July by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The initial tranche of funding is reserved for World Cup host states, as well as the National Capital Region, which will host the America250 celebration in July. The remaining $250 million will become available to all U.S. states and territories in fiscal year 2027.

“We knew we needed to act quickly to keep the World Cup safe from the rising threat of unmanned aircraft systems, and that’s exactly what we did,” said Karen Evans, acting FEMA administrator. “This is the fastest non-disaster grant program ever executed by FEMA with funds being awarded just 25 days after the application deadline.”

About $28 million of the initial tranche of $250 million was awarded to Washington, D.C., on behalf of the National Capital Region. The rest was allocated as follows:

$34.6 million to California

$30.3 million to Texas

$23.6 million to Florida

$21.9 million to Massachusetts

$21.8 million to New Jersey

$20.3 million to Georgia

$19.5 million to Washington state

$17.7 million to New York

$14.2 million to Missouri

$12.5 million to Pennsylvania

$5.3 million to Kansas

To receive funding for UAS mitigation capabilities, states were required to send law enforcement and correctional personnel for training at the FBI’s National C-UAS Training Center (NCUTC), created in June by a White House executive order.

The order directed the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Forces—which secure large public gatherings such as the Super Bowl—to integrate C-UAS capabilities. It also accelerated a federal safety review of foreign UAS and their components, which prompted the Federal Communications Commission to enact a total ban on new sales of those products in December.

The latter move was welcomed by American drone manufacturers but met with concern by drone pilots, many of whom rely on products from China’s DJI. In 2020, the company’s share of the U.S. market was estimated at 77 percent among hobbyists and as high as 90 percent among public safety agencies.

Drone Disruptions

As of November 2025, the FAA has registered more than 830,000 drones and certified more than 480,000 remote pilots. Both figures have risen exponentially since Part 107 regulations for small UAS took effect in 2016. They could continue to grow with the looming introduction of Part 108, which covers operations beyond the visual line of sight (BVLOS) of the operator.

The U.S. military deploys UAS in combat, and commercial operators use them to deliver food, equipment, and medical supplies. But they are also used for purposes the government considers nefarious, such as smuggling contraband into prisons or surveilling sensitive infrastructure. In January officials said unidentified drones were spotted over military installations.

The FAA uses temporary flight restrictions (TFRs) to keep recreational and commercial drones away from crowds. At stadiums, these TFRs typically bar them from flying below 3,000 feet and 3 nm from the venue within one hour of an event’s scheduled start and end time. Larger events, such as the Super Bowl and December’s Army-Navy college football game, have added restrictions.

The FAA’s publicly accessible Sporting Event Automated Monitoring System (SEAMS) tells pilots when and where TFRs are in place. It is updated with weather delays, cancellations, overtime periods, and other data from the NFL, MLB, and other professional sports leagues.

Still, thousands of drones slip through the cracks each year. Cathy Lanier, the NFL’s chief of security, testified to Congress in December 2024 that the league recorded 2,845 drone incursions into the TFRs around its stadiums during its 2023 season. That figure was 2,527 the season prior.

“Our national security and intelligence agencies continue to warn that terrorist groups and other bad non-state actors consider stadiums and other mass gatherings attractive targets for attack,” Lanier said. “In fact, earlier this year, Islamic State propaganda specifically encouraged attacks on stadiums, including referencing the Paris Summer Olympics.”

State and local law enforcement can respond to drone incidents and arrest pilots. But until December, they relied on federal authorities—which are present only for major events—to jam, intercept, or take down the UAS. Lanier in a 2023 interview said that of 121,000 requests for FBI or DHS counter-drone support to stadiums and other venues since 2018, only 77 were approved.

That changed last month with the introduction of the Safer Skies Act, part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act. It extends drone mitigation authority to state, local, territorial, and tribal agencies, which will be trained by the FBI. They will use technologies—including radio frequency and detection, tracking, and identification systems—from a list maintained by the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, Defense, Transportation, and other agencies.

The typical C-UAS protocol is for authorities to contact the drone’s pilot and persuade them to land. If that fails, they can take an array of actions, from shooting the drone down to catching it with a net.

The World Cup presents a massive stage for bad actors to disrupt proceedings. It could also be an opportunity for authorities to determine how effective their C-UAS capabilities really are.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/230922-drone2_rdax_775x440s-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 09:11:39.915526

For most travelers, Airbus SE is a logo on the cabin wall as they buckle in for another flight. For airlines, lessors, and governments, Airbus SE is something far bigger: the defining product and industrial platform at the heart of modern aviation. It is the integrated machine that designs, builds, certifies, and supports aircraft like the A320neo and A350, orchestrates a global supply chain, and steers the industry’s transition toward lower-carbon flight.

As air travel demand rebounds and airlines race to renew aging fleets, Airbus SE has become the de facto standard for fuel-efficient narrowbodies and long-haul widebodies. The company’s commercial aircraft franchise is sold out for years, its decarbonization roadmap is now shaping policy as much as it responds to it, and its digital and defense units are quietly building the scaffolding for the next era of aerospace.

In other words, Airbus SE is no longer just an aircraft manufacturer. It is a product ecosystem that spans jets, services, data, defense, and space — and right now, it is dictating the pace of change across the global aviation market.

Get all details on Airbus SE here

Inside the Flagship: Airbus SE

At its core, Airbus SE is the flagship product: an integrated aerospace and defense platform that turns a sprawling portfolio of programs into one coherent value proposition for airlines, governments, and investors. The company is structured around four key divisions — Commercial Aircraft, Helicopters, Defence & Space, and a growing Services & Digital layer — but the real magic is how these pieces reinforce each other.

The star attraction remains the commercial aircraft line-up, led by the A320neo Family, the long-range A321XLR, and the A350 widebody family:

A320neo Family: The single most important workhorse in global aviation right now. With new-generation engines, advanced aerodynamics, and cabin flexibility, the A320neo and its siblings offer double-digit fuel-burn reductions compared to previous generations. They are the backbone of low-cost and network carriers from Europe to Asia to the Americas and form the financial backbone of Airbus SE itself.

A321XLR: Perhaps the most disruptive variant in the portfolio. By stretching range into traditional widebody territory while keeping narrowbody economics, the A321XLR allows airlines to open thinner long-haul point-to-point routes. This is a structural challenge to older, less efficient widebodies and a gap Boeing has struggled to fill with a convincing competitor.

A350 Family: Airbus’s long-haul flagship, engineered around composite structures, advanced aerodynamics, and quiet, efficient Rolls-Royce engines. The A350-900 and A350-1000 are built to replace aging 777 and A340 fleets with lower fuel burn, more range flexibility, and passenger-friendly cabins. The freighter version, A350F, extends that advantage into the cargo market.

Wrapped around these aircraft is an increasingly sophisticated services and digital envelope. Under the Airbus SE umbrella, the company sells:

Flight operations and maintenance services via Airbus Services and the Skywise data platform, turning operational data from global fleets into predictive maintenance tools, route optimization, and fuel savings.

Training and support ecosystems that lock in Airbus SE as a long-term partner, not just a one-off hardware supplier. Full-flight simulators, pilot and maintenance training, and lifecycle support are all revenue streams that deepen customer stickiness.

Defense, space, and secure communications, from the Eurofighter Typhoon and A400M airlifter to telecommunications and Earth observation satellites. These programs diversify revenue and give Airbus SE strategic relevance beyond commercial cycles.

Crucially, Airbus SE has positioned itself as the vanguard of aviation decarbonization. Its roadmap includes:

Hydrogen-powered concepts under the ZEROe program, exploring multiple airframe architectures with an ambition to bring a hydrogen aircraft to market in the next decade.

SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) readiness across its in-production fleet, aiming for 100% SAF compatibility over time, which can cut lifecycle emissions while the world waits for hydrogen and new propulsion systems to scale.

Incremental efficiency gains — from winglet design and composite use to avionics and cabin reconfigurations — that compound across hundreds of aircraft and millions of flight hours.

This combination of hardware, software, services, and sustainability is what makes Airbus SE a flagship product in the truest sense. It is not just selling planes; it is selling a complete vision of what global air travel looks like over the next 20 years.

Market Rivals: Airbus Aktie vs. The Competition

Airbus SE does not exist in a vacuum. Its dominance is being contested by a small but fierce set of rivals — primarily Boeing in the United States, China’s COMAC, and Brazil’s Embraer. Each is fielding specific products that aim to chip away at Airbus SE’s lead.

On the narrowbody front, the main dogfight is between the Airbus A320neo Family and Boeing’s 737 MAX Family. Compared directly to the Boeing 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 10, Airbus’s A320neo and A321neo have carved out a commanding market share thanks to:

Perceived reliability and brand momentum after Boeing’s prolonged 737 MAX grounding and certification issues, which pushed many airlines and lessors to hedge or shift orders toward Airbus SE.

Cabin and range flexibility, especially in the A321neo and A321XLR, which allow high-density short-haul operations and long-range flights from the same basic airframe.

Earlier time-to-market for the neo concept, letting Airbus SE lock in key customers and slot positions before Boeing’s MAX program fully stabilized.

In the widebody arena, the rivalry centers on the Airbus A350 versus Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner and 777X. Compared directly to the Boeing 787-9 and 787-10, the A350-900 and A350-1000 lean heavily on their composite structure, fuel efficiency, and passenger comfort. While the 787 remains a strong product, Airbus SE has been winning marquee long-haul fleet renewals, in part because of:

Operational economics on long sectors, which many airlines see as tilting slightly in favor of the A350, especially when factoring in growing networks and premium-heavy configurations.

A350F freighter variant, which directly challenges Boeing’s traditional stronghold in cargo and positions Airbus SE as a credible alternative to older 777 and 747 freighters.

Meanwhile, COMAC is emerging as a geopolitical and commercial wildcard. Its C919 narrowbody is positioned as a domestic competitor to the A320neo and 737 MAX on Chinese routes, backed by state-led industrial policy. Compared directly to the Airbus A320neo, the COMAC C919 today lags in:

Global certification and support — critical if it wants to break out of China-centric deployment.

Fleet maturity — Airbus SE brings millions of fleet-hours of operational experience that translate to reliability and predictable maintenance.

At the regional end of the spectrum, Embraer is pushing its E2 jet family as a right-sized alternative for thinner routes traditionally flown by older Airbus and Boeing narrowbodies. Compared directly to the Embraer E195-E2, Airbus’s smallest A220 (marketed under the Airbus SE umbrella after its acquisition) offers:

Mainline comfort in a smaller package, with a cabin that feels more like a full narrowbody than a regional jet.

Unified support under Airbus SE, which appeals to airlines trying to streamline their OEM relationships.

Taken together, these rival products underscore why Airbus SE’s integrated approach matters. Where competitors often anchor on a single marquee jet, Airbus SE fields a full-spectrum offering — from A220 to A321XLR to A350 and A350F — that lets airlines design entire network strategies around a single supplier.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Airbus SE’s edge is not just that it has strong aircraft. It is that it has turned those programs into a cohesive, future-focused platform that is hard to match.

1. Locked-in demand and supply discipline

Years-long backlogs across the A320neo and A350 programs give Airbus SE rare visibility into future revenue. This isn’t just a comfort blanket for investors; it allows the company to:

Optimize production ramp-ups without chasing volume at any cost.

Negotiate from a position of strength with suppliers and airline customers alike.

Fund long-horizon bets like hydrogen and advanced materials without betting the company on any single technology leap.

2. A coherent decarbonization roadmap

Every aerospace company now talks about net zero. Airbus SE has moved faster than most to transform that rhetoric into a product strategy:

ZEROe hydrogen concepts give Airbus SE a credible claim to leadership in future propulsion systems, even if timelines remain challenging.

SAF-ready fleets ensure its current products are compatible with regulatory and customer pressure to cut emissions this decade, not just in the 2040s.

Incremental design improvements — lighter cabins, aerodynamic tweaks, digital route optimization — ensure that existing jets keep getting more efficient while the big technology step-changes mature.

Compared to Boeing, which has spent years firefighting program crises, Airbus SE has been able to engage regulators, airlines, and fuel suppliers as a proactive architect of the future ecosystem. Against COMAC, it pitches not just technology but a mature, globally proven support network. That matters when airlines are planning 20-year fleet decisions.

3. Digital and services flywheel

Skywise and the wider Airbus Services stack are easy to overlook next to gleaming jets, but they are central to Airbus SE’s competitive moat. By embedding itself in airlines’ daily operations — maintenance, crew planning, fuel management — Airbus SE:

Turns aircraft sales into long-term, high-margin service relationships.

Aggregates operational data that can inform next-generation aircraft design.

Raises switching costs if an airline considers leaning more heavily into a competing OEM.

4. Portfolio breadth and resilience

While commercial aircraft dominate headlines, Airbus SE’s helicopters and defence and space businesses give it important hedges. Government contracts, satellite programs, and rotorcraft demand do not always move in sync with airline capex cycles. That smoother revenue base makes it easier for Airbus SE to keep investing in next-gen products even when commercial aviation hits turbulence.

All of this feeds one central narrative: Airbus SE is not winning because of a single blockbuster jet. It is winning because it has systematized innovation, risk management, and customer lock-in across an entire ecosystem.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

While the narrative around Airbus SE is product-led, the financial markets ultimately distill that story into the performance of Airbus Aktie (ISIN: NL0000235190).

Using live market data obtained via financial portals such as Yahoo Finance and other major quote providers, Airbus Aktie is currently trading with a valuation that reflects strong confidence in its commercial aircraft backlog, improving margins as production scales, and the long-term growth thesis around fleet renewal and emerging markets. Where precise intraday figures differ slightly between sources, they consistently show Airbus shares pricing in substantial expectations for sustained demand, tempered by near-term execution risks in the supply chain and industrial ramp-up.

The link between the Airbus SE product ecosystem and Airbus Aktie is direct:

Backlog as a quasi-asset: The enormous multi-year backlog for the A320neo family and A350 line effectively functions as a forward revenue pipeline. Investors scrutinize new orders, cancellations, and delivery schedules as real-time proxies for the health of the Airbus SE product franchise.

Margin trajectory: Each incremental improvement in production efficiency or supplier cost — whether on the A321neo or A350 — drops through to margins. As Airbus SE moves along the learning curve of higher-rate production, investors have bid the stock to levels that imply continued margin expansion, provided the company can keep supply chain bottlenecks under control.

Strategic optionality: Hydrogen concepts, SAF integration, and digital services may not yet be the biggest line items on Airbus’s income statement, but they are central to the equity story. The market tends to reward companies that own key choke points in an industry’s transition; Airbus SE’s position in aviation’s decarbonization journey gives Airbus Aktie an embedded growth option beyond the current product cycle.

That said, the stock is not without risk. Any major delay or certification issue with flagship programs like the A321XLR, significant geopolitical disruptions affecting airline demand, or structural setbacks in hydrogen or SAF policy could compress the growth premium investors currently assign to Airbus Aktie. Supply chain fragility — from engines to avionics — remains a persistent watchpoint and can influence short-term share price volatility even when long-term demand is intact.

Still, viewed from the lens of Airbus SE as a product, the market’s verdict is clear: this is the platform on which much of global commercial aviation will run for the next two decades. Airbus Aktie is, in effect, a liquid proxy for the strength, resilience, and future relevance of that platform.

As airlines, regulators, and passengers push for more efficient, lower-carbon, and better-connected flight, Airbus SE is sitting at the center of the conversation with a portfolio that is already in service today and a roadmap designed for the next era. For competitors, customers, and investors alike, ignoring what Airbus SE is building is no longer an option.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405051_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 10:12:57.238223

2025 recorded several exciting developments in high-speed air-breathing propulsion ground and flight testing, especially in terms of multidisciplinary efforts combining different propulsion technologies. These included turbojet and detonation engines fused with ram/scramjet propulsion systems to achieve sustained supersonic and hypersonic flight.

In Edmonton, Canada, Space Engine Systems (SES) in July and August performed ground tests based on a hypersonic Los Angeles-to-Sydney trajectory. Aims included validating thrust coefficients and establishing throttling protocols to prevent engine seizure during the turbojet-to-ramjet transition. At the company’s Villeneuve Airport facility in Canada, the precooler-enabled turbojet demonstrated operational performance up to Mach 3 with simulations extending to Mach 5, including windmilling. Full-scale ramjet ground tests achieved sustained hydrogen combustion for up to 30 seconds at fuel flow rates of 0.5-3.0 kilograms per second and air equivalence ratios of 0.3-1.0 k/s, providing confidence in thrust coefficients for a flight-ready ramjet. As the trials simulated full-scale conditions, they also served to optimize and demonstrate a working flame holder design along with an actuated, variable-throat rectangular nozzle.

In May, Venus Aerospace completed the first U.S. flight of a rotating detonation rocket engine (RDRE). The prototype, known as the Venus Detonation Ramjet (VDR2), integrates a ramjet with the RDRE to support sustained flight at speeds of Mach 6 to Mach10 directly from conventional runways. Unlike traditional engines that rely on steady combustion, the RDRE harnesses a continuous detonation wave: a supersonic shock front that propagates around a ring-shaped chamber thousands of times per second.

This approach delivers 15-30% higher fuel efficiency and greater thrust in a compact design. The engine operates by injecting fuel, such as jet fuel or hydrocarbon propellants, with a stabilized liquid oxidizer (typically hydrogen peroxide at 70-100% concentration) into the annular chamber, where ignition triggers a self-sustaining detonation wave. Each cycle compresses and ignites fresh mixture, generating immense pressure and thrust while consuming less propellant. With this breakthrough, Venus Aerospace joins other U.S. companies — including Anduril Industries, Hermeus, Castelion, Ursa Major and Kratos Defense & Security Solutions — driving innovation in hypersonics as the nation races to maintain leadership in the global aerospace arena.

The German Aerospace Center’s (DLR) Institute of Space Propulsion continued its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ramjet test campaign within the European More & Less project for emissions testing through multiple test campaigns throughout 2025. Additionally, a big test campaign on rotational detonation combustors (RDCs), a campaign between The French Aerospace Lab (ONERA) and DLR, kept the M11.1 test bench busy from June through August. The tests in this campaign led to a 300 grams per second hot run for two seconds at the end of July after several weeks of successful testing with different configurations and different boundary conditions.The test schedule was completed by two smaller campaigns on new injectors designs at the end of the year.

POLARIS Raumflugzeuge GmbH, a German startup based in Bremen, accomplished its historic in-flight ignition of a linear aerospike rocket engine during a test flight in October of its MIRA II demonstrator. The small company also crossed its 100-flight mark with its four demonstrators in December.

SUM Air is a Regional Air Mobility airline. Their focus is on connecting islands and underserved areas using ATR 72-600 aircraft, as they are eco-friendly and generate lower emissions per passenger.

Choi Yong-deok, chief executive officer, stated:

With the ATR72-600, SUM Air will address the transportation problems of areas with low air transport accessibility. Thanks to the revitalisation of regional airports, we will grow as a central airline for regional transportation connecting all of Korea.

ATR 72-600

The ATR 72-600 is a popular, fuel-efficient twin-engine turboprop regional airliner. They are known for connecting smaller communities with low operating costs, excellent environmental performance (low CO2 emissions) and the ability to use short and challenging runways.

These aircraft were built by the French-Italian company ATR (Avions de Transport Régional), a joint venture partnership between Airbus and Leonardo begun in 1981.

This aircraft features advanced avionics, similar to modern Airbus jets, enhancing safety, and is powered by two Pratt & Whitney Canada PW127M turboprop engines.

This aircraft is a part of a batch of 10 ordered by Aviation PLC in 2024 and has become the first in SUM Air’s fleet. This marks an important step in the airline’s growth in the South Korean aviation market.

Aviation PLC

Aviation PLC is a Singapore-based, publicly traded company that owns and leases a global fleet of commercial passenger aircraft to various airlines worldwide. Their focus is newer, low-emission aircraft and supplying aircraft parts.

Jeff Chatfield, executive chairman of Aviation PLC, said:

We are pleased to purchase this aircraft, which is currently unencumbered and which has been placed on lease with a new airline customer, SUM Air, for a twelve-year lease. SUM Air is our first customer in South Korea; we look forward to a long and successful business relationship with the airline.

The arrival of the ATR 72-600 in Sum Air’s fleet is a step forward in realising the airline’s goal of improving regional transport connectivity across Korea.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/SUM-Air-Aviation-ATR-72-600.webp,N,,2026-01-03 09:11:46.940274

‘SUSTAINABLE’ AVIATION FUELS

The aviation industry uses marketing greenwash and accounting tricks to mislead you into thinking that actual flight emissions from ‘Sustainable’ Aviation Fuel (SAF) are a fraction of those from fossil jet fuel. A jet never burns pure SAF, so a common 50:50 blend with fossil jet fuel doubles claimed emissions. And actual flight CO2 emissions are additionally more than claimed, by the amount of CO2 drawn down in making the fuel. Furthermore SAF still creates non-CO2 emissions twice as warming as actual flight CO2 emissions.

Scaling Synthetic Fuel Production for the 2026 Global Energy Transition The progress recorded throughout 2025 confirms that the era of theoretical decarbonization has ended, giving way to a period of active industrial execution.","In 2025, the conversation around e-fuels transformed from speculation to tangible reality. For years, synthetic fuels were portrayed as futuristic solutions that might one day power planes and ships without fossil emissions. That day arrived sooner than expected.

Governments across Europe, Asia, and the Americas implemented long-awaited climate mandates in 2025. Pioneering companies simultaneously launched the first commercial-scale e-fuel plants. These milestones marked the moment when policy, production, and technology moved in sync.

The shift is critical because e-fuels, produced by combining green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide, use processes that turn CO₂ into green fuel in a way that can directly replace fossil fuels in hard-to-electrify sectors such as aviation and maritime shipping. Operators can cut emissions using existing infrastructure instead of redesigning entire fleets or energy systems.

Yet challenges remain, especially around cost, feedstock supply, and financing. What 2025 proved is that e-fuels are now operational, not theoretical. What 2026 will determine is whether they can scale fast enough to matter.

Twelve Significant Industrial Milestones in the 2025 E-Fuels Market

1. ReFuelEU Aviation: The SAF Clock Starts

In January 2025, Europe’s aviation industry officially entered a new regulatory era through ReFuelEU aviation fuel rules. The law requires all flights departing from European Union airports to use at least 2% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This sets in motion the first legally binding fuel-blending target of its kind.

SAFs are low-carbon alternatives derived from biological or synthetic sources. The regulation’s most ambitious clause begins in 2030. At that point, synthetic fuels made from renewable electricity and captured CO₂ will have their own dedicated sub-mandate.

Regulations provided airlines and fuel producers with a clear long-term investment trajectory. This certainty allowed financiers to assign predictable value to SAF projects for the first time. Aviation regulations represented a major step toward making e-fuels bankable, even before their specific quotas begin later in the decade, because CO₂-based sustainable aviation fuels are starting to move from pilot projects into commercial contracts.

2. FuelEU Maritime: Shipping’s New Greenhouse Gas Rules Go Live

While aviation captured headlines, 2025 was equally transformative for the maritime sector. The EU’s FuelEU maritime greenhouse gas rules officially came into force on January 1. This regulation requires ships in European waters to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their onboard energy by 2%. The initial percentage marks the start of a ratcheting mechanism that will tighten through mid-century, eventually forcing large-scale adoption of low- and zero-emission fuels.

Shipping leaders Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd pioneered the transition by investing in dual-fuel vessels capable of operating on green methanol or ammonia. By combining legal certainty with early commercial success stories, the rule accelerated the business case for green shipping. The rule also positioned Europe as a central hub for alternative maritime fuel development in 2026 and beyond.

3. Kassø: The Commercial-Scale E-Methanol Proof Point

Denmark’s Kassø e-methanol plant achieved a global first in 2025 by launching commercial operations. Beyond serving as a national milestone, the Kassø inauguration validates the global viability of the power-to-liquid model.

The facility achieves significant output through advanced synthesis methods:

Generates 42,000 metric tons of e-methanol annually.

Utilizes renewable power for hydrogen production.

Integrates biogenic CO₂ captured from nearby industrial sources.

Shipping giant Maersk has already contracted the entire volume for its dual-fuel vessels. This partnership proves that large-scale synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels is both possible and profitable. Efficiency, carbon intensity, and cost curves provided by the plant will guide the global e-fuels market as it expands in 2026.

4. ERA ONE: Modular Power-To-Liquids Hits an Operational Milestone

Germany entered the spotlight in 2025 with INERATEC’s ERA ONE facility, Europe’s largest operating e-fuels plant. The site can produce up to 2,500 metric tons of synthetic hydrocarbons per year.

The facility showcases a modular design that allows multiple compact reactors to be deployed efficiently. Each module converts renewable hydrogen and captured CO₂ into synthetic hydrocarbons. These outputs are suitable for use as sustainable fuels or vital chemical feedstocks.

Modular approaches could be transformative for the industry. They lower upfront capital requirements and shorten construction timelines, both major barriers for emerging fuel technologies. ERA ONE demonstrated that e-fuel systems can be built at a smaller, distributed scale before scaling up to industrial capacities. By 2026, INERATEC and its partners plan to replicate this model in additional European regions.

5. Project Roadrunner: A Flagship E-SAF FID and Construction Start

Across the Atlantic, U.S.-based Infinium achieved a significant milestone with the Project Roadrunner facility, which reached its final investment decision (FID) and began construction in 2025. Located in West Texas, the plant aims to produce around 23,000 metric tons—or roughly 7.6 million gallons—of electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) annually by 2027. Project Roadrunner represents a pivotal shift in North American energy production, far surpassing its annual output figures.

Project Roadrunner demonstrates the financial and technical confidence now emerging in the U.S. e-fuels sector. By combining domestic renewable power resources with captured carbon from industrial sources, the project offers a blueprint for scaling synthetic fuels in regions with favorable energy economics. If completed on schedule, it could make the United States a leader in eSAF production by the late 2020s.

6. Argus E-SAF Indexes: The First Real Price Mirror for Buyers

In late 2025, Argus Media introduced the world’s first eSAF price indexes, establishing the transparency required for institutional maturity. These benchmarks assess regional eSAF prices in Northwest Europe and other hubs, offering investors and off-takers reliable data for contract negotiation. Before these indexes existed, price discovery was opaque, leaving many projects unable to secure financing.

Standardized pricing transformed the market by establishing the transparency required for institutional maturity. Analysts quickly noted a significant price gap in the market. Costs for eSAF were roughly 13 times higher than conventional jet fuel and 3.5 times higher than bio-based SAF. Despite the high price, transparency created a reference framework for subsidies and cost reduction tracking. The data reinforced how economies of scale and cheaper renewable electricity could narrow the gap in the years ahead.

7. The E-SAF Pipeline Reality Check: Cancellations and Delays

Although 2025 brought impressive policy and investment milestones, it also revealed the fragility of the e-fuel supply chain. A comprehensive e-kerosene outlook revealed significant headwinds for the industry. At least 16 large-scale eSAF projects across Europe were paused or canceled by early 2025.

Several critical bottlenecks contributed to these industrial delays:

Inaccessible financing for high-CAPEX projects.

Uncertain long-term CO₂ feedstock supply.

Severe delays in electrical grid connections.

Supply chain obstacles indicate that Europe risks missing 2030 SAF mandates unless production capacity expands immediately. Developers are now focusing on public-private partnerships to bridge the funding gap. With government support increasing and early facilities like Kassø and ERA ONE demonstrating feasibility, 2026 is shaping up to be the make-or-break year for eSAF scalability.

8. ZEMBA: Shipping Demand Pools Turn Into Booked Volumes

By 2025, shipping decarbonization had gained real momentum through coordinated buying power. The Zero Emission Maritime Buyers Alliance finalized a tender that locked in approximately 70,000 tons of e-methanol and 25,000 tons of e-ammonia for delivery beginning in 2027. Companies such as Hapag-Lloyd and NCL participated, showing that the demand side of the market was finally catching up with supply ambitions.

Aggregated purchasing signals maturity within the industry. Instead of fragmented, small-scale trials, global shipping firms are contracting multi-year volumes that enable producers to secure financing. Private-sector collaboration accelerates the energy transition by complementing policy-driven initiatives and aligning with emerging green shipping corridors that test methanol- and ammonia-powered vessels on real trade routes.

9. Maersk: Dual-Fuel Fleets Become the Market’s Metronome

Maersk continued to define the pace of the maritime energy transition in 2025, operating dual-fuel vessels capable of using either traditional fuels or green methanol. Each new delivery added credibility to methanol’s role as a bridge fuel that can immediately reduce lifecycle emissions while e-fuels scale up. The company’s procurement strategy effectively became a market signal for suppliers, port operators, and financiers.

Each Maersk vessel launch drives the development of global port infrastructure, bunkering networks, and standardized fuel protocols. By 2026, analysts expect this fleet to serve as a bellwether for whether e-methanol and e-ammonia can achieve cost parity and availability across global trade routes.

10. Methanol’s Pipeline: Announced Capacity vs. Delivered Reality

The Methanol Institute reported that as of late 2025, there were 252 renewable methanol projects globally, representing more than 45 million tons of announced annual capacity by 2030. However, only a fraction of these are expected to materialize on schedule, given the high capital costs and limited carbon feedstock availability.

This disparity highlights the difference between ambition and execution. While methanol has emerged as the leading candidate for near-term decarbonization in shipping and chemicals, real-world deployments of green methanol as a shipping fuel illustrate how quickly demand grows once supply chains align. In 2026, investors will be watching closely to see which of these projects break ground and which stall at the proposal stage.

11. ANDRITZ Electrolyzer Gigafactory: Scaling the Hardware Layer

In 2025, engineering firm ANDRITZ inaugurated an electrolyzer gigafactory in Erfurt, Germany, with an annual capacity of roughly 1 gigawatt. The Erfurt gigafactory represents a foundational step toward securing the hardware backbone of the hydrogen economy. Electrolyzers split water into hydrogen and oxygen, providing the essential input for e-fuel production.

By increasing production volumes and localizing supply chains, ANDRITZ aims to drive down costs while ensuring component availability for Europe’s rapidly expanding hydrogen projects. The facility’s modular design supports multiple electrolyzer types, including alkaline and PEM systems, allowing for flexibility as technology evolves. This scaling effort lays the groundwork for a green hydrogen supply chain that can reliably feed e-fuel synthesis in the years ahead.

12. Topsoe SOEC Factory: Higher-Efficiency Electrolysis Goes Industrial

Also in 2025, Danish company Topsoe opened the SOEC manufacturing facility in Herning, Europe’s largest solid oxide electrolyzer cell (SOEC) factory. With an initial capacity of 500 megawatts per year and support from the EU Innovation Fund, the site showcases how high-efficiency electrolysis can reduce energy consumption in hydrogen production. SOEC technology operates at higher temperatures, allowing for greater conversion efficiency compared with conventional systems.

Expanding manufacturing capacity drives the economies of scale and technical performance needed to compete directly with fossil fuel pricing. As more factories like this come online, economies of scale and improved performance could accelerate cost parity with fossil fuels.

Critical Commercial Success Factors for Global E-Fuels Growth in 2026

The coming year will test whether the groundwork laid in 2025 can translate into measurable scale. The first metric to watch is final investment decisions (FIDs)—a sign that investors trust both the technology and market conditions. Successful FIDs will unlock construction financing, moving projects from concept to reality.

Identifying Strategic Carbon Feedstocks and Energy Economics

Next, attention will shift to CO₂ sourcing. E-fuels rely on captured carbon, meaning access to affordable CO₂ from biogenic systems will determine production growth. Emerging green ammonia and e-fuel pathways show how fuel molecules and critical mineral supply chains are beginning to converge. Meanwhile, electricity costs remain the largest factor shaping e-fuel competitiveness. Regions with abundant wind and solar power, such as Texas, Chile, and northern Europe, are positioned to lead.

Aligning these strategic factors will enable 2026 to serve as the definitive transition from demonstration projects to genuine commercial scaling. Finally, policymakers will need to ensure that subsidies, contracts-for-difference, and tax credits align to de-risk early projects.

Scaling Synthetic Fuel Production for the 2026 Global Energy Transition

The progress recorded throughout 2025 confirms that the era of theoretical decarbonization has ended, giving way to a period of active industrial execution. With the launch of massive electrolyzer gigafactories and the implementation of binding fuel mandates, the primary hurdles to adoption are shifting from technical feasibility to economic scalability. Corporate leaders and policymakers have successfully demonstrated that the power-to-liquid pathway is viable, creating a roadmap that other regions are already beginning to replicate.

Sustaining Momentum Through Policy and Infrastructure Alignment

As 2026 approaches, the focus moves toward stabilizing supply chains and securing the vast quantities of biogenic carbon required for continuous production. The transition from pilot projects to mainstream energy pillars will require sustained investment and a continued focus on driving down the cost of green hydrogen. If the current trajectory of innovation and policy alignment persists, synthetic fuels will likely become the dominant decarbonizing force for global trade before the end of the decade.

Essential Insights on E-Fuels and Decarbonization

How Are E-Fuels Produced for Industry?

Synthetic fuels are created by synthesizing green hydrogen with captured carbon dioxide to create carbon-neutral liquid energy.

Why Are Synthetic Fuels Vital for Aviation?

Aviation requires high energy density that batteries cannot provide, making drop-in synthetic fuels the most efficient way to lower flight emissions.

What Influences the Current Cost of E-Fuels?

Pricing is primarily dictated by the availability of affordable renewable electricity and the efficiency of electrolyzer hardware used in production.

How Do E-Fuels Differ from Traditional Biofuels?

E-fuels rely on renewable power and carbon capture rather than organic waste, avoiding land-use conflicts and agricultural resource competition.

When Will E-Fuel Mandates Impact Global Markets?

The facility will produce SAF through the co-processing of used cooking oil (UCO) in the refinery’s Full Conversion Hydrocracker Unit, effectively leveraging existing infrastructure and minimising additional capital intensity.

Advancing India’s SAF Blending Targets

With this development, India has taken a decisive step towards achieving its SAF blending targets of one percent by 2027, two percent by 2028, and five percent by 2030. The initiative reflects steady progress in India’s transition to cleaner and more sustainable aviation fuels.

Roadmap for Commercial-Scale SAF Production

The Visakh refinery will begin producing approximately ten thousand metric tons (TMT) of SAF per annum from January 2027, following CORSIA certification. The production will contribute directly to India’s efforts to decarbonise aviation. It will also promote a circular, waste-to-wealth economy by using used cooking oil as a feedstock.

Alignment with Global Climate Commitments

The SAF initiative aligns with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA was adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Under CORSIA, airlines must offset emissions exceeding a defined baseline. SAF is a critical tool for long-term emissions reduction in international aviation.

The Surprising Airline Price Wars

Air travel is becoming increasingly unaffordable. As airlines and governments impose various fees, surcharges, and taxes, the cost of flying continues to rise globally. In 2026, passengers are finding themselves facing larger bills for their flights, as airlines pass the cost of fuel, labor, and environmental regulations onto customers. This article explores the various factors behind the dramatic increase in airfares and what it means for travelers.

The Role of Airlines in Raising Ticket Prices

Airlines are directly responsible for a significant portion of the rising airfare prices. Many carriers are imposing fuel surcharges, which are adjusted based on fuel prices. For instance, Delta Air Lines has been charging passengers from Japan hefty fuel surcharges that can add hundreds of dollars to the cost of a ticket. This is not an isolated incident. Emirates, Japan Airlines, and American Airlines are also introducing fuel surcharges that increase flight pricesAirline Fare Research.

One particularly notable example is the Emirates surcharge on flights from Japan, where passengers are expected to pay up to ¥39,500 for certain routesAirline Fare Research. Similarly, Japan Airlines recently updated its fuel surcharges, which vary depending on the destinationAirline Fare Research. These surcharges are added to the base airfare, making the total cost of a ticket much higher than initially expected.

The logic behind these surcharges is simple: airlines are trying to shield themselves from the volatility of fuel prices. When oil prices spike, airlines pass these costs on to passengers, who are left to bear the brunt of unpredictable fuel price fluctuations.

The Growing Green Tax: Environmental Costs and Aviation

As if rising fuel prices weren’t enough, airlines are also being required to comply with stricter environmental regulations. Lufthansa, for example, has introduced an “Environmental Cost Surcharge,” which helps fund sustainable aviation fuel mandates and emissions trading schemes. The fee can range from €1 to €72, depending on the flight’s route and classAirline Fare Research. This green levy is just one example of how environmental regulations are making air travel more expensive.

Similarly, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore has introduced a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) levy that will be applied to flights from Singapore starting in October 2026. The SAF levy will affect both economy and premium cabins, with long-haul passengers being hit hardestAirline Fare Research. These green taxes are seen as necessary for reducing aviation’s environmental impact, but they are also contributing to soaring ticket prices.

Government Taxation: A Hidden Culprit

Governments are also adding their own layers of cost to air travel. The United Kingdom, for example, raised its Air Passenger Duty (APD) in April 2026. The tax now ranges from £32 for short-haul flights to £253 for long-haul flightsAirline Fare Research. This increase in tax is expected to have a significant impact on ticket prices, especially for travelers flying to distant destinations.

Similarly, Canada has increased its Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC) by as much as 33%Airline Fare Research. This new tax means that passengers will be paying more for security checks when they fly. Although this charge is collected by airlines, it’s an additional burden for passengers who are already grappling with rising base fares and fuel surcharges.

Airlines Get Creative with Fees: The Case of Turkish Airlines

Some airlines are finding new ways to increase revenue without directly raising ticket prices. Turkish Airlines, for example, has introduced a new charge for infant passengers. Previously, infants flying with a parent on their lap would often fly for free or pay a small percentage of the adult fare. Now, Turkish Airlines charges 610 Turkish Lira for domestic flights and 915 Turkish Lira for connecting flightsAirline Fare Research. This seemingly minor fee is a part of the growing trend of airlines monetizing every aspect of air travel, even infant passengers.

Global Comparisons: A World of Rising Prices

Airline fare increases are not limited to any one region. From Australia to Europe and the United States, passengers are facing rising costs. In the U.S., domestic flight prices have increased dramatically for certain city-pair routes. For example, the Austin–Detroit route saw a massive fare hike of 51.5% from $205 to $310Airline Fare Research. Similar increases have been recorded for other routes, with some cities seeing airfare rises of 30% or moreAirline Fare Research.

Even low-cost carriers like Ryanair have raised fares. After a year of cutting prices, the airline saw a 13% increase in average fares for the first half of 2026, a trend that is likely to continue as demand for travel picks upAirline Fare Research.

How Airlines Are Justifying Higher Costs

Airlines typically justify the rising costs by blaming external factors. For example, Ryanair pointed to the costs of environmental taxes and fuel surcharges in explaining its fare increasesAirline Fare Research. Similarly, Qantas cited rising wages, engineering costs, and airport charges as reasons for its higher faresAirline Fare Research. While these reasons are certainly valid, they place the financial burden on passengers, who have little choice but to accept the higher prices.

Is There Any Relief in Sight?

Some airlines have attempted to provide relief to passengers by introducing caps on fares or offering discounts. For example, Air India capped its economy-class fares on non-stop domestic flights following directives from the Indian government to prevent price gougingAirline Fare Research. However, these efforts are relatively rare and do little to offset the broader trend of increasing prices.

The overall message from airlines and governments is clear: passengers should brace for higher ticket prices in the years to come. While some carriers are trying to offer competitive pricing, the global trend is towards rising costs across the board.

Higher Fares Are Here to Stay

As we enter 2026, it’s evident that airfare inflation is not going away anytime soon. Airlines and governments are working in tandem to raise ticket prices through surcharges, taxes, and new levies. Whether it’s the fuel surcharge imposed by Delta, the environmental tax introduced by Lufthansa, or the Air Passenger Duty hike in the UK, passengers will continue to feel the pinch.

In the future, travelers should expect to pay more for their flights and be prepared for hidden fees and charges that are often not disclosed upfront. While some airlines are trying to mitigate costs through discounts or fare caps, the overall trend suggests that airfares will remain high for the foreseeable future.

For passengers planning their travel, the key takeaway is simple: budget for higher ticket prices and keep an eye on additional fees. If current trends continue, flying will only get more expensive, and understanding the complex network of fees and surcharges will become more important than ever before.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airlines-price-surge.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 14:11:43.565907

CC - Oh dear, looks like yet another example of you not having a clue about the company / products you are invested in. Your poor / non-existent research and lack of knowledge shines through again. You post -

“You’d think shortages would lead to higher SAF prices.”

Let's cover the bases in nice simple terms, so that you might grasp it.

This is not a normal commodity market where scarcity automatically translates into higher prices. SAF pricing is politically constructed, mandate-driven and subsidy-dependent, not led by demand. The airlines are NOT clambering over themselves in a frenzied need to buy SAF - they'd be quite happy not to have to buy any. Only green-washing and politics might claim otherwise.

Why would any airline buy SAF when it doesn’t have to?

Airlines operate on razor-thin margins. SAF typically costs 2–5× conventional jet fuel. In a competitive industry where fuel is the largest operating cost, voluntarily paying multiples of market price is commercial suicide unless forced to do so. Only a handful of jurisdictions — principally the UK and the EU — currently mandate SAF blending. Much of the rest of the world does not. That creates an immediate and unavoidable distortion:

A non-SAF-using US airline can undercut a UK or EU airline on the same long-haul routes. The US have incentivized SAF usage but it is not mandatory. Figures are targets but by no means compulsory. If economics dictate that it is too costly it won't be used. Will Trump ditch those costly incentives? Drill baby, drill suggests so.

Lower fares win customers.

The “green premium” is not recoverable in ticket pricing.

This is pretty basic stuff - it is not rocket science.

As a result, airlines are reluctant buyers, and when they do buy SAF, they do so grudgingly and opportunistically — often only to the minimum level required for regulatory compliance.

Crucially, airlines are also unwilling to commit to long-term SAF offtake agreements. Why? Because SAF economics are entirely dependent on transient political support: Subsidies, blending credits, tax incentives and mandated targets that can (and do) change with elections and fiscal pressure.

No airline CFO is going to lock into long-term, above-market fuel contracts when the legislative framework underpinning the price can be altered or withdrawn at short notice.

That reluctance feeds directly into the supply side. Without long-term purchase commitments, producers cannot justify the capital investment required to scale SAF production. And without scale, costs don’t come down. Raising prices further only reduces demand even more, making the problem worse, not better.

So while there may be a headline “scarcity” of SAF today, it is a structural and artificial scarcity, not one driven by organic market demand. There is no deep, desperate, cash heavy buyer base waiting to willingly pay higher prices.

Of course it's not a market driven by simple supply and demand.

However, that needs to change and it can change quickly and easiily; but the framework needs to change and IMO it will. Quick enough for 80M shareholders, who knows.

Why would airlines have to buy SAF when they don;t have to, exactly.That's where we are at the moment.

They might start buying it if they can't fly or land their planes without it and I am sorry but we are starting to see signs of that.

CC - Take a look at this recent article (15.12.25) which provides a broker’s analysis of Neste (link below). The stock has more than doubled from its April 2025 lows, though it remains around 60% lower over a three-year view. Share price recovery now seems to be on a decent ascend due to company specific reasons (e.g. management change) and factors relating to the bigger picture.

As for the bigger picture, the article says: [Demand visibility has improved across key markets. In Europe, the impact of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive III is starting to be felt, with Germany recently passing draft legislation that should support significantly higher renewable fuel volumes from 2026. “The 2026 renewable volume obligation in the U.S. is also expected to be sharply higher, which should support margins in the country next year,” the analysts said.] End

Loso Judijanto

Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) is an underutilized feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, positioning waste valorization as a game-changing strategy for aviation decarbonization and the implementation of a circular economy. This qualitative literature review synthesizes recent research (2020-2025) from various journals to evaluate the environmental, technological, economic, and policy dimensions of POME-based SAF. Key findings indicate that POME-derived SAF achieves 65-80% lifecycle greenhouse gas emission reductions compared to conventional jet fuel, with 25-30% of climate benefitsderived from avoided methane emissions through improved wastewater management. Hydrothermal liquefaction and hydro processing pathways demonstrate technical feasibility for compliance with ASTM D7566, while anaerobic digestion remains the most commercially mature conversion route. Indonesia and Malaysia's combined POME generation of 119-178 million metric tons annually creates scalable feedstock potential supporting 360-480 million gallons of SAF production—addressing aviation's primary feedstock scarcity constraint. However, economic viability depends critically on policy support mechanisms, including blending mandates, carbon credits, and cost parity subsidies. Critical challenges include certification integrity (fraud prevention), smallholder inclusion, and potential rebound effects from expanded palm oil cultivation. Indonesia's emerging SAF roadmap, export restrictions prioritizing domestic value addition, and investment in biorefinery infrastructure position it as a potential global leader in POME-SAF production. The analysis concludes that POME-based SAF, through integrated technological optimization, strengthened policy frameworks, and inclusive supply chain development, can meaningfully contribute to aviation's decarbonization while demonstrating circular economy principles at scale.",https://www.wecmelive.com/assets/images/logo.png,N,,2026-01-03 06:12:56.572997

Rather than focus on one specific area of law or operate a general practice that tried to cover all areas, we decided to focus on a single industry — agriculture. Our clients — farmers, ag-tech providers, and businesses that work in agriculture — were grateful to find lawyers dedicated to their industry. Looking back at how our firm has evolved during the past decade, I see many ways agriculture has changed and how our practice has changed with it.

The business of agriculture has continued to advance. Ten years ago, agriculture was on the cusp of a digital transformation. The ag-tech boom was just beginning, following the ag-data gold rush sparked by Climate Corporation’s sale to Monsanto for nearly $1 billion in 2013. Ag-tech startups were being launched everywhere as Silicon Valley sought to disrupt farming the way it had disrupted brick-and-mortar retailers with internet shopping. Legacy agricultural companies were scrambling to keep pace with ideas from these new startups. Ten years later, the dust has settled on the ag-tech boom, and yet we have not seen major disruption to ag supply chains. Instead, we have seen gradual evolution and improvement to long-standing models, made more efficient by digital tools and connectivity.

Rural America has seen diversification in the landscape from renewable energy projects. Ten years ago, farmland pressures came mainly from urban sprawl and residential development. But now, the Midwest is dotted with renewable projects — wind farms, solar developments, anaerobic digesters producing biogas. The use of corn and soy to create biofuels now includes sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). American farms do not just produce crops; they produce energy.

Livestock farms have continued to survive and thrive. Ten years ago, plant-based “meat” products looked to be rapidly expanding into grocery store shelves. Similarly, alternative “milk” products made with almonds and oats started to expand market share. But a decade and one pandemic later, traditional proteins are having a resurgence, and desire for alt-proteins appears to have stalled. We are especially happy to see our livestock producers doing well and expanding their farming operations.

The practice of law has changed, too. When we started this firm, we felt like we were cutting-edge. No expensive offices, marble floors, mahogany desks, or file rooms filled with paper. Instead, we operated with laptops, cell phones, cloud-based software, and modest but modern accommodations provided in a building full of ag commodity groups (thanks, Jane Ade Stevens). We were ahead of the curve in creating a streamlined office environment.

While there have been many changes to both agriculture and the practice of law in the past ten years, the core of our business has remained the same. That core focus is on building human relationships. More than anything, after ten years, I am grateful for those relationships — clients, co-workers, friends, and family — that have helped make us successful. Here’s to ten more years!",https://www.precisionfarmingdealer.com/ext/resources/images/2019/Summer/DataSecurity/Todd-Janzen.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 01:11:51.948398

And I'm going to come to the India Energy Week point in a minute or two.
So let me ask you about India Energy Week.
I think that kind of spirit, that kind of confidence, that's what we want to showcase in India Energy Week.","NOTE: This transcript contains the host's monologue and includes interview transcripts by a machine. Human eyes have gone through the script but there might still be errors in some of the text, so please refer to the audio in case you need to clarify any part. If you want to get in touch regarding any feedback, you can drop us a message on feedback@thecore.in.

Shukla, thank you so much for joining me. So it's been an eventful year, maybe in geopolitics, with geopolitics linked to energy as well. But that's not what I'm going to ask you about.

What's the most interesting or the most interesting challenge that you've been posed in the context of the work that you're doing from perhaps the clients that you talk to, either existing or potential?

First of all, thank you for speaking with me again. And it's an absolute delight to speak on so many issues that we continue from last year. Interestingly, the question that you ask is my answer wouldn't be entirely from the oil and gas.

Very recently, in fact, this has been for the last about a year or so. And very recently, our honourable minister directed that we look at one development which has happened in the sector, which is a solar cooker. And this was this is developed by Indian Oils, R&D.

And he challenged that whether we as a team jointly or otherwise can look at reducing the cost as well as the weight of the solar cooker such that it becomes, you know, affordable and friendly to the mass that, you know, who would be the end user. And it can have a better efficiency as well. So this is one challenge which would probably be a game changer for, you know, steering the solar mission as well and using the solar heat for cooking medium.

Also bring down the energy requirement and the energy cost, especially of households which are challenged in terms of their capacity to purchase, you know, oil and gas for their electricity.

And that's and I'm going to ask you more about the cooker. But that's an interesting point which maybe people have missed, which is that we can address the problems on the demand side as well. And really going right into the house and saying that each of these components of consumption of energy and how can I maybe find solar sources for them?

So the cooker sounds interesting. So tell us more about the cooker itself. And how is your cooker different from Indian Oils?

So I think it's a collaborative effort because the initiation and the credit of the first development and the second development goes to Indian Oil R&D. And we put an independent mind and it's always good to have a second round or a third round of in-depth analysis of the elements that can go into improvement of efficiency, reduction of cost, reduction of weight. And as Engineers India, we have a team which has the expertise in insulation, on materials, on electrical systems.

So it's a, you know, a task in progress, work in progress. It has achieved some milestones and we have challenged ourselves that within a month's time, we would target a really significant reduction on that, on all of the fronts, such that it becomes affordable, you know, for the for end-users. Now, although the solar energy is not a 24-7 available, but today we need all kinds of energy and any element of decarbonised energy and especially solar-based you know, heat that can be used at the end for any of us would be anything, would be an added benefit, you know, in the whole ecosystem of the energy space.

So let's take a step back. And if you were to look at the last year and the work that you've been doing, you've been doing a lot of international work.

Your order book has been the highest ever. And you're also doing a lot of domestic work, which is not to do with oil and gas. You're working in academia, building infrastructure, urban infrastructure and data centres, which is the hottest thing right now.

And I'll come to that in a bit. So tell us about what are the more exciting landmarks for you in the last year?

So the last year has been, last few years, I would say, have been instrumental in steering and shaping the landscape of our business portfolio, the current business portfolio as it is. And where we look forward in the future to lead from the front as an engineering company with excellence and international footprint. So on the international front, very recently we signed a contract to build four very large fertiliser trains in Nigeria for the Dangote group.

These are larger than any of the Indian Urea trains. They are four to five zero TPD of urea. And that puts us into the global map of engineering consultants who have the ability and who have garnered the trust of a very prestigious, large group internationally to implement these projects on a PCM basis.

Similarly, the Dangote group is also looking at adding another 33 million tonnes, 650,000 barrels per day of refinery in the same region, in the same location as we have built the first one, which will bring up the capacity of that single location to 1.2 million barrels per day, which is a very, very large capacity at one place. Again, it is a testimony of the ability of our engineering and project management teams. Would that be larger than any single installation in India?

Yes. Yes. It would be put together at least two such installations of our nation at Patlu and also the six fertiliser trains eventually.

So that will be a conglomeration of refinery, petrochemicals, as well as fertiliser, one of its kind in the entire world. So that's one historic landmark which we have achieved in the last year. Besides, as you mentioned on the diversification part on the other than oil and gas, the world and our clients have found merit and found value in the abilities that our teams have and the experience that they have, you know, over the last 60 years or so, and the strong database and, you know, the wherewithal to solve any of the problems.

So those kind of USPs that we bring on the table for our clients have helped us steer and navigate in, let's say, the fertiliser sector for one, which we weren't a major player earlier and in the infrastructure sector, because there is any client who puts in investments, who puts in, you know, have large capital projects, looks at the ability of the consultant to give a quality delivery, delivery as much as can be possible in the schedule. But more importantly, having cost control, good processes and procedures for procurement. And all these are they are inherent in our teams.

And that's one reason why we have gone beyond the oil and gas. And today, as we speak for this financial year, we have almost 50 percent of our order inflow from international operations. And our order book, which is about 13,700 crores, is an all time high for our organisation.

And we are also hopeful for growing it further.

And tell us about the most technologically complex or fascinating or interesting projects that you're working on right now compared to your past, whether it's an oil and gas or outside.

I think the project which is unique to the industry and the world as well is the Bamboo Refinery, which was dedicated by the Honourable Prime Minister in September in Umar Egar. And that is a second generation ethanol project with some byproducts, which is unique in comparison to other 2G ethanol projects, which just makes second generation ethanol. And we put together that plant with the most exotic material, metallurgy, with new vendors, both national and international, with the equipments which no one has ever operated before.

And our team has supported that plant in troubleshooting, in pre-commissioning. There were huge challenges because people have not faced environments of the nature of slurry, of acidity in the process streams and how to manage the corrosion aspects, the plugging aspects and so many other aspects. These all fluids are not proper fluids, they're non-Newtonian fluids.

So you cannot apply the same principles of chemical engineering, transport phenomena as you do in the plants that we have conventionally done. So that's been a great learning. And the success of the commissioning and operation of that plant is actually is a testimony of the fact that it was extremely exciting, challenging, yet very satisfying at the end when it all came together.

And there's a sort of general knowledge question, perhaps. How do you start with bamboo or because bamboo is already available there and you say, OK, now let's see if we can find another use for it, because obviously one would think of sugar when one thinks of ethanol or maize.

So see, these technologies are some of them are feed agnostic. So whether you look at rice straw or you look at wheat straw or you look at cotton, it's likely tough to, you know, go to second generation ethanol, it's a tough feedstock per se. Or you look at stubble or, you know, any kind of those feedstocks.

People also look at growing some kind of grasses on purpose to get second generation ethanol. So these are all feedstocks which are, you know, available for technology, technologies which are feed agnostic. This particular technology is designed for bamboo because it has a separate processing steps.

Bamboo being, you know, the nature of bamboo being slightly different than, you know, the straw. So the lignin content, the cellulosic content is quite unique in that. And this process deploys a solvent, which is again in variance to the typical enzymatic hydrolysis processes which are there in technology.

And therefore, it finds value in making byproducts like acetic acid and furfural. So that way, this, in fact, was brought up from a technology readiness level, which was very low. So it's one thing to repeat a technology which has been commercialised.

That's the easy part. It could be complex. It could be extremely like a steam cracker or a dual feed cracker, which is very complex.

But you've done it before. World has done it before. And there are set equipment, set suppliers, set systems.

Not much, except you need to kind of put it together. But in this particular case, there was nothing on ground. It's absolutely a blank slate.

And you cannot fail because it is a sizable investment. So I think that itself is, you know, proving the fact that on the client end, there was huge support from maybe RPL, NRL, as well as EIL teams. They work together to put this marvel together, which is totally unique in terms of the context where we are talking today.

Moving from the conventional energy space, the fossil space, slowly by and by transitioning to the green fuels.

And I'm going to come back to this in a moment. You know, but when you look at the entire energy spectrum at one level, let's say there are data centres today who are being set up. The companies that are investing in data centres are also investing in energy companies or setting up energy plants, which was completely unknown or unheard of even a few years ago.

So there are large gigawatt capacity because they have to feed those data centres. So that's a new requirement. An extension of that is obviously investments in nuclear power.

And that is something that you're also involved in with small, small modular reactor. So when you look at the energy, the energy spectrum, it's very difficult to make out what is going in where and what is coming out, because everything inside is being changed around, including the bamboo example that you gave. So how do you see this world?

Yeah, so it's it's a complex world, but I think everybody attempts to make it simple. For example, let's say today the Delhi metro is run by power generated in Madhya Pradesh. So it is complex.

And we were looking at a project of making green ammonia in Odissa with power generated in Rajasthan. So there are this kind of synergies. Yet there are challenges how to put together these elements of, you know, in the game of things.

So you're right. Data centres are a big thing. And especially data centres with renewable power, with a lower carbon footprint, will definitely need huge power capacity for computation needs and data storage, etc.

That is one of the big sectors which is likely to see and we have heard so many announcements. I don't want to name them or how they will pan out and, you know, play out will be seen, but it's a huge opportunity for making capital investments and for us to do project execution as well. So we are in the finishing stages of one data centre, which is a 10 megawatt four data centres at one location.

We've done before some data centres for SBI, for state government of Rajasthan, for UADI here in Delhi. So that experience of creating the framework of the data centre, making it ready for certification for tier four uptime. I think these are the experiences which we as a company bring on the table and the end customer needs, you know, companies who have that prior experience so that their work gets executed smoothly in a kind of efficient and affordable manner as well.

I'm going to come to nuclear in a moment, but you talked about customers, right? I mean, even the nature of customer. I mean, one day, let's say you were dealing with a oil and gas conglomerate in Nigeria or for that matter, in India.

But tomorrow you could be dealing with a social platform like a Meta or someone who's because they're investing in so much. And you two are looking at urban infrastructure and others. So how does that play on your own as a company?

I mean, how does that play in terms of, you know, because it calls for a different frequency because you're not, you know, dealing with maybe, you know, a new age tech organisation is quite different from dealing with a traditional petrochemical or oil and gas company. True, true.

You're so right. Today, we have clients from across the world and across sectors. And you're very right.

The both the expectations, the working style, the procurement processes, the work culture is very, very different. In fact, at times we are challenged by adopting to that work culture. And many times clients also look for that flexibility.

They look for agility and they look for many other responsiveness, communication. These are a lot of skills which especially international clients and especially marquee clients, if you talk of Meta and clients like those, they would look expect from a consultant. So we have different teams, like, for example, the teams which work in Abu Dhabi are very well orientated to the needs of that region.

They're very familiar with the processes, the protocols, the standards and how to even converse, how to even communicate, how to even give documentation. So they are trained in that manner. Similarly, let's say we are looking at data centre when we work for SBI or we work for state.

Let's tell you, let me tell you the one that we are doing now, although it's a client of the central, you know, the government sector, but they're very demanding. It's not that and they're very knowledgeable as yet. So that's another point that clients today are very knowledgeable, sometimes more knowledgeable than us.

And that creates, poses a challenge for us, also an opportunity to build up that skill set to match, you know, their wavelength or give what they expect of us. Likewise, if you see some of the private sector clients, there are some private sector clients who work with a very work breakdown approach. They would like to be controlling every little bits and pieces of it because they need good cost control.

They need, you know, they don't have the bandwidth and rightfully so. They're very efficiently run with a smaller team and they're very conscious of the fact that we should be. So we do work with them.

Then you have also some clients who look at, who don't look at the cost, let us say, of the whole project in somebody who looks at a macro level, somebody who can look at a micro level. So you need to go down to the detail because the devil also lies there. So those are the things which are very different across clients.

And it takes time for the company and the teams to understand that often we are able to fulfil the client's expectations right away. Often we need to recalibrate ourselves, retune ourselves. Sometimes we get feedbacks which we need to, you know, reinvent ourselves and kind of reposition our work style also.

But the good part is that we are there to listen. We are there to take feedbacks and also take corrective actions. The teams are excellent.

The teams are very energetic. We have a low average age. We have youngsters and experienced people who work hand in hand to kind of, and they're very proud of the fact that they belong to a company which has built the energy infrastructure all over the globe for 60 years.

I think they carry that pride on their shoulders and that keeps them going with the ambition and the desire to do better and better.

So let me come to small modular reactors and what's happening in that in that area? What is EIL bringing to the table?

And do you see that whole space taking off?

So we have been attempting to re-enter the nuclear sector. Decades ago, we worked for the heavy water board. We built up their ManuGuru facilities.

Later on, we also supported IGKAR in some liquid sodium technology. We also did the balance of plant for Kodambkulam train one and two and some other projects here and there. Also nuclear fuel complex at Kota for enriching uranium.

So we have been there in the sector for the last few years. We have been attempting to enter the space which will open up post the nuclear liability bill going through, particularly in small modular reactors for the private sector and the public sector. And we have been speaking to the private sector.

Some of the private sector companies who are there in the public domain, we are in touch with them to engage with them. And some of them are also keen to take us on board to do, you know, the seismic and geographical studies to make sure that area is safe to put up a nuclear facility. So this continued attempt and attempt to collaborate to bring on the table the value proposition has actually resulted us in getting the, you know, the trust and faith of NPCIL in them awarding us two modular reactors.

One is a light water reactor, one is a pressurised heavy water reactor, again same to 20 megawatt kind of scale to 20 to 300 megawatt. And we are working on both of them. One is a conceptual design, one is a checking of an existing design such that they can be transformed into an offering for the sector.

And it is very exciting for us. It is also extremely, you know, transformative in the manner that it will take us to a platform where we are having that ability to do conceptual work in the core facility. So many of this, the work that we have done is out of the core nuclear, you know, island.

And this will help us go in there and look at offering our expertise there itself. So not only will it expand our portfolio, it will also make us part of the growth journey. And that's what we want.

EIL has always been there as and when the industry has developed, whether the refinery industry developed, then the petrochemical or offshore or the green technologies or data centres or buildings or wherever you go. So we want to be there when the actual investments happen so that we are better positioned than many other, you know, similar companies. Plus, also, let us keep in mind that nuclear is a strategic sector and a very critical sector which needs a high level of safety and reliability.

And who other than us would be, should be the natural partners of, you know, clients who would like to make that investment.

You mentioned Kudankulam, so a lot of that would be 20-25 years ago. I mean, I'm just wondering how many people who worked on nuclear in EIL are still around?

So that is about 2015-2016. So about 10-12 years ago. So we have teams.

We have some youngsters who have now become the middle level leaders and they are very much there. They, in fact, are very familiar with the teams on the other side as well. So the teams know each other.

That brings, you know, comfort as well as confidence. So we have talent. We have talent and we always intake more talent.

So we have the experience. We have the talent. We have the will.

So we hope to make huge inroads when the sector opens.

So let me come back to the bamboo part and not the bamboo part so much when you talked about the feedstock agnostic technology. Yes. So what else could we be using if we want to do ethanol?

I'm not saying only ethanol, but let's say even as we try and solve or sort of fill in the many energy blanks.

Right. So as we move forward, we have already got 20 percent blending of ethanol and gasoline. And as we move forward, either we get the flex engines, you know, wherein the sectoral, cross-sectoral kind of collaboration is required from the automotive sector as well as from the consumer.

They should also have the comfort to get that, you know, 100 percent ethanol. And they are already, I don't know the number, the many pumps which are also selling 100 percent ethanol. So it's a market driven, customer centric, product centric and, you know, those kind of factors.

But the target to get a blending of sustainable aviation fuel in jet fuel, when we're looking at 1 percent in 2027 and 2 percent in 2028, and we need to meet the regulatory framework, of course, in times to come, being the hub of aviation today as we speak. And so many airlines which are fuelling in the country, we will need to build up that capacity. And why I'm saying this, because ethanol becomes one of the feedstocks for taking A to J, alcohol to jet.

And that's one of the pathways to creating a sustainable pool of jet fuel. So going back to the feedstocks of ethanol, where you would limit the feedstocks for the second generation ethanol, again, second generation ethanol has its own challenges. It is having a price point which needs, which will find it difficult to have multiplicity of investments.

Also, the seasonality of the feedstocks, the price of the feedstocks and the ecosystem, the whole supply chain of feedstocks would be challenged. So the industry is looking at other feedstocks like spoiled grains, dented corn and feedstocks which are not good for, which don't conflict with the, you know, the dialogue about fuel and food and fuel. So those non-conflicting feedstocks, if they can be converted to alcohol, which have more sugar content than the other feedstocks, which are more lignin like straws, etc., I think those pathways are going to take a prominent position in the future to make way for creating a pool of, you know, SAF, which would help in keeping the hegemony of India as, you know, the hub of the airlines, which is going to be huge in times to come. There's fastest growing fuel as well as creating, you know, a decarbonised fuel system, also use of food grains. We have with surplus of food grains.

God has not been kind in giving us as much of the, you know, the like the Middle East, the oil and gas maybe, but we have food grains which we export in plenty, wherein we are surplus in several of them. So some kind of balance wherein we bridge, we overcome the nuances of, you know, kind of keeping the food safety in place, food security in place, I would say, well, where and also meet the second element of sustainable fuels. I think those kind of that kind of ecosystem will be in place in times to come.

Right. And it's interesting because what you're saying is that when we think about sustainable fuels or ethanol injection into fuel, we shouldn't be only thinking about cars and bikes. We should be seeing about aircraft.

Yes.

Which is not what normally comes to mind.

Yes. Yes, definitely.

So, OK, so if, you know, if you were to look at strategically, so as a country, we were investing heavily in renewable, which we continue to, but we're also meeting a lot of targets earlier than perhaps what we thought. So that's good. On the other side.

For geopolitical reasons, among other things, we are facing pressure, let's say, on the fossil fuel side. And I can see that or I can sense that there's a lot of pressure now to amp up our fossil fuel once again.

Yes.

How is that playing out for you?

So for us, I think all fuels are good. As many, the better. So we are there in green hydrogen.

We are doing, we are working in SAP with the 2G ethanol on the sustainable fuel. We are, we know the core, you know, space as well. But what we see going forward is we see a huge growth in the demand.

So it is only seasonal. To assume that this low seasonal growth is going to be sustainable may not be true. We are a growing economy and you've seen the numbers as, you know, every quarter results surprise you.

They, even if you see the real GDP or, you know, it is, you can feel the vibrancy of the economy as you move in the country, you know, and that is evident in the investments, the projects that you see all over. It is actually there and you travel in many other countries, you won't find that. And I think that is something which is going to continue.

So the growth in the energy demand is going to continue. Coupled with that will also be both our own INDCs, our own intrinsic commitment to the COP as well as ourselves to decarbonise will remain. So we need to have a balance of both the fossil fuels as well as the green fuels.

And as an organisation, EIL has been able to position itself very well on both domestic and international front on both. Today, we are also looking at a SAF project in Indonesia because we are doing a SAF project here. And we are talking to others as well, looking at, you know, green projects internationally because now that we have the, so what we have been doing all our life as an organisation is we build our core in India because we have more leverage, we have more dialogue, more easy access, more acceptability, price point competitiveness and so on and so forth.

We build that capability here, then we start looking at opportunities internationally. So we've got a breakthrough very recently of a SAF project in Indonesia, which is a testimony of the fact that we did one second generation ethanol here. We've done, we're doing a SAF project in Mangalore for MRPL and now we've got this project.

So this is how I see there is huge opportunity, both domestically and internationally. In fact, there is so much opportunity that delivery becomes a challenge. Just in SAF?

No, no. In general, in overall, that delivery becomes a challenge. You know, how to keep up your capacity and delivery to meet the, you know, the commitments that we have made as a company to deliver these projects.

So we need to upscale our people. We need to expand the resources. We need to get more talent in both at entry level and lateral level.

We need to keep our people more engaged. We have to bring in systems and processes in the organisation which are bringing in a leanness to both the operational aspects. We have to bring in empowerment, which we've done already, empowered the people to take more decisions, both in qualitative and quantitative terms.

So these are all the need to rebuild, to strengthen the organisation from within when we go outside and, you know, commit ourselves to putting projects together.

And I'm going to come to the India Energy Week point in a minute or two. But a couple of questions before that. One is to do with people and the other is to do with Nigeria, which is obviously a giant country in terms of oil or oil and gas.

And tell us about what you encountered there and what is it that we could pick up? I mean, you know, there's a lot of talk nowadays, for example, of South-South collaboration. And you're obviously implementing a very large project there, bigger than anything in India, at least in the refinery space.

So what is it that we can take away from some of these countries and some of these projects that we're working on?

I think the since that the client is a completely international private sector client, there is the desire to complete the project, to get it up and running, have a fast COD. It's watched all over the world. So that puts pressure on both the client as well as us to deliver.

That project scale is tremendous. One thing which strikes us different, which I have not been able to put together in the system in the country, is a lot of use of automation in terms of construction. So because of the challenges of the region, the non-availability of materials, manpower, the skill set machines in Nigeria, there was all the contractors who came there, largely from India, brought in automatic machines, whether it is for welding, for lifting, a lot of automation.

That kind of automation also brings in quality. It brings in a neatness in the product, which is unique. Something similar we are seeing in Mongolia.

We are implementing the largest LOC project in Mongolia. Again, it's an Indian contractor. But the finishing of the work has a different quality.

I think that's one thing which we are trying our best to adopt for our contractors here. Second element, especially in Mongolia, is safety. The angle of safety, even one incident, can be very serious to both the reputation of the owner, us, as well as the contractor.

So the element of safety, consciousness of safety, the desire for safety, so both the quality and safety aspects, similar things in ADNOC also. When we talk to the ADNOC team, I think these are the two learnings which we can and we must bring in into the country. Safety, we are still conscious in the country, but the quality, which could have a little element of cost, you know, because if you bring automation, because you don't have workers there, you need to have automation.

Here you have the workforce, so you bring in less automation, but then you compromise on time and quality. I think this kind of shift would help all three elements. It will help us as consultants, EPCM or PMC.

It will help the contractor finish their work faster. It will also help the owner achieve their completion. I think this is one learning which has to be put up in the ecosystem of the implementation of the oil and gas projects.

The third element which we had there is the constructability that we could experience, the experience that we got in construction. The largest diameter crude column, how we lifted it, how we placed it, the largest diameter RFCC reactor regenerated in diameter, in weight, in the world. So those are something bigger than any of the refineries.

So that experience is the icing on the cake for us, you know, because that is needing a lot of skill, a lot of supervision. That is unique. And that's why we not only train those people, but all the teams who are there bring back that learning into the company as well.

Right. So let me ask you about India Energy Week. So a lot of all of what you've talked about is what you want to showcase.

So people see it and then they obviously come and do business with you and younger people find this interesting and they come and work for you as well. So what are you hoping to showcase?

So the times of today needs that the talent and the talent that we draw in is excited enough to join us on that front. Secondly, on the customer front, we need to showcase the multifarious expertise that we bring on the table and the ability to stitch together not just the less commercially proven technologies, but also complex mega projects, whether it is in India or international. I think that kind of uniqueness, that kind of diverse talent which is available in one organisation, it is extremely rare to find.

So when we bring on the table the concept to commissioning, kind of end to end services under one roof to customer, we want to showcase that in terms of and showcase that in terms of executed projects, which are mega scale, both domestic and international. I think that kind of message and that kind of value proposition we want to bring across to to our customers and to our viewers and attendees in India Energy Week. We also want to, on the second element, also bring on to the table in India Energy Week that we are a company which is always transforming.

We are a company which is forward looking, a company which not only rests on the laurels of the past, but also looks at avenues for future and is willing to position itself, nurture talent, bring in new, fearless in implementing new technologies. I think that kind of confidence that we have, we want to showcase that even if it's the first of its kind, whereas it's the first of a large acrylic plant in the country, whether it is the first of an LPG cavern, which we commissioned in Mangalore, whether it's the first bamboo refinery, first sustainable evasion fuel and first strategic reserve of crude that we built in years ago in in Vizag or the first giant columns in Nigeria or the mega 26 percent petrochemical intensity in Rajasthan. So we've done all that and we have the ability to not only that, but much more. I think that kind of spirit, that kind of confidence, that's what we want to showcase in India Energy Week.

And what do you want to take away?

So we want to take away a lot of client network with us because we need to build on. We have been steadily building on newer clients and we want to keep our customers who are traditionally our customers with us. We want to retain them so that they come back to us for work.

That's something which keeps us going in terms of our repeat delivery to customers. So we want to take away that the goodwill and the connects that we get, not just from our customers, but all stakeholders, because India Energy Week is also about our other stakeholders. We have a Make in India pavilion wherein we nurture the manufacturing industry of the country.

Today, we are more than 96 percent self-sufficient in refinery sector, about 82 percent in petrochemical. And it's largely because of the efforts of Engineers India over the years, decades of service we have done to the nation to build in the manufacturing sector. So these are all our stakeholders.

So they also bring in new products. They bring in new, let's say, pumps, compressors, instrumentation, electrical systems. It's a good platform for them to showcase that and for us to pick those newer technologies into our own specifications.

In addition, it is a platform to collaborate on international front. Every India Energy Week, we have built in some conversations with the world majors in terms of some collaborative effort, which is one of its kind. And being in India and India-centric, it also not only exposes them to, you know, the Indian companies, it also brings in the element that we are there to expand and grow.

There are a lot of investments going to happen. It's an exciting place to be and an aspiration to kind of find each of us, you know, finding some value proposition at the end of the day. So it's a very, very exciting place to be.

Last question. So the last time I asked you about passing out of IIT and then making a choice of one staying back, working in an engineering space with government and so on. When you look at young people today, they're looking at multiple choices and working in manufacturing, working in, let's say, oil and gas is not necessarily the first one.

What would you tell someone or your younger self if in terms of if they are assessing these opportunities, blockchain versus, you know, energy column in a refinery, why and what would you tell them and why should they do what you think they should do?

Again, it's a very personal choice, but I would say that if anybody wants to continue in engineering and keep engineering as a base, it is a very good, you know, the first few years of one's career is there to learn and that learning can happen when you involve yourself with the nuts and bolts of your profession. So the blockchain or any other thing can sit on top of it, you know. So if one wants to continue in an engineering profession and not take finance and not take marketing and not take something else, it would always be good to build one's base for the first few formative years of your career.

You have formative of your life, formative four or five years of your career in a core engineering company or a core company wherein you learn the nuances of everything, because that gives you the confidence and the strength to apply over and above, you know, on top of it, anything you want after five, six years. Not that people might like to spend, if you like it, you love it. You can spend 40 years, why not 50 years or 60 years on the same subject?

But I think the first few years are very important to build a base. My message would be to take a step back, no harm in investing the first few years in especially a company like the oil and gas sector, whether you have a private sector or public sector. The field is very vast.

The exposure is unique. And I would say in a public sector, the exposure is much better than the private sector. The pay comparisons are similar.

It's not that you're losing out on money. They're almost the same. You get more benefits in the public sector if you want to actually go and evaluate on that front as well.

You have nothing to lose per se in terms of value, but the exposure you get is far more important, far more enriching, far more valuable for a long term career growth. And every company is not the same company as it was some few years ago. Every company has a lot of opportunities.

There is a lot of talent. There's a lot of interaction from the top level or even the head level or the ED level to the people. And I have seen in our company a lot of new youngsters that we keep meeting.

They're very excited and we give them a lot of other opportunities like we have multifunctional teams doing some taking up the project on their own. They do their own, you know, improvement systems. So keep them engaged.

They have a lot of, you know, opportunities to take up some, participate in different award schemes, different exciting hackathons and stuff like that. So there is a lot of engagement from the company side also to the youngsters. So we are there to offer that to the youngsters.

And it would be really encouraging for the industry to keep that, you know, vibe of the youth too, because they're also bringing very new things, especially in the digital domain. And we have a team of digital technology services which looks at, you know, developing a lot of, we've developed a lot of ML within use, a lot of chatbots, etc. So there, somebody who's interested, they can go and join there.

There is a lot of opportunity. So it's good to build the first few years in a core engineering and move on if you think other waters are nicer or the grass is greener.

It's a wonderful note to end on. Thank you so much, Shukla I love talking to you.

Lufthansa, a prominent global airline, marks its 100th anniversary, celebrating a century defined by innovation and leadership in the aviation industry. Established in 1926 as Deutsche Luft Hansa AG through the consolidation of several regional carriers, the airline quickly emerged as a pioneer in international air travel. Over the decades, Lufthansa has played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of commercial aviation both within Germany and on the global stage.

A Legacy of Innovation and Resilience

From its inception, Lufthansa set new standards by expanding international routes and adopting cutting-edge technologies. The airline faced considerable challenges following World War II, including the destruction of much of its fleet. Nevertheless, Lufthansa’s resurgence was marked by a determined focus on modernization, exemplified by the introduction of the Airbus A300. This aircraft brought enhanced efficiency and passenger comfort, reinforcing the airline’s commitment to innovation. Throughout its history, Lufthansa has maintained this forward-looking approach, continuously evolving to meet the demands of a dynamic industry.

Advancing Technology and Sustainability Initiatives

Looking to the future, Lufthansa remains at the forefront of technological progress and environmental responsibility. The airline has invested in advanced aircraft such as the Airbus A350 and is actively pursuing ambitious sustainability goals, including achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2050. Efforts to reduce environmental impact encompass the development of biofuels and comprehensive fleet upgrades aimed at improving fuel efficiency.

A significant component of this strategy involves the planned retrofit of 134 Airbus A320 aircraft to optimize flight paths, with work scheduled to commence in 2026. While this initiative is viewed by some investors as a positive step toward greater sustainability and operational efficiency, it also presents substantial technical and financial challenges. The high costs associated with retrofitting and the aggressive timeline have elicited mixed reactions from the market, with concerns raised about the potential financial strain. This move may prompt competitors to accelerate their own sustainability programs or emphasize their technological advancements, potentially intensifying competition within the sector.

Navigating a Complex Industry Landscape

Lufthansa’s centennial arrives amid a period of heightened competition and economic uncertainty in the airline industry. Analysts anticipate increased class segmentation and evolving consumer preferences by 2026, factors that will require Lufthansa to carefully manage its strategic positioning. Recent leadership changes at subsidiaries Eurowings and SunExpress have attracted attention, with industry observers closely monitoring these developments for indications of stability and future direction within the Lufthansa Group.

Sustained Commitment to Passenger Experience

Throughout its evolution, Lufthansa has consistently prioritized customer service excellence. The airline’s investments in premium cabins—including First Class, Business Class, and Premium Economy—alongside exclusive lounges at major hubs such as Frankfurt and Munich, underscore its dedication to passenger comfort. Digital innovations further enhance the travel experience, featuring a comprehensive mobile application that facilitates seamless check-in, personalized services, and advanced in-flight entertainment options.

As Lufthansa commemorates its centenary, it reflects on a distinguished legacy of adaptability and excellence, while embracing a future shaped by sustainability, technological innovation, and an unwavering commitment to world-class air travel.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/0b7cd19daa2b45559b53f35bb8c53af1.avif,N,,2026-01-03 09:11:55.064950

Aviation contributes a meaningful share of global climate forcing and its fuel demand is expected to grow substantially toward mid-century. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is widely viewed as the most practical near-term decarbonization lever for long-haul fleets because it can be blended with Jet A-1 and used within existing aircraft and airport infrastructure. This review synthesizes the state of SAF feedstocks and conversion routes, spanning lipid-based hydroprocessing (HEFA), gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FT), Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), and emerging Power-to-Liquid (PtL) e-fuels produced from CO₂ and renewable hydrogen.

Since the start of 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate requires increasing levels of SAF in the UK’s jet fuel supply to reach 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.[1] Under the mandate, the economic, energy-security and innovation benefits of expanding domestic SAF production are compelling. This policy stability provides a strong, long-term demand signal to accelerate SAF growth, but the challenge remains in reaching bankability.

WSF’s Teesside project is one of the UK’s most advanced second-generation SAF projects, using existing, proven technology to make SAF from waste. Targeting 14,000 tonnes of production per year, the project supports national energy security, by reducing reliance on imported fuels and anchors new green-industry jobs in the Northeast, by converting mainly UK biomethane into next-generation jet fuel. This project has been funded £7.6 million through two rounds of the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund.

Before committing capital to transactions in this nascent sector, financiers need to address risks including technology performance, feedstock, and price/revenue certainty. While the UK mandate provides strong long-term demand certainty, developers need to assemble a complex mix of public and private de-risking tools to meet these requirements.

With a track record of mobilising £77 billion in committed capital to drive the transition and as a key adviser in shaping the UK’s SAF mandate, GFI’s SAF programme will focus on helping leading projects reach FID in 2026. The “accelerator” platform is designed to remove financing barriers and develop solutions that attract private sector investment into pioneering projects.

Key objectives of the accelerator include:

Developing innovative financing and de-risking strategies for SAF infrastructure.

Identifying regulatory and financial gaps that, if addressed, could enable advanced SAF projects to reach FID and deliver volumes aligned with the UK SAF Mandate.

Convening private- and public-sector market participants to develop solutions that address bankability gaps.

Establishing a replicable model for turning policy ambition into built, investable clean-energy infrastructure as a number of UK projects seek to reach FID in the coming year.

“This partnership with the GFI is a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK,” said Dr. Amy Ruddock, Director, Willis Sustainable Fuels. “Together, we aim to create a blueprint for financing solutions that will accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.”

“Our collaboration with WSF exemplifies how strategic partnerships across the value chain can unlock investment for innovative technologies,” said Dr. Rhian-Mari Thomas, CEO at GFI. “By launching this accelerator approach, we aim to scale SAF production to support the UK’s ambitions for a homegrown SAF industry.”

Both organisations will also collaborate on communicating best practice and lessons learned from this process to raise visibility for SAF financing solutions within the UK’s transition finance ecosystem.",https://ethicalmarketingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-twitter-logo-32x32.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 21:56:37.190230

The Asian continent has been identified as a major driver in the biofuel production sector as several nations aim to enter the sector for the first time or expand existing operations to meet an increase in demand from the international market. Now, a leading Malaysian energy company has outlined its plans to pivot towards the sector in 2026, marking a shift in the conventional energy market.

Indonesia plans a gradual shift to biodiesel production in 2026

Several industry experts have noted the role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in 2026, with Indonesia planning to implement a gradual shift to biodiesel production this year.

Indonesia’s government is planning a concept to produce biodiesel up to B100 as part of its efforts to diversify its biofuel production sector. At the moment, biofuel diesel is required to consist of 35 percent fatty acid methyl esters from palm oil and 65 percent diesel fuel under the government’s directive. However, the Indonesian officials have plans to gradually increase that number over time.

“We are preparing concepts up to B100, but this will be done gradually. We will report the developments in due time.” – Indonesian Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Bahlil Lahadalia

Indonesia’s government is preparing for a surge in biofuel usage in 2026 and beyond

The government has noted its intention to construct various supporting infrastructures, including ports, shipping, and logistics, to ensure a smooth, gradual roll-out of the new mandated percentages of bio-feedstock. Industry experts and analysts all point to the Asia continent playing an integral role in the energy transition to the biofuel sector.

Malaysia is planning to boost bio-feedstock production in the new year

Malaysia is following the trend that has emerged in Indonesia to develop a more welcoming environment for bio-feedstock production this year, as the government has noted the opportunity to become a key player in the global shift towards sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Cathay Pacific, a global leader in sustainability projects, has committed to pivoting its focus to developing the bio-feedstock sector in the nation. Several industry analysts have noted the important role that Asia will play in diversifying the energy market in the new year, such as International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh.

“All of these countries have an opportunity to provide feedstock that can be used for the development of sustainable fuels. It’s not just for air transport, it’s also for road transport. When we look at Asia and Southeast Asia, we see lots of feedstock opportunities there. So, there’s an opportunity to develop a whole new industry, generate employment, reduce dependence on importing oil, and create a positive outcome for the environment as well. – International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh

Reshaping the global energy market to expand alternative energy development options will be key in the coming years, as the slow phasing out of oil and gas production enters a new era.

Despite the clear promotion of biofuels in Asia, the conventional upstream sector is still dominating the sector

Asia’s potential in the biofuel industry aside, the conventional upstream energy sector will continue to play a vital role in meeting the expected increase in energy demand that has been reported across several regions of the world. With PETRONAS reaching a major development step in South America recently, the traditional oil and gas sector is not going anywhere anytime soon. Asia will no doubt become a leader in the biofuel sector in 2026, but can the region continue on its path to diversify its energy sector beyond 2026?",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Depositphotos_647886398_XL-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 17:12:21.432122

Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month, according to Yahoo Finance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop.

The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next years crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.

Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by the current President's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the worlds largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trumps massive budget bill take effect later this year.

Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36 per acre. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.

But farmers say the aid wont solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.

Kentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is ""a Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.""

The President of the National Corn Growers Association Jed Bower also urged the Trump administration to focus on cultivating additional uses for their crops. Farmers will benefit from having more buyers whether it is for ethanol and animal feed at home or for international markets.

""Corn growers have been sounding the alarm about the fact that farmers have been faced with multiple consecutive years of low corn prices and high input costs,"" Bower said. ""While this financial assistance is helpful and welcomed, we urgently need the administration and Congress to develop markets in the United States and abroad that will provide growers with more long-term economic certainty.""",https://www.indexbox.io/landing/img/blog/insights/soybean-farmers-1033756.webp,N,,2026-01-03 06:13:02.664711

A Bright Future for United Airlines and Azul’s Partnership As United Airlines has been expanding its interest in Azul, these airlines are expected to take advantage of their bolstered partnership as they move to succeed in the future.","United Airlines has made substantial progress in enhancing its positioning strategy in the Brazilian air transport sector by acquiring an increased stake of nearly 8% in Azul Linhas Aéreas, thereby more than doubling its present stake of 2.02% in the company. This has been made possible through Azul’s Chapter 11 restructuring, which will enable United Airlines to inject an initial investment of US$100 million into Azul, thereby entrenching their partnership and presenting Azul with more opportunities for co-operation on the continent. CADE, Brazil’s competition authority, cleared the deal, which will enable United Airlines to increase its economic interest in Azul.

This development is likely to have a number of benefits to both of them, with United Airlines acquiring more presence in Brazil, which is considered to be one of the most prominent tourist as well as business centers in South America. However, since Azul is undergoing processes aimed at restructuring, United Airlines’ additional stake in the company helps it grow in Brazil and Latin America.

Leveraging Strategic Partnerships for Tourism and Connectivity Growth

The expanded partnership between United Airlines and Azul is set to fuel tourism growth between Brazil and the United States, providing travelers with more direct routes and codeshare flights. United Airlines has already been collaborating with Azul for years, but this increase in stake strengthens their collaborative efforts, ensuring a seamless travel experience for passengers traveling between the two countries.

This partnership is expected to boost inbound tourism to Brazil, with United Airlines continuing to connect passengers from key US markets to Brazilian cities, including São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte. Meanwhile, Azul’s vast domestic network provides United with an opportunity to tap into Brazil’s regional markets, increasing the number of connections and providing more options for travelers seeking to explore Brazil and South America.

As both airlines expand their codeshare agreements and joint services, tourists and business travelers will benefit from increased connectivity, making Brazil more accessible for American travelers and encouraging cross-border tourism.

Supporting Azul’s Restructuring and Future Expansion

The investment by United Airlines in Azul’s Chapter 11 restructuring highlights the importance of strategic collaboration during times of financial restructuring. As Azul works to reduce debt, strengthen its liquidity, and increase its fleet size, the involvement of United Airlines will provide valuable support and expertise to help the airline recover and grow in the competitive aviation market.

With United’s commitment to the partnership and financial backing, Azul is expected to continue its expansion in the coming years. The airline plans to increase its fleet and network capacity, eventually launching international operations to new destinations, and strengthening its position as a leading carrier in Brazil and the South American aviation market.

Expanding Regional Connectivity and Growth in Latin America

Looking ahead, United Airlines and Azul are likely to expand their influence in the region. As regional connectivity grows and demand for air travel increases in South America, the partnership will likely lead to more direct routes and expanded services, enhancing both domestic and international travel options for tourists and business travelers.

With United Airlines already having a strong presence in Latin America, this partnership will make it easier for US passengers to connect to Brazilian destinations, and vice versa. The increased accessibility to key South American hubs, combined with the expanded network, will contribute to the future growth of the tourism sector and the aviation industry in both Brazil and the United States.

Moreover, as Latin American tourism continues to rise, the collaboration between United Airlines and Azul will ensure that both airlines remain competitive and well-positioned to meet the increasing demand for international and domestic flights in the region. This will also boost tourism revenue, particularly in Brazil, which has already seen growing interest from tourists around the world.

A Growing Focus on Sustainable Aviation Practices

As both airlines continue to expand, they will likely place a growing emphasis on sustainability and environmentally responsible aviation practices. The aviation industry is increasingly moving towards eco-friendly solutions, including fuel-efficient aircraft, carbon offset programs, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

United Airlines, which has made sustainability a core component of its operations, will likely collaborate with Azul to incorporate more eco-friendly practices into their operations, helping both airlines contribute to global sustainability goals. This shift towards green aviation is expected to become a key growth factor in Latin America and global aviation, positioning United Airlines and Azul as leaders in sustainable travel.

A Bright Future for United Airlines and Azul’s Partnership

As United Airlines has been expanding its interest in Azul, these airlines are expected to take advantage of their bolstered partnership as they move to succeed in the future. Increased connectivity between Brazil and the United States, governments’ backing to restructure Azul, and future aircraft additions are expected to boost tourism between these two areas.

This strategic partnership is a testament to the increasing need for the collaborations of airlines globally. This is especially because it contributes to the economic development of the countries as well as the development of tourism. The future potential for both United Airlines and Azul is great, as they continue to play a crucial role in the Latin American aviation market.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/United-Airlines-Expands-Stake-in-Azul-to-Eight-Percent.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 15:12:15.382515

Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming so many areas of our lives, and aerospace is no exception. As the sector faces some significant challenges from increasing passenger demand, new environmental imperatives, and the addition of new airspace actors – such as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) – we will see more and more AI driving advancements in safety, efficiency and sustainability.

The question, however, is no longer whether AI will transform aviation, but how it can be applied responsibly, especially as aerospace innovation accelerates at a pace and scale few sectors can match.

Applying AI to aerospace

Modern airspace is a high-stakes puzzle, with thousands of flights criss-crossing the globe daily and traditional air traffic management (ATM) systems currently straining under the load. AI offers critical solutions by enabling dynamic, real-time air traffic flow management. AI-driven algorithms optimise flight paths and sequencing, reducing delays and maximising airspace utilisation. These systems can also enhance resilience, supporting controllers and pilots with automated decision tools during disruptions, thereby improving safety margins.

Predictive maintenance is another significant area of advancement. Imagine knowing if a component will fail before it does. By analysing the multitude of sensor data from an aircraft system, predictive maintenance forecasts wear and tear, enabling airlines to act before problems ground their fleets. This approach reduces unscheduled downtime and operational costs and could be especially useful in areas where aircraft usage doesn’t follow a repeatable pattern – such as in military aircraft.

Aviation operations generate and require vast amounts of data, from weather pattern monitoring and flight plans to fuel usage and emission measurements. AI excels at processing this sort of information, transforming it into usable insights for both airlines and airports. Real-time weather integration enables dynamic rerouting around adverse conditions, enhancing passenger comfort and safety, as well as aircraft longevity. Predictive models can help anticipate congestion in airspace and airports, allowing for proactive traffic flow management that minimises delays and emissions.

Furthermore, AI-driven route optimisation also improves fuel efficiency by minimising unnecessary deviations and optimising flight profiles, supporting the industry’s sustainability goals. Enhanced collaboration and data sharing between airlines, airports, and network managers – facilitated by AI – creates greater shared situational awareness for all airspace users.

The influence of AI extends to emerging domains such as advanced air mobility (AAM) and urban air mobility (UAM). The integration of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft and autonomous drones into existing airspace presents significant challenges across many areas of society. AI-enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) systems could be essential for safely and efficiently managing large volumes of low-altitude operations.

Navigating the headwinds

However, it’s not all plain sailing, and increased automation certainly introduces challenges for the human-machine interface. Operators must maintain situational awareness and be prepared to intervene, much like cars with autopilot modes on the road. Regulatory frameworks still have some way to go to address certification and safety assurance for autonomous systems, ensuring oversight and accountability remain robust, without stifling this innovation.

As AI capabilities grow, the risk of over-reliance on machine outputs becomes more pronounced. Effective training on human-machine teaming is essential to ensure proper use and to build resilience in a potential scenario where automation fails. Crews must be able to manage unexpected behaviours and exercise manual control to ensure safe outcomes in any situation. Human factors and training will remain vital to air operations, with AI augmenting, not replacing, human expertise. In a similar light, there is a need to determine and define accountability in automated air operations, ensuring there is legal liability and accountability.

The cybersecurity of automated air platforms is paramount. The risk of a hostile takeover, either physically or digitally, of an automated aircraft should never be underestimated, similar to that of traditional surface vehicles. At perhaps a less mortal threat level, dataset poisoning or algorithmic sabotage could also play a role in future commercial competition or hostile action.

AI will prove to be a powerful enabler in civil aerospace, offering significant gains in efficiency, safety, and sustainability. This won’t be a simple or rapid transition and will rely on cooperation and collaboration throughout complex supply chains, air operation environments and jurisdictions. By embracing AI thoughtfully, the aerospace industry can achieve a future that is efficient, safe, equitable, and sustainable.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/iStock-1526986072.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:09.360967

BIMB Securities pointed out that Malaysia’s policies lack clear requirements and firm timelines, which could delay adoption by domestic carriers and reduce the fuel’s competitiveness.
However, BIMB Securities said the biggest hurdle remains the high cost of SAF, which is estimated to be around three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

The research house said that while the European Union and the United States have put in place mandatory measures to boost SAF use, Malaysia’s current blending targets remain voluntary and non-binding. This could leave the country in a position where it produces SAF for export without creating enough demand from its own airlines.

BIMB Securities pointed out that Malaysia’s policies lack clear requirements and firm timelines, which could delay adoption by domestic carriers and reduce the fuel’s competitiveness.

SAF, made by blending palm oil or used cooking oil with conventional jet fuel, is regarded by the aviation industry as one of the main ways to reduce carbon emissions from flying.

In the European Union, airlines must ensure that at least 2% of fuel used on departing flights is SAF from 2025, with the share set to rise to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050. In the United States, producers are offered tax incentives if they meet certain conditions.

Malaysia has also acknowledged the importance of SAF and has set a target to produce up to one million tonnes by 2027.

However, BIMB Securities said the biggest hurdle remains the high cost of SAF, which is estimated to be around three times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. Without subsidies, tax breaks or mandatory blending rules, airlines have little incentive to adopt it on a voluntary basis.

The research firm added that because airlines operate on thin margins, the price gap between SAF and conventional fuel has limited uptake, making stronger policy support necessary to encourage wider use.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SAF-Bioenergy.jpg,N,,2026-01-02 14:12:16.917280

Funding under the decade-long program will be used to draw private investment into biofuels and related industries, with the aim of turning Australia into a key player in global biofuel production.
Australia is a major producer of crops such as canola, sugarcane and sorghum, which are widely used in biofuel production worldwide.

Australia has now joined this shift, with the federal government announcing a major funding plan to support domestic production of low-carbon liquid fuels, following long-standing demands from the farming sector, reports Energies Media.

Under a new Clean Fuels Program, the government will invest AU$1.1 billion (around $732 million) in the biofuel sector over the next 10 years. The move marks a change in direction for Australia, which has historically relied on oil and gas exports, as more countries focus on cleaner fuel sources.

The government plans to begin construction of Australia’s first large-scale biofuel refinery in 2026. Funding under the decade-long program will be used to draw private investment into biofuels and related industries, with the aim of turning Australia into a key player in global biofuel production.

Agriculture is expected to be central to the strategy. Australia is a major producer of crops such as canola, sugarcane and sorghum, which are widely used in biofuel production worldwide. At present, most of these crops are exported, while the country imports much of its fuel.

For years, farmers have urged the government to invest in biofuels, arguing that Australia has both the land and resources to build a strong domestic industry. The new investment is being seen as a response to those calls and a step towards creating new markets for agricultural output.

In a government statement, officials said Australia’s advanced farming methods and access to renewable energy give it a strong advantage in producing cleaner fuels needed by aviation, shipping and heavy transport as countries work to cut emissions.

The government also said the biofuel push would complement growth in renewable energy and help build new industries.

Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the funding represents an early commitment to developing a new sector and ensuring Australia benefits economically from the global shift towards lower-emission energy.

As the global airfreight industry steps into 2026, the latest projections from IATA suggest a year defined by growth, sustainability, and recalibration. Airlines are expected to carry 71.6 million tonnes of cargo.

This bullish outlook comes on the back of a record-setting October 2025, when global air cargo demand rose 4.1 percent year-on-year, according to IATA. It marked the eighth consecutive month of growth, driven by strong intra-Asia, Middle East–Europe, and Europe–Asia lanes — even as the Asia–North America corridor remained under pressure due to U.S. tariff impacts.

At the regional level, African airlines posted the highest year-on-year growth at 16.6 percent, followed by Asia-Pacific at 8.3 percent and the Middle East at 5.7 percent. European carriers grew a stable 4.3 percent, while North America and Latin America both declined by 2.7 percent, reflecting ongoing trade route realignments.

“October’s performance shows how air cargo is enabling global supply chains to reconfigure in real time,” said IATA Director General Willie Walsh. “That’s crucial as we enter the Q4 peak season and prepare for a more fragmented demand environment in 2026.”

Indeed, fragmentation is one of the watchwords for the year ahead. Demand remains uneven across geographies, while cost pressures persist. Fuel prices rose 2.5 percent in October despite falling crude, and the global manufacturing PMI hovers just above the growth threshold. Export order sentiment, meanwhile, remains cautious.

Yet airlines are not standing still. IATA’s 2026 goals include $4.5 billion in SAF investment, $1.7 billion in climate financing, and continued improvement in operational metrics — like targeting an 83.8 percent seat occupancy rate and flying 5.2 billion passengers.

OPINION

By David Sempala

In the bustling terminals of Entebbe International Airport, frustration has become as common as departure announcements. Uganda Airlines, the nation's revived flag carrier, has been plagued by a series of setbacks that epitomise the broader struggles of African aviation. Just this month, passengers bound for Dubai and other destinations found themselves stranded for days due to technical faults, with planes grounded in Lagos and London. Reports of poor communication, lack of accommodations, and even police intervention in Dubai to secure meals for affected travellers have sparked public outrage.

The airline, already haemorrhaging losses, nearly 300 billion Ugandan shillings (about $80 million) in 2024 alone, faces accusations of mismanagement, including an unqualified CEO earning a salary ten times that of her counterpart at profitable Ethiopian Airlines. These incidents aren't isolated; they reflect a continent-wide crisis where national carriers buckle under operational constraints, rising costs, and fierce competition from well-capitalised global players.

Africa's aviation sector, despite leading global growth in passenger numbers post-pandemic, remains hamstrung by structural barriers. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects African airlines will eke out a meagre $0.2 billion in profits for 2025, translating to a slim 1.1% net margin, far below the global average. Challenges abound: fragmented markets and policies hinder seamless operations, while high fuel costs, excessive taxes, and blocked funds (where governments restrict repatriation of airline revenues) erode viability. Safety concerns persist, with Africa's accident rate at 1.1 per million flights in 2025, underscoring inadequate infrastructure and regulatory gaps.

Geopolitical tensions, from conflicts rerouting flights to security risks in volatile regions, compound these issues. Meanwhile, intra-African connectivity lags: only 20% of air travel on the continent stays within Africa, forcing passengers to endure costly detours via Europe or the Middle East.

Uganda Airlines' woes mirror those of peers like Kenya Airways, which has grappled with debt and required bailouts despite partnerships with KLM. As the attached post notes, these carriers face operational constraints, fleet underutilization, and the harsh realities of competing against entrenched regional giants. Yet, the post also highlights a path forward: strategic private partnerships and governance reforms. But why stop at national fixes? Africa's aviation needs a bolder vision, a joint Pan-African airline where countries hold shares, pooling resources for collective strength.

Imagine a carrier modelled on the African Union's aspirations, with equity distributed among member states based on population, GDP, or aviation needs. This ""Air Africa"" could leverage economies of scale to negotiate better fuel deals, aircraft leases, and maintenance contracts, slashing costs that currently cripple smaller operators. Shared fleets would optimise utilisation, addressing issues like Uganda's limited wide-body aircraft that led to recent disruptions. By focusing on unserved routes, it could boost intra-continental travel, plugging gaps in the network and fostering trade under the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).

Tourism would flourish with affordable, direct flights between Lagos and Johannesburg, or Nairobi and Dakar, unlocking economic growth estimated at billions in added GDP. The benefits extend beyond economics. A Pan-African airline would embody unity, much like the defunct Air Afrique, which connected West African nations in the 1960s-2000s before succumbing to mismanagement.

Lessons from that era, ensuring transparent governance and avoiding political interference, could guide success. Shareholder countries would enforce accountability through a multinational board, blending public oversight with private expertise. Sustainability gains traction too: collective bargaining for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could overcome current barriers like high costs and regulatory voids, positioning Africa as a green aviation leader.

Critics might argue that fragmentation makes such a venture improbable, citing past alliances' failures. Yet, recent moves—like Kenya Airways' partnerships reshaping alliances—show momentum. With the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) aiming for liberalisation, a joint airline could accelerate implementation, reducing protectionism that shields inefficient carriers.

National pride, as Uganda wants to be, can't sustain an airline alone. But smart, continent-wide partnerships can. By uniting as shareholders, African nations could transform aviation from a perennial loss-maker into an engine of integration and prosperity. For Uganda Airlines and its counterparts, this could be the lifeline: not revival in isolation, but rebirth through solidarity. The skies await Africa's collective ascent.

The order book of EnviTec Biogas AG shows three new contract signings with first-time customers in Germany. All newly secured projects involve gas upgrading plants that will be manufactured at EnviTec’s Saerbeck site over the coming months. With the project in Biburg, Lower Bavaria, EnviTec Biogas is establishing a presence in the Bavarian market for the first time, following the construction of 112 plants across Germany. “The customer already operates a gas upgrading plant using water scrubbing technology, which will be decommissioned once our EnviThan upgrading plant has been installed,” explains EnviTec Biogas Area Sales Manager DACH, Christian Eilert.

“Nearly two years passed between our first contact at the Biogas Convention & Trade Fair in Nuremberg in 2023 and the signing of the contract – two years marked by political uncertainties, constantly changing market conditions and lengthy permitting procedures,” reports customer Benedikt Bachmeier of Bioenergie Biburg. The initial grid feed-in date for the 1,000 Nm³/h biomethane plant has already been set: from July 2026, the plant is expected to begin injecting into the local network. “A key advantage of this project is that we are also supplying the booster compressor required to achieve the necessary grid pressure. This allowed us to significantly accelerate the overall grid injection process,” Eilert adds.

In addition to the time savings and low power consumption of the EnviThan plant, the customer was particularly impressed by EnviTec’s customised design approach. “Given the structural constraints of the existing biogas plant, space on site is limited. However, our flexible container-based construction enables us to accommodate the conditions effectively,” says Eilert. The EnviTec team is also responding flexibly to the site conditions of its second new customer, Hamme Energie GmbH & Co. KG, located in Osterholz-Scharmbeck near Bremen. “Here too, we are constructing a gas upgrading plant as an extension to the existing biogas plant,” Eilert continues.

The EnviThan system is already under construction in Saerbeck, with delivery scheduled for March 2026. The 137 Nm³/h EnviThan plant can be upgraded onsite to 232 Nm³/h of biomethane by simply adding membranes. The biomethane produced will be fed into the network of Osterholzer Stadtwerke. The plant is supplied with dairy cattle slurry, cattle manure and silage maize from the company’s own farming operations.

The third contract was signed in Reichardtswerben in Saxony-Anhalt. The plant, being built for a Dutch operator of a large dairy farming enterprise, can be expanded from 200 Nm³/h biomethane in its initial configuration to 400 Nm³/h. Once completed, it is intended to inject into the Ontras network to supply the fuel market. “For this project as well, we have already ordered all components and can begin production as soon as the container arrives,” says Eilert.

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy.
Summary and Investor Takeaways The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention.
Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.","As the 2026 calendar year begins, the United States agricultural sector finds itself at a critical policy crossroads. On one hand, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has just finalized the enrollment for its $12 billion Farmer Bridge Assistance (FBA) program, a massive infusion of ad-hoc cash designed to keep producers afloat through February 2026. On the other hand, a growing chorus of commodity leaders and farm advocacy groups is signaling that they have reached a breaking point with ""mailbox farming,"" demanding that Washington move away from emergency bailouts in favor of permanent, structural reforms to the nation’s agricultural safety net.

The immediate implications are stark: while the FBA payments will provide a necessary liquidity injection for corn, soybean, and cotton farmers facing compressed margins, the reliance on such measures underscores the failure of Congress to pass a comprehensive, five-year Farm Bill. With the 2018 Farm Bill now extended through September 2026 following a year of intense legislative gridlock, the agricultural industry is entering a high-stakes period where the very definition of federal support is being contested. Farmers are increasingly calling for higher reference prices and trade stability rather than the unpredictable, politically charged relief packages that have characterized the last several years.

The Push for Permanent Policy Over Temporary Relief

The current friction stems from the December 2025 announcement of the FBA program, which allocated $11 billion for row crops and $1 billion for specialty crops and sugar. The program was necessitated by a ""perfect storm"" of high input costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and trade disruptions that saw the farm income safety net fail to trigger adequately under existing 2018 rules. According to USDA data, the payment rates for the 2026 distribution are significant: rice producers are set to receive $132.89 per acre, while cotton and corn farmers will see $117.35 and $44.36 per acre, respectively. While these funds are a lifeline, commodity leaders argue they are a symptom of a broken system.

The timeline leading to this moment is defined by the expiration of the original Farm Bill in late 2024 and a subsequent series of short-term extensions. Throughout 2025, House Agriculture Chairman G.T. Thompson attempted to advance a ""Farm Bill 2.0,"" which sought to increase commodity reference prices by as much as 21% to account for inflation. However, these efforts were derailed by a significant government shutdown in late 2025 and a fractured political coalition between urban nutrition advocates and rural farm interests. The result was the current extension, which leaves farmers operating under outdated price floors while the USDA scrambles to fill the gap with ad-hoc programs like the FBA.

Key stakeholders, including the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) and the National Farmers Union (NFU), have shifted their rhetoric from gratitude to demand. AFBF President Zippy Duvall recently noted that while aid ""bridges the gap,"" the industry cannot thrive on a ""patchwork of emergency checks."" The NFU has gone further, launching a ""Fairness for Farmers"" campaign that targets the structural roots of the problem, including corporate consolidation in the seed and fertilizer sectors and the lack of mandatory country-of-origin labeling, which they argue suppresses the ""bottom line"" more than any subsidy can fix.

Corporate Impact: From Machinery Slumps to Seed Spin-offs

The policy vacuum and the shift toward ad-hoc aid have sent ripples through the public markets, particularly affecting companies tied to farmer capital expenditures. Deere & Company (NYSE: DE) has been a primary casualty of the uncertainty; the machinery giant reported a nearly 15% decline in large agricultural equipment sales in late 2025. With farmers hesitant to invest in new fleets without a long-term Farm Bill in place, Deere has guided for 2026 to be the ""bottom of the cycle,"" though a successful transition to structural support could trigger a massive replacement cycle in 2027. Similarly, CNH Industrial (NYSE: CNHI) has been forced to implement production cuts and manage bloated inventories as the ""wait-and-see"" approach among producers persists.

In the seeds and chemicals space, Corteva (NYSE: CTVA) is navigating a radical transformation in response to these market pressures. The company recently announced a massive corporate split to be completed by late 2026, dividing into a seed-focused entity (""SpinCo"") and a crop protection-focused ""New Corteva."" This move is seen by analysts as a defensive play against increased federal scrutiny of input pricing and a way to insulate its high-margin Pioneer seed brand from the volatility of the broader chemical market. Meanwhile, Bayer (OTC: BAYRY) continues to face pressure as the calls for structural reform often include heightened anti-trust oversight of the ""Big Three"" seed providers.

The processing and grain handling sector is also feeling the heat. Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE: ADM) and Bunge Global (NYSE: BG) have both seen earnings volatility as ""crush margins"" collapsed in late 2025. For ADM, the delay in clarifying biofuel tax credits—specifically the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit—has stalled investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure. If the 2026 policy shift includes the ""biofuel pivot"" that farm groups are lobbying for, ADM and Bunge could see a significant rebound in demand for corn and soybean oil, transforming their outlook from stagnant to high-growth.

Broader Significance and Historical Context

The current demand for structural reform is not just about money; it is a battle over the future of the American ""family farm"" model versus increasing industrialization. Historically, the U.S. has used ad-hoc aid during times of extreme crisis, such as the 1980s farm crisis or the trade wars of 2018-2019. However, the fact that these ""emergency"" payments have become a near-annual occurrence suggests that the 2018 Farm Bill's safety net—designed for a lower-inflation, more stable trade era—is fundamentally obsolete. This trend mirrors the ""permanent emergency"" state seen in other sectors, but in agriculture, it risks decoupling farm income from market signals entirely.

Furthermore, this event fits into a broader global trend of agricultural protectionism and the ""greening"" of farm policy. The push for structural changes in 2026 is heavily intertwined with the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Farm groups are essentially asking for a trade: they will accept more stringent environmental standards if the government provides a permanent, predictable market for biofuels through tax credits and infrastructure support. This would represent a historic shift in U.S. policy, moving from a ""price support"" model to a ""demand creation"" model.

The regulatory implications are also profound. The National Farmers Union’s focus on consolidation suggests that the next Farm Bill may include ""Competition Titles"" for the first time in decades. This could lead to increased oversight by the Department of Justice and the USDA into the pricing power of companies like CF Industries (NYSE: CF) in the fertilizer market or Tyson Foods (NYSE: TSN) in meatpacking. If structural reform includes anti-trust measures, the valuation premiums currently enjoyed by dominant agricultural players could be at risk.

The 2026 Outlook: Strategic Pivots and Scenarios

Looking ahead to the remainder of 2026, the primary focus for the market will be the September 30 expiration of the current Farm Bill extension. In the short term, the distribution of the $12 billion FBA payments in February will likely provide a temporary boost to the share prices of agricultural retailers and equipment dealers as farmers use the cash to settle debts and make essential purchases. However, for a sustained market recovery, investors will need to see a ""Grand Bargain"" in Washington that reconciles the 21% reference price hike with the budget constraints of the 2025 reconciliation act.

A potential strategic pivot for the industry involves the ""45Z"" tax credit. If the administration provides a clear, long-term framework for carbon-intensity scoring by mid-2026, it could unlock billions in private investment. This would benefit companies like Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR), which is heavily invested in renewable diesel. Conversely, if the policy remains mired in ad-hoc cycles, we may see further consolidation as smaller family farms are forced to sell to larger corporate entities that have the balance sheets to weather the uncertainty.

The most likely scenario for the second half of 2026 is a ""Farm Bill 2.0"" that prioritizes crop insurance and biofuel demand over direct commodity payments. This would be a win for the insurance sector and biofuel processors but might leave traditional row-crop farmers in a tighter margin environment if trade relations with major importers like China do not improve.

Summary and Investor Takeaways

The current state of U.S. agricultural policy is a study in the limitations of emergency intervention. While the USDA's $12 billion FBA program provides a necessary buffer, the loud calls for structural reform from groups like the AFBF and NFU indicate that the industry is ready for a fundamental shift. The transition from ""mailbox farming"" to a market-driven, biofuel-integrated safety net is the primary objective for 2026.

For investors, the key takeaways are:

Watch the 45Z Credit: The clarification of biofuel tax credits will be a bigger catalyst for ADM and Bunge than any direct USDA payment.

Equipment Rebound Timing: Monitor the September Farm Bill deadline; a long-term bill could be the ""buy"" signal for Deere and CNH Industrial.

Input Scrutiny: Be cautious of companies with high market concentration in seeds and chemicals, as ""Fairness for Farmers"" initiatives may lead to regulatory headwinds.

As the February 28 payment deadline approaches, the market will be watching to see if this is the last of the ""great bailouts"" or if the U.S. is destined to remain in a cycle of ad-hoc agricultural management. The next nine months will decide whether the American farm economy enters a new era of structural stability or continues to lean on the crutch of emergency aid.

According to a report from Jagran.com, SAF has up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions than conventional jet fuel and can be used in current aircraft engines without modification. HPCL's roadmap indicates that, once international certification is received, the Visakhapatnam refinery will produce around 10,000 tonnes of SAF annually starting in January 2027. This production will play a significant role in helping India meet its SAF blending targets.
