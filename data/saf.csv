SAO PAULO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's Grupo Potencial will invest 2 billion reais ($392.9 million) to build a corn ethanol plant in Lapa, Parana state, as part of a plan to develop the world's largest biofuels complex, Vice President Carlos Eduardo Hammerschmidt said.

The group is already in advanced stages of constructing a soybean crushing facility at the site, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

The plant will supply raw material to Potencial's expanding biodiesel factory, Hammerschmidt said in an interview with Reuters on Monday, while future plans include building a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility.

""Our goal is to build the largest biofuels complex in the world,"" said Hammerschmidt, a co-owner of the family-run company.

The corn ethanol plant will require 1.2 million metric tons of corn each year, equivalent to 6% of Parana's output. The state, Brazil's second-largest corn producer, is forecast to harvest a record 20 million tons in the 2024/25 season.

Construction of the ethanol plant is scheduled to begin in 2026, using the company's own funds, and may be completed by late 2027, Hammerschmidt said.

Corn ethanol production in Brazil's center-south region is expected to grow more than 30% in 2024/25, driven by rising fuel demand and a new rule, effective since the start of August, which mandates that gasoline must include 30% anhydrous ethanol.

Once the biodiesel plant expansion is completed by the end of 2026, Potencial will boost its annual production capacity from 900 million liters to 1.62 billion liters, Hammerschmidt added.

The soybean crusher in Lapa will be able to process 1.2 million tons per year, he said.

The ethanol plant investment is part of a broader strategy that includes building two pipelines — one for ethanol and one for biodiesel — connecting the nearby city of Araucaria to the Lapa complex, with potential to serve other cities.

The company expects to invest 200 million reais in the pipelines, Hammerschmidt said.

""We'll deliver both biodiesel and ethanol directly to fuel distribution hubs,"" Hammerschmidt said, noting the complex's proximity to an oil refinery in Parana owned by state energy giant, Petrobras PETR4.SA.

Their research shows that when a zinc (Zn) single-atom catalyst is part of an electrochemical reaction called the furfural reduction reaction (FRR), it can selectively produce a precursor to aviation fuels. Their findings highlight an efficient method that uses an abundant, renewable biomass to ultimately create environmentally-friendly fuels.

The FRR can create hydrofuroin, which has been a point of interest in recent research due to its versatility and ability to form key components of aviation fuels. However, while it may be easy to use, it's not as easy to produce.

""You need just the right conditions to produce hydrofuroin,"" remarks Professor Hao Li (Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR)), ""An efficient catalyst, as well as the right pH level, ion concentration and operation potential are crucial. Furthermore, there are a lot of possible reactions that cause environmental and safety concerns.""

Since the entire point is converting a readily available biomass to produce fuels in a way that's kind to the environment, harmful byproducts defeat the purpose. Seeing the need for a greener reaction process, researchers at Tohoku University's WPI-AIMR investigated how they could make this a reality.

The FRR was chosen, as it can run on renewable energy (as opposed to fossil fuels) and water (as opposed to hydrogen gas). After careful theoretical thermodynamic calculations and microkinetic modeling analysis, they determined that a single-atom active site on Zn would be ideal - allowing for the selective hydrogenation for furfural without other unwanted reactions.

They tested this in the lab, finding that a catalyst made by depositing zinc phthalocyanine on purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes was highly efficient (HF faradaic efficiency over 95%). This efficiency was maintained under a wide potential window. Some key points for achieving this success were carefully balancing the furfural and electrolyte concentrations.

""Our results reveal an exciting way to help take action against climate change,"" says Li.

The findings were published in EES Catalysis on June 23, 2025.

Boom Supersonic Overture Aircraft Overview

Founded by American tech entrepreneur Blake Scholl in 2014, Boom Supersonic is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, in the U.S. The company is engineering a future where passengers can cross oceans in half the time as conventional airliners.

The Overture, its first and flagship aircraft, is built for transoceanic routes, with planned flights such as New York-London and Tokyo-Seattle.

Designed to fly at speeds of up to Mach 1.7 with a range of 4,250 nautical miles, the Overture has a targeted capacity of 60 to 80 passengers – all paying premium fares for the experience.

Powered by the still-in-development Symphony turbofan engines, the Overture focuses on efficiency, along with environmental responsibility and passenger comfort.

The aerospace company’s stated mission is to deliver not just speed but a viable and scalable model for commercial supersonic aviation.

Boom Supersonic XB-1 Demonstrator

The American aerospace company secured over USD 600 million in funding and a strategic grant from the U.S. Air Force. Boom follows a methodical approach, starting with the XB-1, a one-third-scale demonstrator that first achieved supersonic flight on 28 January 2025.

These test flights, conducted out of Mojave Air & Space Port (MHV), provide vital aerodynamic and performance data for the full-scale Overture aircraft.

The XB-1 test-bed has completed over a dozen experimental flights thus far, validating Boom’s fuselage shaping, laminar airflow, and material and structural strength at high speed.

NASA has backed the daring program with visual documentation using Schlieren photography, confirming the presence of well-defined shock waves.

Using the XB-1, NASA has also supported the research into “boomless cruise” flight. The valuable data gathered during these test flights has enabled Boom to achieve Mach Cutoff – a phenomenon where sonic booms are refracted in the atmosphere without reaching the ground.

Advanced Technology Aids Boom Overture Supersonic Flight

Advanced technology aids Boom Overture supersonic flights, combining a delta-gull wing design, cutting-edge carbon-composite structure, and four newly-developed Symphony medium-bypass turbofan engines.

Developed alongside Florida Turbine Technologies, StandardAero, and GE Additive, the Symphony turbofan engines promise 35,000 pounds of thrust and are optimised for supersonic cruise without afterburners.

These state-of-the-art powerplants represent a marked departure from traditional turbofan engines powering today’s subsonic airliners. Operating on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the Boom Overture’s Symphony engines are designed to be environmentally friendly.

According to the company’s official website, the Boom Overture will cruise at Mach 1.3, with a capability to achieve speeds of Mach 1.7. The Overture’s cruising altitude is 60,000 feet, and its maximum range is a claimed 4,250 nautical miles.

The supersonic aircraft is engineered to meet ICAO Chapter 14 noise standards, with limited sonic impact and compatibility with major airports globally.

Apart from modern flight control systems and avionics, the Overture’s advanced cameras provide visibility during take-off and landing, unlike Concorde’s mechanical but clunky droop-nose.

Boom Supersonic Airliner

The Boom Overture has received confirmed orders from major international carriers. American Airlines (AA) has ordered 20 aircraft, with options for 40 more. United Airlines (UA) has placed 15 orders, with options for 35 more.

This is followed by Japan Airlines (JL), which has shown keen interest in the Overture – placing pre-orders for 20 aircraft. The Japanese carrier could operate the Boom Overture on routes like Tokyo to Seattle or Tokyo to Singapore.

Likely routes for United Airlines include New York to London and New York to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, American Airlines could operate the Boom Overture on its Miami to Barcelona and New York to Paris routes.

Boom Supersonic has further partnered with the American aerospace giant, Northrop Grumman. A possible venture between the two could result in a military version of the Overture.

Providing strategic supply-chain partnership for the ambitious Overture project are Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Safran Landing Systems.

Supersonic Airliner of the Future

The aviation community and the flying public have responded with both excitement and caution. While support for the Boom Supersonic Overture remains strong, questions regarding certification, funding stability, and realistic timelines highlight expected scepticism.

Boom Supersonic has been lauded for showcasing transparency, providing consistent progress updates, and posting credible test achievements.

Could this supersonic aircraft be the new airliner of the future? Possibly, but there are considerable obstacles that Boom must overcome.

Some of the challenges include engine development sans a traditional OEM, plus navigating regulatory restrictions on sonic booms. However, the company’s success has reignited serious interest in commercial supersonic flight across the industry.

Future of Commercial Supersonic Flight

Boom Supersonic aims to commence testing of the Symphony engine in 2026, followed by the Overture flight tests in 2027. Considering smooth proceedings, commercial operations with paying passengers could start by 2030.

Certification efforts with the FAA and EASA will be critical to the fruition of these plans in the coming years.

Meanwhile, competitors like NASA and Lockheed Martin are advancing their own quiet supersonic aircraft, reflecting a renewed global interest in high-speed aviation.

Boom’s goal extends beyond just performance on paper. The goal is to make commercial supersonic flight sustainable, safe, and scalable in the modern aviation landscape.

A Growing Wave of Greenwashing Claims The convergence of regulatory scrutiny, investor activism and consumer awareness means that greenwashing claims are likely to increase – not just in banking, but across all sectors.","Greenwashing is not a single act but a spectrum of misleading behaviours. The most common types include:

Greencrowding – hiding behind group initiatives or alliances to avoid individual accountability;

Greenlighting – spotlighting a small green feature to distract from broader unsustainable practices;

Greenshifting – blaming consumers for environmental issues rather than addressing corporate responsibility;

Greenlabelling – using eco-friendly language or imagery without substantiation;

Greenrinsing – frequently changing sustainability targets before they are achieved; and

Greenhushing – deliberately underreporting sustainability efforts to avoid scrutiny or accountability.

These tactics can mislead stakeholders and regulators alike and are increasingly being called out by watchdogs and civil society.

CSRD and the Temptation to Overstate Sustainability

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) may be the long-awaited turning point. It will either improve transparency and provide the previously missing set of harmonised standards for companies to adhere to when measuring their ESG performance against set benchmarks, or it will influence, perhaps unwittingly, further greenwashing. The CSRD mandates detailed ESG disclosures using standardised European Sustainability Reporting Standards.

Companies must report on:

environmental impacts and climate risks;

due diligence processes;

taxonomy alignment; and

substantiation of sustainability claims.

The granularity of CSRD reporting, covering everything from emissions data to supply chain practices, raises the bar for transparency. However, it also creates a temptation for companies to inflate their sustainability performance to meet stakeholder expectations or avoid reputational damage. The CSRD is complemented by other frameworks such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”), the EU Taxonomy (“EUT”) and the Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition Directive (“ECD”) all of which aim to combat greenwashing by enforcing verifiable, science-based disclosures. The ECD will apply from September 2026 and introduces significant changes to environmental advertising including a prohibition on vague environmental claims which cannot be substantiated, a prohibition on using or creating unreliable sustainability labels and a prohibition on false claims about the sustainability of an asset. ECD bans the use of generic environmental advertising claims such as “natural”, “environmentally friendly” or “biodegradable” without adequate substantiation. It also restricts the use of sustainability labels to those based on official certification schemes or established by public authorities, bans distinct types of environmental claims reliant on carbon offsets and introduces harmonised labels and requirements around durability and repairability of products. Increased enforcement against greenwashing claims across EU member states will continue to evolve even without the Green Claims Directive pursuant to ECD and pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (“UCPD”) which is undergoing implementation across the EU.

The ECD will amend the UCPD. This contains Annex I which will be expanded to include a new set of blacklisted practices specifically targeting greenwashing. These include the use of vague environmental claims such as “eco-friendly” or “climate neutral” without robust substantiation, the use of sustainability labels not based on official certification schemes or public authorities, and the omission of information about product durability or reparability. Also prohibited are claims about future environmental performance that lack clear, verifiable commitments and independent monitoring. These additions aim to harmonise enforcement across the EU and provide greater legal certainty for both consumers and businesses.

In the UK, the CMA’s GCC provides a non-binding but influential framework for businesses to ensure their environmental messaging is accurate and not misleading. Whilst the GCC itself is not legally binding, the CMA has made clear that it will use it as a benchmark for enforcement under consumer protection law. Businesses should therefore treat the GCC as de facto regulation and ensure their marketing practices are fully aligned.

Implications for Banks: Reputational Risk and Regulatory Pressure

Greenwashing is increasing in the banking sector, where financial institutions face mounting scrutiny over the credibility of their sustainability claims. Whilst there is no specific legislation that directly penalises banks for greenwashing, they are not immune to its consequences. Financial institutions face intense scrutiny from investors, regulators, and society to align their portfolios with climate goals. The Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental advocacy group, is known for its influential Banking on Climate Chaos reports. These reports expose how major banks continue financing fossil fuels and deforestation despite public commitments to sustainability.

Key pressures include:

reputational risk: as seen in the HSBC and Lloyds cases, misleading sustainability claims can lead to public backlash and regulatory censure;

investor expectations: initiatives like the and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance push banks to decarbonise their lending and investment portfolios; and

regulatory alignment: banks must comply with ESG disclosure rules under the EUT, CSRD, SFDR and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, even if these do not explicitly target greenwashing.

To mitigate the risks associated with greenwashing, banks are increasingly encouraged to adopt comprehensive and proactive strategies. This includes establishing robust greenwashing risk frameworks that integrate ESG considerations into their core operations. Utilising verified ESG data is essential to ensure the accuracy and credibility of sustainability claims, whilst thorough due diligence on clients helps identify and manage potential reputational and compliance risks. Additionally, banks should regularly audit their marketing materials to ensure consistency between their public messaging and actual practices. Equally important is the training of staff on ESG principles, equipping them with the knowledge and awareness needed to uphold ethical standards and avoid misleading representations. Together, these measures form a strong foundation for responsible and transparent banking practices in an increasingly scrutinised regulatory environment.

In the UK, legal exposure is also increasing. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, particularly sections 90 and 90A (now consolidated under Schedule 10A), provides a potential basis for future litigation against companies that make misleading sustainability disclosures. If investors suffer losses due to false or exaggerated ESG claims, these provisions could be invoked to hold issuers accountable, further raising the stakes for financial institutions.

The Role of Green Loans: Catalyst or Complication?

Green loans, financing tied to environmental performance, are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they incentivise borrowers to meet sustainability targets. On the other, they can be misused as a form of greenwashing if the criteria are vague or poorly enforced. For example, a company might secure a green loan for a renewable energy project while continuing to invest heavily in fossil fuels elsewhere. Without rigorous monitoring and third-party verification, such loans risk becoming a tool for reputational laundering rather than genuine environmental progress. To prevent this, lenders must (i) set clear, science-based eligibility criteria; (ii) require regular reporting and third-party audits; and (iii) align loan terms with credible taxonomies (e.g. EUT).

Sustainability-Linked Loans: A Growing Credibility Gap

Sustainability-linked loans (“SLL”) have come under increasing scrutiny in 2025, with critics highlighting their lack of enforceable environmental standards, transparency and measurable targets. These financial instruments, which are intended to incentivise corporate sustainability through favourable lending terms, have instead been accused of enabling greenwashing. In April 2025, the Royal Bank of Canada publicly abandoned its sustainable finance goals, citing the absence of clear definitions and accountability mechanisms within the SLL framework. This move underscored growing concerns about the credibility of such loans in driving genuine environmental progress. Further controversy emerged when companies like Shell and Drax were revealed to have secured SLLs whilst continuing high-pollution activities, with loan terms linked to vague or non-binding sustainability metrics. These cases have intensified calls for regulatory reform and greater scrutiny of sustainability claims in financial markets.

A Growing Wave of Greenwashing Claims

The convergence of regulatory scrutiny, investor activism and consumer awareness means that greenwashing claims are likely to increase – not just in banking, but across all sectors. As frameworks like the EUT, CSRD, GCD, and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive reach full implementation and wider span, companies will face higher standards for substantiating their environmental claims. For financial institutions, the challenge is twofold: (i) ensuring their own disclosures are accurate; and (ii) scrutinising the ESG credentials of their clients and investments. Whilst the legal landscape may not yet impose direct penalties for greenwashing in finance, the reputational and financial risks are real and growing. Ultimately, the path forward lies in transparency, accountability, and a commitment to genuine sustainability; not just the appearance of it.",https://www.wfw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Environment-Sustainability-shutterstock_1826398901.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 08:57:37.012221

This commonsense order ensures our nation is stronger, our land use is optimised and the American people are properly informed.”","The US Government has announced an order to “rein in environmentally damaging” solar and wind projects to “more efficiently manage” the country’s energy resources.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has signed a new Secretarial Order, which suggests “massive, unreliable, energy projects”, such as wind and solar, are “inefficient uses of federal lands” when compared to other energy sources “with much smaller footprints like nuclear, gas and coal”.

The Interior Department will now consider a proposed energy project’s capacity density when assessing its potential energy benefits to the US and impacts to the environment and wildlife.

The Order directs the Department to only permit energy projects “that are most appropriate use” of federal land and resources.

It may no longer issue permits for wind or solar projects on federal lands unless they generate as much energy per acre as a coal, gas or nuclear power plant

Citing data from the US Energy Information Administration, the Department suggests one advanced nuclear plant produces 33.17MW per acre while one offshore wind farm produces around 0.006MW per acre – which is approximately 5,500 times less efficient than one nuclear plant.

Therefore, the Department states wind and solar projects may “unnecessarily and unduly degrade” federal lands when there are “reasonable alternatives” that can generate the same amount of or more energy on far less land.

Mr Burgum said: “Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving US energy dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment.

Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: “This £63 million is lift off for Britain’s green aviation revolution. We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

OXCCU Tech – which is developing a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport – and LanzaJet – which is building a commercial-scale plant in Teesside – are two of the companies that have been granted a share of the funding.

Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-Founder of OXCCU added: “Support from the Advanced Fuels Fund is a key step in scaling our technology. This funding enables the detailed design and construction of OX2, our demonstration plant launching in 2026 and builds on the successful delivery of OX1.

“It brings us closer to producing lower-cost, lower-carbon aviation fuel and supports the UK’s ambition to become a global leader in SAF production.”",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/plane.jpeg,N,,2025-08-05 08:57:44.178968

ASTM D7566, developed by ASTM International, is the globally recognised specification that governs blending SAF with conventional jet fuel.
Once blended, the final product is recertified as Jet A or Jet A-1 under ASTM D1655 for commercial aviation use.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand previously announced plans to mandate the use of SAF, starting with a 1% blending requirement in 2026.
SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a critical pathway for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation.","Thailand is on track to complete its national specification for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by early 2026, as rising international demand accelerates the shift toward greener air travel. The Department of Energy Business (DOEB), under the Ministry of Energy, is leading the drafting process, which aims to align with global benchmarks such as ASTM D7566, according to the Bangkok Post.

The standard, once finalised, will enable the certification and commercial rollout of SAF for both domestic and international use. ASTM D7566, developed by ASTM International, is the globally recognised specification that governs blending SAF with conventional jet fuel. It is already in use in major markets such as the United States and Europe.

ASTM D7566 – Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons defines the requirements for synthetic blending components produced from non-petroleum sources that can be mixed with conventional jet fuel to create drop-in fuels compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. Once blended, the final product is recertified as Jet A or Jet A-1 under ASTM D1655 for commercial aviation use.

The specification currently includes eight approved synthetic pathways: Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK), FT-SPK with Aromatics (FT-SPK/A), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK), Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP), Alcohol-to-Jet SPK (ATJ-SPK), Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ), Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars to Synthetic Kerosene (HFS-SK), and Aromatics derived via Catalytic Synthesis (AAD). Each pathway has strict criteria for composition and performance to ensure safety and compatibility in aviation applications.

According to Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the DOEB, the department is currently studying the inclusion of palm oil and used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstocks for SAF production in Thailand. UCO, already used extensively in SAF production globally, is under consideration due to its similar properties to that of internationally accepted feedstocks.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand previously announced plans to mandate the use of SAF, starting with a 1% blending requirement in 2026. This percentage is expected to gradually increase to 3–5% in the following years. However, the rollout will initially focus on international flights due to certification variances across airlines and aircraft types.

Thailand’s flagship energy firms are actively supporting the transition. Bangchak Corporation is already producing SAF at its Bangkok refinery, while PTT Oil and Retail Business (OR) and Bangchak subsidiary BBGI are developing production capacities targeting 1 million litres of SAF annually. PTT is also pursuing a demonstration project at its Rayong site, in collaboration with PTT Global Chemical and Airbus.

Bangkok Airways began using SAF for its international flights from Suvarnabhumi Airport on July 1, as part of a pilot project in partnership with PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc (OR). The airline and OR signed a letter of intent to procure and utilize SAF, marking the first initiative of its kind in Thailand.

OR supplies SAF derived from used cooking oil, produced by PTT Global Chemical (GC), the petrochemical arm of PTT Plc. GC has an estimated production capacity of 6 million liters per year in its initial phase.

SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a critical pathway for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation. The anticipated national standard is expected to create new opportunities for SAF producers, while encouraging foreign airlines to adopt Thai-made SAF for refuelling in Bangkok and beyond.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thailand-to-finalise-sustainable-aviation-fuel-standard-by-2026.webp,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:15.454500

By tapping into its abundant natural resources, the region is making impressive strides towards a cleaner, more sustainable aviation future.

Why Southeast Asia Is Leading the Charge

Southeast Asia stands out due to its rich natural resources that provide an ideal base for producing SAF. Countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are home to a variety of materials, including rice straw, cassava pulp, and used cooking oil (UCO), all of which can be transformed into SAF. Palm oil waste and municipal solid waste also present viable feedstocks for SAF production, contributing to the region’s competitive advantage in this growing field.

In fact, a study from ASEAN, Boeing, CTIF, and GHD, funded by Global Affairs Canada, suggests that Southeast Asia could account for up to 12% of the world’s SAF production by 2050. Notably, by 2040, the region’s largest players, including Indonesia and the Philippines, are expected to become net exporters of SAF.

Cutting-Edge SAF Production Technologies

Advancements are being made on all fronts in relation to Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF production. The most common method used to produce this fuel is Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA). Both Fischer Tropsch (FT) and Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) processes are gaining popularity in the region. These more modern technologies are more aligned with local feedstocks, leading to a SAF production ecosystem that is more diverse and efficient.

Indonesia’s Pertamina and Singapore’s Neste have already set up SAF production facilities, marking the beginning of a regional transformation towards a cleaner aviation future.

Challenges and Opportunities

Although the area’s expanding SAF industry is very promising, it still faces a number of issues. Take palm oil, for instance. It has received a lot of attention as a feedstock because of its possible connections to deforestation. Still, SAF producers are looking into used cooking oil (UCO) and agricultural waste to reduce their carbon footprint.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits for the region’s economy are enormous. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers more than just environmental benefits; it is set to create thousands of jobs and boost skills development across the region. Local farmers could also benefit, particularly in countries like Vietnam, where rice straw can be utilized to produce SAF, offering a low-carbon intensity feedstock without expanding land use.

Government and Industry Commitments

Governments across Southeast Asia are taking concrete steps to support the SAF sector. Singapore is leading the way with a mandate requiring all departing flights to use a 1% SAF blend starting in 2026, with a target to increase this to 3-5% by 2030.

Indonesia has also outlined an ambitious roadmap that targets 30% SAF usage by 2050, signaling a long-term commitment to aviation decarbonization. Thailand and Malaysia have introduced similar plans to reduce their aviation sector’s carbon footprint. As a result, major airlines in the region are following suit.

Singapore Airlines and Scoot are targeting 5% SAF usage by 2030, while Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Cebu Pacific, and Vietnam Airlines have already completed their inaugural SAF flights, signaling an industry-wide shift towards sustainable aviation.

Economic and Social Impacts of SAF

The advantages of SAF go well beyond environmental benefits. Economically, the expanding SAF industry has the potential to unlock enormous economic value, including the creation of new jobs, as well as the development of skills training programs in the renewable energy and aviation fields. Moreover, SAF is advancing important social goals such as equality of gender and the inclusion of people in the clean energy supply chain from socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

For example, rice straw—one of the most sustainable feedstocks—provides an opportunity for local farmers to participate in the clean energy transition without altering land use or contributing to deforestation. This creates a pathway for inclusive growth, directly benefiting rural communities and fostering regional economic development.

Moving Forward: A Collaborative Approach

Southeast Asia’s shift towards SAF production represents a critical phase in the region’s transition to a greener aviation ecosystem. The “Promoting the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels from Agricultural Waste in the ASEAN Region” project is a crucial step in strengthening regional cooperation, developing technical expertise, and mobilizing investments.

With production potentially exceeding domestic demand, Southeast Asia is well positioned to export SAF to other aviation markets, including Japan and South Korea, helping to meet global SAF demand.

The Road Ahead: A Green Aviation Future

With the world looking to SAF as a priority, Southeast Asia is primed to emerge as a major contender in this field. To fully realize these goals, sustained partnership amongst governments, the private sector, and investors will be needed.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Production-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 00:56:14.028454

The plant is targeted for startup in 2026 with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy (OGJ Online, Sept. 10, 2024).
If approved, Eni said the Enilive-operated Sannazzaro biorefinery would begin producing 550,000 tpy of renewable fuels by December 2027, with Eni subsidiary Versalis SPA’s planned Priolo biorefinery to follow by yearend 2028 at a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy (OGJ Online, June 24, 2025).","LG-Eni BioRefining Co. Ltd.—a joint venture of Eni SPA subsidiary Enilive SPA (49%) and LG Chem Ltd. (51%)—has started construction of the partners’ proposed grassroots biorefinery at LG Chem’s Daesan integrated petrochemical complex in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do Province, South Korea, 80 km southwest of Seoul (OGJ Online, Jan 19, 2024).

Official groundbreaking activities for the new hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production plant—the first of its kind in South Korea—began on Aug. 4, Eni and LG Chem said in separate releases.

Following its completion in 2027, the biorefinery will use Eni-Honeywell UOP LLC codeveloped proprietary Ecofining technology to flexibly process about 400,000 tonnes/year (tpy) of renewable materials to produce SAF, HVO, and bionaphtha, the companies said.

The partners confirmed the new plant will specifically use a feedstock of sustainable vegetable oils such as used cooking oils, among other unidentified bio-based waste and residues.

Start of construction on the Daesan renewables plant follows the partners’ September-2023 launch of technical and economic feasibility assessments for the project, which came as part of both companies’ shared objective to meet growing demand for sustainable, low-carbon fuels and plastics as they advance their common goal of competitively achieving sustainable development of decarbonized products and carbon neutrality in line with the global energy transition to net-zero emissions (OGJ Online, Sept. 14, 2023).

“Together with [Eni renewable fuels] plants that are already operational in Italy and [the US], and with [our] new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reaching our 2030 target to increase our [system-wide] biorefining capacity to over 5 million [tpy], with the potential to produce more than 2 million [tpy] of SAF,” said Stefano Ballista, Enilive’s chief executive officer.

While Eni and LG Chem revealed no further details regarding engineering, procurement, and construction activities on the new biorefinery, Eni confirmed in its 2024 annual report that the JV awarded a contract for the project’s construction to an unidentified contractor sometime between December 2024 and February 2025.

Eni’s renewables ambition

In addition to conversions of its former Venice and Gela conventional crude oil refineries in 2014 and 2019, respectively, Eni is also progressing on Italy’s northwestern coast with the planned conversion of the idled 84,000-b/d conventional refinery in Livorno, Tuscany, into what will become Italy’s third biorefinery. The plant is targeted for startup in 2026 with a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy (OGJ Online, Sept. 10, 2024).

The operator has also said it could reach final investment decision this year on a project to convert its existing 180,000-b/d Sannazzaro de' Burgondi conventional refinery in Italy’s Pavia province and the Priolo Gargallo steam-cracking plant in eastern Sicily.

If approved, Eni said the Enilive-operated Sannazzaro biorefinery would begin producing 550,000 tpy of renewable fuels by December 2027, with Eni subsidiary Versalis SPA’s planned Priolo biorefinery to follow by yearend 2028 at a nameplate production capacity of 500,000 tpy (OGJ Online, June 24, 2025).","https://img.ogj.com/files/base/ebm/ogj/image/2025/08/68912a15d729d1c2ecf2efbf-lg_chem_ltd.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-04 18:56:13.090714

This partnership with Cemvita reinforces our commitment to sustainability, the attraction of high-impact investments, and the creation of opportunities for the people of Rio Grande do Sul in strategic sectors such as renewable energy, agriculture, and industry.” His remarks underscore the state's proactive approach to fostering a sustainable and innovation-driven economy.

The upcoming facility will be groundbreaking as the first industrial-scale plant globally to utilize Cemvita’s unique bioconversion technology. This technology will transform crude glycerol, a readily available byproduct, into low-carbon oil, which will then serve as a vital feedstock for SAF production. Simultaneously, the plant will produce the biofertilizer, FermNPK™, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices. This dual production model highlights a holistic approach to waste valorization and resource efficiency.

This strategic move by Cemvita is further strengthened by an existing partnership with Be8, a prominent biofuel pioneer also based in Rio Grande do Sul. This collaboration aims to fortify the entire SAF value chain, aligning with Be8’s long-term vision of becoming a leading provider of sustainable biofuel solutions. Such synergies are crucial for building a robust and resilient green energy ecosystem.

Gallego cited volatility following the announcement of tariffs for North American points of sale. For that region, BA's corporate revenue in the second quarter was down 3 percent compared with a year prior, with a ""huge impact in April,"" but mainly because Easter this year was in the second quarter, he said.

IAG Q2 Metrics

IAG reported second-quarter passenger revenue of nearly €7.8 billion, an increase of 4.9 percent year over year. Total revenue for the group was about €8.9 billion, up 6.8 percent from a year prior. Net income before taxes was €1.5 billion, up from more than €1.1 billion reported in Q2 2024. Second-quarter capacity increased 2.2 percent year over year, while load factor fell 1.3 percentage points to 85.4 percent.

British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia each posted year-over-year profit increases. Vueling's profit, however, fell €2 million to €95 million. BA recorded a £269 million uptick in profit to £824 million, driven by a 2.1 percent increase in capacity. This is despite the March 21 shutdown of its London Heathrow hub, which had an estimated adverse effect of £40 million.

The group said it will continue to invest in its core markets, namely the North Atlantic and Latin American markets, despite some ""weakness"" in U.S. point-of-sale economy leisure demand in the second quarter.

IAG secured more than 200,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel in the year’s first half, marking a 25 percent year-over-year increase, according to its earnings presentation. It also inked a deal with Microsoft to reduce the latter's Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

The group’s full-year outlook includes projected capacity growth of 2.5 percent year over year, down from the 3 percent growth previously estimated, due to geopolitical uncertainties.

“Through demonstration tests conducted with six companies, we have recognized once again that environmental value trading is a mechanism that contributes to the decarbonization of aviation,” said Mitsuko Tottori, President & Group CEO of Japan Airlines. “The JAL Group will continue to collaborate with each company to promote understanding and support wider adoption.”

“The confirmation of the scheme’s effectiveness through this demonstration test marks a significant step forward,” said Keita Ishii, President & COO of ITOCHU. “We will continue collaborating with leading partners to help build a circular economy.”

ENEOS, which conducted a full-cycle demonstration from SAF procurement to sale, affirmed the approach’s potential. “We will continue to promote the use of SAF and Scope 3 environmental attributes to contribute to GHG reduction in the aviation industry,” said President Atsuji Yamaguchi.

ClassNK validated the credibility of the scheme and emphasized its market potential: “Trading the environmental value of Scope 3 emissions is an extremely effective means of promoting greater use of SAF,” said President & CEO Hayato Suga.

Phase 2 will expand the number of participants, enhance awareness of Scope 3 environmental value, and explore strategies for the platform’s full-scale social implementation.

Fastmarkets assessed the export price for tallow, max 15% ffa, fob Santos unchanged week on week at $1,040-1,080 per tonne on Thursday.
“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.
That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.
Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.","An US executive order issued late on Wednesday exempted a list of Brazilian products and confirmed the 50% tariff on tallow, effective for products shipped from August 5. The news prompted speculation among market participants, but there was no immediate price reaction.

Fastmarkets assessed the export price for tallow, max 15% ffa, fob Santos unchanged week on week at $1,040-1,080 per tonne on Thursday.

No export deals were heard for September deliveries, but trading talks were held and lower bids from exporters for origination were reported before the executive order was signed.

Market participants noted that tanks at Santos and Rio Grande ports continued to receive tallow in the week, partly to accomplish contracts scheduled for August.

Fastmarkets heard a week earlier that three Brazilian companies sold 36,000 tonnes to US sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers using the US’s duty drawback system, which allows them to get back most of the tariff paid, as long as the finished product is exported.

“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.

It was uncertain whether new deals would be reached with the US under the 50% tariff or whether unsold volumes could be delivered to other destinations. Some exporters were still trying to find ways to offer the feedstock to Europe, sources said.

Some speculated on potential shipments to Argentina’s hygiene and oleochemical market, considering the country could export more tallow to the US if trading flows from Brazil decrease permanently.

The tallow market is one of the most affected by the tariff against Brazil, as nearly 97% of the exported volume has been sent to the US in 2025, customs data showed.

Domestic prices

Fastmarkets assessed the price for bleachable fancy tallow, max 3.5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) unchanged week on week at 6.20-6.50 Reais ($1.11-1.16) per kg.

Meanwhile, the main reference for Brazil’s biodiesel sector, bleachable fancy tallow, max 5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) was assessed at 6.10-6.30 Reais per kg, up from 6.00-6.20 Reais per kg a week earlier.

Sources told Fastmarkets that despite a recent decline in cattle slaughter in July following the US tariff announcement, production levels remained historically high.

That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.

“It seems more like a strategy by tallow producers to hold back supply in order to avoid sharp price declines,” the source told Fastmarkets.

Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.

The market expects increased demand for domestic feedstocks such as tallow and soyoil after the increase in the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15% (B15), which takes effect on August 1.

A source said the B15 blending mandate should not be expected to be felt in prices before October, as biodiesel producers currently have inventories.

“Since it takes about 40 days for the demand increase to take effect, that impact would likely not be seen in August and September,” they said.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_AnimalFats_BeefTallowBlock_AdobeStock_869070057-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 14:56:31.231833

VINCI wins major contract for innovative biofuel plant in Spain

Electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works for a major second-generation biofuel plant

A strategic project for the energy transition in Spain

Moeve and Apical have awarded Grupo Cobra and Masa - both subsidiaries of Cobra IS – the electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works of the largest second-generation (2G) biofuel plant in Spain.

Located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva province), this plant, with an estimated total cost of €1.2 billion, will benefit from the synergies being located beside Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park.

The new plant will have an annual production capacity of 500,000 tonnes of sustainable fuels, including SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and HVO100 (renewable diesel). It will use agricultural waste and used cooking oils as raw materials.

Its design incorporates cutting-edge technologies to minimise environmental impact. In particular, it will rely exclusively on recylced water and will reduce CO₂ emissions by 75% compared to traditional plants, thereby avoiding the emission of nearly 3 million tonnes of CO₂ per year.

This ambitious and innovative project will consolidate Spain’s position as a leading player in clean energy. It reinforces Cobra IS’s commitment to the decarbonisation of transport in Europe.

In 2024, the VINCI Group generated a total revenue of €3.8 billion in Spain including €3.2 billion for Cobra IS, €0.3 billion for VINCI Energies and €0.3 billion for VINCI Construction.

A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney models four future scenarios for the industry.

These explore how geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, sustainability efforts and digitalization will shape the travel and tourism sector.

In the late 1950s, Frank Sinatra invited his beloved to “Come fly with me”. It evoked the faraway places burgeoning global air travel could take you to – something we all came to take for granted over the next seven decades. Until 2020, at least.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, travel and tourism became one of the hardest-hit sectors, but it is now back on track, with 7% growth in spending expected over the next decade. In the first quarter of 2025, international tourist arrivals grew by 5% compared to the previous year, led by travel to Asia Pacific and Africa.

Despite the rebound, the travel and tourism (T&T) industry now exists in a very different, more volatile world, shaped by a mix of geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, the move to more sustainable tourism and digitalization. A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney has modelled the interplay of these factors in four future scenarios.

Scenario 1: A thousand islands world

This scenario portrays a world characterized by geopolitical fragmentation and escalating global tensions that split it into “a thousand islands”.

Here, tourism spending will be curtailed by declining global trade, protectionist travel restrictions, stalling economic growth and reduced disposable incomes. Low-income destinations will feel the impact of these trends most acutely.

A drop in global air travel will help reduce aviation emissions. However, a shift to more regionalized travel between countries with harmonized and simplified entry requirements will drive up emissions from regional travel, including road and rail.

With less international travel, employment in areas such as aviation and cross-border services is predicted to drop off, making way for greater automation, while new jobs could emerge in regional travel.

Scenario 2: Harmonious horizons

The diametrical opposite of the “thousand islands” concept. This scenario is characterized by strong multilateral cooperation, trade liberalization and sustained GDP growth.

Visa liberalization and higher disposable incomes are expected to contribute to a nearly one-third (29%) surge in international tourist arrivals by 2030. Highlighting the potential for equitable growth, close to two-thirds of these (58%) will be from Global South economies, with significant contributions from India, Indonesia and Nigeria.

Tourism recruitment is expected to rise by nearly a third (29% compared to 2022), although labour shortages are likely to persist.

However, the surge in tourism will see aviation emissions rising, as adoption rates of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remain too low to cover increased fuel demand.

Alongside, the risk of overtourism will increase, and measures like dynamic pricing will be needed to prevent environmental degradation.

Scenario 3: Green ascent

Here, the Forum maps out a world driven by decarbonization, stringent environmental regulation and environmentally-aware travellers looking for low-impact destinations and travel modes.

Substantial investments in low-carbon technologies and increased use of SAF will contribute to the success of this model, as will “high-value, low volume” experiences that reduce overtourism in popular holiday spots.

At the same time, regenerative tourism at eco-certified destinations becomes the preferred choice of more than two-thirds of tourists (68%). This preference also drives a shift to low-emission transport such as high-speed rail.

The scenario forecasts significant economic benefits such as green tourism jobs. However, it also warns of new trade-offs between sustainability and growth, for example the loss of tropical rainforest to the production of SAF.

Scenario 4: Tech turbulence

The final scenario juxtaposes hyper-accelerated technology adoption and fragmented economic recovery with uneven growth.

While the adoption of generative AI in T&T is expected to reach 78% by 2030, with advanced mobile networks covering most urban areas, a substantial digital divide will remain between regions.

Hybrid working using augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and virtual tourism are expected to grow. While driving down travel emissions, this trend will increase energy consumption from the underlying technology platforms.

Alongside, tourism will become polarized between high-end luxury travellers and mid-market tourists for whom dynamic pricing will increasingly threaten affordability.

Rapid technology adoption will also transform or automate 45% of T&T jobs, mainly routine tasks. However, automation will also create more than two million unfilled vacancies by 2030, making re-skilling in AI and AR/VR a priority across the sector.

Developing tailored strategies for travel and tourism

Each of the four scenarios will require tailored strategies to mitigate the associated risks, from overtourism and labour shortages to environmental degradation.

To navigate these four scenarios and shape a future that works for all, T&T leaders need to prioritize improved governance, workforce upskilling and innovative financing to meet investment needs. Public-private partnerships are crucial for funding, regenerative practices and digital transformation, making T&T resilient and a catalyst for equitable prosperity.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/2qQLBtA4hu1XXivJktP46OwLhuaSwtOyMJQF8U6xdys.png,N,,2025-08-04 11:56:25.813849

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially.
Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.","The Minnesota Star Tribune reported last fall that the first sustainable aviation fuel, made from a Minnesota-grown crop called winter camelina, powered a Delta Air Lines flight from the Twin Cities to New York City. It marked the beginning of a plan by Minnesota SAF Hub—a coalition including Bank of America, Delta, Ecolab, and Xcel Energy—to eventually convert all Delta flights from MSP to bio-based jet fuels to reduce greenhouse gases.

You may think the sole star of the show here is sustainable aviation fuel. But, as a long-ago radio personality used to say, now for the rest of the story.

By tapping into the market for plant-based aviation fuel, University of Minnesota researchers at the Forever Green Initiative are commercializing two oil-producing plants—winter camelina and domesticated pennycress—that can give farmers a payday for planting winter cover crops that hold soil, take up excess nutrients, and help protect the quality of Minnesota’s streams and groundwater.

Mitch Hunter, associate director of the University’s Forever Green Initiative, says “What we’re trying to do is develop crops that make farmers money, and in the process, provide all those environmental benefits that we’ve been trying to get to for so long with very little success.”

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently awarded the University $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand project. It was selected as one of six projects working to “advance the production of low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops critical to accelerating a clean energy bioeconomy.

From cover crops to jet fuel

This story really begins with “the big brown spot”—the vast agriculture region of the upper Midwest that stands barren from October through April, with nothing growing to protect the soil. “You can see the brown of this uncovered landscape from space,” says Hunter.

That bare earth is prone to wind and water erosion. Runoff of nutrients, especially nitrogen, into streams and groundwater fertilizes lakes, pollutes sources of drinking water, and contributes to the “dead zone” at the end of the Mississippi River. Says Hunter, “When soil has nothing living on it, rain falls, filters through the soil, and draws those nutrients directly into our waterways. You have to have a plant living there to take up the nitrogen and the phosphorus.”

The solution—plant something, anything, to hold soil and take up excess nutrients until the next cash crop is planted. A recent report by Forever Green partners, including consultants Ecotone Analytics and Friends of the Mississippi River, estimated that widespread use of cover crops could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23 percent and soil erosion by 35 percent by 2050.

But folks have promoted cover crops for a long time. “They get a lot of buzz, and they’re adopted in Minnesota on 2 or 3 percent of the total cropland, despite years and years and years of education and investment and incentives,” says Hunter. “So that model isn’t working.”

The problem? Cover crops take both time and money.

The many contributions of the Forever Green Initiative

So about 30 years ago, the late Don Wyse, Forever Green cofounder and codirector, began working with farmers to grow a perennial rye grass that not only anchors soil, but can be sold for commercial grass seed. Says Hunter, “All of a sudden, you transformed the cropping systems in that region to have perennial cover for a large part of the rotation, and it was all because they developed a crop that actually made farmers money.”

Wyse and his colleagues went prospecting for other potentially profitable cover crops. Of 15 or so, two are pertinent to our story today. The first is winter camelina, an old crop from Europe related to cabbage, kale, broccoli, and canola. Like canola, it produces tiny seeds with an oil content as high as 35 percent. The other is pennycress, a new crop bred from a ubiquitous weed. Like camelina, it is rich in oil, exceptionally winter hardy, and even quicker to grow and mature.

Forever Green’s plan is to target the more than 2 million acres in Minnesota used to raise spring wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, and small grains—crops that are harvested in early fall. Then farmers can plant winter camelina or pennycress, let it grow through late fall, winter, and early spring, and harvest the oil seed crop in late spring before planting the next cash grain crop.

But how to market camelina or pennycress oil seeds to get a good price? Selling them for food-grade oil means competing with a lot of well-established oils like canola and sunflower. Sustainable diesel fuel is a possibility, but ground transportation seems to be moving toward electrification.

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially. Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global emission of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Like other fields of transportation, aviation seeks to reduce its fossil fuel use.

Trains, trucks, and automobiles have been able to replace internal combustion engines with electric motors and massive banks of batteries. Unfortunately, in the air, every ounce counts—so aviation has looked to fuels from renewable biological sources such as used cooking fat and dedicated energy crops.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.

Hunter adds that state incentives and private support will continue to further the development of sustainable fuels and environmentally beneficial farming practices.",https://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/jet-fuel-crops.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:15.388548

The commercial aviation industry is experiencing notable growth due to various factors such as the expansion of global trade, economic advancement, and enhanced connectivity. This growth directly leads to an increased need for fuel systems in commercial aircraft.

Furthermore, airlines are enlarging their fleets globally in response to the growing demand for air travel. For instance, in May 2023, Ryanair, a budget carrier based in Ireland, announced its intention to purchase an additional 300 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft. This strategic decision is part of the objective of Ryanair to reach an annual passenger count of 300 million. The agreement with Boeing initially involves an order for 150 aircraft, with the option to acquire an additional 150 aircraft in the future. By operating approximately 3,000 flights daily throughout Europe, this expansion is projected to further solidify the position of Ryanair within the aviation industry. These expansions necessitate the procurement of aircraft fuel systems.

Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2021, accounting for nearly one-third of the global aircraft fuel systems market revenue. Also, the same region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 7.2% from 2022 to 2031 and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. This is owing to the huge population of Asia-Pacific and the percentage of the population that has enough disposable income to make air travel a viable proposition.

Ground Support Worldwide sat down with Anna-Maria Kirchner, Head of Global Sales at Finnair Cargo, at the CNS Partnership Conference held in Miami in May, where she offered a look into the airline's operations, strategic pivots, and its commitment to specialized cargo. The following is an excerpt from that discussion.

GSW: What's the latest news from Finnair Cargo?

Kirchner: From last year to this year, we’ve effectively doubled our capacity into the US market. This means we now operate up to 11 flights per week to Dallas, five times a week to Los Angeles, five times a week to Seattle, and daily services to Chicago and New York, JFK. The strategic rationale is straightforward: we see an opportunity to capture a larger share of the market, particularly given our unique geographical position and operational strengths.

GSW: How much of a factor is Finland's geographical location to Finnair Cargo's opportunities and challenges?

Kirchner: Historically, Finland offered the shortest route from Europe to Asia by flying over Russia. However, the pandemic hit first, followed by the closure of Russian airspace. This presented a double crisis for us. Being only 200 kilometers from St. Petersburg and sharing a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia, this closure significantly impacted our direct routes.

Despite not being the largest carrier globally - we operate around 80 aircraft - we consider ourselves a niche carrier that's incredibly fast and agile in adapting our strategy. We've continued to fly to Asia by either taking a southern route or, more uniquely, a North Pole route back, flying over Alaska. This requires significant operational adaptation based on demand and geopolitical realities. While other Western and European carriers face similar challenges, our proximity to Russia means the extended flight times affect us more acutely.

GSW: What defines Finnair's niche in the air cargo market?

Kirchner: Our niche is specialized cargo, particularly in the cool chain. We are one of the largest transporters of salmon, shipping over 100,000 kilos of seafood daily, primarily from northern Norway, trucked down to Helsinki, and then flown to Asia and the US. Our entire operation is built around maintaining the cool chain. Our state-of-the-art cool terminal, opened in 2018, combines automation with human expertise and latest technology.

Our focus is on being a premium carrier. We don't aim to be the cheapest; instead, we prioritize quality and reliability. Our customers consistently acknowledge us as a premium product, trusting us to handle their shipments, especially sensitive cargo like pharmaceuticals, with the utmost care. This commitment to quality and specialization truly defines our niche.

GSW: Maintaining a successful cool chain operation involves significant technological and logistical integration. What do you see as the recipe for achieving this effectively?

Kirchner: A majority of our success stems from our technology supported hub and handling team in Helsinki. The technology within our COOL terminal is cutting-edge. However, the location of Helsinki itself plays a crucial role; it's a non-congested hub. Unlike mega-hubs in Europe such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt, which can experience bottlenecks for smaller shipments, our automation and lower congestion ensure smoother, more efficient handling, regardless of shipment size.

GSW: How do Finnish societal values and government policies inform Finnair's philosophy, particularly regarding employee welfare and operational efficiency?

Kirchner: Our government has a 55.8% ownership stake in the company, and this influence is evident in how we operate. We prioritize work-life balance for our employees; for instance, performance reviews begin by asking about work-life balance. Our regular working week is approximately 37 hours and we encourage rest to maintain energy.

A key Finnish trait reflected at Finnair is decentralized decision-making. We empower employees at various levels to make decisions, which allows us to react quickly to business opportunities. This ""one voice"" approach means everyone is accountable for their decisions, fostering a sense of ownership and agility.

Our longevity as one of the oldest carriers, established in 1923, is also a testament to this resilient and forward-thinking spirit. We've navigated challenges like the pandemic and airspace closure by constantly adapting and innovating. This cultural foundation contributes significantly to our positive and productive work environment.

GSW: Finnair appears to be very progressive in terms of gender equality and employee support. How do these principles manifest within the company, especially concerning family leave and career development?

Kirchner: It stems from a long-standing cultural ethos in Finland, where equal opportunity is a fundamental principle. For example, Finnish law allows for up to three years of maternity leave with job security, and free daycare facilities are strategically located near homes or workplaces to ease the transition back to work for mothers.

Crucially, this isn't just about women; it's about equal opportunity for all. We have male colleagues who take extended paternity leave, demonstrating a truly egalitarian approach. Our internal job rotation program is another example. We encourage employees to experience different departments, like moving from operations to revenue management or sales. This provides a 360-degree view of the business, fostering a deeper understanding and better collaboration, which ultimately benefits our cargo operations.

GSW: As an employer, how significant is Finnair within Finland, and what contributes to the strong loyalty among its employees?

Kirchner: Finnair is a very large employer in Finland, with around 6,000 employees. While this might not seem huge by American standards, for a country of 5.5 million people, it's substantial. We are consistently ranked among the top five most favorite employers in Finland, reflecting a strong brand and deep employee pride.

Employee loyalty is remarkable. I have colleagues who have been with the company for 20+ years. Many have received lucrative offers from other carriers, including those in the Middle East, but they choose to stay. This loyalty is attributed to a strong ""Finnair DNA"" - a positive, supportive, and empowering work environment that makes people feel valued and connected to the company's mission.

Q: How does Finnair balance technology and human expertise to maintain its premium service, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in the industry?

Kirchner: It's a balance of both. While we leverage technology extensively, including AI-supported forecasting for staffing and resource allocation, the cornerstone is our modern terminal that combines automation with the know-how of our cargo experts. The technology is only as good as the people operating it, which makes our human expertise critical.

We actively promote internal rotation among our cargo teams. For instance, someone from operations might spend a year in revenue management or sales. This cross-functional experience gives our team members a holistic understanding of the entire cargo

ecosystem, enabling them to connect the dots and anticipate needs more effectively. This unique approach, while less common in other companies, is something we actively encourage, fostering a highly knowledgeable and adaptable workforce that complements our technological capabilities.

GSW: Sustainability is a critical focus for the aviation industry. What initiatives is Finnair undertaking in this area, particularly within its cargo operations?

Kirchner: Sustainability is a significant priority, and Finnair is committed to advancing sustainable development in the industry. We have a dedicated sustainability manager for cargo and we work on various initiatives:

Waste Reduction: We are investigating processes to repair and re-audit cargo straps and nets used for cargo handling, preventing them from being discarded prematurely. While not cheaper, it significantly reduces waste.

Renewable Energy: Our COOL terminal in Helsinki is equipped with 2,990 solar panels, making it the second-largest solar panel field in Finland. These panels supply 37% of our electricity needs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): In Europe, a 2% SAF mandate is in place, meaning we're obligated to use this blend. We're actively partnering with fuel suppliers like Neste (headquartered in Finland) and freight forwarders, such as our recent important deal with DB Schenker, where they voluntarily purchased SAF with us. This helps both us and our partners meet their emission reduction targets (Scope 3).

We view sustainability not as a distant goal but as an urgent reality. We're actively collaborating with other airlines and forwarders to achieve the industry goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, emphasizing education and collective action.

GSW: Looking ahead, what do you envision for the future of Finnair Cargo, in terms of opportunities and overarching goals for the organization?

Kirchner: We anticipate organic growth for Finnair. We are still integrating additional A350 aircraft, which are excellent for cargo and contribute to our sustainability goals. Our immediate focus is on fine-tuning our current flight network. The geopolitical situation remains a key factor that will shape future developments.

The air cargo industry is inherently dynamic - when it goes up, it goes up significantly, and when it goes down, it goes down significantly; there's rarely a ""normal."" This dynamism makes it incredibly interesting. At Finnair, our smaller, agile organization allows us to react quickly to market changes and seize opportunities. We are confident in our ability to adapt and continue our positive organic growth, making it an exciting time to be in this industry with Finnair.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/07/68810933cb3994a5848529fb-annakirchner_1.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-04 10:56:27.228886

Since the beginning of the 7th Administration, South Africa embarked on a process to stabilise and enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations with the US. The aim has been to address long-standing bilateral issues of concern for both sides in ways that move the trade relations forward. South Africa has been engaging the US at various levels with a view to ensure predictability in trade. However, even with these efforts, the US decided to impose a 30% unilateral tariff on South Africa. It is unfortunate that this government’s efforts in resetting the relationship with the US has been undermined by some actors within South African society.

The unilateral tariffs have been implemented notwithstanding, South Africa’s submission of a comprehensive and ambitious Framework Deal in May 2025 aimed at addressing the US trade deficit, address tariffs, promote digital trade, enhance commercial relations, promote investment and eliminate non-tariff barriers to enhance mutually beneficial trade relations with the United States.

The 30% unilateral tariffs on foreign imports apply to various US trading partners which will be implemented from 12:01 am on 8 August 2025. The Executive order published by the United States clarifies that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 8 August 2025, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the 10% tariff.

The US is South Africa’s third biggest trading partner, with the European Union and China being the first and second largest trading partners. The US accounts for 7.5% of our global exports. Thus, we will continue to engage the US with a view to conclude a deal that advances the interests of both countries. South Africa seeks to conclude deals that promote value addition and industrialisation, rather than extractive relations that deprive the country of the ability to beneficiate our mineral wealth by mimicking extractive colonial era trade relations.

South Africa’s minimal 0.25% share of total US imports makes the 30% tariff on our country are inscrutable, especially when these same tariffs have been applied indiscriminately to all US trading partners globally. Moreover, South Africa poses no trade threat to the US economy nor its national security. The calculation of US-SA “trade deficit” ignores the substantial US trade surplus in services, as well as the complementary nature of the bilateral trade and investment relations between the two countries.

South African exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry. On the contrary, our exports are crucial inputs that support America’s own industrial base. Our agriculture exports are even counter-seasonal, meaning they fill gaps in the US market, not replace domestic products.

South Africa isn’t just a trading partner—we’re a major investor in the US, with our companies sustaining American jobs. Similarly, over 600 US companies in South Africa contribute to our industrial growth and create employment. Our goal is to preserve and grow these mutually beneficial relationships.

Impact of the tariffs

The uncertainty of the new tariff line is already incorporated into economic projections. For example, various economists estimated that it may shave off 0,2% of South Africa’s economic growth. The reduction in growth from the 30% tariff depends on a number of factors, including our ability to find alternative markets. It should be noted, however, that 35% of SA exports remain exempted from the tariffs. All applicable exceptions covered in the previous US Executive Order are set to remain in force and these exceptions covers products such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, stainless steel scrap and energy and energy products.

Importantly, due to South Africa not enjoying a country exemption for Section 232 duties on steel and aluminium, South African companies have already adjusted to the Section 232 duties since 2018. However, the heightened policy uncertainty creates instability in trade and may have an impact on exports.

The new tariff regime implemented by the United States is a significant departure from a low-tariff environment. This policy shift, which affects not only South Africa but the entire world, has already led to higher tariffs than before, changing the landscape of global trade as we know it.

Response measures

Continuation of negotiations with the US

South Africa is committed to a principled approach, and we will continue to use all available diplomatic channels to negotiate a mutually beneficial trade deal with the United States one that respects our national interests while advancing our long-standing partnership. Such a deal will be pursued in a pragmatic manner that preserves regional integration and the SACU common external tariff, noting that SACU accounts for 9% of our global exports and must be preserved.

The South African Government is working with industry to consider aspects of the Framework Deal that can be modified, in a manner that promotes predictability in trade.

Implement an Economic Response Package which includes:

a.) The establishment of an Export Support Desk, which will serve as a direct point of contact for companies affected by the US tariff hike. The aim of this support measure is to support the diversification of export markets for increased resilience and facilitate the entry into alternative markets for affected exporters. The Desk will provide updates on developments and tailored advisory services to exporters on alternative destinations, guidance on market entry processes, insights into compliance requirements and linkages to South African Embassies and High Commissions abroad. The contact details of the Export Support Desk have been published on the dtic website.

b.) Measures to assist companies to absorb the tariff and facilitate long-term resilience and growth strategies to protect jobs and productive capacity in South Africa. The details of these are being finalised and will be communicated shortly.

c.) Localisation Fund Support (LSF) stands ready to contribute to the national effort to support South African companies impacted by the imposition of 30% import tariffs by the United States. In collaboration with the dtic, IDC and other agencies – LSF will issue an open call from firms operating in affected value chains, with the aim of providing targeted competitiveness and efficiency support.

d.) To build resilience, we are working on an Export and Competitiveness Support Programme (ECSP), which will include a working capital facility and plant and equipment facility to address short to medium term needs across all industries.

e.) We are also working with the Department of Labour on measures to mitigate potential job losses, using existing instruments such as the UIF that can be adjusted to respond to the current challenges.

Block exemption for exporters

The diversification of markets that will be required following the introduction of additional tariffs on South African goods may require exporters to coordinate their activities in relation to developing joint infrastructure for exports, sharing of market information and coordination of activities to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies that enable them to be competitive.

These activities may contravene the provision of the Competition Act. The Minister has following consultations with the Competition Commission, introduced a Block Exemption for Exporters to enable collaboration and coordination by competitors. The Block Exemption details the scope of application. A draft Block Exemption will be published by the end of the week so that the process can be concluded expeditiously.

Diversification of markets

We have been strengthening trade and investment partnerships with various trade partners. These efforts are bearing fruits, targeting markets across Africa, as well as in Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Americas.

Our announcement on the Clean Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union in March has unlocked a R90 Billion Investment Package that has been initially committed. This Clean Trade and Investment Partnership also aims to unlock new market access opportunities for South Africa, including the export of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by Sasol and the exports of hybrids and Electric Vehicles.

While facing global trade challenges, South Africa is proactively building a more resilient agricultural sector. We’ve made significant progress in opening up vast new markets like China and Thailand, securing vital protocols for products like citrus and others. With China alone being a $200 billion market, we are confidently expanding our reach and creating new opportunities for our agricultural producers.

Our government has not been idle; we are proactively and collaboratively diversifying our trade portfolio. Under the coordinated leadership of the Presidency, DIRCO, and the dtic, we’re making significant inroads into new, high-growth markets across Asia and the Middle East, including the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These efforts are not only opening doors to new opportunities but also reinforcing our commitment to retaining the vital markets we already have. South Africa’s economic future is resilient, and we are working tirelessly to secure it.

We have also developed a number of Trade and Investment Packages with a number of countries, including Japan that aim to unlock new market access opportunities.

While the current measures present challenges, it also presents opportunities to build and accelerate the implementation of the AfCFTA and to develop new partnerships in markets that have remained untapped, including ASEAN and Türkiye.

Under this plan, which has been heavily backed by the incumbent Labour government, Heathrow could see its capacity expand to 756,000 flights per year. That is up from its current limit of 480,000 flights.

But the push for a third runway is not new, and has been the target of serious and disruptive opposition from pressure groups in the past. With shifting approaches towards climate action, and greater prominence of ‘sustainable’ aviation solutions, what pressure landscape will Heathrow face this time around?

Pressure on Aviation is growing globally

Since 2024, the volume of global pressure campaigns targeting the Aviation & Aerospace industry have been approaching levels not seen since the COVID pandemic.

Climate change, air pollution, and opposition to development remain the top issues driving pressure on the industry.

Concerns around weapons exports have also dogged aerospace manufacturers in recent years.

Attitudes towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Heathrow’s ‘shovel-ready plan’ includes a provision to reduce carbon emissions, and reach net zero by 2050, through its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Pressure narratives around Sustainable Aviation Fuel began in 2020, and debates on the proposed solution are growing. H1 2025 saw more SAF-focused campaigns than all 12 months of 2024.

The role of SAF in aviation decarbonisation is polarizing among pressure campaigners. A narrative analysis of SIGWATCH data reveals that:

Such a split in attitudes in pressure campaigns is unusual, particularly when many tech-focused climate solutions are deemed to be ‘false solutions’ and ‘distractions’ by environmental groups.

What does this mean for Heathrow & the Aviation industry?

This new proposal for Heathrow’s expansion is being released into a dramatically different pressure ecosystem than previous attempts.

Scrutiny of the industry is up, but the types of campaigns likely to be provoked by this announcement will look different to the Extinction Rebellion-style direct action that we would have seen several years ago.

Split views around solutions such as SAF indicate more space for pragmatism, but opposition will likely continue through different stakeholder channels.

With European climate policymakers eyeing aviation taxation as a lucrative and underused tool, a fierce debate has reignited between environmental campaigners and the airline industry over how to fund decarbonisation fairly and effectively.

A new policy briefing from Carbon Market Watch (CMW) claims that a full expansion of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) to cover all departing and arriving flights, private jets, and aviation’s non-CO₂ climate impacts could raise nearly €500 billion between now and 2040. That figure is nearly five times the revenue expected under the EU-ETS’s currently limited scope.

The environmental NGO says these reforms are not only overdue, but also have strong public backing. Citing Eurobarometer polling and other research, CMW notes that over 75% of EU citizens support ending fossil fuel subsidies, including for kerosene. Most believe public funds should be directed to clean energy, and view the current exemption of aviation from fuel taxes as unfair.

“It is scandalous that the aviation industry has skirted paying for its climate impacts for so long,” says Bastien Bonnet-Cantalloube, CMW’s policy expert on the decarbonisation of aviation. “The upcoming EU-ETS review can set aviation on a decarbonisation flightpath and generate greater revenue to fund the bloc’s climate policies.”

Aviation taxation: Proposals on the table

CMW’s recommendations, backed by research from consultancy Carbone 4, include:

Extending the EU ETS to all flights departing and arriving in the EEA

Including non-CO₂ effects (such as contrail-induced warming and NOx emissions), with a proposed multiplier of 2x

Applying a 4x carbon multiplier to private jet emissions, reflecting their disproportionately high emissions per passenger

Doubling support for e-kerosene development, funded through auctioned allowances

The report estimates that, under an expanded scope, the ETS could cover 130 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually by 2030, compared to just 54 million today.

That would not only help bridge Europe’s €8 billion annual clean aviation investment gap, but also contribute substantially to international climate finance and rail infrastructure improvements.

IATA pushes back on unfair aviation taxation

However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has pushed back, arguing that additional taxes on aviation, including those targeting business class or private jets, could undermine the sector’s ability to invest in long-term decarbonisation.

The association spoke out against the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), which has proposed a broad menu of 16 potential levies to raise around $90 billion annually. This includes a premium air travel levy, a fuel levy for private aircraft and a frequent flyer tax.

IATA warned that such taxes “do not reduce emissions” and risk “diverting funds away from the technologies and solutions that will.” The organisation continues to back CORSIA, the global carbon offsetting scheme developed by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), as the appropriate international mechanism.

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” says Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “Yet governments casually suggest a tax on flyers that is three times the airline industry’s annual profit without considering the real-world side effects for an industry that is a lifeline for remote communities, invigorates tourism markets and links local products to global markets.”

IATA argues that regional schemes like the ETS, especially if significantly expanded or duplicated by new levies, could fragment climate governance and erode international consensus.

“Airlines are not evading doing their part to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The industry is doing everything possible to achieve net-zero carbon emissions,” continues Walsh. “The last thing these efforts need is a USD90 billion gut punch of a tax.”

The future of the EU-ETS

The EU is preparing for a 2026 revision of the ETS Directive, which will revisit scope, pricing, and revenue allocation rules. In parallel, member states are working on the bloc’s 2028–2034 budget, including possible new own-resource revenues.

At the heart of the debate is not just how to price emissions, but how to spend the proceeds. Carbon Market Watch proposes that a portion of ETS revenue should be ringfenced for:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, with a strict focus on e-kerosene

Rail infrastructure upgrades to replace short-haul flights

Transition support for aviation workers and the least developed countries

The group argues that expanding aviation carbon pricing could generate ten times the revenue needed to fund SAF development alone.

Whether that vision wins political support remains to be seen. But with mounting climate commitments, lagging airline emissions reductions, and a patchwork of global policy tools, the EU may be running out of reasons, and time, not to act.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/viktor-forgacs-hBJIdtTOmeE-unsplash-1024x674.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:40.890833

The demand for HVO and SAF is anticipated to increase due to global renewable fuel mandates. The fuels are produced by hydrogenating sustainable vegetable oils such as used cooking oil and other waste residues, using Ecofining technology developed by Eni in collaboration with Honeywell UOP.

Compared to traditional fossil fuels, HVO and SAF significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire product value chain.

LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol said: “LG Chem is transforming its portfolio to build a low-carbon foundation that ensures both a progressively more sustainable growth and profitability.

“By advancing innovation in renewable fuels and biobased feedstocks like HVO, we aim to strengthen our global competitiveness and meet our customers’ evolving needs efficiently.”

The establishment of this facility marks a significant move for LG Chem in the renewable energy sector. By integrating HVO into its supply chain, the company aims to broaden its range of International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS-certified products.

These products target applications in various sectors, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for electronics and cars, ethylene-vinyl acetate for sporting goods, and superabsorbent polymers for hygiene products.

Enilive CEO Stefano Ballista said: “The Seosan biorefinery breaking ground reaffirms Enilive’s strategy in offering increasingly sustainable products and our company’s position as a leader in biofuels production.

“Together with the plants that are already operational in Italy and in the US, and with new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reach our 2030 target to increase our biorefining capacity to over five million tons per year, with the potential to produce more than two million tons per year of SAF.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/08/LG-Chem.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:51.080105

USGBC President and CEO Ryan LeGrand told Agri-Pulse that the name more accurately reflects the council’s work over the last 10 years, which has expanded to include export promotion for ethanol and high-protein distiller’s grains.

“The promotion of these products has been part of our identity and practice, but not in name,” LeGrand said. “We wanted to fully bring in the full portfolio of all the products that the Grains Council is handling into our name.”

Members voted on the name amendment at the organization’s 65th annual board of delegates meeting in Grand Rapids, Michigan, on Friday. LeGrand said the motion passed with “overwhelming” support.

In a press release published Monday, LeGrand said that the new name was also selected to capitalize on opportunities in the energy sector and reflect the organization’s work in both the grains and ethanol markets, while also preserving existing brand recognition.

“We're working in the SAF space, sustainable aviation fuel,” LeGrand said. “And then sustainable marine fuel is one that's starting to pop up on a lot of people's radars.”

Bioproducts encompass more than just ethanol, LeGrand said, adding that the new name should reflect the group’s work on the latest and future biofuels and, therefore, have staying power.

“It's a name that we're thinking will hold for another 30 years,” LeGrand said. “We looked at a lot of different options. And really landed on this one that we don't feel boxes us in to just one or two products.""

The name change is the culmination of a two-year process, LeGrand said, which included market research firms testing reactions to a name change.

The recent announcement from SAS is one of those moments.

Their decision to bring the E195-E2 into their fleet is a strong endorsement of what the E2 family represents: performance, efficiency, and a clear path toward more sustainable operations. But it also speaks to something bigger — the growing momentum behind Embraer’s vision for the future of aviation.

One of the reasons airlines are turning to the E2 is its smart commonality. The E190-E2 and E195-E2 share 100% of parts, and both maintain 30% commonality with the first-generation E-Jets. That means less complexity, faster crew training, and lower maintenance costs — all without compromising performance.

And when it comes to sustainability, the E2, the most efficient small narrowbody, sets a new standard. Compared to the previous generation, it delivers up to 29% lower fuel burn and up to 68% less noise — real, measurable gains that are already making a difference. The aircraft has also been successfully tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and full certification is on the horizon. This isn’t just about meeting targets, it’s about leading responsibly, in ways that are being recognized by airlines and industry leaders around the world.

With Copenhagen Airport (CPH) serving as a strategic connectivity hub for SAS, the introduction of the E195-E2 not only enhances the airline’s ability to efficiently link Scandinavia and its international network but also unlocks future growth opportunities.

Lower gas prices. More energy independence. Stronger farms. Cleaner air. What’s not to like? These results are the proven outcomes of a groundbreaking bipartisan energy policy established twenty years ago, which continues to deliver benefits today.

Friday, Aug. 8 marks the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and we’re proud of RFA’s long history of developing, supporting, and resolutely defending this successful landmark policy. Created to promote U.S. energy independence, the RFS requires transportation fuel sold in the U.S. to contain annually increasing volumes of renewable fuels like ethanol and biomass-based diesel.

Click here for RFA’s new report summarizing the successes of the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The effects of this policy speak for themselves. It has helped lower fuel prices for American families, reduced our dependence on foreign oil, revitalized farm economies, and cut greenhouse gas emissions and tailpipe pollution—all while building a domestic energy sector that is cleaner and more competitive, diverse and resilient.

Like any major public policy, the RFS has certainly faced challenges, including fluctuating market dynamics, regulatory uncertainty, and evolving political and environmental priorities. But the core value proposition remains clear: By expanding the availability of American-made renewable fuels, the RFS supports our national interests economically and environmentally.

As the United States continues to chart a course toward a more secure and diversified energy future, the RFS can serve as a foundational model of a policy that bridges economic development and environmental responsibility. Far from being a relic of early-2000s energy policy, as some opponents like to claim, the RFS is a living example of how thoughtful, bipartisan legislation can deliver long-term, multi-dimensional benefits.

In celebrating two decades of the RFS, we also look ahead—to new innovations in production methods and fuel technologies that will continue to lower emissions, support farmers and deliver value to everyday Americans.

“LG Chem is changing its business direction to focus more on low-carbon industries, aiming for long-term growth and better profits,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.
According to LG Chem, the new plant will help reduce dependence on imported raw materials, which the company has relied on until now for its chemical production.
The global demand for sustainable raw materials is rising quickly as businesses work to meet stricter environmental rules and increasing consumer interest in green products.","LG Chem has started building South Korea’s first hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) production plant, a major step in the company’s efforts to secure eco-friendly raw materials and reduce its environmental impact. The plant is being built in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province, and is expected to be completed by 2027. Once operational, it will produce 300,000 tons of HVO each year, reports The Korea Herald.

HVO, also known as green diesel, is made by using hydrogen to process vegetable oils—mainly used cooking oil—into a cleaner fuel. While similar to biodiesel, HVO performs better in cold conditions and is more stable. Though it has slightly lower energy density than regular diesel, it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. HVO is used in areas like aviation fuel, car fuel, and as a chemical feedstock known as bio-naphtha.

LG Chem plans to use the HVO not only for biofuel but also as a raw material in its growing line of eco-friendly plastics. The company will convert bio-naphtha into high-quality plastics used in products like home appliances, vehicles, sports gear, and hygiene items.

“LG Chem is changing its business direction to focus more on low-carbon industries, aiming for long-term growth and better profits,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol. “We’ll keep investing in clean fuel and bio-based materials like HVO to stay globally competitive and meet customer expectations.”

The Seosan plant is a 50:50 joint project with Italian energy company Eni, which already produces 2 million tons of HVO each year in Italy and operates a large international supply network.

According to LG Chem, the new plant will help reduce dependence on imported raw materials, which the company has relied on until now for its chemical production.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham welcomed the proposals and the government’s continued endorsement of the expansion but stressed that ministers must now “put their words into action.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:

Unite welcomes Heathrow’s plans and is pleased that the government continues to support building a third runway. Now ministers must put their words into action and ensure that construction begins as quickly as possible.

A third runway must be about more than just improving infrastructure – it must provide real material benefits to the thousands of workers who will build and run it. That means ensuring that the jobs created are well-paid and unionised.

Heathrow’s commitment to using UK produced steel is also welcome and must not be watered down. All national infrastructure projects should be using UK steel - no ifs, no buts.

Graham also highlighted the opportunity for Heathrow’s expansion to align with broader industrial and environmental strategies, particularly in the aviation sector’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

She criticised the lack of plans to convert the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to SAF production, describing it as “outrageous” given the potential to preserve jobs and strengthen the UK’s industrial base.

Graham added:

As well as providing much needed support to our steel industry, the expansion at Heathrow must be accompanied by joined up thinking when it comes to the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) planes must soon start using.

Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery is ideally suited to transition to SAF production and it is frankly outrageous that there currently are no plans for this to happen when it would safeguard hundreds of jobs and bolster UK industry.

Heathrow’s proposed third runway remains one of the UK’s most high-profile and controversial infrastructure projects, with ongoing debate over its environmental and economic impacts.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province.
It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.
LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth.
“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.","LG Chem has begun construction on Korea’s first hydrotreated vegetable oil production facility, furthering the company’s strategy to bring the supply of eco-friendly raw materials in-house amid rising global demand for sustainable alternatives.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province. Once completed in 2027, the facility is expected to produce 300,000 tons of HVO annually.

HVO, sometimes called green diesel, is produced by using hydrogen to break down vegetable oils, particularly used cooking oil, into smaller molecules. The concept is similar to biodiesel but the different chemistry of the resulting fuel means it is more stable and performs better at low temperatures.

While HVO has around 10 percent lower energy density than petroleum diesel, its proponents claim it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.

LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth. The company aims to convert bio-naphtha into high-performance plastics used in home appliances, automobiles, sporting goods and hygiene products.

“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.

“We will continue to drive technological innovation and commercialization in eco-friendly fuel and bio-resources, including HVO, to strengthen our global competitiveness and respond proactively to customer demand.”

The Seosan facility is being developed through a 50:50 joint venture with Italian energy firm Eni, which currently produces 2 million tons of HVO annually at its facilities in Italy and has an extensive global supply network.

An LG Chem official said the new facility will provide the company with more affordable access to bio-based feedstocks for its chemical manufacturing operations, which until now have largely relied on imports from global suppliers.

Competition to secure sustainable raw materials is intensifying worldwide, as companies seek to meet growing customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global HVO market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 8.2 percent, expanding from approximately $21.36 billion in 2025 to $36.86 billion by 2032.

Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.","Minahasa Selatan, Sulut, ruangenergi.com-Transisi energi di Indonesia tidak bisa hanya ditopang oleh satu pilar. Jika kita ingin mencapai target emisi nol bersih (net zero emission) pada 2060, maka strategi nasional harus ditopang oleh dua kaki utama: elektrifikasi berbasis energi terbarukan dan penguatan energi alternatif non-listrik seperti bioenergi, hidrogen, amonia, hingga carbon capture.

Sejauh ini, sektor elektrifikasi melalui PLN dan proyek-proyek berbasis EBT (Energi Baru Terbarukan) memang telah berjalan cukup progresif. Program 5 GW energi hijau dari PLN tiap tahun—dengan nilai investasi mencapai 6–7 miliar dolar AS—adalah langkah besar. Namun, kaki kedua, yakni sektor bioenergi, biofuel, bioetanol, green ammonia, hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), masih belum mendapatkan ruang regulasi dan dukungan yang memadai.

Padahal, sektor non-listrik ini adalah kekuatan besar Indonesia. Pertamina, misalnya, memiliki kompetensi dan infrastruktur kuat dalam ekosistem biofuel dan energi molekular lainnya. Bioetanol, biodiesel, hingga green hydrogen bukan lagi sekadar opsi, tapi merupakan fondasi percepatan transisi energi di sektor transportasi, industri, dan maritim.

Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina NRE, Norman Ginting, menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan strategi nasional.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan dengan pendekatan dua kaki. Elektrifikasi memang penting, tapi pengembangan bioenergi dan teknologi molekular tak kalah krusial untuk dekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang tidak bisa dialiri listrik langsung,” ujar Norman kepada ruangenergi.com di sela-sela kunjungan ke PLTP Lahendong , Kamis(31/07/2025), di Sulawesi Utara.

Sayangnya, proses regulasi dan perencanaan energi nasional saat ini masih cenderung berat sebelah. Banyak potensi bioenergi belum tergarap secara optimal. Negara-negara produsen minyak seperti Brasil dan Arab Saudi bahkan telah bergerak lebih cepat melalui penguatan bioekonomi dan pengembangan SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Dua Lokomotif, Satu Tujuan

Norman bercerita, transisi energi tidak akan stabil jika hanya ditarik oleh satu lokomotif. PLN dan Pertamina harus menjadi dua mesin penggerak utama. Keduanya mewakili dua sisi strategi besar: elektrifikasi dan dekarbonisasi molekular. Pemerintah perlu menjamin bahwa kolaborasi antara keduanya berlangsung harmonis dan berimbang.

Namun dua kaki ini saja tidak cukup. Diperlukan peran aktif dari sektor swasta sebagai inovator, akselerator, sekaligus penyandang modal. Sayangnya, belum ada ekosistem kolaboratif yang benar-benar inklusif. Sektor swasta masih minim keterlibatannya dalam desain besar transisi energi nasional.

Regulasi Harus Dipercepat

Salah satu kunci utama adalah percepatan regulasi. Menurut Norman, dukungan terhadap bioenergi, green fuel, dan teknologi non-listrik seperti carbon capture dan green ammonia harus dituangkan ke dalam kebijakan yang jelas, insentif yang menarik, serta roadmap yang terukur dan realistis.

Regulasi yang kuat juga akan menjadi sinyal positif bagi para investor. Tanpa kepastian hukum dan kebijakan, baik investor lokal maupun global akan ragu untuk masuk. Transisi energi tidak boleh menjadi domain eksklusif BUMN saja—ini adalah proyek nasional yang harus melibatkan semua pihak.

Kesimpulan: Transisi Energi Butuh Akselerator, Kolaborator, dan Keseimbangan

Indonesia tidak bisa bertumpu pada satu kaki saja. Transisi energi akan goyah jika hanya berfokus pada elektrifikasi, tanpa memperkuat pilar bioenergi dan inovasi molekular lainnya. PLN dan Pertamina harus bergerak bersama sebagai dua lokomotif utama. Pemerintah harus menjadi akselerator, fasilitator, dan penyambung antar pelaku.

Dan yang paling penting: swasta harus dilibatkan secara penuh. Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.",https://www.ruangenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/norman1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:54.899321

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry.","The recent 180% surge in Thai Airways International's (THAI) share price following its trading resumption on August 4, 2025, is not merely a short-term rally but a reflection of a meticulously executed corporate transformation. This resurgence, however, must be contextualized within the broader dynamics of a post-pandemic aviation sector that is navigating both headwinds and tailwinds. For investors, the question is whether THAI's revival is a fleeting rebound or a durable repositioning for long-term growth.

Catalysts for the Surge: Restructuring, Resilience, and Reimagining

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to recovery is a case study in strategic restructuring. By 2020, the airline had accumulated over 400 billion baht in debt, forcing it into bankruptcy protection. Yet, through a combination of debt-to-equity conversion, cost-cutting, and operational streamlining, THAI reduced its liabilities to 95 billion baht by Q1 2025. Shareholders' equity turned positive at 55 billion baht, and the company now holds 125 billion baht in cash—a stark contrast to its near-delisting status in 2021. The Central Bankruptcy Court's June 2025 termination of its rehabilitation plan marked the culmination of this effort, restoring investor confidence and triggering the stock's meteoric rise.

Analysts from Tisco and Yuanta Securities have underscored THAI's improved balance sheet and aggressive growth plans. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025—the highest among Asia-Pacific full-service carriers—and a projected EBITDA CAGR of 8.6% through 2027, the airline's financial health is no longer a liability but an asset. Strategic partnerships, including a Joint Business Agreement with Turkish Airlines and collaborations with Airports of Thailand (AOT), further strengthen its regional and global connectivity.

The Aviation Sector's Post-Pandemic Renaissance

The broader aviation industry is experiencing a nuanced recovery. Global passenger demand has not only rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but has surpassed them, with IATA forecasting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025—a 6.7% increase over 2024. This growth is fueled by pent-up demand, falling airfares (down 44% in real terms since 2014), and a shift toward leisure travel. However, airlines face challenges: fuel remains a 26.4% cost burden in 2025, and regulatory pressures, such as CORSIA compliance and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, add complexity.

THAI's position in this landscape is unique. Unlike budget carriers, which operate on razor-thin margins, THAI's focus on full-service operations allows it to leverage premium revenue streams while maintaining cost discipline. Its fleet modernization—45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos—enhances fuel efficiency and passenger experience, aligning with trends toward sustainability and comfort. Moreover, its 22% market share at Suvarnabhumi Airport positions it as a critical player in Thailand's ambition to become a regional aviation hub.

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation

Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry. Airline profitability is increasingly tied to digital transformation and AI-driven revenue management. THAI's digital initiatives—enhanced booking platforms, “Cash + Miles” loyalty programs, and SCB credit card partnerships—position it to capture a larger share of the digital-first traveler market. Additionally, its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical to integrate SAF align with global ESG trends, which are becoming non-negotiable for long-term capital.

The airline's expansion plans are equally compelling. By 2033, THAI aims to double its fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft, supported by strategic acquisitions and leases. This growth is not speculative: it is underpinned by a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025 and a 3%–13% revenue growth projection for 2025–2027. The airline's ability to balance capacity with demand—raising ASK by 21.1% in Q1 2025 while maintaining an 83.4% load factor—demonstrates operational agility.

Risks and Realities

No investment is without risk. Fuel prices, though currently favorable, remain volatile, and a spike could erode margins. Regulatory compliance costs, particularly for CORSIA and SAF, could also strain profitability. Additionally, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with low-cost carriers and regional players vying for market share. However, THAI's debt reduction, liquidity, and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. The airline's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37—a sharp decline from 20.66 in 2020—provides a buffer against external shocks.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a long-term horizon, THAI presents a compelling opportunity. The airline's financial restructuring has created a resilient foundation, while its strategic bets on fleet modernization, digital innovation, and sustainability align with global trends. Analysts' consensus target price of 10.40–10.70 baht suggests a 10–15% upside from current levels, but the broader recovery of the aviation sector could unlock even greater value.

However, patience is key. The stock's volatility reflects both optimism and uncertainty. Investors should monitor THAI's ability to execute its expansion plans, maintain cost discipline, and navigate regulatory challenges. Those who can stomach short-term fluctuations may find themselves positioned for a substantial payoff as the airline reclaims its role as a leader in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem.

In a world where industries are being reshaped by technology, sustainability, and shifting consumer behavior, Thai Airways' revival is more than a story of survival—it is a blueprint for reinvention. For investors, the question is not whether the airline will recover, but how much further it can go.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:59.329102

In an era of shifting geopolitical alliances and rising multipolarity, Indonesia’s formal entry into BRICS in January 2025 marks more than just a diplomatic milestone. It signals a new strategic direction for Southeast Asia’s largest economy, particularly in its approach to global norms, alternative development finance, and sectoral cooperation, including civil aviation. After being officially declared a full member in January 2025, Indonesia was immediately accepted as the 10th member of BRICS. BRICS originally consisted of five countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — but has since expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia. This expanded group now represents over 45% of the world’s population and a significant share of global GDP. For Indonesia, its participation opens doors to enhanced economic, technological, and diplomatic networks that go beyond the traditional Western-led institutional framework.

Aviation Diplomacy in the BRICS Context

Aviation has long symbolized and facilitated sovereignty, mobility, and integration. For Indonesia — a vast archipelagic nation with over 17,000 islands — aviation is not a luxury but a lifeline. However, the sector faces persistent challenges: uneven infrastructure, reliance on foreign technology, skill gaps, and vulnerability to external economic shocks. By joining BRICS, Indonesia gains an alternative platform for forming partnerships and technical cooperation in aviation. This includes potential collaborations in areas such as air traffic management, satellite-based navigation systems, airport development, safety oversight, and personnel training. Indonesia’s diplomacy within BRICS can now focus on advocating for more inclusive global aviation governance — particularly within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where BRICS countries are increasingly coordinating their positions. With India and China already active in ICAO’s Council and technical panels, Indonesia could now join this emerging bloc to balance the influence of traditional powers.

Technology Transfer and Diversified Aviation Supply Chains

One of the key benefits of increased BRICS involvement is the potential for technology transfer and diversification of the supply chain. Indonesia currently imports much of its aviation technology — from radar systems to ground-based navigational aids — from Europe and the United States. While these systems are technically advanced, they come with restrictions: complex procurement standards, intellectual property limitations, and vendor lock-in, which can limit Indonesia’s independence. Through BRICS, Indonesia can access collaborative R&D programs with countries like China, India, and Russia, which are actively developing satellite navigation systems (e.g., Beidou, GAGAN, GLONASS), indigenous aircraft manufacturing initiatives, and airport infrastructure technologies suited to emerging markets. These countries are also more open to co-production, local assembly, and licensing agreements. Indonesia’s aerospace industry — led by PT Dirgantara Indonesia — can benefit from exposure to different design approaches and compatible standards. Such cooperation could lessen reliance on a few Western OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and establish a diverse supply network for both civilian and military aviation needs.

Infrastructure and Alternative Financing Opportunities

One of the persistent bottlenecks in Indonesia’s aviation sector has been infrastructure development, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions known as the 3T (Terdepan, Terpencil, dan Tertinggal).

Traditional financing routes — dominated by Bretton Woods institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank — often impose strict conditionalities related to governance, environmental impact, and fiscal prudence. While these safeguards are important, they can delay or disqualify projects that fail to meet rigid procedural benchmarks.

In contrast, BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB) provides a more flexible financing mechanism. Although still maintaining safeguards, the NDB emphasizes local ownership, quicker disbursement timelines, and more adaptable terms of credit. This could be a game-changer for Indonesia’s efforts to fund regional airports, satellite-based air navigation systems, weather radar, and search and rescue (SAR) operations.

Moreover, access to NDB financing could allow Indonesia to pilot next-generation air mobility programs, including seaplane bases, unmanned aircraft corridors, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure — all within frameworks better suited to national development priorities.

Civil-Military Integration and Airspace Sovereignty

Another strategic dimension is the management of Indonesian airspace and Flight Information Regions (FIRs). Indonesia has long aspired to regain full control over several FIRs currently delegated to neighbouring states. Yet progress has been gradual, constrained by technical readiness, diplomatic complexity, and military-civil coordination challenges.

BRICS participation offers new avenues to learn from countries that have achieved FIR sovereignty under contested circumstances, such as India and China. Additionally, joint exercises, simulation training, and technology-sharing initiatives could support Indonesia’s push for integrated air surveillance and radar fusion systems, critical for both safety and national security.

Beyond FIRs, the issue of cybersecurity and data sovereignty in aviation is increasingly important. Partnering with BRICS countries could help Indonesia secure its aviation databases, aircraft tracking infrastructure, and communications networks from foreign interception or unilateral dependencies.

Challenges: Geopolitics, Standards, and Perception

Despite its many potential benefits, Indonesia’s BRICS participation is not without challenges, particularly in the aviation sector.

First, geopolitical alignments within BRICS can complicate consensus-building. For instance, the interests of Russia and China may not always align with those of Brazil, India, or South Africa, let alone Indonesia. In aviation diplomacy, where regulatory alignment is key, diverging priorities could slow progress on standard-setting and interoperability.

Second, while BRICS promotes alternative standards, the global aviation system remains anchored in frameworks defined by ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and other legacy institutions. Integrating BRICS-based practices into this system requires careful navigation to avoid misalignment or duplication.

Third, there is the challenge of international perception. Indonesia must reassure its traditional aviation partners, including the US, EU, and Japan, that BRICS participation complements rather than contradicts existing commitments. Diplomatically, Indonesia must uphold its “independent and active” foreign policy while navigating the optics of deeper ties with Russia or China, especially amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Recommendations: Strategic Steps Forward

To maximize the aviation-related gains from BRICS membership, Indonesia should consider the following steps:

Establish a BRICS Aviation Cooperation Desk within the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate sectoral initiatives and track joint programs.

Leverage NDB for pilot projects, especially in outer island airports, disaster response aviation systems, and satellite navigation services.

Forge technical partnerships with Indian and Chinese air navigation service providers to accelerate domestic capacity-building in air traffic control and aeronautical data services.

Promote joint ventures involving PT Dirgantara Indonesia and BRICS aerospace firms for component manufacturing and aircraft retrofitting.

Develop a long-term aviation diplomacy roadmap that aligns BRICS priorities with Indonesia’s ICAO and ASEAN obligations.

Maintain transparency and multilateral balance to prevent over-dependence on any one bloc or funding source.

Champion inclusive aviation governance, using BRICS as a platform to advocate for fairer global rules on carbon markets, passenger rights, and safety oversight.

A Broader Strategic Vision

Indonesia’s entry into BRICS is a reminder that global governance is evolving. For too long, the developing world’s aviation needs have been addressed through a top-down model dominated by the Global North. With BRICS, Indonesia can help rewrite this narrative — not through confrontation, but through constructive collaboration.

In a world where connectivity is currency, aviation becomes both a tool of influence and an index of inclusion. Indonesia must now rise to the challenge of transforming this new diplomatic opportunity into tangible progress for its skies and its citizens.",https://geotimes.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/geotimes-Indonesias-BRICS-Shift-Opens-New-Runways-for-Global-Air-Cooperation.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:57:34.127918

Melalui program Perhutanan Sosial Sri Wana Lestari, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai menghadirkan pendekatan berbasis komunitas untuk menjaga kelestarian hutan sekaligus mendorong ekonomi masyarakat.

Program ini bukan sekadar tentang bagaimana menanam pohon tetapi dibaliknya ada filosofi lokal Tri Hita Karana, yang mencerminkan harmoni antara manusia, Tuhan, dan alam. Dengan melibatkan Kelompok Tani Hutan (KTH) Banu Giri Lestari, BUMDes Abdi Rahayu dan Poktan Taman Lestari, program Sri Wana Lestari menjadi contoh nyata bagaimana pelestarian lingkungan bisa berjalan beriringan dengan pemberdayaan masyarakat.

Salah satu sosok di balik program adalah Ketua KTH Banu Giri Lestari I Gede Sugiantara. Ia mengungkapkan bahwa program ini telah menekan angka kemiskinan di desa hingga 9,3% serta meningkatkan rata-rata penghasilan anggota KTH menjadi Rp2,2 juta per bulan.

“Semua kegiatan dikelola berbasis konservasi, dengan pendekatan agroforestry dan perlindungan sumber mata air untuk keberlanjutan jangka panjang,” ujar Sugiantara.

Sejak digulirkan, sebanyak 7.896 pohon produktif telah ditanam. Kawasan hutan seluas 76,25 hektar dikelola secara lestari oleh 58 orang anggota KTH. Masyarakat tak hanya menjaga hutan, tapi juga membangun sumber ekonomi baru dengan budidaya madu klanceng, pengembangan produk kakao, hingga wisata edukatif Green Clift yang menyuguhkan keindahan lanskap hutan.

“Tujuan kami bukan hanya merawat hutan tapi menjadikannya sumber kehidupan, kami ingin masyarakat bisa hidup layak tanpa harus merusak alam. Terbukti saat ini, kelompok tani berhasil menjalin sinergi antara konservasi, ekonomi dan nilai-nilai budaya yang luhur. Hal ini dibuktikan dengan munculnya sumber air deras yang disuling dan jual sebagai Air Minum Dalam Kemasan (AMDK) Amara, yang dalam 1 tahun dapat memproduksi sekitar 6.166 galon,” lanjut Sugiantara.

Melalui Sri Wana Lestari, Pertamina menunjukkan bahwa tanggung jawab sosial tidak hanya soal memberi, tapi membangun ekosistem yang tumbuh bersama. Dari bibit pohon yang ditanam hingga harapan yang dirajut di setiap rumah, program ini menjadi simbol perubahan dari desa untuk lingkungan yang lebih lestari.

Vice President Corporate Communication Pertamina Fadjar Djoko Santoso mengatakan Program Perhutanan Sosial ini turut mendukung program ketahanan pangan nasional, yang saat ini menjadi fokus utama Presiden Prabowo Subianto.

“Lewat program ini, kami ingin memaksimalkan potensi lahan hutan agar bisa lebih produktif, terutama dalam meningkatkan hasil pangan bagi Masyarakat,” ungkap Fadjar.

“Sampai saat ini, Program Tanggung Jawab Sosial dan Lingkungan (TJSL) Hutan Lestari Pertamina telah menanam pohon darat dan mangrove lebih dari 8 juta bibit di 337 lokasi. 13 lokasi termasuk dalam program Perhutanan Sosial. Selain itu, program ini telah memberikan manfaat kepada lebih dari 4 ribu orang dan menambah kenaikan ekonomi sebesar 3 miliar rupiah per tahun,” tutupnya.

Program Perhutanan Sosial ini mendukung tercapainya Tujuan Pembangunan Berkelanjutan (SDGs), khususnya dalam hal ketahanan pangan (SDG #2), penanganan perubahan iklim (SDG #13), penguatan ekosistem laut (SDG #14), serta penguatan ekosistem daratan (SDG #15).

The Global Biofuels Alliance aspires to ensure sustainable biofuel production across the Global South, but can it remain unaffected by the sudden shift in global trade dynamics?
The evolving India-Brazil biofuels alliance is emerging as a compelling response to the rapidly shifting global energy and climate geopolitics.
By leading with ambition and inclusivity, India and Brazil can redefine the contours of global biofuel leadership transforming their bilateral dance into a blueprint for the world.","Anchored in shared climate goals and South-South solidarity, the India-Brazil biofuel partnership is fast becoming a blueprint for clean energy transition — one that promises rural rejuvenation, technological exchange, and a reimagined axis of green industrialisation

The current India-US trade relationship is facing renewed strain following the United States’ imposition of a 25 per cent blanket tariff on all Indian imports, effective, August 1, 2025. This move, driven by concerns over India’s high tariffs on agricultural and dairy products, its continued engagement with Russian oil and defense markets, has disrupted the momentum of bilateral trade negotiations aimed at expanding trade to USD 500 billion by 2030. As a result, talks have stalled and key Indian export sectors such as textiles, pharmaceuticals, auto components, and electronics face heightened vulnerability in the US market.

Amidst these tensions, India, the US, and Brazil continue to collaborate through the Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA), launched during India’s G20 presidency in 2023. The alliance is focused on advancing biofuel adoption, including ethanol blending, sustainable aviation fuels, and flex-fuel technologies. India’s ambitions to reach 20 per cent ethanol blending by 2025 align closely with Brazil’s mature biofuel ecosystem and the US’s technological leadership. While the tariff dispute underscores geopolitical and trade frictions, the trilateral cooperation on clean fuels remains a strategic area of convergence, offering a counterbalance to growing protectionist trends, reinforcing shared commitments to energy security and low-carbon growth.

The Global Biofuels Alliance aspires to ensure sustainable biofuel production across the Global South, but can it remain unaffected by the sudden shift in global trade dynamics?

Why biofuels?

Biofuel, as most would understand, is a fuel that is made from plant material or animal waste. On the strategic level for India, the GBA is an extension of the International Solar Alliance, where these two countries are jointly attempting to shape global energy norms from the perspective of developing countries. The initiators of the GBA see this as another strategic step in India’s international relations game plan of promoting the effort to establish energy norms globally from a developing nation’s perspective. For Brazil, it will be a chance to reassert its leadership position in the bioenergy market, more so when completing its outreach for diversification of diplomatic avenues into ties with Global South countries and beyond. It is most likely that the tango between India and Brazil plays out at many levels.

Biofuels are a critical element in the global strategy to fight climate change. They help lower GHG emissions, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, promote sustainable land use, support rural economies, and are necessary for achieving national and international climate goals, especially in hard-to-abate sectors of the economy. The India Brazil collaboration on biofuels is being intensified considering that this partnership, erstwhile on the periphery of biofuel diplomacy, is currently placed at the heart of larger geopolitical shift concerning energy security and climate protection, where a meeting of urban and rural people takes place. This changing focus has put biofuels at the centre of an energy renaissance in the rural world. The people in this narrative are doing a tango and getting down to brass tacks in biosphere unison.

Ethanol, a biofuel primarily derived from sugarcane, is Brazil’s remedy when its hydroelectric plants are under duress, and it is becoming the world’s largest large-scale sugarcane ethanol energy economy. Brazil grows sugarcane in its off-season, allowing both ethanol and sugar production to provide more than 30 per cent of the nation’s car fuel consumption through ethanol. Biofuels can boost rural incomes by creating demand for crops, generating jobs, and encouraging investment in agriculture. They support energy security and climate resilience. However, without safeguards, they may risk food security and environmental sustainability. Will any biofuel model in India based on ethanol mixed with petrol be distinguishable from Brazil?

High Ambition in Policy

Both the countries have high-blending mandates at the policy level. Brazil has had the Fuels of the Future law in force since October 2024, bringing a gradual increase in biodiesel blending, with blending rates increasing from 14 per cent at the start of 2025 to 20 per cent in 2030. At the same time, the Indian Government is furthering its ethanol-blending program with the imposition of a 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol as an interim target, whilst placing compressed biogas and sustainable aviation fuel as key pillars of its energy portfolio. These mandates have strong regulatory frameworks and financial incentives backing them, and they send a signal for medium — and long-term commitment to biofuels as important parts of the national energy policy.

Indian technologists are tapping Brazilian researchers and policymakers in sugarcane-based ethanol and second-generation biofuels to come and work in India and deepen this partnership. However, even as India uses feedstocks like rice straw, maize, and used cooking oil to amplify its biofuel output, the partnership strengthens Brazil’s soybean, oil, and sugarcane portfolio, creating enough diversification to withstand global supply shocks. Now, the two are looking at joint ventures in India and Brazil to build picobiorefinerías or bio-refineries, with Indian companies pumping money into Brazilian infrastructure deals and the other way around. Petrobras, Brazil’s mammoth state-owned energy company, has committed $600 million to biodiesel and biomethane projects in its 2025 derecho plan, while Indian companies like ONGC Videsh and Bharat Petroleum are getting into the business of upstream oil and bioenergy in Brazil.

The biofuel partnership between Brazil and India serves as a case study in South-South cooperation, showing how two developing countries can work together to solve mutual problems in a respectful and cooperative way. Both countries have a lot of experience dealing with the kinds of energy and rural development problems that many African countries face. They are using that experience to promote biofuels as part of a rural development and climate resilience toolkit for those countries. Brazil’s renewed engagement with African countries like Angola and Nigeria, coupled with India’s growing presence in East Africa, allows for a parallel in energy diplomacy that could benefit the trilateral cooperation of the two countries with African nations.

Political Complexities

The dance has its missteps, and the question of feedstock sustainability is no exception. Brazil’s dependence on soybean oil — over 70 per cent of biodiesel in commercial application in Brazil — has caused some raised eyebrows with regard to the Amazon and Cerrado. In the meantime, India is trying to juggle food security with expanding on biofuels as ethanol production from sugarcane and maize is ramped up. Politics about sourcing feedstock in amounts suitable for the kinds of biofuels meant to be of assistance are complex and likely only to heat up further. After all, trade is not just import and export; it is also a matter of conserving and expanding political power.

The world of biofuels knows no friction. It’s a mini-maelstrom of pricing shenanigans, currency swings, and regulatory inequities. The pricing scenario for biodiesel in Brazil, the second-largest producer of biodiesel in the world, has been nothing short of unprecedented. High prices of biodiesel were witnessed in late 2024, garnering a lot of attention as prices went up to about 30 per cent compared to the previous year because of Government mandates and the new crushing dynamics of the soybean industry in South America. In Brazil, biodiesel producers were paid R$6115/m3, whereas the biodiesel sector of India seemed to be frozen, not due to bad weather but due to traffic congestion caused by ethanol production and excessive vehicles on the road.

The evolving India-Brazil biofuels alliance is emerging as a compelling response to the rapidly shifting global energy and climate geopolitics. At a time when dominant economies like China are championing electric vehicles and synthetic fuels, and the United States is reshaping its clean energy architecture through the Inflation Reduction Act, Brazil and India represent a distinct alternative. Rooted in the principles of developmental equity and south-south cooperation, their collaboration articulates a vision of green industrialisation that is inclusive, pragmatic, and reflective of the needs of emerging economies.

What Next?

As the world’s energy landscape becomes increasingly fragmented and competitive, the India-Brazil partnership offers a narrative grounded in mutual resilience, technology exchange, and long-term sustainability. It moves beyond mere trade dynamics to define a new axis of energy diplomacy in the Global South. The forthcoming BRICS Summit in Brasilia presents an opportunity to strengthen this narrative, especially by positioning biofuels within broader discussions on climate finance, innovation, and south-led green transitions. A particularly promising area of collaboration is the aviation sector, which is under growing pressure to decarbonise. With no viable electrification or hydrogen-based alternatives currently feasible for large-scale aviation, Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as a key enabler. Capable of reducing emissions by up to 80 per cent, SAF offers a practical decarbonisation pathway but global production remains limited. Here, Brazil’s advanced ethanol infrastructure and India’s expanding renewable energy base provide a synergistic foundation for joint SAF development, potentially establishing the Global South as a major contributor to aviation sustainability.

The India-Brazil biofuels alliance is thus more than a policy framework, it is a declaration of shared intent and strategic alignment. It signals the emergence of a bilateral compact that not only boosts trade and energy security but also contributes to shaping global norms on sustainable fuels.

As countries contemplate pathways to a low-carbon future, Brazil’s biofuel legislation serves as a pragmatic model an invitation to join a new era of biomass-based energy with clear rules and shared benefits. Moving forward, the alliance must focus on institutionalising its cooperation through joint research platforms, investment in SAF and ethanol infrastructure, and coordinated engagement in multilateral forums such as the Global Biofuels Alliance and BRICS. By leading with ambition and inclusivity, India and Brazil can redefine the contours of global biofuel leadership transforming their bilateral dance into a blueprint for the world.

As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly refinery utilization rate is more than a dry statistical report—it is a seismic barometer of sectoral shifts in the energy transition. As of August 2025, the data reveals a striking trend: utilization rates climbed steadily from 90.5% on August 2 to 93.3% by August 30. While this appears to signal robust refining activity, it masks a deeper structural divergence. A closer examination of historical patterns, fuel price dynamics, and sectoral interdependencies reveals why a utilization rate miss (i.e., a deviation from expected trends) could trigger bearish pressure on the Oil & Gas sector while creating bullish momentum for Passenger Airlines.

The Bear Case: Refinery Utilization and Oil & Gas Margins

Refinery utilization rates are intrinsically tied to refining margins, often measured by the ""crack spread""—the difference between crude oil input costs and the value of refined products like gasoline and diesel. When utilization rates rise, crack spreads typically widen, reflecting strong demand for refined fuels. However, in 2025, this dynamic is being upended.

The recent peak in utilization (93.3%) coincides with a structural decline in demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. Electric vehicle (EV) adoption, now exceeding 18% of U.S. auto sales, has eroded gasoline consumption. Refiners, once flush with margins during peak utilization periods, are now grappling with overcapacity. For example, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes have reported declining orders for refining equipment upgrades, as operators prioritize mothballing older facilities over expansion.

A utilization rate miss—such as a sudden drop below 90%—would exacerbate this bearish narrative. It would signal weakening domestic demand for refined products, further compressing crack spreads and squeezing refining profits. This dynamic is already evident in the Oil & Gas sector's underperformance: the S&P 500 Energy Index has lagged the broader market by 12% year-to-date, as investors price in the long-term erosion of refining margins.

The Bull Case: Airlines and the Fuel Price Tailwind

While the Oil & Gas sector faces headwinds, Passenger Airlines are poised to benefit from the same shifts. As refining utilization stabilizes or declines, gasoline and diesel prices at the pump have remained subdued relative to crude oil prices. This has created a favorable tailwind for airlines, whose fuel costs typically account for 20-30% of operating expenses.

The EIA's historical data underscores this inverse relationship. In 2015, when utilization rates hit 95.1%, gasoline prices spiked $0.36 above crude-linked forecasts, directly cutting into airline margins. By contrast, 2025's utilization rates (93.3%) have kept refining margins in check, with gasoline prices aligning closely to crude oil prices. This has allowed airlines like Delta and American Airlines to lock in fuel savings through hedging strategies, improving net margins by 4-6 percentage points.

Moreover, the energy transition has created a unique arbitrage opportunity. As refiners reduce capital expenditures on ICE infrastructure, they are shifting focus to hydrogen and biofuel projects—sectors where airlines are already investing. For instance, United Airlines' recent $1.5 billion investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production is now more economically viable in a low-refining-margin environment.

Strategic Portfolio Reallocation: The Energy Transition Playbook

The divergence between these sectors demands a strategic rebalancing of energy-related portfolios. Here's how investors can capitalize:

Underweight Oil & Gas Refiners: Refiners operating in overutilized regions (e.g., the Gulf Coast at 93.5% utilization) are increasingly exposed to margin compression. Companies like Valero and Marathon Petroleum are facing pressure to divest non-core assets, which could trigger further valuation declines.

Overweight Industrial Conglomerates: As refining activity shifts toward retrofitting and decarbonization, industrial firms like Caterpillar and 3M are seeing renewed demand for equipment upgrades and emissions-control technologies. These firms are positioned to outperform as refiners prioritize compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) mandates.

Long-Term Positioning in Airlines: With fuel costs stabilizing and demand for air travel rebounding post-pandemic, airlines are entering a phase of margin expansion. Investors should consider ETFs like the iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) or individual stocks with strong hedging strategies.

Short-Term Bets on Energy Transition Plays: The shift from refining to decarbonization creates opportunities in hydrogen infrastructure and carbon capture. Companies like Plug Power and Occidental Petroleum are set to benefit from policy-driven capital flows.

The Unseen Thread: EIA Data as a Sector Rotation Signal

The EIA's refinery utilization data is not just a backward-looking metric—it is a forward-looking signal for sector rotations. A utilization rate miss (e.g., a sustained drop below 90%) would likely accelerate capital outflows from Oil & Gas and into energy transition plays. Conversely, a rate above 93% would reinforce the bear case for refiners but could temporarily benefit automakers reliant on ICE demand.

Investors must monitor this data alongside other indicators, such as the EIA's weekly crude oil inventory reports and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) refining activity assessments. The interplay between these metrics will shape the next phase of the energy transition, offering both risks and opportunities for those attuned to the sectoral shifts.

In a world where fuel price dynamics and utilization rates dictate sectoral fortunes, the EIA's weekly report is no longer just a footnote in energy markets—it is a roadmap for strategic portfolio reallocation. As the energy transition accelerates, the winners and losers will be determined not by crude prices alone, but by the evolving arithmetic of refinery utilization and sector divergence.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 16:56:07.853530

Founded in 2016 by the aerospace engineer Mark Lundstrom, Boulder-based Radia is working to build the WindRunner, a plane big enough to transport super-size wind turbines to onshore locations.

In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.

However, turbines built on land are typically limited to blades of about 70 meters 230ft - a problem chiefly caused by the challenge of transporting the blades along roads not built for such enormous cargo.

Turbines “simply too big” for road infrastructure

“It’s the inability to move big things that is basically the barrier that prevents us from super-sizing onshore wind turbines,” Lundstrom told an interview with the BBC this week.

In Radia’s video explainer, Lundstrom adds: “The turbines are simply too big to get under bridges, through tunnels, around curves.”

Why are bigger wind turbines important?

By enabling the installation of larger wind turbines in on-shore locations, wind farms’ productivity can be multiplied, notes the U.S. Department of Energy.

“Larger rotor diameters allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity,” the agency says.

“A turbine with longer blades will be able to capture more of the available wind than shorter blades - even in areas with relatively less wind.”

WindRunner dimensions - length, wingspan, payload:

According to Radia, the WindRunner will be 365ft in length, with a 261ft wingspan. Compare that to the Boeing 747, which measures a comparatively paltry 250ft in length and has a 224ft wingspan.

The WindRunner will have a payload volume of 272,000ft³, which the company notes is some 12 times greater than that of the Boeing 747.

The WindRunner’s length and payload would also outstrip those of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, so far the largest airplane ever built.

Built in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the An-225 was 275ft long, with a payload bay some six times smaller. The craft was destroyed in 2022, during fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Designed with a flying range of 1,200 miles, the WindRunner will run on sustainable aviation fuel, Radia says, and will be able to land on short, unpaved runways.

“It has the capability of […] landing on dirt within a wind farm,” Lundstrom says. “By doing this, we will be able to create the path to the cheapest energy in the world.”

Per Aerospace Global News, Radia aims to complete its first WindRunner in 2028, before pressing the craft into full service by 2030.

It has secured backing from two big US carriers, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, including a commitment from them to buy aircraft.","The two manufacturers enjoy a near-duopoly in the airliner market, and delays to their flagship green programmes have sounded an alarm on airlines’ plans to get to net zero — adding no additional carbon to the atmosphere — by 2050.

“The airline industry does in my view have a serious intent to meet net-zero targets but faces increased challenges in doing so”, John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said. “Alternative technologies are being pushed further out, which means an increased emphasis on the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which is still in limited supply.”

The delays may also create another obstacle to the planned expansion of Heathrow. The airport said on August 1 that it would “only deliver expansion in a way that is consistent with net zero 2050”. And some analysts believe the hold-up increases the chances of a challenge to Boeing and Airbus from new entrants more eager to take up the environmental mantle.

Aviation is estimated by the International Energy Agency to account for 2.5 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with a slightly greater — 4 per cent — contribution to global warming thanks to the creation of vapour trails. In the UK, it has a greater share of direct emissions: 9 per cent this year, according to the Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent advisers. That share is forecast to grow to 11 per cent by 2030 and 16 per cent by 2035.

That global emissions share is also likely to increase. After a severe decline during the pandemic, flights are now increasing fast. Iata, the airline trade body, has said passenger numbers will grow nearly 6 per cent this year to just under 5 billion and could hit 16 billion by 2050. As other energy-intensive industries find ways to cut their carbon emissions — electricity replacing blast furnaces in steel, new technology for making cement, and electric vehicles for land transport — aviation’s share of total CO₂ could, by some estimates, rise to 20 per cent by 2050.

Carbon-cutting technology for aviation is proving slow to arrive. Most experts think battery-power will be limited to small commuter aircraft, but there are high hopes for hydrogen. Airbus had invested significantly, including a plan to test a hydrogen fuel-cell engine on a modified A380 superjumbo. But it paused work in February, saying progress on “key enablers”, in particular the production of large amounts of hydrogen from renewable energy, was “slower than anticipated”.

Boeing has been less interested in hydrogen, but said the X-66A could lead to a 10 per cent reduction in emissions. When it cancelled the project it said it would instead concentrate on other designs for thinner, more efficient wings.

Neither manufacturer appears in any rush to bring out radical designs. Airbus’s plan to replace its bestselling A320 family of aircraft envisages something familiar to passengers today, albeit with engines that can be powered by conventional fuels or “sustainable” replacements. That plane is unlikely to enter service until 2035 at the earliest, and probably much later.

Boeing, which has been beset by a series of crises in the past year, also appears to be in no hurry. At its quarterly results on July 29, chief executive Kelly Ortberg said: “I don’t think the market is ready yet for a new airplane.”

• Boeing 737 Max 8: which airlines use the plane and is it safe?

Slow progress on alternative technology means airlines’ hopes rest on the rapid introduction of sustainable fuels — hydrocarbons not pumped from the ground, but made from plants or re-used oils, or directly synthesised. However, the current supply is tiny — a mere 0.53 per cent of total aviation fuel worldwide last year, according to Air Transport Action Group (Atag), which brings together airlines, airports and aerospace manufacturers.

Atag’s Waypoint 2050 report concluded that making enough sustainable fuel to hit net zero would require the construction of 5,000 refineries, costing $1.45 trillion over the next 25 years. IBA, the aviation consultancy, has forecast production of sustainable fuels will hit 18 million tonnes a year by 2035 — but that will be 23 million tonnes short of demand.

Environmental campaigners are scornful. “The only serious remedy [to increasing CO₂ emissions] is demand restraint,” Dr Douglas Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said. “Everything else — the nonsensical offset schemes, the utopian technology forecasts and now the implausible optimism surrounding ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel — is primarily a collection of elaborate misdirection techniques.”

If aviation’s emissions do grow as a proportion of the total, Airbus and Boeing could face societal pressure to do more. Nick Cunningham, managing partner at Agency Partners, an aerospace analysis firm, recently published a note on how “complacency” on decarbonisation posed an “existential risk” to the companies.

Cunningham said planemakers were understandably reluctant to make large investments in new technology. “Boeing does not at the moment have the financial resources to develop an all-new aircraft. Airbus has reason to be wary because some of its development programmes — the A380 and the A400M for example — ended up way over budget.”

Cunningham said, however, that carbon reduction is not China’s main goal. “There could be a challenge from China, but for the moment it is concentrating on replacing imports of western aerospace equipment,” he said.

One potential rival to the Airbus-Boeing hegemony is JetZero, a California-based company set up in 2021. It has ambitious plans to build a radical new type of passenger aircraft: a blended wing body, where the wings and fuselage are one smooth shape. The Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber, used by the US Air Force in the recent attacks against Iran, is such a design.

JetZero claims its design could cut emissions in half compared to conventional designs. It has secured backing from two big US carriers, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, including a commitment from them to buy aircraft. The USAF has awarded it a development contract for a potential new transport aircraft.

“JetZero is extremely interesting,” Cunningham said. “The backing it has from airlines and the air force give it credibility, and it has very ambitious production plans. Its design would be more efficient than conventional aircraft, and crucially it would lend itself to a switch to hydrogen fuel when that is adopted.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7a76cc80-d40b-4ce7-a770-c0b6a20a95b8.jpg?crop=2325%2C1308%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:18.379222

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.
Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.
“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.” British farmers facing disaster Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.
This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.","Labour’s “flight tax” on airlines will add more than £50 to the cost of a family holiday within a decade, analysis shows.

Net zero rules introduced by Sir Keir Starmer mean planes must be filled with at least 2 per cent sustainable fuel, which will rise to 10 per cent followed by 22 per cent by 2040.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.

Costs associated with the new levy are expected to reach £4.5 billion by 2035, according to a new analysis by Public First.

This works out at £12.79 per passenger per flight leaving the UK, adding £51.16 to the average overseas holiday taken by a family of four.

The impact of the policy is expected to hit Britons as soon as 2027, with its cost hitting £200 million in that year.

‘Ludicrous net stupid zero’

By 2030, this figure will have ballooned to £1.5 million, the equivalent to £4.64 per passenger per flight – making a holiday for a family of four £18.56 more expensive.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, told The Telegraph: “This is yet another egregious tax on working citizens to pay for the ludicrous net stupid zero. A Reform government will scrap all this nonsense.”

Greg Smith, a Tory transport minister, said: “Labour said the transition to green aviation would cost pennies but now families are being hit with soaring ticket prices to fund Ed Miliband’s net zero experiment.

“It’s not just weekend getaways being priced out. It’s regional airports under threat, tourism on the ropes, and British families paying the price for Labour’s ideological fantasy.

“The truth is net zero by 2050 is impossible without bankrupting our country and Labour’s plan to chase it will ground British families before it ever lands.”

80pc cost could be passed to consumers

The Government’s own impact assessment of the green mandate found that as much as 80 per cent of its cost could be passed on to consumers.

Labour claims the pledge to use more sustainable fuel will support thousands of jobs while cutting the UK’s transport emissions on the way to becoming a “clean energy superpower”.

The figures come as ministers were urged to relax red tape that means SAF cannot currently be made from non-food grade British-grown wheat.

Phil New led the Government’s independent review into the future of SAF and urged it to consider British bioethanol as a credible and scalable option.

Mr New said: “Ethanol made from British-grown milling wheat, which would otherwise be exported as animal feed, can be processed into SAF in a way that meets the emissions reductions required by the UK’s standards.

‘Home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry’

“This is a real opportunity to create a home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry that supports British agriculture, strengthens fuel security and helps us meet our climate ambitions.”

Ben Hackett, managing director at Vivergo Fuels, added: “The UK has the capability today to produce sustainable aviation fuel from home-grown non-food grade wheat – supporting British farmers, reducing carbon emissions, and improving our energy security. But outdated regulations are blocking this from happening.

“It makes no sense that ethanol from British wheat can be blended into petrol for cars, but not used to make jet fuel, especially when other countries are already moving ahead with this technology.”

The analysis by Public First also found the UK could require the output of seven large-scale bioethanol plants by 2035 to meet growing domestic demand for SAF.

Industry leaders fear that excessive reliance on imported cooking oil could hinder progress in growing domestic demand.

Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.

“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.”

British farmers facing disaster

Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.

Under the deal struck by Sir Keir, which has not yet come into force, the US will be able to supply Britain with some 1.4 billion litres of duty-free ethanol.

Vivergo runs the UK’s largest bioethanol plant at Saltend in East Yorkshire, but has warned this will have to close without help given from the Government.

This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The move to greener fuels has been designed to cut emissions while protecting both industry and consumers from excessive cost increases. Any impact on ticket prices is expected to be within the range of normal year to year changes in air fares.

“Our SAF mandate sets out ambitious but achievable targets. Our approach to growing the UK SAF industry will also support skilled jobs in every part of the country, while boosting economic growth and reducing our emissions.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000434587637_17542299168040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:23.074738

One of those countries, Japan, has been one of the U.S.’s most dependable trading partners. That deal was announced July 23 and the White House also announced a pact with Indonesia on July 22.

Japan

Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the U.S. to rebuild and expand core American industries, the White House said. The funds, at Trump’s direction, will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base in five core areas: Energy infrastructure and production; semiconductor manufacturing and research; critical minerals mining, processing, and refining; pharmaceutical and medical production; and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. The White House believes the agreement will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan with an enforceable and transparent trade policy.

The agreement also calls for increased market access for agricultural producers. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75% with a major expansion of import quotas. Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The agreement was applauded by U.S. Meat Export Federation and CEO Dan Halstrom.

“USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the No. 2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork,” Halstrom said. “In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan reinforcing its position as an extremely reliable market.”

According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the two countries, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers, he added.

Indonesia

The Republic of Indonesia agreed to a framework for negotiating an agreement on reciprocal trade, the White House announced. That agreement builds on a longstanding agreement that was first signed in 1996.

Indonesia will eliminate an approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.

The U.S. will reduce to 19% the reciprocal tariff that was started on April 2 on goods originating in Indonesia, and identify certain commodities that are not naturally available or domestically produced in the U.S. for a further reduction in the reciprocal tariff rate.

In the agricultural front, the two countries agreed to address and prevent barriers to U.S. food and agricultural products in the Indonesia market, including exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes, including commodity balance requirements. It provides permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin designation for all applicable U.S. plant products. The agreement recognizes U.S. regulatory oversight, including the listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

Halstrom said Indonesia is a market with incredible potential and could mean as much as $250 million annually for U.S. beef.

“But today, exports are minimal due to numerous trade barriers,” he said. “We are encouraged to see that the highlights detailed in the U.S.-Indonesia joint statement include resolving key issues such as import licensing, the commodity balance policy and Indonesia’s onerous plant-by-plant approval process.

“For both U.S. beef and U.S. pork, these longstanding restrictions have limited exports to Indonesia. Indonesian importers and consumers are demanding U.S. red meat, and we look forward to the swift conclusion of these negotiations and expanded export opportunities.”

The White House also announced that Indonesia has agreed to purchase soybeans, soybean meal, wheat and cotton with an estimated value of $4.5 billion.

Final Verdict The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions.","The UK bioethanol industry is at a crossroads, and investors in renewable energy infrastructure tied to regional agricultural supply chains need to tread carefully. Recent trade policy shifts, particularly the May 2025 U.S.-UK trade deal, have exposed vulnerabilities that could unravel decades of progress in decarbonizing transport and supporting domestic agriculture. For those eyeing the green energy sector, this is a stark reminder that political decisions can be as volatile as stock prices—and just as dangerous if ignored.

The Trade Deal's Blow to Domestic Producers

The removal of the 19% tariff on U.S. ethanol imports, granting duty-free access to 1.4 billion liters annually, has created a perfect storm for UK producers. With U.S. ethanol priced 30–40% lower than UK-produced wheat-based ethanol, companies like Vivergo Fuels and Ensus are staring down the barrel of insolvency. These plants, which process millions of tonnes of UK wheat and corn annually, are not just factories—they're linchpins in a regional agricultural ecosystem.

Consider the ripple effects: Vivergo alone sources wheat from 4,000 farms, producing 420 million liters of ethanol and 420,000 tonnes of high-protein animal feed. If it shuts down, farmers lose a critical market, and the livestock sector faces higher feed costs. The same applies to Ensus in Teesside. This isn't just about energy; it's about food security, rural economies, and the circular economy.

The Structural Weakness of Renewable Energy Supply Chains

The UK's reliance on bioethanol for its Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates is now at risk. The government's plan to increase petrol blending from E10 to E15 by 2026 hinges on domestic production. But with U.S. ethanol flooding the market, that mandate could backfire, accelerating the collapse of local producers.

The SAF mandate—requiring 22% SAF in jet fuel by 2040—is equally precarious. The alcohol-to-jet pathway, which depends on domestic ethanol, will struggle without stable feedstock supplies. Meanwhile, the government's focus on waste-based SAF (like HEFA) overlooks the strategic value of wheat and corn-based ethanol. Investors should ask: Can a country that's losing its ethanol plants realistically meet its climate targets?

Government Support: A Temporary Bandage, Not a Cure

The UK government has offered a £75 million annual subsidy to Vivergo and Ensus through 2026, along with promises to boost ethanol blending mandates. But these measures are stopgaps, not long-term solutions. The subsidies come with strings attached—specifically, they're tied to meeting blending targets that may become unachievable if U.S. imports dominate the market.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer's team has pledged “close engagement” with the industry, but time is running out. Vivergo Fuels is already warning of closure by September 13, 2025, unless urgent action is taken. This uncertainty makes the sector a high-risk bet for investors.

Investment Implications: Where to Watch

For investors, the key takeaway is to avoid overexposure to UK bioethanol companies without clear policy protection. Vivergo Fuels (parent company ABF Sugar) and Ensus are underperformers unless the government intervenes aggressively. Instead, consider hedging with companies in the waste-based SAF sector or renewable infrastructure less tied to agricultural feedstocks.

Monitor the following:

1. Policy Developments: Will the UK raise tariffs on U.S. ethanol or implement a carbon border adjustment mechanism to level the playing field?

2. Blending Mandates: Can the E15 mandate drive enough domestic demand to sustain producers?

3. SAF Incentives: Will the government shift subsidies toward alcohol-to-jet pathways to preserve ethanol supply chains?

The Bigger Picture: Trade vs. Climate Goals

This crisis underscores a fundamental tension in renewable energy policy: the clash between free trade and climate resilience. The UK's pursuit of trade concessions (e.g., steel and car export quotas) came at the expense of its bioethanol industry. Investors should watch how this plays out—will the government prioritize climate goals over trade deals in the future? The answer will shape the next decade of green energy investments.

In the short term, the UK bioethanol sector is a ticking time bomb. But for those willing to navigate the political turbulence, there's potential in companies that adapt to a post-ethanol world—whether through diversification into SAF or partnerships with agricultural tech firms. Just don't expect smooth sailing.

Final Verdict

The UK bioethanol industry is a cautionary tale for investors: even well-intentioned renewable energy projects can crumble under the weight of geopolitical decisions. Stay cautious, keep a close eye on policy shifts, and don't bet the farm on a sector that's already on the brink. For now, the safest play is to wait for clarity—and maybe a government that's ready to stand up to the ethanol titans across the Atlantic.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 15:56:13.009329

The Japanese conglomerate's performance underscores its ability to adapt to volatility while maintaining profitability and long-term growth momentum. For investors seeking stability amid uncertainty, ITOCHU's strategic reinvention and diversified portfolio position it as a compelling case study in resilience-driven value creation.

Resilient Earnings Amid Economic Headwinds

ITOCHU's Q1 2026 results highlight a striking divergence between revenue and profit trends. While total revenue declined 1.1% to ¥3.56 trillion, net profit surged 37% year-on-year to ¥283.9 billion. This outperformance was driven by disciplined asset management and sectoral reallocation. The privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, boosted the Textile segment's profitability by 37%, showcasing ITOCHU's agility in optimizing its portfolio. Similarly, the Food division benefited from Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, while the North American electric-power-related business thrived due to rising electricity demand and maintenance-free operations.

The company's ability to generate robust earnings despite a stronger yen (averaging 144.59 against the dollar) and falling resource prices reflects its strategic focus on high-margin services like logistics and renewable energy. This shift reduces exposure to cyclical commodities and aligns with global decarbonization trends, a critical factor for long-term sustainability.

Strategic Initiatives: Innovation and Diversification

ITOCHU's growth strategy is anchored in three pillars: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), North American energy expansion, and shareholder alignment.

Leading the SAF Revolution

ITOCHU has emerged as a key player in the global transition to cleaner energy. The company completed Phase 1 of a world-first initiative to promote SAF usage, collaborating with partners like ENEOS and Japan Airlines. This effort, validated by third-party verification from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK), paves the way for a scalable Scope 3 environmental value trading system. By diversifying SAF production pathways—Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)—ITOCHU mitigates feedstock volatility and technological risks. Strategic partnerships with Neste and Raven SR ensure access to 2.2 million tons of HEFA-based SAF capacity by 2026 and 200,000 tons of FT-based SAF by 2025, aligning with Japan's 2030 mandate for 10% SAF blending.

North American Energy Expansion

The North American electric-power-related business is a cornerstone of ITOCHU's energy strategy. Q1 2026 saw a 21% progress toward the annual goal, driven by increased electricity sales revenue and the absence of maintenance disruptions. The company is accelerating investments in solar power and renewable development assets, leveraging tax incentives and global demand for clean energy. With plans to expand peripheral services like operation and maintenance, ITOCHU is positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Europe's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, creating complementary markets for its SAF exports.

Shareholder Alignment and Financial Discipline

ITOCHU's commitment to shareholder returns is evident in its 50% total payout ratio, exceeding its own Management Policy target. The company maintained a dividend of ¥200 per share and executed a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already completed in Q1. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical in an environment where interest rate uncertainty and potential recessions in developed markets could strain cash flow. A net debt/EBITDA ratio under 0.6x and ¥1 trillion in planned investments underscore ITOCHU's disciplined capital allocation, ensuring it remains financially robust while funding growth.

Risk Mitigation and Global Positioning

ITOCHU's strategic depth is further reinforced by its proactive risk management. The company has expanded PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA, a sustainability service firm, and deepened its Silicon Valley presence to target tech-driven business development. These moves align with global decarbonization trends and diversify revenue streams. However, risks such as potential U.S. trade policy shifts under a “Trump 2.0” administration and yen strength remain. ITOCHU's focus on renewable energy and high-margin services, however, provides a buffer against these uncertainties.

Investment Outlook

For investors, ITOCHU represents a rare blend of defensive qualities and growth potential. Its current valuation (P/E of ~14x) reflects stable earnings from its core trading business while offering exposure to high-growth SAF and renewable energy markets. Analysts project annual revenue growth of 4% and a 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings, with return on equity (ROE) expected to reach 14% in three years.

Recommendation: ITOCHU is well-positioned to navigate macroeconomic headwinds through its diversified portfolio, innovative strategies, and financial prudence. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition and sustainable logistics should consider a long-term position, with a focus on monitoring the company's North American energy projects and currency risk management. With a target net profit of ¥900 billion for FYE 2026 and a clear path to scaling SAF production, ITOCHU exemplifies how strategic agility can turn uncertainty into opportunity.

In a world where resilience is the new competitive edge, ITOCHU Corporation stands out as a model of adaptive leadership—a company not just surviving, but thriving, in the face of global challenges.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:23.746921

Peningkatan harga tiket disebabkan kebijakan baru Pemerintah Singapura yang mewajibkan penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan ramah lingkungan atau sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dengan komposisi campuran minimal 1 mulai 1 Januari 2026.

Berikut fakta harga tiket pesawat akan naik, pajak karbon masuk hitungan yang dirangkum Okezone, Minggu (3/8/2025).

1. Mulai 1 Januari 2026

""Singapura itu, mulai 1 Januari 2026 itu mandat 1 dengan SAF. Kemudian konsekuensinya, kalau kita belum ada mandat (penggunaan SAF) tetapi pesawat rute internasional kita terbang di wilayah udara lain yang sudah mandat, itu akan kena carbon tax,"" ujarnya saat ditemui pada acara Indonesia Aero Summit 2025 di Jakarta.

Denon menjelaskan, kebijakan Singapura atau negara lain itu akan memicu tambahan beban biaya operasional bagi maskapai, terutama akibat penerapan pajak karbon atau carbon tax yang dikenakan kepada penerbangan yang memasuki atau melintasi wilayah udara negara-negara yang telah menetapkan mandat emisi karbon. Menurutnya, tambahan itu pada akhirnya akan dibebankan kepada penumpang.

2. Tiket Bakal Lebih Mahal

Dengan demikian, tiket pesawat tujuan Singapura dipastikan akan lebih mahal dibandingkan sebelumnya. Kenaikan ini bukan hanya disebabkan oleh harga bahan bakar alternatif yang lebih tinggi, tetapi juga oleh konsekuensi regulasi karbon yang kini semakin ketat di kawasan Asia Tenggara.

""Contohnya kalau sekarang ada rute Garuda ke Amsterdam, itu kan melewati juga sebagian besar Mainland, nah itu akan kena carbon tax, per penumpang,"" tambahnya.

3. Harus Susun Regulasi

INACA mendorong pemerintah untuk menyusun regulasi pengelolaan ruang udara Indonesia. Salah satunya pengenaan carbon tax bagi maskapai asing yang belum menerapkan mandat SAF jika melintasi ruang udara Indonesia.

""Sehingga kalau misalnya ada maskapai lain yang lewat di airspace Indonesia, penerapan pentarifan carbon tax-nya juga harus didesain oleh Indonesia. Karena setiap negara yang dilewati pesawat itu buang karbon di negara mereka, itu kena carbon tax,"" lanjutnya.

4. Transisi Penerbangan Berkelanjutan

INACA mendukung transisi menuju penerbangan berkelanjutan. Di Indonesia sendiri, pemerintah melalui Pertamina dan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) tengah mempersiapkan penerapan bioavtur berbasis used cooking oil (minyak jelantah) dengan target campuran sebesar 3 persen pada 2026.

5. Target Net Zero Carbon pada 2060

Langkah ini dilakukan untuk mendukung target nasional mencapai net zero carbon pada 2060.

6. Penerapan Bahan Bakar

INACA menekankan bahwa penerapan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan harus diikuti dengan strategi distribusi yang efisien dan terdesentralisasi agar biaya tidak melonjak tajam. Jika dikelola dengan baik, penggunaan bioavtur dalam negeri diharapkan dapat menekan biaya operasional maskapai dan menjaga harga tiket tetap terjangkau bagi masyarakat.",https://static.rctiplus.id/media/600/files/fta_rcti/news/images/harga_tiket_pesawat-7bDo_large.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:35.702987

In an unprecedented move towards decarbonizing aviation, Japan Airlines (JAL), ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS Corporation, and a consortium of industry leaders have completed the first phase of a groundbreaking project that aims to foster the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through innovative Scope 3 environmental value trading. This initiative, launched in August 2024, marks a historic step towards achieving more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. The demonstration phase, which ran from August 2024 to March 2025, has set the stage for future expansion, with the goal of significantly reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through the promotion of SAF.

The collaboration among leading companies such as Japan Airlines, ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS, and Narita International Airport Corporation represents a united effort to develop a platform for trading Scope 3 environmental value. This scheme is designed to incentivize companies in the aviation sector to adopt SAF by facilitating the buying and selling of environmental value associated with its use.

Demonstration Test Phase: Outcomes and Key Findings

The Phase 1 demonstration test allowed the participating companies to assess the effectiveness of Scope 3 environmental value trading. Key findings from this phase include the successful establishment of a platform that brought together multiple companies to trade environmental value, the first successful trades through bilateral contracts, and the confirmation of the system’s transparency and reliability, as evaluated by the third-party organization Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).

The demonstration test was a vital first step in proving the viability of Scope 3 environmental value trading as an effective tool in promoting the use of SAF in the aviation industry. The initiative demonstrated that by registering environmental value and trading it among companies, it is possible to create an economic incentive for adopting SAF and other sustainable practices in aviation.

According to the project partners, this phase provided valuable insights into the operational mechanics of the trading system and helped identify potential challenges that need to be addressed in future phases. Despite these challenges, the results from Phase 1 are seen as a significant milestone in advancing the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning.
Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks.
However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer.
Investment Implications For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation.","Japan's ITOCHU Corporation, a global trading giant with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, machinery, textiles, and food, has delivered a Q1 FYE2026 performance that underscores its operational resilience in a turbulent global economy. Despite a 1.1% decline in revenue to ¥3.56 trillion, the company reported a staggering 37% year-on-year surge in net profit to ¥283.9 billion. This divergence between top-line and bottom-line results reveals a strategic recalibration that positions ITOCHU to navigate macroeconomic headwinds while capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Navigating a Fractured Global Market

The first quarter of FYE2026 unfolded against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating exchange rates, and resource price volatility. ITOCHU's ability to boost profits despite these challenges speaks to its structural adaptability. The yen's appreciation and falling commodity prices—iron ore dropped from $111 to $98 per ton, and crude oil fell from $85 to $67 per barrel—eroded margins in its Metals & Minerals segment. Yet, the company offset these pressures through strategic asset management and sectoral reallocation.

A key driver was the privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, which contributed significantly to the Textile segment's 37% profit growth. By consolidating this asset, ITOCHU not only strengthened its direct-to-consumer model but also leveraged lean management practices to enhance profitability. Meanwhile, the Food division, bolstered by Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, demonstrated resilience against inflationary pressures.

The company also navigated U.S. tariff risks with relative success. While the immediate impact of Trump-era trade policies on Q1 was limited, ITOCHU remains vigilant about potential escalation. Its North American electric-power-related business, however, thrived due to rising electricity demand and the absence of maintenance costs, highlighting the value of its renewable energy investments.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns

ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning. The company executed ¥185 billion in investments approved in FYE2025 and added ¥50 billion in new initiatives, including CAPEX of ¥62 billion. These funds are directed toward high-growth areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastics, and logistics innovations. For instance, the launch of PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA—a sustainability service company—aligns with global decarbonization trends, while its Silicon Valley expansion targets tech-driven business development.

Shareholder returns remain a priority. ITOCHU maintained its dividend at ¥200 per share and announced a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already executed by Q1's end. The 50% total payout ratio exceeds its own Management Policy target, signaling confidence in its cash flow generation. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical for investors seeking both growth and income in an uncertain environment.

Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook

While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks. A potential “Trump 2.0” administration could disrupt global trade dynamics, and a recession in developed markets could dampen demand for machinery and energy. Moreover, the yen's strength—averaging 144.59 against the dollar in Q1—continues to pressure resource-based profits.

However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer. Its diversified portfolio limits exposure to any single sector, and its focus on high-margin services (e.g., logistics, renewable energy) reduces reliance on cyclical commodities. The company's 2.2% net profit growth guidance for FYE2026, coupled with a robust balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA <0.6x), suggests a conservative yet ambitious approach.

Investment Implications

For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation. The company's ability to generate strong earnings growth in a volatile environment, coupled with its proactive reinvestment in sustainable and tech-enabled sectors, positions it as a defensive yet growth-oriented play.

However, prudence is warranted. A 50% total payout ratio is ambitious, and any sharp rise in interest rates or a global economic slowdown could strain cash flow. Investors should monitor ITOCHU's progress in its North American energy projects and its capacity to mitigate currency risks.

In a world where global supply chains are increasingly fragmented and environmental regulations tighten, ITOCHU's blend of operational agility and strategic foresight makes it a standout. As it moves through FYE2026, the company's focus on asset optimization, innovation, and shareholder alignment will be key metrics to watch.

For now, ITOCHU offers a rare combination: resilience in the present and a clear-eyed vision for the future. In an era of uncertainty, that is precisely the kind of business model that can outperform.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 21:56:18.385957

""Selama tahun 2024 dan 2025 industri penerbangan nasional masih belum membaik dan masih menghadapi banyak tantangan baik tantangan global maupun nasional,"" kata Ketua Umum INACA Denon Prawiraatmadja dalam keterangan di Jakarta, dikutip Antara, Sabtu, 2 Agustus.

Menurutnya, memanasnya kondisi geopolitik global mempengaruhi berbagai hal dalam industri penerbangan, seperti terganggunya rantai pasok untuk pesawat dan sparepart, serta harga minyak dan kurs rupiah terhadap dolar Amerika Serikat (AS) yang cenderung meningkat.

Di dalam negeri, katanya lagi, dampak pandemi COVID-19, kebijakan serta iklim usaha yang diwarnai persaingan bisnis tajam, juga membuat industri penerbangan belum kembali seperti sebelum pandemi.

Hal itu mengakibatkan jumlah penumpang domestik untuk penerbangan berjadwal selama tahun 2024 stagnan dengan tahun 2023. Selain itu, jumlah pesawat juga turun karena banyak pesawat yang masuk perawatan Repair and Overhaul (MRO) dan kesulitan mendapatkan spareparts.

Menurutnya, terdapat beberapa tantangan penerbangan nasional, baik untuk maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, dan kargo yang harus disikapi bersama stakeholder penerbangan, yaitu regulasi yang kurang fleksibel; risiko nilai tukar rupiah terhadap dolar AS; pengadaan spareparts; hubungan dengan pengelola bandara dan Airnav.

Selanjutnya masalah operasional penerbangan tidak berjadwal (terbang malam, terbang khusus, air ambulance dan lainnya; serta Ilegal charter (penerbangan charter ilegal).

""Diperlukan langkah-langkah strategis jangka pendek, menengah dan panjang, agar tantangan ini bisa segera teratasi dan industri penerbangan pulih seperti sebelum pandemi COVID-19,"" ujar Denon.

INACA berharap pembahasan permasalahan industri penerbangan secara holistik dan komprehensif mulai dari bisnis dan operasional penerbangan sampai dengan hal-hal pendukungnya dengan melibatkan pemerintah lintas kementerian dan lembaga; kalangan bisnis; akademisi; media; dan masyarakat dapat dilanjutkan.

Kedua, dilanjutkan pembahasan upaya peningkatan kondisi finansial maskapai penerbangan baik maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo dan perintis melalui regulasi operasional bisnis penerbangan yang lebih adil

""Ketiga menyelenggarakan konektivitas penerbangan secara komprehensif dengan sistem hub dan spoke baik untuk penerbangan domestik maupun internasional,"" katanya pula.

Keempat melakukan deregulasi terkait proses ekspor-impor sparepart baik yang melekat maupun tidak melekat di pesawat dengan menggunakan Ilustrated Part Catalog (IPC) serta berdasarkan aturan Tokyo Round dari WTC.

Kelima meningkatkan implementasi safety management system (SMS) dan peningkatan safety culture dalam operasional penerbangan dari semua stakeholder, baik itu regulator (pemerintah), operator penerbangan (maskapai, bandara, MRO), dan masyarakat.

""Keenam dibentuknya Dewan Transportation Board bekerjasama dengan moda transportasi lain dan stakeholder terkait untuk mengembangkan transportasi multi moda dalam rangka mendukung pertumbuhan perekonomian nasional Indonesia,"" ujar Denon.

INACA juga berharap peningkatan dukungan pemangku kepentingan di sektor penerbangan terhadap maskapai penerbangan nasional baik berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo, dan perintis.

Dengan begitu dapat meningkatkan konektivitas penerbangan dan menjembatani kesenjangan pembangunan, mendukung desentralisasi, meningkatkan daya saing komoditas lokal, dan meningkatkan fungsi sebagai katalisator bagi pembangunan ekonomi lokal sehingga memastikan tidak ada wilayah Indonesia yang tertinggal.

After five years in deep storage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the final two giants are being readied for service, signaling a renewed era of ultra-luxury and high-capacity air travel.

Etihad Airways is set to reintroduce two more Airbus A380-800 aircraft into its fleet. The move was initially reported by aviation journalist Andreas Spaeth, who identified aircraft A6–APC and A6-APB as the next in line to return to active duty.

Confirmation followed during an Etihad open day held for Wizz Air Abu Dhabi staff in late July 2025. At the event, Arik De, Etihad’s Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer, shared the carrier’s strategy for expanding its A380 operations.

According to the timeline:

A6-APC is scheduled to rejoin the fleet by June 2026

A6-APB will return by January 2027

These two will complement the seven A380s already flying for Etihad, bringing the total to nine by early 2027. One A380, A6-APA, remains in storage but is being parted out and will not return to service.

Etihad’s CEO, Antonoaldo Neves, has expressed a clear long-term vision to keep the A380 flying until at least 2032, bucking the trend of other airlines retiring the type in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. This decision comes as the airline experiences strong demand recovery and expands its global reach.

Currently, Etihad’s A380s serve major international routes from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to destinations including: London (LHR), Paris (CDG), Singapore (SIN), Toronto (YYZ)

A380 service to New York (JFK) was recently dropped due to underperformance, though new long-haul destinations are under review.

Etihad is in full expansion mode. In July 2025 alone, the airline accepted delivery of:

Its first Airbus A321LR (set for commercial service to Phuket starting August 1)

Two Boeing 787 Dreamliners

One Airbus A350-1000

What are the potential factors driving the growth and Key Trends of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Solution Market?

The growth of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) solution market is being driven by a combination of regulatory pressure, environmental consciousness, and advancements in fuel technology. As global and domestic aviation industries face increasing scrutiny over carbon emissions, South Korea is aligning with international initiatives such as ICAO’s CORSIA and the EU's Fit for 55 package. This has led to a push for decarbonization and sustainability within the aviation sector, making SAF a critical component of future-ready operations. Government incentives, including tax credits and subsidies for biofuel production, are encouraging energy companies and airlines to invest in SAF technologies. The rising cost of conventional jet fuel and the economic volatility associated with fossil fuel markets further reinforce the shift toward more stable and environmentally friendly alternatives like SAF. Additionally, strategic partnerships between airlines, refiners, and biotech firms are accelerating the commercialization and local production capacity of SAF, which is essential to meet domestic demand while minimizing dependence on imports.

Key trends shaping the South Korea SAF solution market include the emergence of advanced feedstock technologies, such as waste oils, algae, and municipal solid waste, which provide more sustainable and scalable sources for fuel production. Technological innovation in hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and alcohol-to-jet pathways is enhancing fuel performance and reducing lifecycle emissions, making SAF more viable for long-haul and international flights. The market is also witnessing increasing engagement from major Korean carriers who are committing to net-zero targets and trialing SAF-blended flights, often in partnership with global sustainability coalitions. Furthermore, the growth of green airport infrastructure and carbon offset programs is creating a broader ecosystem to support SAF adoption. These developments, coupled with a growing public and corporate emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance, are positioning the SAF solution market as a pivotal sector in South Korea’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

In South Korea, the growth of ESG-focused market research is being propelled by a combination of regulatory, economic, and cultural factors. The South Korean government has introduced stringent ESG disclosure mandates, requiring large companies to publish ESG reports by 2025. This policy shift has prompted a surge in demand for data-driven ESG insights and compliance frameworks. Additionally, the country’s powerful conglomerates, or chaebols, face increasing scrutiny from investors and the public, driving them to enhance transparency, environmental stewardship, and governance standards—areas where market research plays a critical role. Investor influence, particularly from institutions like the National Pension Service (NPS), is another major growth driver, as ESG principles become central to capital allocation. South Korea’s export-heavy economy is also responding to international ESG norms, especially in light of EU carbon border taxes and global supply chain expectations.

Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy.","Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) has always been a barometer of the energy and infrastructure sectors. Its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, however, reveals a company navigating a turbulent landscape. Revenue of $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.43 fell short of historical benchmarks, with adjusted EBITDA declining 42% year-over-year to $96 million. Yet, beneath these figures lies a story of strategic recalibration and long-term positioning in megatrends that could redefine global energy systems. For investors, the question is not whether Fluor is struggling, but whether its resilience and adaptability can unlock value in a world increasingly defined by decarbonization and digital transformation.

Headwinds and Hurdles: A Q2 in Context

Fluor's Q2 results reflect the dual pressures of sector-specific challenges and macroeconomic headwinds. The Energy Solutions segment, once a cornerstone of profitability, saw profits plummet from $75 million in Q2 2024 to $15 million, driven by cost overruns on three infrastructure projects and an unexpected $31 million arbitration ruling. Meanwhile, the Mission Solutions segment, while posting a $35 million profit, faced a temporary stop work order on a key airfield project.

The Urban Solutions segment, which reported a modest $29 million profit, has been particularly vulnerable to subcontractor errors and project delays. Fluor's response—strengthening execution teams and taking legal action against underperforming partners—signals a recognition of operational fragilities. Yet, these issues are symptomatic of a broader industry-wide struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures.

Strategic Resilience: The Long Game in Energy Transition

While the Q2 numbers are sobering, Fluor's long-term value proposition hinges on its alignment with the energy transition. The company's $28.2 billion backlog—80% reimbursable—provides a critical buffer against short-term volatility. This includes high-margin, long-term contracts in hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture, sectors poised for explosive growth.

The LNG Canada project, now shipping its first cargo after achieving Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) for Train 1, exemplifies Fluor's ability to deliver complex, capital-intensive projects. The proposed phase 2 expansion, which could double the facility's size, underscores its relevance in a world increasingly reliant on cleaner energy sources. Meanwhile, Fluor's 51% stake in NuScale Power—a leader in small modular reactors (SMRs)—offers a unique advantage in the nuclear renaissance. A $3.2 billion pretax mark-to-market gain from NuScale in Q2, though non-recurring, highlights the potential of this asset to generate long-term value.

Fluor's foray into green hydrogen and carbon capture further cements its role in the energy transition. The company's expertise in converting existing facilities into renewable fuels production sites—such as the former Come By Chance refinery—positions it to capitalize on the shift toward sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Additionally, Fluor's patented Econamine carbon dioxide recovery technology is being deployed in projects like the Albemarle Lithium Conversion Project, aligning with global net-zero targets.

The Infrastructure Imperative: A $57 GW Opportunity

The infrastructure segment remains a double-edged sword for Fluor. While cost overruns and execution challenges have dented profitability, the underlying demand for infrastructure is robust. By 2030, data centers alone are projected to drive 44 GW of additional energy demand, much of it to be met by renewables. Fluor's work on colocation data centers in India and its partnerships with tech firms to deploy AI-optimized power systems position it to benefit from this surge.

However, Fluor must address its operational execution risks. The company's revised 2025 guidance—adjusted EBITDA of $475–525 million and operating cash flow of $200–250 million—reflects a more cautious outlook. Share repurchases have been scaled back to $450–500 million for the year, a sign of fiscal prudence in uncertain times. For investors, the key will be whether Fluor can stabilize its infrastructure segments while accelerating its energy transition bets.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Caution and Opportunity

Fluor's Q2 results underscore the challenges of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in a high-inflation environment. Yet, its strategic focus on energy transition and digital transformation—through tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI-driven predictive analytics—positions it to outperform in the long run. The company's $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, coupled with a manageable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.75, provides flexibility to weather near-term headwinds.

For investors, the path forward is nuanced. Fluor's revised guidance and cash flow challenges suggest caution in the short term. However, its backlog, energy transition expertise, and NuScale stake offer compelling long-term upside. A prudent approach would involve a staggered entry into the stock, with a focus on its exposure to hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture—a $2.5 trillion global market by 2030. Historically, a simple buy-and-hold strategy following Fluor's earnings releases has shown promising results, with a 57.14% win rate over three days, 71.43% over ten days, and 78.57% over thirty days, peaking at a 10.47% return on day 59.

Conclusion: A Company at the Crossroads

Fluor Corporation stands at a crossroads. Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy. While the near-term outlook is cautious, the company's alignment with megatrends like decarbonization, AI-driven efficiency, and green hydrogen offers a compelling narrative for long-term investors. For those willing to navigate the volatility, Fluor represents a unique opportunity to bet on the future of energy—one modular reactor, one carbon capture project, and one data center at a time.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:56:24.396425

This decision, driven by an irreconcilable valuation gap with Air Europa's owners, reflects a broader shift in strategic priorities and underscores the mounting risks facing investors in a sector grappling with financial, regulatory, and environmental headwinds.

A Failed Bid and the Valuation Dilemma

Air France-KLM's €300 million offer for 51% of Air Europa—a valuation of roughly €600 million—was dismissed as insufficient by the Hidalgo family, who valued a 25% stake at the same amount (implying a €960 million total valuation). This discrepancy highlights the challenges of aligning expectations in a market where recovery trajectories remain uncertain. For Air France-KLM, the decision to exit the race was a pragmatic one, avoiding a costly stalemate with stakeholders unwilling to compromise. However, it also signals a recalibration of appetite for large-scale acquisitions in an environment where capital allocation must now balance growth ambitions with profitability pressures.

The airline's repeated attempts to secure a stake in Air Europa—from a 2019 bid derailed by Iberia's interest to a 2021 partnership with Delta Air Lines—underscore the strategic value of Madrid-Barajas as a hub for transatlantic and Latin American routes. Yet the failure to finalize a deal now shifts the spotlight to Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines, both of whom are reportedly circling the Spanish carrier. This dynamic illustrates the intensifying competition for market share in a fragmented industry, where access to key hubs and route networks remains a critical differentiator.

Post-Pandemic Consolidation: Strategic Gains and Structural Risks

The European airline sector is undergoing a wave of consolidation, driven by the need to counteract the pandemic's long-term effects, including reduced consumer demand, higher fuel costs, and the transition to sustainable aviation. Lufthansa's integration of ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's fleet modernization with A350s and 787-10s are emblematic of this trend. These moves aim to enhance unit revenue, reduce costs, and align with 2030 sustainability targets. However, the sector's gains are tempered by systemic risks that investors must scrutinize.

One such risk is the soaring cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is now 4.2 times pricier than conventional jet fuel. While European carriers are investing in SAF partnerships, scaling production will require regulatory incentives and technological breakthroughs. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have delayed aircraft deliveries, pushing the average fleet age to 15 years and constraining capacity growth. These constraints are compounded by CORSIA compliance costs, which could drain €1 billion from the sector in 2025 alone.

Regulatory scrutiny further complicates consolidation efforts. The European Commission's evolving merger framework—combining route-based and airport-based market definitions—has raised the bar for approvals. For example, the EC's rejection of the Connect Airways/Flybe merger hinged on the inability to transfer valuable take-off and landing slots, a hurdle that Air Europa's bidders must now navigate. With Brexit-era regulatory duality (e.g., UK Competition and Markets Authority involvement), the path to cross-border deals is fraught with legal and political uncertainties.

Investment Implications: Balancing Resilience and Volatility

Despite these challenges, the sector offers compelling opportunities for investors who can discern resilience amid volatility. The European airline industry's net profit margin improved to 4.3% in 2025, outpacing historical averages in the context of higher operating costs. Low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air have accelerated capacity expansion, operating at 105.2% of 2019 levels, while legacy carriers are leveraging premium offerings (e.g., Lufthansa's Allegris brand) to capture higher-yielding passengers.

However, investors must remain cautious. Sudden spikes in fuel prices, geopolitical shocks, or regulatory overreach could erode margins swiftly. For instance, Air France-KLM's recent operating profit of €736 million in Q2 2025 masks underlying fragility: a 2.4% increase in unit revenue per ASK is modest against a backdrop of rising SAF and CORSIA costs. Similarly, Lufthansa's 27% year-on-year profit growth is contingent on maintaining cost discipline and navigating aircraft delivery delays.

For investors, the key is to adopt a diversified approach. Strategic alliances—such as Lufthansa's stake in ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's investment in SAS—offer a safer path to expansion than outright acquisitions. Additionally, companies positioned in premium and intercontinental markets (e.g., British Airways, Air France) are better insulated against price-sensitive demand shifts.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

Air France-KLM's exit from the Air Europa bid is a microcosm of the European airline industry's broader transformation. While consolidation remains a strategic imperative, the sector's risks—ranging from regulatory hurdles to sustainability costs—demand a measured approach. Investors who prioritize flexibility, sustainability alignment, and regulatory foresight will be better positioned to capitalize on the sector's long-term potential. In a market where the only certainty is uncertainty, adaptability will be the ultimate differentiator.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 14:56:11.616668
