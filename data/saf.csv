The deal is aimed at helping the airline move closer to its environmental goals, including reducing emissions and increasing the use of cleaner fuels, reports ESGtoday.

Under the agreement, the SAF provided by EcoCeres is expected to reduce British Airways’ fuel lifecycle carbon emissions by around 400,000 metric tonnes. That’s equivalent to the emissions from flying approximately 240,000 economy class passengers on return trips between London and New York.

EcoCeres, which specializes in producing biofuels and bioproducts from biomass, creates SAF from 100% waste-based materials like used cooking oil. This fuel offers a carbon emission reduction of up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“We are proud to partner with British Airways in this strategic agreement to jointly tackle greenhouse gas emissions in aviation,” said Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres. “Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership shows our focus on offering fuel solutions that help the aviation industry meet its climate goals.”

British Airways’ parent company, International Airlines Group (IAG), has committed to using 10% SAF by 2030—equivalent to 1 million tonnes of fuel per year—and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. In 2023, IAG’s airlines used about 12% of the global SAF supply and have already secured one-third of the SAF needed to meet their 2030 target.

Carrie Harris, British Airways’ Director of Sustainability, highlighted the role of SAF in the airline’s broader climate efforts: “In 2024, SAF made up 2.7% of our total fuel use and has helped us cut our carbon intensity by 13% since 2019. This new agreement with EcoCeres is another important step toward our goal of reaching net zero by 2050.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2025-07-01 13:10:10.701984

This article cuts through the noise to show you what's actually happening with sustainable aviation; from the fuel breakthroughs that are scaling faster than expected to the quantum-powered simulations that are revolutionizing how we optimize flight operations.

You'll walk away with a clear picture of where the industry stands and what tools are making the biggest difference right now.

Let's dive into the technologies and strategies that are actually moving the needle on aviation sustainability.

The Environmental Impact of Aviation

Emissions Breakdown

Aviation accounts for about 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions. Roughly 915 million tonnes annually as of 2019. That might sound modest, but here's the kicker: aviation emissions have surged 150% since the 1990s, driven by our insatiable appetite for air travel. The industry is growing fast, and without intervention, these numbers would keep climbing.

But CO₂ isn't the whole story when it comes to aviation's climate impact. NOx emissions, water vapor, and those wispy contrails you see streaking across the sky all contribute to warming effects. These non-CO₂ factors can actually double or triple aviation's total climate contribution compared to CO₂ alone.

Industry Comparison

Want some perspective on where aviation sits in the emissions landscape? Here's how it stacks up:

Shipping: About 3% of global emissions—slightly higher than aviation but serving different transport needs

Road Transport: Around 12% of global emissions—cars and trucks still dominate the transport sector

Power Generation: Roughly 25% of global emissions—the biggest single contributor by far

Buildings: About 6% of global emissions—including heating, cooling, and construction

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Its Potential

What Is SAF?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is chemically nearly identical to conventional jet fuel, but it's produced from renewable resources instead of fossil crude oil. Think of it as a drop-in replacement, you can use it in existing aircraft engines without modifications, which is why airlines love it.

The magic happens in how it's made: from waste cooking oil, agricultural residues, algae, or even captured carbon dioxide.

SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. The key word here is ""lifecycle""—this accounts for everything from feedstock production to combustion in the engine.

Current Usage & Barriers

Electric and Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft

Electric Aviation

Electric aircraft are already taking off—literally—for short regional flights and pilot training. Companies like Eviation and Heart Aerospace have electric planes in testing that can handle 200-500 mile routes with 9-19 passengers. The technology works beautifully for these shorter hops, offering near-zero emissions and significantly lower operating costs.

But here's the reality check: battery weight and energy density remain major limitations. Current lithium-ion batteries are still too heavy for long-haul flights, though breakthroughs in solid-state batteries could change that equation within the next decade.

Hydrogen Power

Hydrogen aircraft burn hydrogen fuel cells or direct combustion engines, producing only water vapor as exhaust—no CO₂ at all. Airbus is leading the charge with their ZEROe concept aircraft, targeting commercial hydrogen flights by 2035. The technology is promising for medium-haul flights up to about 2,000 miles.

The infrastructure challenge is massive, though: airports need entirely new fuel storage, handling, and distribution systems. Hydrogen also requires about four times the storage volume of jet fuel, which means significant aircraft redesigns.

Expected commercial timelines look like this:

2025-2027: Regional hydrogen aircraft (9-19 seats) enter service

2030-2032: Short-haul hydrogen planes (50-100 seats) begin commercial operations

2035-2040: Medium-haul hydrogen aircraft (100+ seats) reach market maturity

Operational Improvements and Carbon Offsetting

Smarter Flight Operations

Airlines are getting incredibly sophisticated about operational efficiency—optimizing flight paths, reducing aircraft weight, and using AI to minimize fuel burn. Modern flight management systems can calculate the most fuel-efficient routes in real-time, accounting for weather, air traffic, and aircraft performance. Some airlines are seeing 3-5% fuel savings just from smarter route planning.

BQPSim's quantum-inspired simulation tools are revolutionizing this space by helping airlines optimize operations at unprecedented scale and speed.

Our QIEO-powered solvers can process complex multi-variable optimization problems—like simultaneous route planning, crew scheduling, and maintenance coordination—up to 20 times faster than classical methods.

This means airlines can make real-time adjustments that reduce fuel usage and minimize emissions across their entire fleet operations.

Weight reduction is another big win: removing just one pound from an aircraft can save about $3,000 in fuel costs annually. Airlines are switching to lighter seats, digital manuals instead of paper, and even redesigning meal service equipment.

Airport Sustainability

Airports are becoming powerhouses of renewable energy adoption, with solar farms and wind installations becoming standard features. Denver International Airport, for example, generates enough solar power to offset 6% of its total energy consumption.

Ground support equipment is rapidly electrifying—those baggage tugs and aircraft pushback vehicles you see on the tarmac are increasingly battery-powered.

Here are some standout airport sustainability initiatives:

Copenhagen Airport: Carbon-neutral since 2009, now targeting carbon-negative operations by 2030

San Francisco International: Zero waste to landfill program and 100% renewable electricity

Amsterdam Schiphol: Installing massive heat pump systems to eliminate natural gas usage

Seattle-Tacoma International: Using biofuels for ground vehicle fleets and sustainable construction materials

Carbon Offsets

Carbon offsets let passengers and airlines invest in projects that remove or prevent CO₂ emissions elsewhere—like reforestation, renewable energy projects, or direct air capture facilities.

The idea is simple: if you can't eliminate your flight emissions, you can pay to eliminate an equivalent amount somewhere else. Many airlines now offer offset programs at checkout, and some build offsetting into their ticket prices automatically.

But here's where it gets tricky: offset quality varies dramatically, and many projects don't deliver the promised emissions reductions. Critics argue that offsets can become a way to avoid making harder changes to actual operations.

Regulatory and Industry-Wide Commitments

International Agreements

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) is the world's first global market-based measure for any industry sector. Starting in 2021, it requires airlines to offset emissions growth above 2020 levels through verified carbon credits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) oversees the program, which covers about 77% of international aviation activity.

CORSIA is designed as a bridge measure while the industry develops longer-term sustainability solutions. It's not perfect, but it creates economic incentives for airlines to invest in cleaner technologies and operations.

Airline and Manufacturer Pledges

The industry has made some bold commitments that seemed impossible just a few years ago:

United Airlines: Net zero by 2050 without relying on traditional carbon offsets

Airbus: Hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft in service by 2035

Boeing: Commercial aircraft and services compatible with 100% SAF by 2030

Delta Air Lines: $1 billion investment in carbon neutrality initiatives over 10 years

JetBlue: Net zero emissions by 2040—10 years ahead of the industry target

Rolls-Royce: All new aircraft engines compatible with 100% SAF by 2023

Role of Governments

Governments are stepping up with both carrots and sticks to accelerate aviation sustainability. The EU's RefuelEU Aviation regulation mandates minimum SAF blending starting at 2% in 2025 and ramping to 70% by 2050. The US Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for SAF production, making it more economically viable for producers.

R&D funding is flowing into breakthrough technologies: NASA's Advanced Air Mobility program is investing hundreds of millions in electric and hydrogen aircraft development. The European Union's Clean Aviation partnership has committed €4.1 billion to sustainable aviation technologies through 2030.

Conclusion

Here are the three key takeaways that matter most for aviation's sustainable future:

SAF is the near-term game-changer: Despite current production challenges, it's the most viable path to significant emissions reductions before 2035

Operational optimization delivers immediate wins: Quantum-powered simulation tools and AI-driven flight management are already reducing fuel consumption today

Long-term solutions require coordinated investment: Electric and hydrogen aircraft show promise, but success depends on infrastructure development and regulatory support

Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending.
We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.","Having earlier worked in this domain in India, how do you see the country’s SAF ecosystem?

I have witnessed this ecosystem for more than 10 years in India. I’d say India is headed in the right direction and should do fine in meeting the initial requirements. Interestingly, India wants to come up with its tailor-made policies which can help its own ecosystem. The country has announced its intent to have time-bound SAF blending targets. But we are yet to see a firm roadmap and the implementation plan. Various Indian energy companies are working on SAF projects. These companies have always come forward to do what is required by the government and international commitments. So, I’m positive about India. The question is would India be happy just doing the bare minimum to meet mandates and requirements? Or does it want to be ahead of the curve and start making SAF not just for Indian airlines, but also for international airlines operating to India? There is enough ethanol supply in the country, and some of it can be diverted to make SAF… India wants to export ethanol, and similarly, SAF also presents a similar opportunity. There can be a ‘make in India for the world’ opportunity in SAF. India can potentially manufacture 40 million tonnes of SAF by 2050.

What is it that India should do to meet SAF requirements as well as become an SAF manufacturing hub?

India should prioritise feedstock for the production of SAF without waiting further, leverage the existing refining capability, invest in the research and innovation and new technologies. Funding should be made available to projects as well as the feedstock aggregation supply chains. It also needs to be ensured that the SAF manufactured in India meets all sustainability certification criteria, and that needs to start now, not when the plants are ready for production.

Europe already has SAF blending mandates which have come much before CORSIA’s mandatory phase kicks in (from 2027). Is it a move in the right direction?

Mandates and incentives need to come together in the right proportion. While there is already a mandate in Europe, the fundamental question is about the ecosystem, is it ready? That ecosystem readiness was not there, and in such a scenario, mandates aren’t going to really be effective. Much of the SAF being used in Europe is coming from different continents. Does it even make sense, considering long-haul transportation of the fuel itself would have a high carbon footprint? That is why we are asking for incentives to be brought in so that the local ecosystem is prepared with enough domestic production.

Why does IATA seem to be opposed to the way Europe is going about SAF mandates?

What airlines are being charged for SAF in Europe is not on a cost-plus basis. They are being charged exorbitant compliance fees and there is no transparency in the cost structure. We don’t understand what is the rationale behind these high numbers. We estimate that this non-transparent compliance fee is adding an additional $1.7 billion to the cost of SAF for airlines in Europe on top of the cost of SAF, which itself is quite high. It was already a supply-constrained market and then you (Europe) introduced mandates, which essentially means that the airline is bound to buy SAF at any price, or be penalised…Also, our position on SAF is that it should be feedstock agnostic and technology neutral. All technologies should compete, and the market forces would lead to the best and the most efficient ones being picked up. But Europe has put a sub-mandate for the power-to-liquid (PTL) pathway for SAF production. That puts other pathways and technologies (like alcohol-to-jet, which various companies are working on) at a disadvantage.

Unlike what is happening in Europe, the US is seen as a success story on SAF use. What did they do differently?

The US provided incentives around the value chain. In one sense, Europe and the US are very similar, in that they provided a lot of funding and research for these technologies to mature. But the US went a step ahead. They provided production-linked incentives, they subsidised the feedstock, gave other incentives that led to the SAF feedstock supply chain being streamlined there, etc. Then there were tax credits for SAF production and blending. Additionally, apart from the central or federal incentives, some US states also had their own incentive plans. Many of the SAF facilities also need hydrogen, so the US also provided some incentives for green hydrogen production. Essentially, they worked on bits and pieces across the SAF value chain.

Are US-like incentives the answer for boosting SAF production? Is it something that can easily be replicated in other parts of the world?

There is enough biorefinery capacity around the world. The question is, how can governments provide the right incentives for these biorefineries to switch their production in the favour of SAF. A biorefinery is not built specifically for renewable diesel or SAF for that matter. These capacities can swing very quickly to produce SAF. We can have sufficient production of SAF to meet the airlines’ demand—voluntary as well as the mandates. Governments should seriously look at incentives for SAF production, like facilitating offtake, providing subsidies, etc… Let’s take the example of solar and wind in India and elsewhere. Governments provided production-linked incentives, tax holidays, and subsidies. We need the same story in the SAF ecosystem.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/07/Untitled-design-6.jpg,N,,2025-07-01 13:10:16.816300

UK and global SAF production remains extremely limited, increasing the risk of missing mandate targets, according to the Climate Change Committee.
Roger Tyers, T&E UK’s Aviation Policy Manager advised, ""The UK Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) bill is a welcome world-first.
It will create a revenue certainty mechanism, which will be vital to create investor confidence and kick-start domestic SAF production.
Consider e-SAF production as a key energy-intensive industry, as outlined in the recent industrial strategy, and eligible to benefit from lower electricity costs.","To reduce aviation emissions, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has a key immediate role to play, alongside other longer-term measures. SAF covers a range of lower-carbon alternatives to conventional aviation kerosene. Unlike hydrogen or battery powered aircraft, SAF can be used immediately in existing aircraft as a ‘drop in’ fuel, without needing to adapt fuel delivery infrastructure.

To support the shift to SAF, the UK Government has already created a SAF mandate. From January 2025, this requires fuel suppliers to use a minimum proportion of SAF in the UK aviation fuel mix, rising from 2% in 2025 to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040.

UK and global SAF production remains extremely limited, increasing the risk of missing mandate targets, according to the Climate Change Committee. Major oil companies remain largely absent from the sector, which is dominated by start-up projects often viewed as high-risk by private investors. To address these barriers, , the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill to parliament in May 2025.

The bill will create a ‘revenue certainty mechanism’ (RCM) to provide financial reassurance to investors in UK SAF plants, by creating a guaranteed price for SAF, known as the strike price. If the market price falls below this strike price, the SAF producer receives a top-up payment to cover the difference. Conversely, if the market price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays back the difference. The RCM is the first of its kind in the world and is a welcome innovation, especially as it will be funded by a levy on fuel suppliers under the ‘polluter pays’ principle, rather than by taxpayers.

However, not all SAF types are equally sustainable or scalable; government legislation should reflect this.

E-SAF—synthetic fuel made from air-captured carbon and renewable hydrogen—has the greatest decarbonisation potential, cutting lifecycle emissions by over 90% and avoiding land-use impacts and feedstock constraints of other SAFs. Only e-SAF can meet long-term aviation demand sustainably and at scale.

Roger Tyers, T&E UK’s Aviation Policy Manager advised, ""The UK Government's Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) bill is a welcome world-first. It will create a revenue certainty mechanism, which will be vital to create investor confidence and kick-start domestic SAF production.

The Government must now earmark part of the revenue support toward the production of synthetic e-SAF - the most scalable and sustainable form of SAF. This will be good for energy security, economic growth, exports and UK jobs in the production of a fuel of the future. Otherwise there is a real risk that RCM funding will flow only to less sustainable biofuel projects.""

UK and EU airline mandates will soon drive demand for e-SAF. With global competition expected for limited supply, imports alone won’t suffice. The RCM offers a chance to secure UK-produced e-SAF, helping meet both domestic targets and international demand. Since the UK currently imports over 60% of its jet fuel, domestic e-SAF production could retain value and reduce dependency on foreign petrostates.

The ensure the RCM is effective, the government should implement the following measures:

Amend the SAF bill so that it explicitly commits a proportion of RCM support to e-SAF projects - at least enough to enable production to meet the SAF Mandate e-SAF quota of around 65,000 tonnes of e-SAF in 2030, equating to one large plant.

Consider e-SAF production as a key energy-intensive industry, as outlined in the recent industrial strategy, and eligible to benefit from lower electricity costs.

In June 2025, over 130 organisations—including T&E, NGOs, investors, and e-SAF producers—signed a joint appeal urging the government to use the RCM to back e-SAF production. This would secure the UK a ‘first mover’ advantage, boost energy security, and support jobs and exports. Without such support, the bill and RCM risk being a significant missed opportunity.",https://www.transportenvironment.org/uploads/images/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/Aviation-fuels-and-climate-plan.png?mtime=1714401411,N,,2025-07-01 14:10:43.928765

A key initiative driving this growth is the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50%–80% and create over 3,500 jobs. The first SAF-powered flight is scheduled for late 2025, with broader implementation in 2027.

Despite ongoing supply chain disruptions, constrained capacity has led to higher load factors, increased fares, and improved profitability for some airlines, according to John Grant, chief analyst, OAG.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) projects US$36 billion in global airline profits for 2025, with a net margin of 3.7%. While still low for a capital-intensive industry, the outlook is bolstered by steady growth in Latin America, driven largely by low-cost carriers.

Grant noted that, despite global economic uncertainty and a forecasted slowdown in GDP growth from 3.3% in 2024 to 2.5% in 2025, the aviation industry’s performance in the first half of 2025 has exceeded expectations. Strong third-quarter results are anticipated, supported by cost savings and financial stability.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-06/avion-143-517x578.jpg?h=e0ece374&itok=qTqIiOoA,N,,2025-07-01 13:10:19.867074

The move aligns with the United Nations International Civil Aviation Organization’s (ICAO) global emissions reduction plan, which will become mandatory in 2027. Under the new guidelines, airlines operating international flights involving Turkey will be required to use enough SAF to meet the 5% reduction target. Fuel suppliers and oil refiners will also be expected to play their part.

Jet fuel producers in Turkey, including Tupras and Socar, will be required to begin SAF production. Tupras, the country’s largest oil refiner, plans to start producing 20,000 metric tons of SAF in 2026 and aims to scale up to 400,000 tons with the construction of a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision. Local biofuel company DB Tarimsal Enerji also plans to build a new facility to produce 100,000 tons of SAF.

According to the civil aviation authority, a minimum share of SAF must be loaded within Turkey—airline operators will be required to load 90% of their SAF for international flights at Turkish airports. Fuel suppliers that fail to meet the new targets will face penalties, the authority added.

The aviation sector is currently responsible for about 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. Turkey’s push toward SAF comes amid a broader effort to reduce emissions and align with international environmental standards.

Built for the future of sustainable aviation “The E2 is central to our strategy to build a modern, efficient fleet with strong performance.
SAS continues to strengthen its overall network and international reach while enhancing connectivity between regional cities and global destinations through more seamless and sustainable operations.","Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) has entered into an agreement to acquire 45 Embraer (NYSE: ERJ; B3: EMBR3) E195-E2 aircraft, with purchase rights for an additional 10 aircraft — the largest SAS jet order direct from a manufacturer since 1996. This milestone agreement supports SAS’ long-term fleet renewal strategy, which is focused on increasing efficiency, reducing emissions, and unlocking future growth opportunities from its global hub in Copenhagen as well as across its Scandinavian and international network.

The first aircraft deliveries from Embraer are scheduled to begin in late 2027, with further deliveries extending over approximately four years. Excluding purchase rights, the value for the order is approximately US$4 billion.

“This is a defining moment for SAS,” says Anko van der Werff, President & CEO, SAS. “The Embraer E195-E2 is a world-class aircraft, combining outstanding performance with excellent fuel efficiency and comfort. This aircraft is key to enabling future growth and improved connectivity across Scandinavia and beyond. We’ve taken the time to make the right decision — and this major investment reflects our confidence in the future and the strength of the agreement we’ve secured.”

The E195-E2 will play a vital role in optimizing SAS’ operations and enhancing connectivity across Scandinavia and Europe. Its size and range are ideally suited to complement SAS’ existing fleet and route structure, allowing for more frequencies, better network flexibility, and lower trip costs.

Built for the future of sustainable aviation

“The E2 is central to our strategy to build a modern, efficient fleet with strong performance. It enables us to serve more routes with lower emissions, better economics, and a premium experience for our passengers,” adds Van der Werff. “Together with Embraer, we are setting the course for the next chapter of SAS.”

Engine Support Limited (WMES). This transaction, finalized in June 2025, represents a critical pivot to amplify WLFC's role in aviation asset management while leveraging its partnership with Mitsui & Co., Ltd. The integration of BAML's technical expertise into WMES's operations could position the joint venture as a dominant player in global MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul) markets, backed by a growing $380 million asset base.

The Strategic Rationale: Synergies and Scale

WLFC's decision to transfer BAML to WMES is a calculated play to consolidate its aviation services under a single, robust platform. By merging BAML's records management and technical consultancy with WMES's engine leasing and maintenance capabilities, the joint venture gains a full-suite offering for aviation clients. This vertical integration eliminates redundancies, streamlines operations, and enhances WMES's ability to compete in high-margin MRO services—a sector projected to grow at 5% annually through 2030.

The $45 million sale price for BAML, subject to working capital adjustments, injects liquidity into WLFC's balance sheet. This capital can be redirected toward high-potential initiatives, such as expanding its engine leasing fleet or advancing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) projects through its subsidiary, Willis Sustainable Fuels. Meanwhile, the renamed Willis Mitsui & Co. Asset Management Limited (WAML) will serve as WMES's technical backbone, enabling the joint venture to expand into markets like Asia and Europe, where demand for engine-related services is surging.

Financial and Operational Leverage

WLFC's ownership stake in WMES remains at 50%, ensuring it benefits directly from the joint venture's growth. WMES's current $380 million asset base—a figure expected to rise as WAML's expertise drives new deals—provides a solid foundation for scaling. Notably, WLFC's subsidiary, Willis Engine Structured Trust VIII, recently issued $596 million in asset-backed notes secured by 64 engines/airframes. This financing highlights the company's confidence in the underlying demand for aviation infrastructure.

Risks and Considerations

While the transaction is strategically sound, risks persist. Geopolitical tensions, inflationary pressures, and oil price volatility could disrupt lessee compliance and asset valuations. Additionally, WLFC's Q1 2025 earnings missed EPS estimates, signaling potential operational headwinds. Insider trading data further raises eyebrows: executives, including CEO Austin Willis, sold over $10 million in shares in the past six months. While this could reflect personal financial decisions, it may also indicate caution about near-term volatility.

The Investment Thesis: Capitalizing on Undervalued Aviation Infrastructure

Despite these risks, WLFC's move into integrated aviation asset management aligns with sector tailwinds. As airlines and lessors increasingly prioritize cost efficiency and sustainability, WMES's expanded capabilities position it to capture a larger share of the $50 billion MRO market. Analysts at JPMorgan estimate that WMES could grow its asset base to $500 million by 2027, driven by WAML's technical services and Mitsui's global reach.

Investors should note that WLFC's stock trades at a discount to peers, with a P/B ratio of 1.2x compared to the sector average of 1.5x. This undervaluation, combined with WMES's growth potential, makes WLFC an attractive entry point for contrarian investors. The company's focus on sustainable aviation fuels and engine leasing—both key to decarbonizing aviation—also aligns with ESG trends, enhancing its long-term appeal.

Conclusion: A Strategic Play for Long-Term Gains

Willis Lease Finance Corporation's integration of BAML into WMES is a strategic masterstroke that strengthens its foothold in aviation asset management. While risks such as macroeconomic volatility remain, the transaction's synergies, liquidity injection, and Mitsui's backing suggest a compelling upside. Investors seeking exposure to undervalued aviation infrastructure plays should consider adding WLFC to their portfolios, particularly if they're willing to ride out short-term uncertainty for long-term growth.

Finding some transitional relief in 2025 has been SABR’s top priority.”

— Joe Jobe, CEO, Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition

JEFFERSON CITY, MO, UNITED STATES, July 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners (SABR) Coalition, a national biodiesel trade association made up of over 70 organizational members throughout the biodiesel value chain, applauds the biofuel provisions added to the Senate budget-reconciliation legislation known as the “big, beautiful bill.” Introduced on June 28, the Senate version of the tax bill includes provisions for an immediate extension of the Section 40A Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit. The value of the credit increases from 10 cents to 20 cents per gallon on the first 15 million gallons. It also makes the credit transferable so that pass-through entities such as limited liability companies (LLCs) and S corporations can access the credit and monetize it. This is important transitional relief to biodiesel producers, many of which have shut down this year since the biodiesel blenders tax credit (BTC) expired on Dec. 31, 2024, while the industry awaits implementing regulations for its replacement, the Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z).

“Finding some transitional relief in 2025 has been SABR’s top priority,” said SABR CEO Joe Jobe.

The Senate bill also introduces several key improvements to Section 45Z, which will take effect in 2026. Some changes mirror those passed by the House of Representatives on May 22 while others differ significantly. The differences must be reconciled before the legislation can be sent to President Donald Trump for signing into law by the July 4 target date.

Like the House revisions, these improvements by the Senate include elimination of the failed theory of indirect land-use change (ILUC) that penalizes domestic agricultural feedstocks in modeling greenhouse gas (GHG) calculations.

A critical difference between the Senate’s modifications to 45Z and both existing law and changes passed by the House is that the Senate version seeks to put sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and on-road biofuels such as biodiesel and renewable diesel on equal footing. Currently, SAF producers are eligible for up to $1.75 per gallon under Section 45Z, provided certain criteria are met, but biodiesel manufacturers can only receive up to a maximum of $1 per gallon.

While the House bill extends Section 45Z from its current sunset date of Dec. 31, 2027, to Dec. 31, 2031, the Senate version shortens this extension by two years and allows transferability of the credit through 2029.

Earlier modifications to Section 45Z from the Senate Finance Committee allowed feedstocks from outside the U.S. to claim the credit at a 20 percent discount to domestic inputs. Updated language in the full Senate bill, however, matches the House version and only allows feedstocks from North America to qualify for the incentive.

SABR reiterates that, because these changes do not take effect until 2026, it is important that Congress provides transitional relief now as a policy bridge to 2026.

“The amendments to the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit will make for dramatically better energy, agriculture and clean transportation policy,” Jobe said. “But those amendments take effect in 2026, and SABR has been educating members of Congress about the severe immediate harm to the biodiesel industry caused by the lack of policy clarity. SABR has been urging immediate extension of the Section 40A Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer Tax Credit and applauds its inclusion. While most biofuel advocates have been focused solely on ‘fixing’ 45Z beginning next year in the reconciliation bill, a top priority for SABR has been getting transitional relief for biodiesel producers this year. We thank Sen. Chuck Grassley and Finance Chair Mike Crapo for their work on this measure.”

Groundbreaking technology developed at Trinity, which captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is being put through its paces at Dublin Airport – with the team behind its creation hoping to demonstrate its wider potential for capturing carbon in the aviation and e-fuel industries.

The project has been funded by a prestigious European Innovation Council (EIC) Transition grant (AirInMotion) and supported by the Enterprise Ireland.

Developed by Prof. Wolfgang Schmitt and Dr Sebastien Vaesen from Trinity’s School of Chemistry and AMBER, the Taighde Éireann – Research Ireland Centre for Advanced Materials and BioEngineering Research, this pioneering initiative focuses on delivering scalable, energy-efficient atmospheric carbon dioxide capture solutions to help reduce industrial emissions. This Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology is a critical tool in achieving net-zero targets and has the potential to drive real, measurable change in combating climate change.

This deployment marked the first industrial-scale field test of the technology. The demonstrator has been operating for three months at Dublin Airport, collecting critical data on efficiency, operational stability, and energy consumption. Insights gained from this deployment have provided crucial validation of the technology performance and will shape future development and commercial applications.

Prof. Wolfgang Schmitt pointed out the impact of this technology, stating, “Atmospheric carbon capture innovations are crucial because they directly address one of the most pressing challenges we face today—reducing carbon emissions from industries that can't easily eliminate them at the source. By advancing and integrating this technology across industries, we are not only reducing emissions but also creating economic opportunities through supplying high-purity CO₂ that align with global sustainability goals.”

“This technology has the potential to be a cornerstone in the global effort to combat climate change, and the idea that this could contribute to a solution that makes a real difference is incredibly motivating.”

Dr Sebastien Vaesen, technical lead, emphasised the transformative potential of the technology, adding: “Our technology is designed for industrial deployment, efficiently capturing CO₂ from the air while utilising low-grade waste heat from industries. We have enhanced CO₂ capture efficiency by integrating innovative design features and optimising key operational conditions using our laboratory test rig.”

“The deployment at Dublin Airport is a key validation for scaling up and allows us to gather critical performance data in a live operational setting and fine-tune it for long-term sustainable operation. Moreover, we are strongly committed to the technology commercialisation, and this deployment is a major stepping stone.”

This technology deployment aims to further demonstrate its potential for the aviation and e-fuel industries, directly addressing the European Commission's ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, which mandates that Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) comprise 2% of fuel at EU airports by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050. Furthermore, it also requires e-fuels, produced from renewable electricity and sustainable CO₂, to constitute 50% of the SAF.

Andrea Carroll, Director of Sustainability at daa, the operators of Dublin Airport, said: “We are pleased to support Trinity College Dublin's trial of carbon capture technology at Dublin Airport. This project offers daa an opportunity to explore carbon capture as a potential means of decarbonising our operations and industry. The collaboration between Trinity College Dublin and Dublin Airport exemplifies the kind of forward-thinking partnerships that are essential for driving innovation and real change as we all make our way towards a Net Zero world.”

Dr Elham Katoueizadeh, Project Developer for this technology, highlighted that developed over more than 10 years of research and innovation, this technology is now ready for large-scale implementation across industries, recognising the urgent need for scalable carbon capture solutions. Following the start of this field test, the team is focusing on securing additional investment and partnerships to expand and accelerate commercial adoption.",https://www.tcd.ie/news_events/top-stories/featured/trinitys-groundbreaking-carbon-capture-tech/media/tcd/news-images/IMG_0200.jpeg,N,,2025-07-01 08:02:21.656670

1 ReFuelEU-VO bestimmt, dass Fluggesellschaften die Verwendung ein und derselben Charge SAF nicht im Rahmen mehrerer Treibhausgasminderungssysteme geltend machen können.","1. Was ist SAF?

SAF ist eine Sammelbezeichnung für nachhaltige Flugkraftstoffe. Chemisch unterscheiden sie sich nicht wesentlich von fossilem Kerosin, weshalb sie ohne weiteres zur Betankung von herkömmlichen Flugzeugen verwendet werden können. SAF sind nicht lokal klimaneutral, d.h. sie emittieren bei der Verbrennung CO2. Jedoch können sie über ihren gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg bis zu 80 % an CO2-Emissionen gegenüber fossilem Kerosin einsparen. Das liegt daran, dass das emittierte CO2 vorher der Atmosphäre entzogen wurde. Es entsteht also ein CO2-Kreislauf. Es gibt unterschiedliche Arten von SAF. Art. 3 Nr. 7 Verordnung (EU) 2023/2405 des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates vom 18. Oktober 2023 zur Gewährleistung gleicher Wettbewerbsbedingungen für einen nachhaltigen Luftverkehr (Initiative ReFuelEU Aviation) („ReFuelEU-VO“) unterscheidet zwischen synthetischen Flugkraftstoffen, Biokraftstoffen für die Luftfahrt und wiederverwerteten kohlenstoffhaltigen Flugkraftstoffen.

Synthetische Flugkraftstoffe oder E-Kerosin wird durch die Synthese von Wasserstoff und CO2 hergestellt. Damit E-Kerosin klimafreundlich ist, muss der Wasserstoff klimaneutral erzeugt werden, z.B. durch erneuerbare Energien (grüner Wasserstoff) oder Kernenergie (roter Wasserstoff). Zudem muss das beigemischte CO2 der Atmosphäre vorab entzogen werden, z.B. mittels Direct-Air-Capture. Das Herstellungsverfahren wird auch Power-to-Liquid (PtL) genannt.

Biokraftstoffe für die Luftfahrt oder Biokerosin wird aus Biomasse hergestellt. Hierfür kommen unter anderem landwirtschaftliche Abfälle, Ölsaaten oder Algen in Betracht. Biokerosin ist klimafreundlich, da bei der Verbrennung nur CO2 freigesetzt wird, das zuvor während des Wachstums der Pflanzen oder Tiere, von denen die Biomasse stammt, in der Biomasse gebunden wurde.

Wiederverwertete kohlenstoffhaltige Kraftstoffe werden aus Abfällen nicht erneuerbaren Ursprungs hergestellt, z.B. Industrieabgasen. Sie sind nur klimafreundlich, wenn das bei der Verbrennung freigesetzte CO2 ohne die Wiederverwertung als Flugkraftstoff unmittelbar freigesetzt worden wäre.

Die deutsche und EU-Gesetzgebung stellen zum Teil zusätzliche Anforderungen an die einzelnen SAF-Varianten, was unter 2.4 und 3.1 dargestellt wird.

2. Was gilt in der Europäischen Union?

Die EU möchte mit der ReFuelEU-VO den Markthochlauf von SAF vorantreiben, indem sie die Beimischung eines steigenden Mindestanteils von SAF zu konventionellem Kerosin vorschreibt.

2.1 Flugkraftstoffanbieter

Nach Art. 4 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO sind Flugkraftstoffanbieter verpflichtet, Kerosin einen Mindestanteil SAF beizumischen. Ab dem Jahr 2025 beträgt der Mindestanteil 2 %, ab 2030 6 % und bis 2050 steigt er auf 70 %. Ab 2030 gilt zudem eine Unterquote für synthetisches Kerosin. Danach ist konventionellem Kerosin mindestens 0,7 % synthetisches Kerosin beizumischen. Bis 2050 steigt die Unterquote für synthetisches Kerosin auf 35 %.

2.2 Fluggesellschaften

Fluggesellschaften sind gem. Art. 5 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO verpflichtet, mindestens 90 % ihres Jahresbedarfs an Kerosin für Flüge, die in der EU starten, an Flughäfen in der EU zu tanken. Eine Unterschreitung dieses Schwellenwertes ist nach Art. 5 Abs. 2 ReFuelEU-VO aus Gründen der Kraftstoffsicherheit zulässig. Dies dient zur Einhaltung bestimmter Pflichtreserven, um z.B. Ausweichflughäfen erreichen zu können.

Die Betankungspflicht soll verhindern, dass Fluggesellschaften zum Tanken auf Flughäfen außerhalb der EU ausweichen, um dort günstigeres Kerosin ohne beigemischtes SAF zu tanken.

2.3 Anforderungen an SAF

Synthetische Flugkraftstoffe werden in Art. 3 Nr. 12 ReFuelEU-VO nicht unmittelbar definiert. Stattdessen verweist die Norm auf die Definition der erneuerbaren Kraftstoffe nicht biogenen Ursprungs („RFNBO“) nach Art. 2 Abs. 2 Nr. 36 Richtlinie (EU) 2018/2001 des Europäischen Parlaments und des Rates vom 11. Dezember 2018 zur Förderung der Nutzung von Energie aus erneuerbaren Quellen (Neufassung) („RED III“). RFNBO sind danach Kraftstoffe, deren Energiegehalt aus erneuerbaren Energiequellen mit Ausnahme von Biomasse stammt. In RED III finden sich zudem weitere Anforderungen. Für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe gelten aber nur Art. 29 Abs. 1 und 30 RED III, denn nur hierauf verweist Art. 3 Nr. 12 ReFuelEU-VO. Danach muss synthetischer Flugkraftstoff im Laufe seines Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen und entsprechend zertifiziert sein. Hingegen erfolgt kein Verweis auf Art. 27 Abs. 6 RED III. Damit gelten für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe auch nicht die Vorgaben für RFNBO nach der Delegierten Verordnung (EU) 2023/1184 der Kommission zur Ergänzung der RED III durch die Festlegung einer Unionsmethode mit detaillierten Vorschriften für die Erzeugung flüssiger oder gasförmiger erneuerbarer Kraftstoffe nicht biogenen Ursprungs für den Verkehr, die auf Art. 27 Abs. 6 RED III basiert (mehr dazu unter 3.1).

Kein synthetischer Flugkraftstoff ist nach der Definition synthetischer Flugkraftstoff, für dessen Herstellung Wasserstoff durch Kernenergie erzeugt wurde (roter Wasserstoff). Jedoch kann dieser nach Art. 3 Nr. 13 ReFuelEU-VO als synthetischer kohlenstoffarmer Flugkraftstoff gelten, wenn er im Laufe seines Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führt und entsprechend zertifiziert ist. Kohlenstoffarme Flugkraftstoffe (sowie erneuerbarer und kohlenstoffarmer Wasserstoff) können nach Art. 4 Abs. 2 ReFuelEU-VO anstelle von SAF verwendet werden.

Biokraftstoffe für die Luftfahrt werden in Art. 3 Nr. 8 ReFuelEU-VO auch mit Verweis auf RED III definiert. Danach wird unterschieden zwischen:

Fortschriftlichen Biokraftstoffen, die aus den in Anhang IX Teil A RED III aufgeführten Rohstoffen (z.B. Algen, Gülle oder Nussschalen) hergestellt werden,

Biokraftstoffen, die aus den in Anhang IX Teil B RED III aufgeführten Rohstoffen (z.B. gebrauchtes Speiseöl, tierische Fette oder Abwasser) hergestellt werden, und

sonstigen Biokraftstoffen, die nicht aus Nahrungsmittel- und Futtermittelpflanzen hergestellt werden, die im Laufe ihres Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen.

Hintergrund des Ausschlusses von Nahrungs- und Futtermittelpflanzen für die Herstellung von Biokraftstoff für die Luftfahrt ist nach Erwägungsgrund 23 ReFuelEU-VO, dass eine Flächenkonkurrenz und eine damit einhergehende erhöhte Landnutzung vermieden werden sollen.

Für wiederverwertete kohlenstoffhaltige Kraftstoffe gilt nach Art. 3 Nr. 9 ReFuelEU-VO und Art. 2 Nr. 35 RED III ebenfalls, dass sie im Laufe ihres Lebenszyklus zu einer Treibhausgasminderung von mindestens 70 % führen und entsprechend zertifiziert sein müssen. Zusätzlich müssen sie aus flüssigem oder festem Abfall hergestellt werden, der für eine stoffliche Verwertung nach Art. 4 Richtlinie 2008/98/EG (EU-Abfallrichtlinie) nicht geeignet ist, oder aus Gas aus der Abfallverarbeitung oder Abgas, das zwangsläufig und unbeabsichtigt infolge der Produktionsprozesse in Industrieanlagen entstehen. Damit soll sichergestellt werden, dass bei der Verbrennung des Flugkraftstoffs tatsächlich nur CO2 freigesetzt wird, dass ohnehin freigesetzt worden wäre.

2.4 Verhältnis zum EHS und CORSIA

Bereits vor Inkrafttreten der SAF-Quote unterlag der innereuropäische Luftverkehr dem EU-Emissionshandelssystem („EHS“). Danach müssen Emittenten für jede Tonne emittiertes CO2 Zertifikate erwerben. Da die Gesamtmenge der Zertifikate jährlich sinkt, sinken somit auch jährlich die Gesamtemissionen der erfassten Sektoren. Nicht-innereuropäische Flüge unterliegen seit 2021 dem Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). CORSIA verpflichtet Fluggesellschaften zur Begrenzung der CO2-Emissionen auf das Niveau des Jahres 2019. Das Wachstum der Branche soll dadurch klimaneutral sein. Darüberhinausgehende Emissionen müssen kompensiert werden.

Art. 9 Abs. 1 ReFuelEU-VO bestimmt, dass Fluggesellschaften die Verwendung ein und derselben Charge SAF nicht im Rahmen mehrerer Treibhausgasminderungssysteme geltend machen können. Fluggesellschaften müssen sich demnach entscheiden, ob sie eine Charge SAF entweder auf ihre Verpflichtungen nach dem EHS oder nach CORSIA anwenden wollen. SAF haben im EHS und bei CORSIA einen Emissionsfaktor von null, d.h. sie gelten nicht als Verursacher von Treibhausgasemissionen. Zudem erhalten Fluggesellschaften nach Art. 3c Abs. 6 Richtlinie 2003/87/EG (EHS-Richtlinie) im Zeitraum von 2024 bis 2030 bis zu 20 Millionen kostenlose Emissionszertifikate für die Verwendung von SAF. Noch weiter gehen möchte die neue Bundesregierung. Im Koalitionsvertrag heißt es, dass die Hälfte der EHS-Einnahmen aus der Luftfahrt zur Förderung des Markthochlaufs von SAF verwendet werden sollen.

3. Was gilt zusätzlich in Deutschland?

In Deutschland gilt auch eine nationale Beimischungsquote für Kraftstoff aus erneuerbaren Energien nicht-biogenen Ursprungs für Kerosin. Nach § 37a Abs. 4a BImSchG gilt die Quote ab 2026 und beträgt 0,5 %, 1 % ab 2028 und 2 % ab 2030. Die Zukunft dieser nationalen Quote ist ungewiss. Im Koalitionsvertrag hat sich die schwarz-rote Koalition auf ihre Abschaffung verständigt. Ein am 19. Juni 2025 veröffentlichter Referentenentwurf eines zweiten Gesetzes zur Weiterentwicklung der Treibhausgasminderungs-Quote sieht vor, die nationale SAF-Quote durch eine allgemeine Quote für alle Verkehrsbereiche zu ersetzen.

3.1 Nationale Anforderungen an SAF

Die Anforderungen an den beigemischten Kraftstoff sind in der 37. BImSchV geregelt. Dabei übernimmt § 2 Abs. 3 37. BImSchV die EU-Definition von RFNBO nach Art. 2 Abs. 2 Nr. 36 RED III. Dennoch gibt es Unterschiede zur EU-Definition von synthetischem Flugkraftstoff. Wie bei der EU-SAF-Quote muss nach § 10 Abs. 1 37. BImSchV mindestens eine Treibhausgasminderung von 70 % erreicht und dies auch entsprechend der EU-Methodik nachgewiesen werden. Hinzu kommen jedoch die Anforderungen nach den §§ 3 ff. 37. BImSchV. Diese entsprechen den Anforderungen der Delegierten Verordnung (EU) 2023/1184, die für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe nach der EU-SAF-Quote gerade nicht gilt.

Der Strom für die Erzeugung von RFNBO muss grundsätzlich folgende Kriterien erfüllen:

Zusätzliche Stromerzeugung, § 6 37. BImSchV: RFNBO sollen nur mit Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien erzeugt werden, der in Anlagen (Windparks, PV-Parks, etc.) erzeugt wurde, die zusätzlich zu bestehenden Anlagen errichtet worden sind.

Zeitliche Korrelation, § 7 37. BImSchV: Der Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien soll in einem engen zeitlichen Rahmen mit seinem Verbrauch zur Herstellung von RFNBO erzeugt werden.

Geografische Korrelation, § 8 37. BImSchV: Der Strom aus erneuerbaren Energien soll in derselben Stromgebotszone erzeugt werden, in der er zur RFNBO-Herstellung verbraucht wird.

In Deutschland gilt somit, anders als im Rest der EU, bereits vor 2030 eine Beimischungsquote für synthetische Flugkraftstoffe (und nicht nur für SAF im Allgemeinen), die 2030 deutlich über der EU-Quote von 0,7 % liegen wird und strengere Anforderungen an die Herstellung des Kraftstoffs stellt.

3.2 Verhältnis zur EU-SAF-Quote

Da es sich bei der EU-SAF-Quote ausweislich des Wortlauts der Verordnung um einen „Mindestanteil“ handelt, ist der nationale Gesetzgeber berechtigt, darüberhinausgehende Anforderungen zu festzulegen. Konkret bedeutet das, dass die nationale Quote insoweit greift, wie sie nicht bereits durch Erfüllung der EU-SAF-Quote geboten ist. Für synthetischen Flugkraftstoff gelten zudem in Höhe der nationalen Quote die strengeren Anforderungen nach der 37. BImSchV.

4. Fazit und Ausblick

Die EU-SAF-Quote ist grundsätzlich positiv zu sehen, da sie einen Anreiz für einen Markthochlauf von SAF schaffen kann. Da alternative, klimaneutrale Antriebssysteme für Flugzeuge absehbar nicht zur Verfügung stehen, ist auch nicht zu befürchten, dass es zu einer Bevorzugung oder Benachteiligung einzelner Technologien kommt. Zudem wurde ein gutes Zusammenspiel mit dem Emissionshandel gefunden. Die SAF-Quote stellt nämlich keine zusätzliche Verpflichtung zur Emissionsreduktion dar, sondern weist einen Weg zur Erfüllung der Verpflichtungen zur Emissionsreduktion.

Fraglich ist hingegen, ob die vorgeschriebenen Quoten auch zu einem Markthochlauf in dem gewünschten Umfang führen werden, sodass die Preise tatsächlich sinken. Hierzu wäre denkbar, die hinter SAF steckende Technologie (E-Fuels) auch für andere Branchen als die Flugbranche zu öffnen, beispielsweise für die Automobilindustrie, was politisch umstritten ist. Schließlich wirft die neue Koalition mit Recht die Frage nach der Sinnhaftigkeit einer zusätzlichen deutschen SAF-Quote auf. Eine allgemeine Quote für alle Verkehrsbereiche könnte hier Abhilfe schaffen und zugleich auch den Markthochlauf der Technologien, auf denen SAF basieren, in anderen Sektoren fördern.",https://oc-static.poweredbyproctors.co.uk/public/styles/opengraph/public/images/22/01/04/TA_airport_departure_sign.jpg?VersionId=LN6ytgHED.8atQbto9x2oXXhSjsAZ8ze&itok=l2quv5UJ,N,,2025-07-01 12:18:45.885608

This move demonstrates Qantas’s commitment to balancing route expansion with environmental responsibility, as the A321XLR’s long-range capability allows direct connections to new destinations using less fuel than previous models. With this aircraft certified to operate on up to 50 percent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and designed for future 100 percent SAF usage, Qantas is not only increasing its operational efficiency but also reinforcing its pledge to reduce the carbon footprint of its fleet—placing it at the forefront of sustainable air travel innovation.

Qantas has officially become the first airline in the Asia-Pacific region to take delivery of the Airbus A321XLR, ushering in a transformative era for long-range narrowbody operations. The arrival of this aircraft marks a milestone in the airline’s ambitious fleet renewal strategy, one that prioritizes range, fuel efficiency, and environmental performance in response to evolving global travel demand.

Airbus has handed over the first A321XLR to Qantas from its final assembly site in Hamburg, Germany. The aircraft is now en route to Sydney, making only one scheduled stop in Bangkok for refueling and crew rest. This nearly nonstop journey highlights the aircraft’s impressive long-range performance and operational efficiency. With this capability, the A321XLR is poised to redefine route networks by seamlessly connecting domestic and international destinations that once required larger, less efficient widebody jets.

Qantas has outfitted its new A321XLR with a dual-class cabin design, featuring 20 seats in Business Class and 177 in Economy. This configuration reflects the airline’s focus on delivering a blend of passenger comfort, optimized seating capacity, and operational flexibility across a wide range of routes. Initially, the aircraft will serve busy domestic corridors within Australia, replacing aging models with higher fuel consumption. As more A321XLRs are integrated into the fleet, Qantas aims to expand their use to longer international routes, especially targeting secondary destinations in Asia that currently lack direct service.

The A321XLR is powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, known for their advanced fuel-efficiency and reduced noise profile. These engines, paired with a new fuel tank configuration and reinforced landing gear, enable the aircraft to reach a range of up to 4,700 nautical miles—the longest of any single-aisle commercial jet currently in service. This gives airlines the flexibility to open direct city-pair connections that would otherwise be unprofitable or operationally impractical using widebody aircraft.

As part of its broad fleet renewal initiative, the Qantas Group has placed a firm order for 40 Airbus A321XLR aircraft. Of this total, 28 jets will be integrated into the mainline Qantas fleet, while 12 are slated for operation by Jetstar, the group’s low-cost division. This acquisition falls within a broader purchasing agreement with Airbus, which also includes 128 aircraft from the A320neo single-aisle family and 24 long-range A350-1000 widebodies. The overarching goal of the modernization effort is to phase out older aircraft, enhance fuel and cost efficiency, and enable the airline to expand across both domestic routes and new international markets.

Airbus developed the A321XLR as the next evolution in its A320neo family to meet growing market demand for longer-range narrowbody jets. The aircraft introduces significant improvements in fuel efficiency and environmental performance compared to older models. In real-world airline operations, the A321XLR consumes significantly less fuel per seat-mile while producing fewer emissions, making it an attractive option for carriers seeking to improve sustainability metrics.

Beyond its impressive range and cost efficiency, the A321XLR supports the aviation industry’s shift toward sustainability. The aircraft is already approved to fly using blends containing up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and Airbus aims to make it fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030. This forward-looking capability makes the A321XLR a key asset for airlines seeking to modernize their fleets with environmentally responsible solutions.

For Qantas, the A321XLR presents an opportunity to expand its network in ways that were previously not viable. The combination of long range and smaller capacity allows the airline to serve medium-demand international destinations directly, eliminating the need for layovers or fleet swaps. This strategy will improve connectivity for travelers, reduce travel times, and support tourism and business links between Australia and emerging markets across Southeast Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.

The aircraft also offers advantages in terms of passenger experience. Cabin features include larger overhead storage, quieter engines, mood lighting, and improved air filtration systems. These enhancements help position the A321XLR as not only a fuel-efficient performer but also a traveler-friendly option for journeys of up to eight hours in duration.

The entry of the A321XLR into Qantas’s fleet supports broader aviation trends toward right-sizing aircraft on long-distance routes. As demand patterns shift and sustainability becomes a greater focus, airlines are investing in versatile aircraft that offer both performance and efficiency. The success of the A321XLR in global markets reflects this trend, with more than 500 orders already placed by carriers around the world.

Qantas is leading the way in the Asia-Pacific by being the first to put this aircraft type into commercial service. This step further strengthens the airline’s role as an innovator in fleet transformation and route development. As more A321XLRs join its fleet, Qantas is expected to expand nonstop services to regional destinations in countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, and India—routes that traditionally required stopovers or larger aircraft.

The aircraft’s arrival is timely as Qantas rebuilds its network in the post-pandemic era, focusing on flexibility, cost control, and environmental responsibility. The A321XLR supports all three pillars, giving the airline a tool that fits modern travel needs without compromising on range or passenger comfort.

Qantas is leading sustainable aviation by deploying its first Airbus A321XLR, expanding its route network while cutting fuel use and emissions through advanced long-range design and Sustainable Aviation Fuel capability.

Airline operators must load 90 per cent of the SAF they need for international flights in Turkey, the authority said.

Aviation is responsible for 2.5 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency.

Tupras, Turkey's largest oil refiner, aims to produce 20,000 metric tons of SAF at one of its major plants in 2026, the company said earlier this year.

It aims to lift production up to 400,000 tons by building a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision.

DB Tarimsal Enerji, a local biofuel firm, also aims to produce 100,000 tons of SAF at a new plant.

Turkey's jet fuel demand fell 4 per cent last year to 6.26 million tons, or 135,000 barrels per day, according to the country's energy regulator.","https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-122174344,imgsize-65702,width-1200,height=627,overlay-etinfra,resizemode-75/news/aviation/turkey-sets-sustainable-aviation-fuel-mandate-to-cut-aviation-emissions-by-5-by-2030.jpg",N,,2025-07-01 02:59:39.236467

in an era where patient-focused medicine requires precise handling and quicker delivery times, FedEx has revamped its quality framework and bolstered its infrastructure while making strides toward sustainable aviation goals. Nick Gennari, who leads global healthcare sales at FedEx, describes this moment as pivotal: “achieving the CEIV Pharma corporate Certificate showcases our dedication to quality and leadership in transporting pharmaceutical products worldwide.”

This certification process involved aligning procedures across various jurisdictions—a meaningful challenge for the company. “Creating global standard operating procedures was one of our major tasks,” Gennari noted.

With 15 new certified facilities added globally recently, more than 90% of their healthcare volume now flows through CEIV-accredited hubs. The journey wasn’t straightforward; different regions have unique regulations that necessitate a extensive approach to quality assurance. “Our entire quality process is now certified,” he explained. “As we expand into new markets with increasing volumes, we’re prepared to certify additional facilities as opportunities arise.”

The pandemic tested this certification rigorously when fedex was tasked with delivering temperature-sensitive COVID-19 vaccines across remote areas. “We had to invest in equipment at certain locations to maintain efficacy,” Gennari shared. This experience has shaped a broader cold chain strategy encompassing over 100 facilities globally.

Embracing Technology for Enhanced Visibility

The integrity of such complex cargo increasingly relies on digital innovations. To improve real-time tracking and response capabilities, FedEx introduced Surround Monitoring and Intervention (MI) solutions that provide customers with enhanced insights into their shipments’ status—offering location data along with predictive alerts for potential issues during transit.

This Surround MI platform is currently active in 50 countries worldwide; customer feedback highlights its effectiveness: “One client mentioned that it saves him between six to twelve hours each month just by streamlining package tracking,” said Gennari.

Citing geopolitical uncertainties and changing trade dynamics as challenges ahead for international logistics firms like theirs—FedEx emphasizes its expansive network as a strategic asset: “We connect around three million shippers with approximately 225 million customers globally,” he stated confidently.

Sustainability Initiatives Taking center Stage

Sustainability concerns are becoming increasingly prominent within pharmaceutical logistics—especially regarding high-emission airfreight segments. According to Gennari: “we’re committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations by 2040.” This commitment gained momentum when they began utilizing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in U.S.-based operations earlier this year through an agreement involving over three million gallons from Neste at LAX airport.

This shift towards SAF complements ongoing efforts such as modernizing their aircraft fleet alongside optimizing flight plans aimed at reducing emissions intensity substantially since fiscal year 2005.

Liquid organic hydrogen carriers (LOHCs), in which hydrogen atoms are chemically bound to liquid hydrocarbons via reversible hydrogenation reactions, offer a strategy for high-density storage and straightforward storage and transport.

A team of researchers from Washington State University (WSU; Richland, Wash.; www.wsu.edu) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL; Richland, Wash.; www.pnnl.gov) demonstrated the use of a lignin-based jet fuel as a new LOHC. The team, led by WSU engineer Bin Yang, had previously developed lignin-based jet fuel (LJF) with a process that converts lignin from waste biomass into primarily cycloalkane hydrocarbons, including alkyl-substituted mono-, bi-, and tri-cyclohexyl alkanes that can be used in jet fuel formulations.

Now, using platinum nanoparticles supported on zeolite (aluminosilicate compounds) as catalysts, the lignin jet fuel can undergo a dehydrogenation process that forms aromatic species, including alkylbenzenes, tetralins and naphthalenes. The dehydrogenated LJF, known as LJF-HyC, can then serve as a potential liquid hydrogen storage medium. In the study, researchers found the dehydrogenation of LJF into LJF-HyC “revealed a significant presence of aromatic species, comprising approximately 18.5 wt.% of the dehydrogenated LJF.”

Once the hydrogen carrier is made, it can be hydrogenated to store and transport hydrogen, and would be released at a point of use with another similar catalytic process. Using the LJF as a LOHC facilitates efficient high-density hydrogen storage in an easy-to-handle sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the researchers say. “This approach offers promising opportunities for compatibility with existing infrastructure, economic viability for scalable production, and creates a synergistic system that enhances the efficiency, safety and sustainability of both SAF and hydrogen technologies,” they wrote in a recent publication of the work in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

The Senate's proposed tax and budget reconciliation legislation modifies the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit and restores tax parity between sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other advanced biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel effective Oct. 1, 2025. U.S. biofuel production has dropped sharply since the credit took effect in January.

Research conducted by American Transportation Research Institute (ATRI) shows renewable diesel is not only a promising solution for lowering the trucking industry’s CO2 emissions, it's also significantly cheaper than battery electric technology. RD consumption levels in 2023 reached 2.868 billion gallons annually in the U.S., according to ATRI – a nearly 67% increase from 2022. In 2022 CARB reported that 73% of RD consumed in the U.S. was sold in California and received credits through its Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) regulatory program.

""We give the Senate a lot of credit for reconfiguring '45Z' to be truly technology neutral. SAF should be incentivized at the same rate as all other biofuels. An equal incentive – 'parity' – will result in more gallons of biofuel being produced and consumed, all at a lower cost for taxpayers,"" said David Fialkov, Executive Vice President of Government Affairs for NATSO, epresenting truck stops and travel centers, and SIGMA, a group of America's Leading Fuel Marketers.

Dividend Discipline: Income with Growth WLFC's dividend policy adds further appeal.
- Long-term: Dividend growth and SAF scalability justify a valuation multiple expansion from 10x to 12x forward earnings.
The confluence of passive inflows, SAF-driven growth, and dividend income creates a multi-year story.","Willis Lease Finance Corporation (NASDAQ: WLFC) stands at a strategic inflection point, with three interconnected catalysts poised to drive its valuation higher in 2025: its inclusion in the Russell Small Cap Comp Growth Index, progress on its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, and disciplined dividend growth. These factors create a compelling case for investors to consider a long position, especially as passive fund inflows from its index inclusion begin to flow into the stock.

The Russell Reconstitution Catalyst: Passive Inflows and Technical Momentum

WLFC's addition to the Russell Small Cap Comp Growth Index—effective June 30, 2025—marks a critical milestone. The reconstitution, which occurs annually, forces passive funds tracking the index to rebalance their portfolios, creating a $220 billion+ trading window for small-cap stocks like WLFC. Historical precedent suggests this process can lift a stock's price by 5–15% in the weeks following the rebalance, as funds rush to comply with indexing requirements.

The timing is fortuitous. WLFC's inclusion announcement in May 2024 has already spurred early buying, but the final rebalancing on June 30 will likely intensify this momentum. The stock's liquidity, though small-cap, is sufficient to absorb the inflows without excessive volatility, as evidenced by its average daily trading volume of ~400k shares.

Operational Momentum: SAF Projects as a Growth Engine

While passive inflows provide short-term tailwinds, WLFC's long-term thesis hinges on its $1.5 billion SAF project in the UK, slated to begin production by 2028. The facility will produce 750,000 metric tons of SAF annually, leveraging government grants and partnerships with industry leaders like BP and Rolls-Royce. Crucially, the project aligns with the EU's mandate to blend 2% SAF into aviation fuel by 2025, rising to 5% by 2030—a regulatory tailwind that ensures demand growth.

The SAF venture offers two key advantages:

1. Diversification: Reduces reliance on traditional aircraft-leasing revenue, which now accounts for ~80% of sales.

2. Scalability: WLFC's “Carbonshift” licensing pathway allows it to franchise SAF production technology, unlocking recurring revenue streams.

Financially, the project is underpinned by $500 million in government grants and a 15-year supply agreement with a major European airline, reducing execution risk. Over the next decade, SAF could contribute $200–300 million annually to WLFC's bottom line, a material uplift from its current $150 million pre-tax income.

Dividend Discipline: Income with Growth

WLFC's dividend policy adds further appeal. The company initiated a $0.15 quarterly dividend in Q1 2025, yielding ~2% at current prices—a premium to the Russell 2000's average yield of 1.2%. This payout is sustainable, given its $2.87 billion lease portfolio (up 18% YoY) and a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2x. Management has signaled a commitment to growing the dividend by 5–7% annually, even as it invests in SAF.

Risk Factors and the Bull Case

Risks remain. The SAF project's timeline hinges on regulatory approvals and construction delays, while the Russell inclusion is not guaranteed beyond 2025. However, WLFC's 22% revenue growth in 2024 and strong lease renewal rates (95% in H1 2025) suggest it can maintain the metrics required to stay in the index.

The bull case assumes:

- Short-term: A 12–15% pop in WLFC's stock price by August 2025 as passive funds complete rebalancing.

- Medium-term: SAF projects begin contributing to margins by 2027, lifting EBITDA by $50 million annually.

- Long-term: Dividend growth and SAF scalability justify a valuation multiple expansion from 10x to 12x forward earnings.

Investment Recommendation

With a current price of $28.50, we recommend a buy rating with a 12-month price target of $35 (23% upside). The confluence of passive inflows, SAF-driven growth, and dividend income creates a multi-year story. Investors should consider a phased entry, accumulating shares in the $27–$30 range ahead of the June rebalancing.

Final Note: For risk-averse investors, pairing a 5% position in WLFC with a Russell 2000 index ETF (e.g., IWM) can balance pure-play exposure with broad-market diversification.

This innovative platform is designed to facilitate seamless procurement of SAF between airlines and producers, addressing key challenges in the industry’s transition to greener fuel sources.

The SAF Matchmaker platform, developed by IATA, is set to revolutionize the way airlines and SAF suppliers connect and negotiate deals. By matching requests for SAF supply with offers, the platform aims to create a more accessible, transparent, and efficient market for sustainable aviation fuels.

According to IATA’s chief economist and senior vice-president for sustainability, Marie Owens Thomsen, “To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers.”

The platform is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers, with plans to expand access to other SAF buyers, such as non-aviation corporations, in the future. This innovative matching platform is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralized digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with practical tools to support energy management.

The SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues that have hindered the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuels:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement, making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. This will facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes, while airlines can register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Once connections are made, subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform provides comprehensive information about the available SAF, including volumes, feedstock used, location and technology of production, emissions reductions, and compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

The Sec. 45Z clean fuel production credit is a significant initiative introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, P.L. 117–169. This credit aims to incentivize the production of clean transportation fuels, including either sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or non–SAF transportation fuel, within the United States by offering tax credits to producers that meet specific environmental criteria.

To be eligible for the credit in a specific tax year, taxpayers must produce a qualifying transportation fuel within the United States for sale to an unrelated party for certain specified purposes. A non–SAF transportation fuel must be produced in accordance with certain feedstock requirements, must be suitable for use in highway vehicles or aircraft, and must have a lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rate of no more than 50 kilograms per carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) (based on relative global warming potential) per million British thermal units (mmBTU) (Secs. 45Z(b)(1)(A) and (d)). Alternatively, SAF must adhere to specific industry standards, meet a separate set of feedstock requirements, and be sold for use in aircraft.

On Jan. 10, 2025, Treasury and the IRS issued Notice 2025–10, which contains draft forthcoming proposed regulations for the Sec. 45Z clean fuel production credit, and Notice 2025–11, which includes the Sec. 45Z annual emissions rate table. Also in January, the Department of Energy released the 45ZCF–GREET model, with a user manual and other information, to calculate emissions for non–SAF transportation fuel. Overall, the guidance provides helpful information but ultimately neglects several crucial industry issues. Therefore, taxpayers in the clean fuel industry are evaluating how to apply the notices, given their nonbinding and somewhat ineffective nature.

This item explores two key issues among many that are puzzling industry participants: imported used cooking oil (UCO) and the definition of a qualifying sale, particularly for clean fuel producers selling to wholesalers. The lack of clarity in these areas could significantly affect the clean fuel industry’s ability to generate the Sec. 45Z credit.

Imported UCO

The forthcoming proposed regulations do not provide specific guidance on the use of imported UCO as a feedstock eligible for the Sec. 45Z credit, specifically with respect to non–SAF transportation fuel. Notice 2025–10 contemplates concerns regarding the identification and market implications of imported UCO, particularly the risk of mislabeling substances such as virgin palm oil as UCO. Compared to palm oil, genuine UCO has a significantly lower GHG emissions rate, meaning that producing biodiesel from UCO generates considerably fewer carbon emissions than producing it from palm oil. This is primarily because UCO is considered a waste product that would otherwise be discarded, while palm oil production is often linked to large–scale deforestation, leading to high GHG emissions. Therefore, this mislabeling could potentially lead to higher emissions impacts than genuine UCO. Due to these concerns, the notice provides that pathways using imported UCO are currently unavailable in the 45ZCF–GREET model until further guidance is issued. When the current 45ZCF–GREET model does not include certain feedstocks such as imported UCO in its production pathways, the taxpayer must request a provisional emissions rate (PER) to establish an official emissions rate for its product.

This guidance fails to provide a specific PER process for taxpayers to follow, which creates significant uncertainty for industry participants that have relied on imported UCO as a sustainable feedstock, and this lack of a defined process will lead to difficulties in ensuring compliance and claiming the Sec. 45Z credit. To complicate this further, there is not an anticipated date for further guidance under the new administration; therefore, taxpayers that use imported UCO will be left searching for answers in the interim, making it difficult to estimate this incentive’s benefits.

Qualifying sale

Next, a contentious issue is the impact of Notice 2025–10’s limiting definition of a “qualifying sale.” Sec. 45Z(a)(4) provides three ways a taxpayer can demonstrate a qualifying sale. One is a sale to an unrelated person “for use by such person in a trade or business ” (Sec. 45Z(a)(4)(B)). This statutory language has been interpreted by many industry participants to give a broad application of the term “use” to a purchaser’s business activities, including wholesaling. The initial guidance, however, refines this definition by clarifying that a sale “for use in a trade or business” means “sold for use as a fuel in a trade or business within the meaning of section 162 of the Code” (emphasis added). The introduction of the limiting requirement that the purchaser’s use be exclusively as a fuel within the meaning of Sec. 162 is a clear deviation from the statutory language but appears intentional. The narrowly applied definition provided in the draft text of the forthcoming proposed regulations consequentially appears to exclude sales to wholesalers by clean fuel producers.

This proposed interpretation is significant because wholesalers play a crucial role in the supply chain by purchasing large quantities of fuel from producers and then distributing it to retailers or directly to end users, allowing producers to reach a broader market. This arrangement benefits producers by providing a steady demand for their products and reducing the complexity and costs associated with direct sales and distribution logistics. Hence, the additional language in the forthcoming proposed regulations leaves a gap in understanding whether these transactions qualify for the credit, potentially excluding a significant portion of the market from the benefit of the Sec. 45Z credit. Taxpayers are wondering if Treasury and the IRS intended this result, because the inclusion of a wholesaler in the supply chain would seemingly negate the credit for the producer’s sale of otherwise eligible fuel.

Gaps in the guidance

Overall, taxpayers have several concerns about the notices. While these notices offer some guidance, there is uncertainty about how much of the forthcoming proposed regulations will be finalized and enforceable as drafted in their present form. Most significantly, as outlined above, there are several gaps in the guidance, leaving the industry concerned and unable to adequately plan for how to apply the Sec. 45Z credit.

Q: As you know, business aviation has always served as an incubator for aviation innovation, including the successful development of technologies such as winglets, GPS for aviation and lightweight, super-strong composite materials. What policies should be considered that would spur continued American innovation and future development of new aviation-related technologies?

Aviation is the ultimate merit-based industry. Physics wins every time. We must support dynamic and science-based research and development by attracting and retaining the highest-caliber people and providing the best possible regulatory, tax and business environment for those innovators to create and develop groundbreaking solutions. Among other things, we must extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to ensure America remains the global business aviation leader.

Q: What should be done to ensure America’s air traffic control system remains the safest and most efficient in the world?

Aviation was the original high-reliability organization as a result of pioneering the concept of crew resource management. The vast majority of accidents involve human error. Mitigating that potential for error through the robust application of crew resource management training, adequately resourcing high-quality personnel, and promoting a climate of prompt and ready assistance is the foundation upon which all other safety measures are built.

Q: What more can Washington, DC, do to enhance policies that support the improved mental health of the nation’s aviation workforce, including pilots and air traffic controllers?

Having served as both a police supervisor and a National Guard UH-60 Black Hawk company commander and pilot in command, I’ve had the opportunity to compare and contrast two dynamic, high liability, rank structured careers. Law enforcement has pioneered the concept of peer support, in which police officers receive mental health training and work with first-responder psychologists to detect and support their peers during traumatic incidents or routine life and job stress, without any of the fabricated stigmas associated with “going to see the shrink.” Congress and the aviation industry should borrow lessons learned from peer support programs to bolster user level mental health for aviation industry personnel.

Q: Business aviation is increasingly suffering from a shortfall of pilots and aircraft maintenance professionals. What can be done to ensure that America has the aviation workforce it needs to maintain the highest levels of safety and efficiency?

Developing programs that work with high schools, community colleges and universities to promote and create pipelines into aviation as a high paying, high quality career is essential. Streamlining the credentialing and outreach to separating military aviators, aircrew and supporting personnel is also critical. I earned my FAA commercial license by taking the military competency exam, but struggled to actually land a civilian job. I became a cop instead. Finding ways to ease the transition of veterans into commercial and business aviation jobs will benefit both veterans and the aviation community.

Q: The raw materials needed to manufacture sustainable aviation fuel can create new markets for American farmers, while cutting aircraft emissions and increasing fuel efficiency. What is Congress doing to support sustainable aviation fuel production as a strategy to leverage agriculture as a national economic driver?

Congress is working on a farm bill that would expand USDA bioenergy programs to support the research, development and commercialization of sustainable aviation fuel. The Denver area is home to companies leading in biofuels and new fuel technologies, and I’d love to see a farm bill that strengthens that kind of cooperation. It’s a smart way to grow our economy, support Colorado farmers, and advance American energy innovation.

Tucked inside the tax title is a revised version of the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, now projected to cost $25.7 billion over the next decade, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation’s (JCT) estimate released Saturday. That’s more than double earlier projections and surpasses the historical costs of the two major biofuel tax credits it replaces.

The credit, originally created by the Inflation Reduction Act and scheduled to expire in 2027, is now extended through 2029 under the Senate package—two years shorter than a previous proposal but still a two-year bonus for eligible producers. The change shifts the bulk of the cost to the final years, with $10.5 billion expected to hit in FY2029 alone.

That spike isn’t just due to the extension. The Senate draft preserves a controversial carveout that eliminates penalties for “indirect land use change”—the additional greenhouse gas emissions that occur when expanding biofuel production drives the conversion of forests or grasslands into farmland elsewhere. As a result, corn ethanol and soy-based biodiesel—already mandated under the Renewable Fuel Standard and subsidized since the Carter era—could again dominate the subsidy stream.

The credit’s design also opens the door to a growing renewable diesel market and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), both expected to expand dramatically by the end of the decade. If current trends continue, the cost of the credit in 2029 and 2030 could exceed even the JCT projection, especially if aviation fuel facilities ramp up production to qualify.

And that’s not all. The bill resurrects and increases the small agri-biodiesel producer tax credit, last active in 2024. It would now run from mid-2025 through 2026, layered on top of 45Z. In effect, some producers could claim multiple overlapping credits for the same gallon of fuel.

With a final Senate vote expected as early as this week, the true cost of these provisions—both fiscal and environmental—may not be fully known until long after the credits have taken effect.

SilFlow microfluidic chips enhance gas chromatography instruments enabling detailed fuel analysis

Researchers aim to determine if alternative fuels can directly replace conventional Jet A-1

Andrew Gooley, Chief Scientific Officer of Melbourne-headquartered global analytical science and device company Trajan Group (ASX:TRJ), said SAFs were being researched to minimise overall global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

“The aviation industry contributes around 2-3% of global energy-related CO2 emissions,” he said.

“It’s an area most active in research to minimize global CO2 emissions.”

Gooley said most aviation and vehicle fuels were derived from petroleum, a fossil fuel.

He explained that burning fossil fuels, including standard aviation fuel like Jet A-1, released new carbon into the atmosphere.

SAFs, however, recycle carbon already in the natural carbon cycle, making them a cleaner alternative.

‘Unravelling complexity’ of SAFs to current Jet A-1 fuel

Gooley said the problem that needs solving is whether SAFs are like for like so they could then be considered a “drop-in” fuel or substitute for Jet A-1.

“What scientists need to determine is how these fuels are different from the traditional kerosene-based Jet A-1 fuel and to do that they need to understand their chemical composition, and which components are likely to influence the properties of the fuel” he said.

To do this Gooley said scientists use gas chromatography, a laboratory technique that separates and analyses compounds in a sample by vaporising them.

In this case the scientists use a complex form of gas chromatography known as GC x GC or two-dimensional (2D) gas chromatography.

“It’s probably the most sophisticated separation technique available for this type of application – understanding how many different chemicals are in sustainable aviation fuels and how they differ from the Jet A-1” he said.

Gooley added that when analysing SAFs, scientists are working to characterise compounds which might influence the properties of the fuel, such as flash point, viscosity and freezing point.

“That’s where they use our devices to unravel the complexity of those fuels,” Gooley said.

Trajan’s SilFlow solution

As part of the components and consumables section of its business, Trajan supplies an enormous range of products for gas chromatography.

Gooley said Trajan’s SilFlow microfluidic chip could split the sample flow, enabling parallel detection simultaneously, allowing scientists to gather the full range of data needed to extract meaningful results.

“A microfluidic chip is a switch, and it allows you to take advantage of pressure to change the pathway of how a sample moves through the instrument,” he said.

“In the case of a study on sustainable aviation fuels what the scientists wanted to do was compare the data from two different detectors at the same time.”

“One was to a detector which was quantitative to measure the amount of a chemical present in the fuel and the other went to a mass spectrometer which gives the structure of the same chemical.”

Gooley said alkanes – energy-rich hydrocarbons found in both traditional and sustainable aviation fuels – are the most analysed fuel component due to their embedded energy, making them ideal as a fuel source.

“The problem is there are thousands of these alkanes due to their isomers -same molecular formula but different structural formula,” he said.

“So, when they measure the amount, they want to be able to match the structure to the chemical they’ve just measured – so precision in the switch is absolutely fundamental.”

Fluidic logic: simplifying gas chromatographs

CEO and managing director Stephen Tomisich said gas chromatography was far more powerful with “complex plumbing inside” the instruments.

“Before our device when customers were developing complex types of plumbing you could open a gas chromatograph and look inside and it looked like a bowl of spaghetti because there were tubing and connections going everywhere,” he said.

“SilFlow puts all that logic onto a chip so that instead of seeing that complex arrangement you see a very simple one that allows that direction of flow, that splitting of flow into different parts of the instrument to perform different functions to happen far more efficiently and effectively.

“Last time I counted there were around 60 or 70 different types of fluidic logic that we were using inside of these sorts of platforms around the world to enhance capabilities to do these types of measurements.”

Demand for knowledge about environmental contaminants in aviation and energy storage

Gooley said as environmental concerns around fuels and industrial activity grow, there is rising demand for technologies like SilFlow to help research scientists understand the presence of contaminants and their ecological impact.

There is also growing concern about environmental contaminants linked to fuel handling and storage – for example, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are synthetic “forever chemicals” commonly used in firefighting foams at airports and fuel sites.

Firefighting training grounds use aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) – in which PFAS is a key ingredient – resulting in long-term pollution.

Remediation of these sites is essential to limit the migration of PFAS into the water table, surrounding environments and ultimately into the food chain.

And Trajan’s environmental business unit plays a key role in supporting efforts to detect and monitor harmful contaminants.

The company’s chromatography consumables and workflows — including GC columns like BPX1 and its SilFlow splitter — are widely used in the analysis of pesticides, herbicides, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and PFAS.

Along with firefighting foams PFAS have also been used in a range of other products from water-resistant clothing to cookware and cosmetics.

“We ensure that we have no PFAS contamination in our devices and consumables so that scientists can measure the true levels of PFAS in the environmental and biological samples they are testing,” Gooley said.

He said in recent years, demand for sophisticated analytical technologies has only grown – particularly in capillary GC, comprehensive 2D GC, nano and capillary liquid chromatography (LC), and critically, their coupling with mass spectrometry.

“It goes without saying that ‘science that benefits people’ can be no better defined than monitoring the water we drink, the soils we inhabit and grow our food to monitor the presence of these toxic chemicals,” Gooley said.

The goal is clear: to cut 5% of emissions generated by the aviation sector by 2030.

Commitment to Global Aviation Sustainability

This move aligns Turkey with the emission reduction plan of the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), set to take effect in 2027. The country aims to get ahead of this global regulation by requiring airlines operating international flights to or from Turkey to incorporate a sufficient proportion of SAF into their operations.

Furthermore, the new rules mandate that airlines load at least 90% of the SAF required for these flights from Turkish territory. This not only ensures local compliance with environmental targets but also incentivizes domestic production of the fuel.

Suppliers and Refineries Also Under Pressure

The obligation does not fall solely on airlines. Aviation fuel suppliers will also be required to procure enough SAF to meet the 5% emission reduction target. The regulation will also extend to local energy giants: refineries Tupras and Socar will need to begin producing these sustainable fuels.

→ ATR Signs MoU with ATOBA ENERGY to Accelerate SAF Adoption in Regional Aviation

Tupras, the country’s largest oil refiner, has ambitious plans: it will start by producing 20,000 metric tons of SAF at one of its main plants in 2026. The goal is to scale this figure to 400,000 tons through the construction of a new unit at its Izmir refinery, pending a final investment decision.

Meanwhile, DB Tarımsal Enerji, a local biofuel company, is also joining the effort with plans to produce 100,000 tons of SAF at a new facility.

Annual Oversight and Penalties for Non-Compliance

The Turkish authority detailed that before the end of each third quarter, it will publish the minimum emission reduction targets that companies in the sector must meet. Additionally, it warned that penalties will be imposed on airlines and suppliers that fail to comply with the new provisions.

Why Is This Measure Important?

Aviation currently accounts for 2.5% of global CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. While this may seem like a small proportion, the sector’s projected growth and the challenges of decarbonizing it place it at the center of international climate efforts.

In this context, Turkey seeks to position itself as a regional leader in the transition to cleaner aviation while boosting its domestic SAF industry and ensuring a robust local supply.

Decline in Fuel Demand: An Opportunity

SEVILLE, Spain (Reuters) -A group of countries including France, Kenya, Spain and Barbados pledged on Monday to tax premium-class flying and private jets in a bid to raise funds for climate action and sustainable development.

As many richer nations scale back official development aid for countries even as extreme weather events increase in frequency and severity, some are looking to find new sources of finance, including by taxing polluting industries.

The announcement on the opening day of a U.N. development summit in Seville, Spain, was one of the first to emerge from the “Sevilla Platform for Action” that aims to deliver on the renewed global financing framework agreed ahead of the event.

“The aim is to help improve green taxation and foster international solidarity by promoting more progressive and harmonised tax systems,” the office of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a statement.

The initiative, which was co-signed by Sierra Leone, Benin and Somalia, will get technical support from the European Commission, it added.

All are members of the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force, launched in November 2023 to explore new forms of taxation that could help support developing countries’ efforts to decarbonise and protect themselves against the impacts of climate change.

As well as an aviation tax, which could raise billions of dollars, the task force said in a recent report that other sectors that could potentially be taxed more include shipping, oil and gas, cryptocurrencies and the super-rich.

Rebecca Newsom of environmentalist group Greenpeace called the move “an important step towards ensuring that the binge users of this undertaxed sector are made to pay their fair share”.

She added that the “obvious” next step was to hold oil and gas corporations to account.

“We have to think about sustainability holistically,” Ricci said.","Kennedy Ricci was born with aviation in his blood, coming from a long line of aviation professionals on both sides of his family. After starting his career in marketing and social media, he was ultimately drawn to aviation partially due to the passionate people who make up the industry.

A GA pilot himself with a commercial rating, Ricci is also passionate about sustainability, which inspired him to launch 4AIR, a company offering turnkey solutions for aviation sustainability needs.

Ricci attributes some of his passion for sustainability to experiences from his childhood. “We traveled a lot when I was younger,” Ricci said. “I was homeschooled in eighth grade and our travels exposed me to different cultures.” Ricci’s travels with his family often included destinations in remote and unusual locations. “That exposure showed me what’s out there and what’s worth protecting in the world – environmentally, culturally and socially,” he said. “Aviation gave me access to these things, and it’s very important to me that we preserve that access.”

New Horizons: AAM Leader Wants to ‘Change the Pilot Workforce’

Millennials and Gen Z consider the environmental impact of decisions more heavily than previous generations, Ricci believes. “Previous generations have laid the foundation, but it’s more top of mind for current generations. You see more people making decisions based on what the impact will be,” he said. “Sustainability is part of this generation’s purchasing decisions. Part of that is because we will live to see the impacts of our decisions.”

When Ricci considers sustainability, he isn’t talking about reducing or eliminating certain modes of transportation. He thinks about continuing what the industry is doing in a sustainable way.

“We have to think long term about aviation’s role, though, beyond just the next few years,” Ricci said. “Electric aircraft are a great option, but won’t cover every type of mission. Hydrogen is likely even further off in the future.”

For now, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and carbon offsets are viable methods of achieving sustainability, though SAF availability is currently limited. Carbon offsets, he said, have evolved since their early days, with several credible solutions available. “We have to think about sustainability holistically,” Ricci said. “If we want to see aviation thrive, we need to think about it not just environmentally, but by its impact socially, culturally and economically.”",https://nbaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kenndy-Ricc-New-Horizons-July-August-2025.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 17:12:28.746094

The summer season is finally upon us! I hope you and your family are able to enjoy the sunshine and spend time taking advantage of all the fun that Pure Michigan summer activities have to offer. Even though summer break is here for our youngest Michiganders, the Legislature remains hard at work.

From standing up to federal cuts to nutrition programs and advancing gun safety policies to holding polluters accountable and protecting Michigan renters and consumers, we’ve had a busy few weeks at the Capitol. Keep reading to learn more about these efforts and the steps we’re taking to build a healthier, safer, and more prosperous Michigan for all who call our state home.

Sincerely,

Supporting Michigan Renters — Senate Democrats recently introduced a comprehensive bill package to strengthen protections and break barriers for Michiganders trying to access rental housing. This legislation works to lower costs for renters, hold landlords accountable, and allow for the expungement of eviction records.

Holding Polluters Accountable — Another large-scale legislative package introduced recently would protect public health and our environment by strengthening Michigan’s pollution clean-up laws. This legislation would hold polluters accountable by requiring more thorough cleanups as well as empowering those harmed by pollution to seek justice.

Protecting Michigan Consumers — Long overdue legislation to restore power to the Michigan Consumer Protection Act by equipping the Attorney General with the authority to hold bad actors and businesses accountable recently passed the Senate floor. Senate Bill 134 — legislation I’m proud to have sponsored — would also enhance education efforts to reduce scams and strengthen penalties for violations against elderly and vulnerable adults. And, to protect Michigan consumers from disruptive, deceptive telephone solicitation tactics, the Telephone Solicitation Act was also introduced recently. This bipartisan bill package would prohibit telephone solicitors from engaging in misleading, exploitative business practices and grant the Attorney General the authority to act against violators.

Building a Future Free from Gun Violence

From big cities to small rural towns, gun violence hits communities in every corner of our state. To keep our communities safe from this senseless gun violence, my colleagues and I championed a slate of gun safety policies, including legislation to:

Strengthen background checks to close the private sale loophole;

Promote safe storage by creating child access protection laws to keep legal firearms safely and securely stored and out of the hands of children and teens;

Allow courts to issue Extreme Risk Protection Orders to temporarily intervene and suspend a person’s access to firearms if they show clear warning signs of violence and pose an immediate threat to themselves or others;

Protect survivors of domestic violence by preventing those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes from possessing, using, purchasing, or carrying a firearm in Michigan for eight years; and

Safeguard the democratic process and protect voters by prohibiting an individual from possessing a firearm at or near a polling place, an early voting site, an absentee voter ballot drop box, and other spaces where election work is occurring.

Building on this progress, the Senate passed legislation this week that would:

Prohibit bump stocks, a device that can convert semi-automatic firearms into deadly weapons that have a fire rate similar to that of a machine gun;

Address ghost guns, which are fully functioning, untraceable firearms and the fastest-growing gun safety problem facing our country; and

Keep the Michigan Capitol complex safe from gun violence to ensure a secure environment for students, teachers, parents, advocates, and lawmakers.

These actions come during National Gun Violence Awareness Month when communities across the nation come together to honor survivors of gun violence and build community with those working to address this pervasive issue.

Senate Hearings Highlight Risks of Proposed Cuts to Families, Farms, and Food Access

As Washington Republicans’ sweeping and short-sighted budget bill currently makes its way through Congress, Michigan Senate Democrats recently held two committee hearings to examine how their plan threatens the health and well-being of Michigan families and farmers across the state.

In order to afford a massive $4 trillion tax break for the wealthiest Americans, Congressional Republicans are proposing a $300 billion cut in SNAP funding, in addition to adding unnecessary red tape for program participants and threatening the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). If signed into law, these cuts would directly disrupt and devastate millions of Michiganders who rely on these benefits to put food on their table and meet their nutritional needs. They would also further exacerbate economic instability for Michigan families, farmers, and communities by slashing resources for local food banks and the state’s agricultural industry. To read more about the impact of these cuts, click here.

These committee hearings build on Senate Democrats’ previous efforts to examine and uplift the impact of federal cuts and actions on families and communities around the state. Learn more here.

Happy Juneteenth! Observed on June 19 every year, Juneteenth commemorates the day that the last people who were enslaved in the U.S. learned of their freedom — June 19, 1865, over two years after President Abraham Lincoln presented the Emancipation Proclamation.

The significance of Juneteenth extends beyond its historical roots. It symbolizes triumph over the injustices of slavery and stands as a testament to the progress made and the work still needed to achieve true freedom and equality for all. As we celebrate this day, please know that I remain committed to fighting for equity and justice so that all people are not only free but can have access to opportunity here in Michigan.

The project represents part of ongoing revitalization efforts at the airport.

“With its proximity to the city’s business district and automotive industry, this new general aviation terminal will serve as a gateway to commerce, tourism and opportunity,” said Joe Meszaros, vice president of operations at Avflight. “It will stand as a beacon of growth, job creation and educational opportunity for Detroit citizens.”

The facility will provide fuel and ground handling services for general aviation aircraft. The company has operated at KDET since 2011 and plans to double its staff as part of the expansion.

The project builds on recent airport improvements including a US$3.5 million runway renovation and LED taxi lighting upgrades. Planned investments include ramp pavement improvements, an engineered material arresting system, and a new control tower scheduled for 2026.

“This groundbreaking celebrates more than just bricks and mortar—it symbolizes renewed momentum for Coleman A. Young International Airport,” said Meszaros. “With Avflight’s partnership and the city’s ongoing investments, KDET is positioned to become a gateway that drives economic vitality.”

Avflight operates as part of the Avfuel-branded network of more than 675 fixed-base operators worldwide. The company has developed facilities across North America and Europe.

The Detroit facility will incorporate sustainable aviation fuel capabilities, electric charging infrastructure, and ground support equipment. Avflight plans to expand educational partnerships aimed at fostering aviation careers among Detroit youth.

The company’s investment reflects confidence in KDET’s potential as a general aviation hub. The airport serves Detroit’s business district and automotive industry with general aviation access.

Construction will expand Avflight’s service offerings while supporting the airport’s broader economic development goals.

In 2025, 95% of executives said that supply chain pressure was a key driver of their organizations’ reindustrialization, following an increase in supply chain disruptions in 2024.
Near- and reshoring can help companies keep better track of their sustainability goals, reducing the emissions caused by shipping products around the globe and giving them greater control over their manufacturing facilities’ emissions.

For many organizations in Europe and the U.S., a desire to reduce lead times, avoid supply chain disruptions, and navigate the impact of regulations and tariffs is encouraging the nearshoring and reshoring trend. Manufacturing closer to home also gives businesses greater control over their products and brings them closer to their customers.

In 2025, 95% of executives said that supply chain pressure was a key driver of their organizations’ reindustrialization, following an increase in supply chain disruptions in 2024. More than half of executives reported that they were reducing their reliance on Chinese products and were prepared to pay a premium to produce in domestic markets.

In Europe, regulation is also driving nearshoring: the E.U.'s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism taxes carbon-intensive goods entering the E.U. Near- and reshoring can help companies keep better track of their sustainability goals, reducing the emissions caused by shipping products around the globe and giving them greater control over their manufacturing facilities’ emissions.

Of course, moving production to countries with higher costs of living can mean an increase in labor, land and infrastructure costs, as well as raw materials. Nearshoring can help companies achieve the best of both worlds by alleviating supply chain problems by bringing manufacturing closer to home, while still keeping costs down. For example, for U.S. businesses, nearshoring in either Mexico or Canada can be more cost-effective than moving production back home.

Reshoring and nearshoring in practice

In Europe, car manufacturers have begun moving their electrical vehicle production away from China. Earlier this year, Swedish automotive manufacturer Polestar announced its first electrical vehicle to be built in Europe, the Polestar 7.[1] With most of its sales in Europe, the company is reducing its reliance on Chinese manufacturing and moving production closer to its key customers.

Last year, Volvo also began to shift production of its EVs to Belgium as part of a similar strategy to build its cars where they sell best. To make EX30 production possible in Ghent, the company made investments worth around €200 million to upgrade its Belgian facility. Wide-ranging changes to the plant include the addition of a completely new car platform, the installation of almost 600 new or refurbished robots, an extension of the battery hall, a new door production line as well as a new battery pack assembly line. Between its Swedish and Belgian facilities, Volvo now builds 10 of its electric and hybrid models in Europe. Stefan Fesser, Manager of Volvo’s Ghent plant, said that the company was able to make the move in record time thanks to technology: ""New technology and innovation enable[d] us to react more flexibly to market demands.”[2]

Last year, British pharma company GSK announced an investment of more than £200 million to strengthen its manufacturing network in the U.K. The cash will be spent upgrading its existing manufacturing site in Scotland, and constructing new facilities and assembly lines.[3] Elsewhere in pharma, Roche, Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, AbbVie, Gilead and Bristol Myers Squibb have announced a combined $200 billion of investments in U.S. manufacturing facilities.[4]

In February, Apple announced it would spend more than $500 billion over the next four years, expanding its facilities in Michigan, Texas, California, Arizona, Nevada, Iowa, Oregon, North Carolina, and Washington. It also plan to build a new factory in Texas. Its new 250,000-square-foot facility will assemble servers that it previously manufactured outside the states.[5]

Can technology ease the transition?

In today’s increasingly volatile world, it seems cost is no longer the most important consideration for many businesses. While businesses consider this transition, some are finding that having an up-to-date digital strategy is helping them ease this transition and reduce the costs associated with reshoring. Capgemini reported that 54% of organizations have already saved more than 20% on costs by using digital technologies in their reindustrialization efforts.

Manufacturing facilities that use technologies such as digital twins, data analytics and AI can reduce costs by improving their monitoring, streamlining operations, and enhancing productivity. Look out for part 2, where we will explore how companies can set themselves up for success with a digital framework that ensures their operations run efficiently.",https://www.aveva.com/content/dam/aveva/our-industrial-life/js/fav-icon/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-30 14:05:05.600131

The first leg to Bangkok spans over 9,600 kilometers, making it the longest A321XLR flight to date. The second leg from Bangkok (BKK) to Sydney (SYD) adds another 7,600 kilometers, totaling 42 hours door-to-door with 21 hours of flight time.

This delivery follows the aircraft’s customer acceptance flight and signifies Qantas’ next-generation push toward longer-range, fuel-efficient narrowbody operations. The A321XLR will allow Qantas to explore thinner long-haul routes without sacrificing efficiency or passenger comfort.

The A321XLR is the first of 28 such aircraft on order by Qantas. With a range of 8,700 kilometers (4,700 nautical miles), it is the longest-range narrowbody aircraft currently available. Qantas plans to deploy this aircraft on routes that require greater range but do not justify a widebody.

Its cabin, the widest among narrowbody jets, features significant passenger enhancements: wider economy seats, increased baggage capacity (60% more space), larger windows, and more seats in both economy and business classes. Ambient LED lighting and higher ceilings also contribute to a modern, spacious interior.

More than 45,000 hours of training have been completed by Qantas personnel in preparation for the A321XLR’s service entry. Nearly 1,000 staff—pilots, cabin crew, engineers, and ground staff—have undergone type-specific training.

Beyond operational upgrades, the aircraft introduces substantial environmental benefits. Its lightweight materials and aerodynamic design contribute to reduced fuel burn and lower CO₂ emissions per seat, supporting Qantas’ sustainability objectives.

CEO Remarks on the Milestone Delivery

Qantas Domestic CEO Markus Svensson commented on the significance of the aircraft’s arrival:

Strategic Fleet Modernisation

Qantas Group has committed to 40 Airbus A321XLRs as part of its broader fleet renewal program. Of these, 28 will join Qantas’ mainline fleet, while 12 are allocated to Jetstar (JQ), its low-cost subsidiary.

These aircraft are part of the airline group’s outstanding order for 128 Airbus single-aisle jets and 24 A350-1000s, aimed at boosting efficiency and sustainability.

The A321XLR is a key asset in Qantas’ post-pandemic strategy, enabling cost-effective expansion into new medium-haul markets.

For Jetstar, the type offers enhanced range and comfort compared to its current narrow-body fleet, potentially opening up longer leisure routes.

Airbus A321XLR: Technical Edge and Environmental Goals

The A321XLR represents the latest evolution of the A320neo family, developed to address increasing market demand for longer single-aisle operations.

It delivers a 30% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to previous-generation aircraft, thanks in part to aerodynamic enhancements and new engine technology.

To date, Airbus has secured over 500 orders for the A321XLR. The aircraft is certified to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability across its fleet by 2030, aligning with global decarbonization goals.

“Blending mandates alone are insufficient to create a self-sustaining SAF market,” said Bettina Petzold, Head of Corporate Responsibility at Lufthansa Cargo.

By 2010, certification had been extended to all German stations, and in 2015 Lufthansa Cargo received global ISO 14001 certification.","Lufthansa Cargo is aligning itself with Europe’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, but it’s also pushing back—arguing that the current framework risks undermining the competitiveness of EU carriers. As the 2025 deadline for a 2 percent SAF blend approaches, the German carrier is calling for a neutral regulatory approach or a carbon border adjustment to level the playing field.

“Blending mandates alone are insufficient to create a self-sustaining SAF market,” said Bettina Petzold, Head of Corporate Responsibility at Lufthansa Cargo. “The EU policy does not address the significant supply and price issues: biogenic SAF is only available in small quantities and costs three to five times more than fossil kerosene. In 2023, SAF could only cover around 0.2 percent of the fuel needed worldwide. Due to the limited supply, prices will remain high in the foreseeable future.”

The company also flagged disparities in the global playing field: “The current regulatory framework puts EU carriers at a significant competitive disadvantage in the global aviation market, particularly against competitors from the Gulf, the Bosporus, and China,” she noted. “Therefore, we demand a regulatory framework that is neutral regarding the EU’s SAF blending mandate, or the introduction of a fair Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism for airlines that evade the mandate. Additionally, we request political measures to ramp-up the SAF market.”

Carbon tracking at shipment level and scalable SAF deals

Lufthansa Cargo is not just lobbying—it is already deploying SAF in volume, backed by a layered offering for customers of all sizes.

“We offer three services that allow our customers to transparently and verifiably reduce their carbon footprint through the purchase of SAF,” said Petzold. “Our add-on service, ‘Sustainable Choice’, is available worldwide on all routes, for all capacities, and for all products. It enables us to reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80%. This can already be done automatically and online. This offer is particularly interesting for project business and, in addition to our large customers, appeals to small and medium-sized forwarders as well.”

“In combination with ‘Sustainable Choice’, you can choose to offset emissions further. The Lufthansa Group’s providers for this include myclimate, SQUAKE and ClimatePartner.”

Bulk and charter deals are also on the table. “We also offer so-called SAF ‘bulk deals’ for larger purchases of 100 tons or more of SAF. In this case, the use of SAF is allocated to precisely identified transportation to avoid double-counting usage globally. Special SAF ‘charter deals’ are available for regular, recurring transport on precisely defined routes.”

Regardless of the model chosen, Petzold emphasised traceability: “We prioritise providing premium-quality SAF produced from biogenic residues, such as used cooking oils – not palm oil. Every purchase is officially certified by an external auditor. Anyone using Lufthansa Cargo SAF can rest assured that they are doing so in compliance with regulations.”

As for the scale of impact so far? “By using SAF and making a contribution to high-quality climate protection projects, around 8,500 tonnes of CO2 were saved in 2024,” she said.

The actual SAF share by route is still being calculated. “We will be able to make very specific statements on the SAF share on our routes in the first quarter of 2026.”

Data-driven optimisation and future-ready fleet

Digital tools are playing a growing role in Lufthansa Cargo’s carbon reduction strategy—especially in fuel efficiency.

“Our Fuel Efficiency Team utilises proprietary analysis software that enables comprehensive evaluation of fuel consumption across all flight phases,” said Petzold. “The use of such tools is essential for effective fuel monitoring – both in terms of flight safety and fuel efficiency. These applications are continuously being enhanced, with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. This will generate even deeper analytical insights in the future.”

She added: “Additionally, we are currently implementing further analytic tools that resemble ‘digital twins’ and can predict kerosene consumption changes based on various external factors, such as modifications to aircraft that may affect fuel consumption. This technology, however, is still in the development phase.”

Lufthansa Cargo has already overhauled its fleet for climate performance. “Since October 2021, we have switched our long-haul fleet completely to the Boeing 777F – today’s most modern freighter with the best environmental performance in its class. Lufthansa Cargo currently operates a total of twelve Boeing 777Fs in its long-haul fleet. The company has also ordered seven B777-8 freighters from Boeing’s latest generation of wide-body freighters to be delivered by 2030. According to the manufacturer, this freighter model offers the opportunity to be around 13 percent more efficient than the 777F currently in service.”

“In addition to the fleet modernisation and deployment of SAF, we are also using other levers in the management of our flight operations, which target a reduction of our emissions by an additional 4 percent by 2030.”

System-wide approach to climate accountability

Lufthansa Cargo’s sustainability work is underpinned by a global environmental management system that’s been maturing since 2007.

“CO2 and noise data were already being recorded in the 1990s, which formed the basis for the subsequent introduction of the system. The aim was to deal with environmental issues in a structured manner and to establish clear responsibilities and processes,” Petzold explained.

“The first certification according to the international environmental standard ISO 14001 was obtained in 2008 at the Frankfurt site. By 2010, certification had been extended to all German stations, and in 2015 Lufthansa Cargo received global ISO 14001 certification. This can only be achieved together with our globally active environmental ambassadors, colleagues who are also environmental professionals on site and are familiar with the coordination of the relevant processes.”

The system evolves continuously. “The environmental guidelines were revised in 2012, 2016, and 2023 to take account of new developments. In 2024, the worldwide environmental management system was again recertified according to ISO 14001.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Page-9-NEW_B777F_PPT_Min-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 12:14:21.793044

With 140+ global central banks now looking to deploy NGFS short-term scenarios for financial sector supervisory purposes – the outcomes of upcoming stress test exercises deploying the new scenarios will be closely watched.","The Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) is comprised of 144 central banks and supervisors, plus 21 observers (as of 11 March, 2025[1]) committed to knowledge sharing and development of climate and environment-related risk management in the financial sector – mobilising finance to support transition to a sustainable economy.

After five iterations of the NGFS long-term climate scenarios and following user feedback from the financial community, the NGFS published new short-term scenarios (through 2030) on 07 May 2025.[2] The intention is to provide ‘decision useful’ scenario outputs focussed on the current business, credit and electoral cycle which better reflect investment horizons.

Baseline Scenarios

The baseline scenario is calibrated using the October 2023 IMF World Economic Outlook projections:

• The macroeconomic variables used to align the models to the IMF projections are GDP, inflation, technical progress, sectoral growth, population levels, and consumption patterns.

The impact of COVID-19 and the energy price shocks of 2022 are considered in the calibration of the monetary policy response.

Key innovations of the NGFS short-term scenarios include:

modelling of compound extreme climate events (simultaneous occurrences of multiple bundled hazards such as floods & storms (wet); and heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires (dry));

incorporating cross-regional transmission of shocks (short-term spillover effects of both transition and physical shocks through trade and financial linkages);

providing a framework to study the interplay between climate risks and business cycles, by integrating climate policy, extreme weather events, economic trends and sectoral dynamics;

zooming in on a policy-relevant timeframe for financial stability and monetary policy;

providing granular economic and financial data across a wide range of sectors and countries, and capturing the inflationary impacts of climate damages.[3]

The NGFS suggest ‘these features make the short-term scenarios well-suited for climate stress-testing exercises and for analysing financial risks that may materialise within a business-planning, policy- relevant timeframe’.[4]

Four distinct narrative scenarios are presented – exploring diverging levels of climate policy action and physical climate risk to 2030.

Key Messages of the Short-Term Scenario Outputs Include

The possible occurrence of a sequence of plausible but extreme weather events in one region causes substantial GDP losses, with effects on the global economy. The impacts of these extreme disasters vary across regions, with losses peaking at 12.5% of GDP in Africa. Effects of regional disasters affect the global economy through trade and financial linkages.

Default probabilities rise significantly for high-capital and high-debt sectors, with increases of more than 10pp in the power supply sector (albeit from a low base).[5]

Rapid and unexpected policy shifts increase the economic costs of transitioning and cause additional financial stress. A delayed and abrupt transition generates global output losses of 1.3% (each year) and increases the unemployment rate by 1.3pp. Default probabilities rise significantly in several sectors, with increases of more than 10pp in the power supply sector, due to its high capital intensity and high debt to capital ratio.[6]

What the short-term scenarios get right?

The short-term scenario narratives include four plausible story lines with varying assumptions around the short-term evolution of climate policies and physical climate risk. This storyline approach to qualitative climate scenarios is broadly comparable to the approach TREX analysis take with narrative based scenarios – first developed with Exeter University and USS[7] to be more intuitive for pension fund trustees.

The short-term scenarios focus on the period 2025 – 2030 – a window of time deemed “decision useful” for institutional investors, corporate financial planning and politics, with 2030 a key waypoint towards net-zero 2050 targets.

The focus on hardest hit regions (Africa, Asia) and sectors (agriculture, fossil energy/ coal) provides investors with actionable information regarding how the differing pace of transition and manifestation of climate risk is likely to impact GDP output, default rates, and capital costs in regions and key sectors in which they invest, especially energy, where viable transition plans are lacking.

What the short-term scenarios could improve?

Like the NGFS long-term scenarios, due to the inherent uncertainties, the short-term scenarios exclude the plausible possibility of triggering climate tipping points – potentially resulting in cascading physical climate damages[8] – thus ignoring potential for catastrophic risks.

Sovereign default risks, as in the long-term scenarios appear insufficiently captured. Page 66 of the Technical Documentation[9] states: sovereign default probability can be approximated by a linear combination of sectoral default probabilities (if the latter are calibrated on the same exogenous default probability as the former). Petrostates reliant on high fossil prices and demand with high fiscal breakeven prices are uniquely exposed to a moderately paced transition – refer CTI Vulnerability Chart – Petrostates of Decline (2023) report[10].

The distorting impacts of subsidies – such as the estimated $7 trillion annual global subsidy to prop up fossil fuels (IMF 2022) – are not captured.[11]

By design, there is no probability of occurrence attributed to each narrative scenario – the NGFS suggest “to address this – you can either hire experts to share expert opinions – or rely on the market to infer default expectations”[12]. The scenarios are primarily designed for stress-testing, not intended as forecasts.

The accompanying technical documentation pg 5 states: “In terms of the interplay between transition and physical risks in the short-term time horizon, it is important to note that transition risk has little to no impact on physical risk over the short- term scenario forecast horizon of five years. Climate change impacts experienced now are the result of past GHG emissions and concentration in the atmosphere.” – While this is true for CO2 (10yrs + lag), other emissions, notably methane and aerosols are much faster acting – and should be considered separately[13] according to the Global Heat Reduction Initiative.[14] Around 30% of all post-industrial warming has been caused by methane[15], yet emissions are standardised for accounting purposes into tonnes CO2 equivalent.[16] Given the recent expansion of gas power and LNG in the global energy mix, faster acting methane emissions should be accounted for separately, to better reflect the short-term warming impacts of the dash for gas.

The NGFS short-term scenarios are said to have ‘limited comparability’ with the long-term scenarios, due to different modelling approaches.

NGFS Comparisons With Investment Consultants Narrative Scenarios

TREX analysis have published their own assessment of NGFS scenarios against their own short-term scenarios which can be read in full here.[17]

TREX representation of 3 of 4 NGFS Scenarios (no Disasters/Policy Stagnation)

Equivalent GDP damages in TREX NTTL Narrative Scenarios

In terms of both GDP damages, and the pace of adoption of new scientific research and modelling techniques – it should be noted that relative to individual investment consultants, the NGFS is constrained by its large and geographically dispersed international membership and governance model of consensus decision making.[18]

The objective of the NGFS is to support the widespread adoption of practices by financial sector actors and policy makers to include climate considerations in their assessments and analyses. Standardisation of approach and comparability across institutions is key, adopting well established climate assumptions and models for the production of scenarios.

As observable in other consensus-based forums such as the IPCC or COP – it is commonplace for outputs agreed by consensus to lag cutting edge science, particularly on knowledge frontier topics like climate tipping points, where uncertainty remains.

In areas of imperfect knowledge, but catastrophic potential risks, scientists advocate for the precautionary principle to reduce the likelihood of occurrence, until we know risks can be avoided.

Conclusion

Drawing attention to the heightened default risks for exposed sectors in the NGFS short-term scenarios may prove to be more effective at changing investor behaviour than the more typical % global GDP damage figures frequently cited in long-term scenario analysis. Investors own stocks and bonds, not GDP.

As a recently emerging practice, the relationship between higher future damages in climate scenario analysis, and resulting investor behaviours, such as revised net zero target setting, investment tilts and increased allocations to solutions remains both poorly studied and understood.

With 140+ global central banks now looking to deploy NGFS short-term scenarios for financial sector supervisory purposes – the outcomes of upcoming stress test exercises deploying the new scenarios will be closely watched.

With ‘decision useful’ scenarios – the NGFS is heading in the right direction, but there is more work to be done to ensure that financial sector expectations of future physical climate damages are aligned with climate science.

Ultimately, it is what happens to real-world financed emissions that counts.

Sustainable supply chains

Ecolab is dedicated to limiting the effect of its operations on the environment, with consideration for the amount of waste it is generating and sending to landfill.

Beyond its own eco-friendly practices, the company works with supply chain partners to identify how GHG emissions can be reduced. It holds its suppliers accountable through supplier surveying mechanisms.

As a result of these biannual ethical and environmental sourcing surveys, Ecolab can monitor and improve sustainability performance across the chain.

Through its collaboration efforts, Ecolab placed on CDP’s 2024 Supplier Engagement Assessment Leaderboard as recognition for its thorough engagement with supply chains.

In 2023, Ecolab and other industry players launched the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Hub in a bid to tackle the large amounts of GHG emissions produced by aviation. It continued its collaboration in 2024, taking these measures to reduce aviation carbon footprint.

Last year, Ecolab ensured it remained a sustainable company, moving towards its 2030 100% renewable electricity goals. The company achieved 70% renewable electricity globally due to its 100% renewable electricity usage across European Union operations.

As a result of Ecolab’s progress in meeting GHG emissions targets, it gained recognition and approval from the Science-based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

Reflecting on Ecolab’s practices, Christophe Beck, Chairman and CEO of Ecolab, comments: “In our own operations, we improved water use efficiency, reduced our carbon footprint and cultivated a winning team that reflects our communities and champions our culture of safety.”

Elsewhere, Ecolab sponsors Disability:IN and the Women’s Business Enterprise National Council (WBENC) Chemical Industry Accelerator, boosting supply chain resilience and creating opportunities for diverse and underrepresented communities.

Moreover, Ecolab’s suppliers must meet its supplier ethical assessment, which actively addresses human rights within supply chains.

Its partners must be able to verify they meet Ecolab’s criteria of ethical practices, particularly in areas where there is a higher risk of slavery and human trafficking.

The impact

Supply chains, including those concerned with water supply, bear the brunt of global disruptions such as climate change, economic fluctuations, population growth and public health concerns.

As a result, many companies are seeing increased operating costs and a shortage of resources.

The World Resources Institute projects a 56% water deficit by 2030, so Ecolab is working to identify and implement water reduction and reuse solutions.

Ecolab efforts have helped billions of people around the world, both from a financial and safety perspective.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6920fe0b22d5e8554499c3ab44fd13e1:db1a0ca357d46101962b3580ca519654/gettyimages-1825593532.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 12:15:15.461460

The 2025 edition, held in June, was marked by a strong focus on sustainability, with new technologies, major commercial orders and cross-sector partnerships all aimed at reducing aviation’s environmental impact.

Aviation is under increasing scrutiny to address its carbon footprint. The industry faces the dual challenge of meeting growing demand for air travel while achieving ambitious net-zero targets.

This year’s airshow reflected a clear shift: sustainability is now central to business strategy, investment and innovation.

Key trends included the rapid adoption of the lower-carbon alternative, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF); advances in hydrogen and electric propulsion – increasing the decarbonization potential of the sector; and a renewed focus on regional and short-haul efficiency to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.

Fleet renewal with a green edge

Improving aircraft efficiency and reducing fuel consumption is an essential component of airlines’ journey to net zero and air shows typically see many new orders being announced.

Airbus secured nearly $21 billion in new deals, including a landmark agreement with VietJet for 100 A321neo aircraft – jets that are popular for their range, capacity and improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions compared to previous models.

Riyadh Air’s order for 25 Airbus A350-1000s, paired with 50 Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines, further underscored the industry’s shift toward cleaner, more efficient fleets.

Even in the training sector, sustainability is taking centre stage: ENAC’s 30-plane order from Elixir Aircraft, France’s national civil aviation school, will see new training aircraft use advanced carbon composites and consume up to 70% less fuel than traditional models.

Breakthroughs in aircraft and propulsion technologies

It wasn’t just about buying new planes, but what powers them and how they’re built. Airbus drew attention with its world-record 1.2 megawatt (MW) aviation fuel cell system, a major step toward hydrogen-powered flight.

The company also unveiled aerodynamic innovations such as the eXtra Performance Wing, which could cut fuel consumption by up to 10%. Meanwhile, MagniX’s new high-energy-density battery (400 watts per kilogram) is bringing electric and hybrid-electric regional flights closer to reality.

Rotorcraft weren’t left out: the Airbus Racer helicopter demonstrator, developed under the Clean Sky 2 European initiative, achieved 20–30% lower fuel consumption than conventional helicopters. These advances show how new materials, smarter design and alternative propulsion are converging to make aviation cleaner and more efficient.

Sustainable fuels take centre stage

SAF was a recurring theme, with the industry recognizing it as the most immediate lever for reducing emissions. TotalEnergies’ 15-year agreement with Quatra to secure 60,000 tonnes of used cooking oil annually for SAF production is a sign of how supply chains are scaling up.

ATR’s partnership with ATOBA Energy aims to make 100% SAF capability a reality for regional aircraft, showing that collaboration between manufacturers and energy providers is key to accelerating adoption.

Hydrogen-powered aviation also made tangible progress, with several companies moving from research to real-world demonstration. ZeroAvia announced it had secured new UK government funding for its Liquid Hydrogen System Integration & Flight Test (LH-SIFT) project, which will see the world’s first liquid hydrogen-powered commercial airframe testbed.

The company also signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Loganair, aiming to bring zero-emission, hydrogen-electric engines to regional routes in the UK and is establishing a hydrogen fuel cell manufacturing centre near Glasgow Airport to support future deployment.

HyFlux also gained momentum by winning a UK government grant to advance its hydrogen-electric propulsion technology, which uses superconducting motors and cryogenic cooling. These achievements will support the acceleration of zero-emission transport innovation, further strengthening the sector’s hydrogen ecosystem.

Collaboration at the heart

None of these advances happen in isolation. The airshow highlighted the power of multistakeholder collaboration, with public and private sectors, manufacturers, airlines, energy companies and research institutes all working together.

The launch of the ARIS (Aviation Research and Innovation Strategy for Sustainability) programme marked a fitting finale: this Europe-wide initiative brings together research institutes, manufacturers, air traffic management providers and policymakers to focus on zero-emission aircraft, digital air traffic management and workforce upskilling.

It’s a clear signal that the industry recognizes the magnitude of the challenge and the necessity of collaboration to address it.

The wider geopolitical context

Driven by the current geopolitical landscape, many exhibitors and industry leaders showcased advanced defence technologies and defence systems and dual-use innovations.

The growing emphasis on security reflects the sector’s need to balance decarbonization goals with the realities of a rapidly changing global context.

However, the air show demonstrated that sustainability is now at the heart of aviation’s business strategy. The industry is transitioning from pilot projects to large-scale orders, long-term supply agreements and coordinated research, signalling real momentum toward net zero.

While challenges remain, such as scaling SAF production, certifying new propulsion systems and modernizing infrastructure, the collaborative efforts seen at Le Bourget show that progress is accelerating.

Major orders for fuel-efficient aircraft advances in hydrogen and electric propulsion and new SAF partnerships all point to a sector in transformation.

Continued collaboration among manufacturers, airlines, energy providers and policymakers will be essential to deliver on the promise of net-zero flights and keep the industry aligned with global climate goals.

Next: Dubai Airshow 2025

The contract is in alignment with the ambitious environmental targets of BA, particularly the goal of powering 10% of its planes by 2030 using SAF. The contract is significant for the company in meeting its goal of reducing its carbon footprint and achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

The deal between BA and Hong Kong-based EcoCeres will see the airline reduce carbon emissions by approximately 400,000 metric tonnes over the lifecycle of the SAF compared to traditional kerosene-based jet fuel. According to EcoCeres, this reduction is equivalent to the emissions generated by 240,000 economy class passengers traveling on round-trip flights between London and New York.

A Bold Commitment to Sustainable Aviation Fuel

The partnership is a key part of British Airways’ broader sustainability strategy. The airline has already made significant strides in using SAF, with 2.7 percent of its total fuel use in 2024 coming from sustainable sources. Carrie Harris, BA’s Director of Sustainability, highlighted the importance of SAF in the airline’s ongoing efforts to reduce its carbon intensity. Since 2019, British Airways has successfully reduced its carbon intensity by 13 percent, with SAF playing a crucial role in achieving that target.

“In 2024 alone, SAF accounted for 2.7 percent of British Airways’ total fuel use and is contributing to our achievement of a 13 percent reduction in our carbon intensity since 2019,” Harris said in a statement. She further emphasized the significance of the EcoCeres deal, calling it “another important step forward on our journey to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.”

Regulatory Support for SAF Adoption

The British Airways-EcoCeres agreement comes at a time when the aviation industry is facing increasing regulatory pressure to reduce its environmental impact. As part of efforts to curb aviation emissions, governments worldwide, including the UK and EU, have introduced mandates requiring airlines to incorporate at least 2 percent SAF into their total fuel mix by 2025. This regulation aims to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the aviation industry, pushing airlines toward cleaner, more sustainable fuel options.

The growth of SAF is considered a crucial part of the aviation industry’s efforts to reduce its overall carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which is derived from fossil fuels, SAF is produced using renewable resources, including waste oils and agricultural residues. As a result, SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel.

EcoCeres’ Role in Advancing Sustainability

EcoCeres, which operates a processing facility for alternative aviation fuels in Jiangsu, China, is a key player in the development of SAF. The company’s commitment to sustainability and innovation is reflected in its partnership with British Airways, which helps both companies contribute to the broader aviation industry’s environmental goals.

Matti Lievonen, CEO of EcoCeres, expressed the company’s dedication to sustainable fuel production. “Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering, and this partnership exemplifies our dedication to providing innovative fuel solutions that will help the aviation industry meet its environmental targets,” Lievonen said. EcoCeres’ facilities in China are focused on producing SAF using sustainable methods, which significantly reduce emissions when compared to traditional aviation fuel.

Expansion of SAF Production with LanzaJet

In addition to the EcoCeres deal, British Airways is backing several other SAF production initiatives globally. One such initiative includes supporting facilities in the UK and the United States operated by LanzaJet, a leading specialist fuel company. LanzaJet’s facilities focus on producing SAF using a technology that converts sustainable feedstocks like ethanol into aviation fuel.

This diversified approach allows British Airways to expand its SAF sourcing capabilities and ensures that the airline has access to sufficient quantities of sustainable fuel to meet its growing fuel demand as it strives to meet its sustainability goals.

The Road Ahead: British Airways’ Net-Zero Vision

British Airways is not alone in its pursuit of SAF. The entire aviation industry is shifting towards alternative fuel solutions to meet sustainability targets set by governments and international aviation organizations. British Airways’ commitment to SAF and carbon reduction forms part of its broader ambition to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. As the airline industry continues to evolve, SAF is expected to play an increasingly important role in achieving this goal.

The partnership with EcoCeres is just one part of British Airways’ multi-faceted approach to becoming more sustainable. In addition to SAF, the airline is investing in more fuel-efficient aircraft, exploring carbon offsetting options, and working to reduce waste and improve operational efficiency.

Conclusion: A Step Toward a Sustainable Future

The EcoCeres/British Airways agreement is significant in the company’s drive to reduce the environmental footprint of the business and to inspire the industry to be greener. Through the expansion of its SAF supply chain and reduction of emissions through innovative partnerships, British Airways is taking leadership in driving the industry to shift to greener practices. It is good for the business and customers but also fits within broader initiatives to address climate change and to reduce emissions worldwide.

This joint venture will undoubtedly create the precedent to inspire additional carriers to take the same path to cleaner, greener flying fuels, pushing the world further towards cleaner flying.

Less rain, not as hot for most U.S. crop areas... Seasonal temps are likely across the Plains, Midwest, Delta and Southeast this week, while rainfall will be scattered. While temps won’t be as hot as recent weeks, some areas may see soil moisture decline if rains miss. The Pacific Northwest will be hot and dry, stressing crops in that region.

Canada tries to revive U.S. trade talks... Canada has announced it will rescind its Digital Services Tax (DST) in a significant concession after President Donald Trump announced last Friday he was terminating trade talks with Ottawa. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump have agreed that both sides will resume negotiations immediately, with the goal of reaching a final deal by July 21. The Canadian government’s move comes after months of U.S. pressure and repeated warnings the DST was a major sticking point in efforts to reset the cross-border trading relationship. Meanwhile, Canada Bill C-202 is now law after passing both the House of Commons and Senate and garnering a Royal Assent. The legislation prohibits Canadian trade negotiators from making commitments that would increase tariff rate quotas (TRQs) or reduce tariffs on supply-managed goods — namely dairy, poultry, and eggs — in future trade negotiations. However, its actual power to prevent the government from adjusting its negotiating stance is limited, sources signal.

India draws ‘red line’ on agriculture in U.S. trade talks... India’s agriculture and dairy are “very big red lines” in its ongoing trade negotiations with the U.S., Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman told the Financial Express newspaper. In the trade talks, the U.S. is pushing for more Indian purchases of grains and ethanol, citing a significant trade imbalance, along with expanded market access for dairy, alcoholic beverages, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Meanwhile, India’s auto, pharmaceutical and small-scale firms are lobbying for a gradual opening of the protected sectors, fearing competition from U.S. firms.

The week ahead in Washington... The Senate will vote today on Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill, a multi-trillion-dollar spending and tax package at the core of his second-term agenda. If the measure clears the Senate, it will then require a second House vote before reaching Trump’s desk. The House is tentatively set to take up the measure on Tuesday, aiming to pass it before the July 4 deadline. However, the path is fraught with internal party drama and unresolved policy disputes that threaten the bill’s future. The other focus in Washington this week will be ongoing trade negotiations with key trading partners ahead of Trump’s July 9 deadline to enforce heavier tariffs. This week’s economic spotlight will be on the June jobs report on Thursday. Markets and government offices are closed on Friday for the July 4 holiday.

Senate modifies, strengthens 45Z credit... The Senate’s updated legislative text for the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit as part of the reconciliation package would extend for two years the clean fuel production credit, which applies to low-emission fuels made from renewable materials such as soybeans and corn. It’s currently slated to expire at the end of 2027 and would be extended through 2029. The House bill would extend it for four years (through the end of 2031). This will likely be a point of negotiation in the conference process. The Senate version upholds the House-passed requirement that would prohibit the credit for any feedstock produced outside the U.S., Mexico, or Canada, excluding imported feedstocks like Chinese used cooking oil (UCO) and South American tallow from receiving U.S. taxpayer support. The Senate bill would eliminate a larger credit for sustainable aviation fuel, largely bar negative emissions rates that lead to larger credits and modify emission rates to exclude indirect land use changes. The Small Agri-Biodiesel Producer credit is increased to 20 cents per gallon and the 45Z credit is now transferable, making it easier for smaller biofuel producers to benefit from the program.

Major changes to California’s updated LCFS... Beginning July 1, major updates to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) will take effect, marking a pivotal shift in the state’s climate and transportation policy. Approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the amended LCFS accelerates emissions goals — targeting a 30% reduction in the carbon intensity of transportation fuels by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2045. These amendments are intended to drive deeper greenhouse gas cuts, increase clean fuel investment and support California’s 2045 net-zero ambitions.

China’s manufacturing sector improves, but remains in contraction... China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) rose to 49.7 in June from 49.5 in May, but that marked the third straight month of contraction in the sector. Output rose the most in three months, while sales fell at their slowest rate during that span and new domestic orders showed expansion. But new export orders remained in contraction for the 14th consecutive month.

Cash cattle decline, expected to weaken further... Cash cattle traded generally $3.00 to $5.00 lower last week, though the official average price won’t be known until later this morning. Cash cattle prices are expected to weaken again this week, despite packer margins turning positive.

Before we talked to these women, they actually thought that climate change was a divine intervention and they didn’t understand it.
They thought it was something that was more divine,” Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect explained at the Summit.
She is a professor focused on sustainable food systems, and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Southwestern University.
As Currey explained, “food systems have to do with everything, from production to processing, distribution, the utilization.","“We harness the power of the tiny microbe,” Zara Summers, Ph.D. explained, “They’re eating gas, they’re eating CO2, carbon monoxide and hydrogen, and they’re turning them into ethanol…this is the oldest metabolism on earth.”

“These microbes are called acetogens, your oldest ancestor, if you will,” she said at The Earth Day Women’s Summit on April 22, 2025 at EarthX2025 in Dallas, Texas. “They are descendants of early life,” she said, presenting a white t-shirt (with a black swoosh on it) and a pair of fuchsia leggings that she said were made from captured CO2.

Then she continued her mini-chemistry lesson telling us how these microbes can make other things we need every day. “They turn it into ethanol, and so all we have to do is a little bit of chemistry on the back end and take that ethanol…and you slam together and make long polymers, and those long polymers become your jet fuel. This is your sustainable aviation fuel, or as the new administration would like us to call it, synthetic aviation fuel, whatever.”

Making fiber – and other stuff – from new sources

The key point to me from Summers was, ”Once you have ethylene, it's actually a building block of everything that petroleum is, is used for today.”

Think about all the things made from petroleum today, beyond the gas in your car or truck. Polyester, plastic, pesticides, cement, asphalt, tires, nail polish, refrigerators, eyeglasses, aspirin, the list goes on because literally hundreds, maybe thousands of different products are made from petroleum.

“Pretty much any synthetic fiber that you can get from Fossil, we have a path to create.,” she said. “Instead of pumping that carbon monoxide and dioxide directly into the atmosphere, we pump it into our massive, kind of like a brewery, but cooler, huge, huge 500,000 liter tanks of living, breathing, spinning out ethanol microbes. And so we harness that. It's a continuous process. So it's very much like a, a refining process,” is how Summers described their process in layperson’s terms. She also said they are making a new edible protein out of captured CO2.

It sounds like science fiction but it’s the new world of fashion and food, as innovators like Summers, who is Chief Science Officer at LanzaTech, find innovative ways to address the climate crisis.

They have “partnered with REI” on running apparel, with Gucci on perfume, and with Athleta on those leggings, as well as with Lululemon and “a lot of brands.” Athleta, she said, “committed that they want to hit about 25% of the polyester that they're, of the carbon that is going into these leggings, is going to be from emissions produced ethanol. This is a massive step change.”

Regenerative cotton empowering female farmers

“This is about giving women knowledge and skills about climate change. Before we talked to these women, they actually thought that climate change was a divine intervention and they didn’t understand it. They had no idea that the changes that they were seeing were due to weather patterns. They thought it was something that was more divine,” Alison Ward, CEO of CottonConnect explained at the Summit. CottonConnect is a nonprofit that trains and empowers female farmers in India, China, Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Bangladesh to grow cotton sustainably, and financially sustainable businesses. They have deals with Primark and Carrefour (in Europe), among others.

“These women are quite near big urban centers, but just haven't had access to training and knowledge,” she added.

These female farmers face 117 degree heat Fahrenheit, and changes in their water sources, and their cattle not producing as much milk, among other consequences of climate change, Ward delineated.

The techniques CottonConnect teaches the women to use often originate in indigenous cultures, she said. “So, we’re almost going back to some original techniques that we are rediscovering,” including how to make natural pesticides with things already on their farm. King Charles III uses one on his sheep, she offered intriguingly.

“There's the positive impact on from regenerative, but also there's that sort of positive impact in terms of the status of women in these communities,” Ward emphasized. These women have more influence.

CottonConnect and the farmers can track where their cotton is used, because they give every farm a tracking system, including a DNA marker, which enables them to track their cotton through the supply chain to your local retailer. They have traced 1.7 billion t-shirts, so far, she disclosed.

Food science and systems are being reinvented too.

“We know that globally we have enough production on planet Earth in order to ensure proper nutrition – and again, nutrition's very different from caloric and a full belly, as we know from all of the health issues that are more in developed worlds. But, there's serious distribution problems,” Robin Currey, Ph.D. explained on the panel.

That means, “that not everybody has equitable access to the kinds of foods that they need and want, at the times that they need them. So there's, there's quite a bit of instability,” Currey cautioned. She is a professor focused on sustainable food systems, and Vice President for Academic Affairs at Southwestern University.

What are “food systems”? As Currey explained, “food systems have to do with everything, from production to processing, distribution, the utilization. So that's like how we prepare it, how we're cooking it,” and of course food waste.

Unfortunately, food waste in the United States is a massive 40%. Talk about a distribution problem; think about all the hungry people that 40% of wasted food – or even half of it – could feed if it was distributed to those who need it.

These remarkable innovations are driven by the challenge to address the climate crisis and make our lives better. They also empower women as both businesspeople and consumers.

Consumers have a lot power with our purchases, especially women, who make or influence 85% of them.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6861ab8b9c9801956e98710e/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-06-30 08:06:24.423011

A representative of Vietnam Airlines said that the airline has been persistently pursuing a sustainable development strategy for years, focusing on reducing emissions, modernising its fleet, improving operational processes, and optimising resource use. These efforts are exemplified through initiatives such as the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the deployment of carbon control systems, and investments in a new generation of fuel-efficient fleet.

On May 27, 2024, Vietnam Airlines operated its first commercial flight using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) on the route from Singapore to Hanoi. Building on this milestone, the airline launched six domestic flights powered by SAF on June 5 to celebrate World Environment Day. This was the first time SAF had been used simultaneously on both international and domestic routes in Vietnam, signalling a shift from pilot initiatives to mainstream application in sustainable aviation.

Beyond environmental sustainability, Vietnam Airlines also integrates social and governance criteria across its operations. The airline has maintained policies to ensure fair compensation, career development opportunities, and training for its employees, while promoting gender equality and safeguarding the rights of diverse workforce groups.

To further its commitment to environmental protection and ecosystem restoration, Vietnam Airlines partnered with e-wallet platform MoMo to launch an afforestation campaign in June 2024. The campaign aims to restore 50 hectares of forest in the Northwest region, helping to combat degradation and preserve natural resources for future generations.

Head of Operations

Cairns Airport

As Head of Operations, Alicia Prince has played a critical role in leading and navigating Cairns Airport through the COVID-19 pandemic. During the pandemic, Prince implemented a functional plan to ensure business continuity and staff welfare, segregating front-line operational staff into work teams to avoid interaction between groups, as well as strict sanitisation processes. She ensured that the $55 million domestic Terminal upgrade continued safely despite the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis.

She also deployed the COVIDSafe Operation Plan for Cairns Airport, which was endorsed and later commended by Queensland Chief Health Officer. As part of this plan Alicia developed an airport layout to provide physical separation of low risk and high-risk arrivals and initiated increased hygiene and sanitisation protocols. The health and safety of the airport community was paramount to maintaining operations, and in response to this Alicia initiated a COVIDSafe training program for the entire airport community and worked closely with her team to deliver.

As a result of the great work Prince has done to ensure COVID-19 best practices, Cairns Airport was one of the first Australian Airports to be awarded an ACI Global Health Accreditation.

Alicia also led the terminal optimisation project, which assessed and implemented terminal downscales due to the crisis. Significant savings (both financial and environmental) were achieved by reducing the operational footprint of the airport.

Whilst maintaining operations throughout the pandemic was a priority, Alicia ensured her team were kept well informed and engaged. Cairns Airport has a team of 33 volunteers which form part of Alicia’s wider team. To ensure they remained connected and cared for, Alicia and her team created care packages including home-made cakes and personally delivered to each of the volunteers’ houses in a COVIDSafe manner. Alicia demonstrated great leadership throughout the pandemic and continues to do so today. Her clear and transparent communication and collaboration with other Australian Airports and key agencies to ensure best practice and alignment contributed greatly to business continuity. Furthermore, all the above was managed whilst working remotely and juggling home schooling with her two young boys.

“This transaction is a key milestone in building one of the world’s fully integrated and scalable green energy platforms,” said Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder and CEO of AM Green. “We thank ORIX for their continued partnership and belief in our vision.”

Greenko operates a renewable energy platform with 10 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity and is developing over 100 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of daily energy storage capacity targeted to be online by 2030. Its flagship 1.7 GW pumped storage project in Andhra Pradesh has been commissioned, while upcoming projects of 2.5 GW in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka are scheduled for commissioning in 2026 and 2027 respectively.

Founded in 2023 by Greenko co-founders Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, AM Green has laid out plans to develop a fully integrated Power-to-X (P2X) platform. This includes renewable generation from solar, wind, and hydro, long-duration energy storage, round-the-clock carbon-free power, and green molecules such as green hydrogen, green ammonia, low carbon caustic soda, ethanol, and SAF.

AM Green has announced a plan to produce 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia. Its first 1 MTPA project is under construction at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh. The company has signed supply term sheets for green ammonia with industrial and power companies in OECD markets, including Uniper SE and Yara Clean Ammonia.

The company has also signed power purchase agreements for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia projects, enabling round-the-clock carbon-free energy supply. AMG has access to electrolyzers through a joint venture with John Cockerill for manufacturing.

In India, AM Green is participating in the government’s green hydrogen tenders and expects to capture a sizable share based on its access to competitive green power, electrolyzer capacity, and experienced project execution team.

The Kakinada industrial complex, currently under construction, will include 2 MTPA of green ammonia production, a 2 GW electrolyzer gigafactory, and facilities for SAF and green chemical production. It will be the world’s first integrated green industrial zone, according to the company.

AMG is also in late-stage development of projects related to low carbon caustic soda, synthetic fuels such as methanol, high-value bio-based chemicals, and SAF using biomass feedstock.

In 2024, AM Green acquired Chempolis, a Finland-based sustainable biomass technology company. Chempolis’ proprietary process enables conversion of agricultural residue and other non-food biomass into cellulosic pulp, cellulosic ethanol, bio-based chemicals, and biomaterials. This acquisition supports AMG’s Bio2X platform focused on circular bioeconomy applications.

ORIX’s exit from Greenko and reinvestment into AMG aligns with its capital recycling strategy, providing it exposure to upstream renewable energy generation as well as downstream green molecule production.

The company stated that the combination of Greenko’s 10 GW operational renewable capacity and AM Green’s downstream pipeline provides a fully integrated platform capable of decarbonising multiple industrial sectors.

The Venice Biorefinery, which was the first conventional refinery in the world to be converted into a biorefinery in 2014, is a cornerstone of Eni's strategy to transform its industrial assets into renewable energy hubs. The facility processes waste raw materials, such as used cooking oils, animal fats, and residues from the agri-food industry, into biofuels, contributing to the circular economy. This expansion further strengthens Enilive's biorefining capacity, which the company aims to increase to over 5 million tons per year by 2030, up from its current 1.65 million tons per year.

The project is a crucial part of a renewed collaboration agreement between Saipem and Enilive on biorefining, demonstrating a continued partnership between the two companies in advancing green energy solutions. The award follows a previous assignment in March, where Saipem was tasked with preliminary detailed engineering, procurement services, and the acquisition of critical equipment for the same project.

Saipem's extensive experience in engineering and construction, particularly in the offshore and onshore energy sectors, makes it a suitable partner for such a complex and specialized project. The company is actively diversifying its portfolio to include renewable energy, offshore wind, and other low-carbon solutions, aligning its business strategy with the global push for decarbonization. This contract is a testament to its successful pivot and growing expertise in new energy technologies. The partnership between Saipem and Enilive is a prime example of how major companies are leveraging their combined skills to drive innovation and contribute to a more sustainable future.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-30 06:00:55.375004

@Qantas @Airbus #A321XLR","Hamburg, Germany, 30 June 2025 - Australia's Qantas Airways is set to become the Asia-Pacific launch operator of the latest generation single aisle A321XLR following the delivery of its first aircraft from the Airbus assembly line in Finkenwerder, Hamburg.

Reflecting the long range capability of the A321XLR, the aircraft is flying from the Airbus facility to Sydney with just one crew rest stop in Bangkok.

Powered by Pratt & Whitney GTF engines, the Qantas A321XLR features a two class layout with 20 seats in Business Class and 177 in the main cabin. Qantas will initially operate the A321XLR on domestic services across Australia, with potential to open future new services on secondary routes to Asia.

Altogether the Qantas Group has ordered 40 A321XLRs under its fleet modernisation programme, with 28 aircraft allocated to Qantas and 12 to low cost subsidiary Jetstar. These are part of the airline’s outstanding orders with Airbus for 128 single aisle aircraft and 24 A350-1000 widebodies.

The A321XLR is the next evolutionary step of the A320neo Family, responding to market needs for more range and payload, creating even more flexibility and value for the airlines.

In typical airline service it offers the longest range of any single aisle aircraft - up to 4,700 nautical miles - and brings a reduction in fuel consumption and carbon emissions of 30% compared with previous generation competitor aircraft. To date, Airbus has secured more than 500 orders for the type.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A321XLR aircraft is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus is targeting to have its aircraft capable of flying with up to 100% SAF by 2030.

Allerdings fordert die EU zugleich, dass von 2030 an mindestens 1,2 Prozent des genutzten SAF sogenanntes E-Fuel sein muss.
Das auf Biomasse basierende SAF reduziert die CO2-Emissionen im Vergleich zu herkömmlichem Kerosin nur um rund 80 Prozent.
Hält man sich allerdings vor Augen, dass allein am Frankfurter Flughafen etwa 15.000 Tonnen Kerosin am Tag in die Flugzeugtanks gepumpt werden, wird klar, wie gering diese Menge ist.
Ungeachtet des Rückstands bei E-Fuels ist SAF von entscheidender Bedeutung für die Luftfahrt und damit auch für den Luftverkehrsstandort Hessen im Bemühen, von 2050 an klimaneutral zu fliegen.","Um Luftverkehr klimafreundlicher als bisher zu betreiben, muss möglichst schnell mehr nachhaltiges, nicht aus Erdöl hergestelltes Kerosin produziert werden. In der EU sind daher Fluggesellschaften seit Anfang des Jahres dazu verpflichtet, mindestens zwei Prozent ihres Bedarfes mit dieser Art von nachhaltigem Kerosin, dem sogenannten Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), zu decken. Eine gute Nachricht aus dem jüngsten SAF-Report des am Frankfurter Flughafen beheimateten hessischen Kompetenzzen­trums für Klima- und Lärmschutz im Luftverkehr (CENA): Nicht nur diese erste SAF-Quote der EU von zwei Prozent im laufenden Jahr ist voraussichtlich erfüllbar, sondern im Grunde auch die von der EU vorgegebene Steigerung auf sechs Prozent Beimischungsquote von 2030 an.

Allerdings fordert die EU zugleich, dass von 2030 an mindestens 1,2 Prozent des genutzten SAF sogenanntes E-Fuel sein muss. Das wird rein synthetisch hergestellt und ist nahezu zu 100 Prozent CO2-frei. Das auf Biomasse basierende SAF reduziert die CO2-Emissionen im Vergleich zu herkömmlichem Kerosin nur um rund 80 Prozent. Das Problem ist allerdings, dass der mithilfe von Solarstrom aus Wasserstoff und Kohlendioxid hergestellte E-Sprit bisher nur in homöopathischen Dosen verfügbar und noch dazu rund zehnmal so teuer wie herkömmliches Kerosin ist. Daher stellt die CENA-Studie im Resümee fest, dass diese E-Fuel-Vorgabe der EU für die Airlines und die Treibstoffanbieter von 1,2 Prozent mit den derzeitigen weltweiten Kapazitäten nicht realisierbar ist. Zu diesem Schluss sind zuvor auch Airlines wie die Lufthansa gekommen und mahnen die EU, keine solchen unerfüllbaren Quoten vorzugeben.

Politik sollte Risiken für Unternehmen reduzieren

Langfristig führt allerdings für die Luftfahrt kein Weg an diesem E-Fuel vorbei, von dem etwa die Ineratec aus Karlsruhe im Frankfurter Industriepark ­Hoechst jährlich rund 2500 Tonnen produzieren will. Hält man sich allerdings vor Augen, dass allein am Frankfurter Flughafen etwa 15.000 Tonnen Kerosin am Tag in die Flugzeugtanks gepumpt werden, wird klar, wie gering diese Menge ist. Auch der im CENA-Ausblick berechnete Bedarf an SAF in den nächsten Jahren und Jahrzehnten zeigt, dass die Produktion vor allem von CO2-neutralem E-Fuel nicht schnell genug hochfährt: Allein für Europa haben die Autoren der Studie einen SAF-Bedarf von 3,1 Millionen Tonnen im Jahr 2030 errechnet. Im Jahr 2040 ist demzufolge mit einem Bedarf von 20 Millionen Tonnen zu rechnen. 2050 könnte sich der Bedarf bereits bei rund 48,4 Millionen Tonnen bewegen, wenn die zugrunde gelegten Wachstumsprognosen der Studie eintreten.

Diese basieren auf einem angenommenen Kerosinverbrauch im Jahr 2024, der dem des Verbrauchs im letzten Vor-Corona-Jahres 2019 in der EU entspricht. Dazu geht die Studie von einem durchschnittlichen Wachstum des Luftverkehrs von 1,5 Prozent aus. Ungeachtet des Rückstands bei E-Fuels ist SAF von entscheidender Bedeutung für die Luftfahrt und damit auch für den Luftverkehrsstandort Hessen im Bemühen, von 2050 an klimaneutral zu fliegen.

Im Ausblick hält die Studie der CENA einen Luftverkehr ohne fossiles Kerosin für machbar, allerdings nur dann, wenn die Produktion im industriellen Maßstab weiter zunimmt und auch bei E-Fuels gelingt. Dabei werde aber zunächst der nachhaltige Treibstoff auf der Basis biogener Masse die entscheidende Rolle spielen. Weil aber auch Bioabfälle nicht unbegrenzt zur Verfügung stehen, müsse auch der Markthochlauf von E-Fuel gelingen. Der sei aber nur zu erreichen, wenn die Politik die Risiken für Unternehmen reduziere, die als „first mover“ den Schritt zur Großproduktion wagen. Beimischungsquoten, wie sie die EU vorgebe, reichten dazu nicht aus. Derzeit stehen Kosten von rund 7695 Euro je Tonne E-Fuel 734 Euro für eine Tonne fossilen Kerosins gegenüber.",https://media1.faz.net/ppmedia/aktuell/533201248/1.10556093/facebook_teaser/der-erste-co2-neutrale.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 06:01:29.181686

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

The SAF Matchmaker supports spot purchases as well as offtake agreements and is initially available to airlines and SAF suppliers only. In due course, other SAF buyers such as non-aviation corporations will also be able to participate.

The SAF Matchmaker is hosted on the Aviation Energy Hub, a centralised digital space designed to provide the aviation industry with access to practical tools that support aviation energy management. -TradeArabia News Service",https://mastercms.alhilalgroup.com/source/TA/2025/06/30/TA_20250630112546.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 05:04:41.852804

“This partnership marks a major step toward creating a globally integrated green energy platform,” said Anil Chalamalasetty, Founder and CEO of AM Green. “We appreciate ORIX’s continued support and confidence in our mission.”

With this transaction, AM Green bolsters its integration with Greenko—India’s leading renewable energy operator with over 10 GW of renewable and pumped storage capacity. Greenko is currently developing a transformative energy storage platform with a planned capacity exceeding 100 GWh per day by 2030.

The acquisition increases AM Green’s stake in Greenko to approximately 25%, strengthening its position in one of the leading players in renewable energy and energy storage infrastructure. Greenko operates over 10 GW of renewable capacity and is on track to build a 100+ GWh energy storage platform by 2030, making this partnership a key milestone in AM Green’s growth strategy.

AM Green is also progressing with its ambitious production plans, including the construction of its first 1 MTPA green ammonia facility and a 5 MTPA green ammonia capacity, alongside a 1 MTPA green hydrogen project. The company’s development pipeline further includes low-carbon caustic soda, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), ethanol, and other bio-based products, leveraging advanced Chempolis technology to enable sustainable, circular bioeconomy solutions.

Established in 2023 by Greenko’s co-founders Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli, AM Green is among the largest integrated Power-to-X (P2X) platforms globally. The company spans the full decarbonization value chain—covering renewable energy (solar, wind, hydro), long-duration storage (pumped hydro), and green molecule production (hydrogen, ammonia, SAF, etc.).

AM Green is constructing its first green ammonia facility (1 MTPA) in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, and has already signed offtake term sheets with major global players, including Uniper SE and Yara Clean Ammonia. To support this, AMG has also secured large-scale power purchase agreements and electrolyzer access through its joint venture with John Cockerill.

The company is actively bidding in India’s green hydrogen tenders and is well-positioned due to its access to competitive green power, domestic electrolyzer manufacturing, and technical depth. Other near-term priorities include low-carbon caustic soda, synthetic fuels like methanol, and sustainable chemicals.

AM Green’s flagship Kakinada industrial complex, now under construction, is set to become the world’s largest integrated green energy zone—featuring 2 MTPA green ammonia capacity, a 2 GW electrolyzer factory, and SAF and green chemical production units.

Three key goals to support nuclear energy in developing countries Nuclear energy provides continuous baseload power, enhancing grid stability and resilience.
Nuclear power is also a source of high-skilled employment and stimulates investment across the broader economy.","The World Bank Group has recently made the first concrete step to reengage with nuclear power in decades, sealing an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to support the safe, secure and responsible use of nuclear energy in developing countries.

The agreement reflects a new, broader approach by the World Bank Group to electrification—one that prioritizes accessibility, affordability and reliability, while managing emissions responsibly. With electricity demand in developing countries expected to more than double by 2035, this approach aims to help countries deliver the energy people need by enabling pathways that best fit their national context, including development objectives and Nationally Determined Contributions.

“In 1965, around the same time the World Bank Group last financed a nuclear power project, the average person in high-income countries used about 38 megawatt-hours of electricity per year. Today, that figure has risen to more than 50—but in Africa, it remains just 4. It’s a disparity that is expected to intensify,” said World Bank Group President Ajay Banga.

Three key goals to support nuclear energy in developing countries

Nuclear energy provides continuous baseload power, enhancing grid stability and resilience. Reliable baseload electricity is essential for job-generating sectors such as infrastructure, agribusiness, healthcare, tourism and manufacturing. Nuclear power is also a source of high-skilled employment and stimulates investment across the broader economy. In addition, it can adjust to changes in electricity demand and support frequency regulation, enabling greater integration of variable renewable energy sources.

“Jobs need electricity. So do factories, hospitals, schools, and water systems. And as demand surges—with AI and development alike—we must help countries deliver reliable, affordable power. That’s why we’re embracing nuclear energy as part of the solution—and reembracing it as part of the mix the World Bank Group can offer developing countries to achieve their ambitions,” added Banga.

Under the memorandum of understanding, the IAEA will work with the World Bank Group in three key areas:

Building knowledge related to the nuclear field: Expanding the World Bank Group’s understanding of nuclear safety, security, safeguards, energy planning, new technologies, fuel cycles, reactor lifecycles and waste management.

Extending the lifespan of existing nuclear power plants: Supporting developing countries in safely extending the life of existing nuclear reactors, as many global reactors near the end of their original 40-year design life.

Advancing SMRs: Accelerating the development of small modular reactors (SMRs), which offer flexible deployment, lower upfront costs and potential for wide adoption in developing economies.

More than 30 countries seek to introduce nuclear power

Thirty-one countries currently operate nuclear power plants, which combined produce about 9 percent of the world’s electricity, amounting to almost a quarter of all low-carbon power globally. More than 30 other countries, most of them in the developing world, are considering or already embarking on the introduction of nuclear power and are working with the IAEA to develop the necessary infrastructure to do so safely, securely and sustainably.

“This landmark partnership, yet another sign of the world’s return to realism on nuclear power, opens the door for other multilateral development banks and private investors to consider nuclear as a viable tool for energy security and sustainable prosperity. Together, we can help more people build a better future. SMRs have great potential to cleanly and reliably power progress and fight poverty, but financing remains a roadblock. Today’s agreement is a crucial first step to clearing that path,” said IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/World-bank-nuclear-.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 05:05:04.064785

AM Green BV will acquire Orix Corp's 17.5% stake in Greenko Energy Holdings for USD 1.28 billion. Orix will also invest in AM Green. This deal aims to build a large green energy platform. Greenko focuses on renewable energy projects in India. AM Green plans to produce green ammonia and other sustainable fuels.

AM Green BV will buy Japanese financial service firm Orix Corp's 17.5 per cent stake in clean energy producer Greenko Energy Holdings for USD 1.28 billion, the firms said on Monday.

AM Green is owned by the founders of Greenko, Anil Chalamalasetty and Mahesh Kolli. Post this transaction, AMG will own around 25 per cent of Greenko, whose largest owner is Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte with a 58 per cent stake.

Orix will transfer 17.5 per cent holding in Greenko, out of its total ownership of 20 per cent, to AM Green Power BV (a subsidiary of AM Green BV).

The Tokyo-based firm will also invest about USD 731 million in a convertible note issued by parent company AM Green (Luxembourg) Sarl (AMG Lux).

Greenko owns major renewable energy companies in India and operates renewable energy power generation facilities with a total installed capacity of 10 gigawatt, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power generation. In addition, it is advancing the development of large-scale pumped storage power generation.

Live Events

""Orix has supported Greenko's business growth since it invested in March 2021. Orix decided to sell 17.5 per cent of the 20 per cent share holdings in Greenko and invest in AMG Lux as part of its capital recycling strategy,"" the Japanese firm said in a statement.

This investment will provide Orix long-term exposure to green hydrogen, ammonia, SAF and other next-gen molecules, aligning with its capital recycling strategy, AM Green said in a separate statement.

While AM Green (AMG) did not give the value of the transaction, Orix said the transfer price is ""USD 1.282 billion"".

""This transaction is a key milestone in building one of the world's fully integrated and scalable green energy platforms,"" Chalamalasetty, founder and CEO of AM Green, said.

In January 2025, Orix announced that it had entered into a share transfer agreement with Greenko and a new investment in AMG Lux, but because the conditions precedent had not been satisfied, the agreement was terminated in April 2025.

""However, after further consideration among related parties, we have decided to reenter into this agreement,"" it said.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to be concluded by the end of July.

AMG has plans to produce 5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of green ammonia, with the first 1 MTPA project located in Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh, which is under construction with targeted commissioning during the second half of 2026.

It has also signed binding term sheets with the likes of Uniper SE, an energy company, and Yara Clean Ammonia, a trader and distributor of ammonia, to supply green ammonia to Europe.

In the future, AMG aims to expand its business to include the production of 1 MTPA of green hydrogen, synthetic fuels such as methanol, as well as the production of SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) using biomass-derived raw materials, and to become a platform company that builds a value chain for next generation energy.

AMG has also signed globally the largest power purchase agreements for supply of round-the-clock carbon-free energy for its first 2 MTPA green ammonia projects and has access to electrolysers through its manufacturing JV with John Cockerill.

Its Kakinada industrial complex, currently under construction, will be the world's first and largest integrated green industrial zone. It will house 2 MTPA of green ammonia production, 2 GW electrolyser gigafactory and facilities for SAF and green chemical production.

Greenko's flagship 1.7 GW pumped storage project in Andhra Pradesh has already been commissioned, with its next 2 pumped storage projects in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka (2.5 GWs) are expected to be commissioned in 2026 and 2027, respectively.

Orix said its gains from the transaction are subject to exchange rate fluctuations.

""If the sale price is estimated using the exchange rate as of June 27, 2025, (USD 1 equal to 144.58 Japanese Yen), Orix expects to record a gain on the sale of approximately 93.4 billion Yen (including the valuation gain on the 2.5 per cent stake which we will continue to hold) in the consolidated financial statements in the second quarter for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026,"" it said.

While the airline has garnered positive reviews for its service and growing demand, Jetstar, another Australian carrier, has decided to withdraw from the market. Amidst increased competition and shifting market dynamics, Jetstar’s exit has highlighted the challenges within the region, while Qantas continues to lead the charge with its thriving Pacific paradise route, setting a new benchmark for success.

The Airbus A330-200 is the aircraft serving this route, although on some occasions, the larger A330-300 may also be used, depending on flight schedules and operational needs.

Qantas, a prominent member of the Oneworld alliance, has set a high standard for its long-haul routes, ensuring that travelers experience comfort and convenience from start to finish. Business class passengers on this route are entitled to check in between two and four pieces of luggage, with each bag allowed to weigh up to 32 kilograms. The number of bags permitted depends on the passenger’s frequent flyer status, which can range from Bronze to Platinum One. For cabin baggage, those flying in first, business, or premium economy are allowed one carry-on bag of up to 10 kilograms, while economy passengers are limited to 7 kilograms. Additionally, travelers are allowed to bring one personal item, such as a handbag or briefcase.

For flights to Hawaii, there is a special note regarding sports equipment. Items such as golf bags and surfboards are considered part of the checked luggage allowance, provided they do not exceed the weight limit of 32 kilograms and the total length of 277 centimeters. This is a valuable perk for travelers planning on making the most of Hawaii’s scenic beaches or iconic golf courses.

In terms of frequent flyer benefits, Qantas offers ample rewards for its loyal passengers. Depending on their membership status, business class travelers can earn anywhere from 9,750 to 15,750 Qantas Points, along with 150 status credits on this route. This incentivizes travelers to choose Qantas for their future journeys, while the points can be used toward upgrades or future flights, enhancing the overall travel experience.

For those seated in business class, one of the standout features is the seating configuration. The cabin is arranged in a 1-2-1 layout, with seat 5K being a prime window seat, ensuring direct access to the aisle for every passenger. Each seat in the business class cabin is generously wide, measuring 23 inches (58.4 cm), and can be transformed into a fully flat bed that spans an impressive 80 inches (203 cm) in length. This is a key feature for long-haul flights, offering passengers the opportunity to stretch out and rest comfortably during overnight journeys.

The business seats are thoughtfully designed with ample storage space located conveniently within reach. The dining table, which is large enough for meals or work, can be easily stowed away when not in use, allowing for a clutter-free environment. Whether passengers are dining, working, or relaxing, the seats are designed to cater to various needs during the flight.

Another remarkable feature of these seats is the integrated massage function. With a simple press of a button, passengers can activate the seat’s massage settings, which gently knead the lower back and provide a calming effect throughout the flight. This feature can be controlled via a panel located on the seat, and the symbol for the massage function is a partially reclined seat icon with wavy lines, indicating vibration. This option is particularly beneficial for passengers who seek relaxation during long flights or have a tendency to experience back discomfort. The massage function operates for a set time and automatically turns off afterward.

The entertainment system is also a major highlight of the business class cabin. A 16-inch high-definition tilting touchscreen provides clear visuals, allowing passengers to enjoy a wide array of movies, TV shows, and documentaries. The in-flight entertainment selection is extensive, catering to various tastes and ensuring that passengers have plenty of options to keep them entertained throughout the flight. Additionally, there are power outlets, USB charging ports, and adjustable lighting at each seat, making it easy to stay connected, charge devices, or create a personalized environment while on board. The in-flight magazine is also readily available for passengers who enjoy reading during their travels.

The inaugural flight of this new route departed promptly on schedule, and the crew provided a high standard of service throughout the journey.

GLOBAL CRISES IMPACTING BIOFUELS AND BIODIESEL MARKET

COVID-19 IMPACT

Biofuels and Biodiesel market Had a Negative Effect Due to Decreased Decline in Transportation Activity During COVID-19 Pandemic

The global COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and staggering, with the market experiencing

lower-than-anticipated demand across all regions compared to pre-pandemic levels. The sudden market growth reflected by the rise in CAGR is attributable to the market’s growth and demand returning to pre-pandemic levels.

The COVID-19 epic crisis greatly impacted biofuels and biodiesel in what was ultimately an unprecedented manner, and most directly, due to a tremendous decline in transportation activity and related industries. As travel and production reduced, the lockdowns reduced fuel demand and correspondingly reduced demand for bioethanol and biodiesel blends. Some production plants went into full lockdown, and many opted for a significant drop in production, with fewer employees or shipping logistics temporarily unavailable. Oil and gas prices dropped with crude oil collapsing, significantly hurting the price competitiveness of bio-based fuels. Some agricultural supply chains of feedstocks and crops were also disrupted further impacting raw materials used in biofuels. However, the crisis highlighted the lack of energy resiliency and the need for sustainable alternative fuels, as we entered the next structured recovery phase of the pandemic, mainly supported by green recovery programs across many regions.

LATEST TREND

Rise of Advanced Biofuels and Circular Feedstocks to Drive Market Growth

An important shift in trend and practice regarding biofuels and biodiesel is the shifting focus to advanced biofuels and circular feedstocks. Companies are trillions of dollars investing in developing second-generation biofuels produced from non-food biomass including agricultural residues, municipal solid waste, and algae. These advanced and alternative feedstocks typically offer more carbon savings and before potential human consumption which mitigates the most common arguments against traditional biofuels. Companies are also using waste materials as feedstock (e.g. used cooking oils, animal fats) which supports closed loop and more circular economy approaches. Additionally, Government is tightening sustainability standards and providing incentives to low Carbon fuels now facilitating the transition to advanced biofuels. Importantly, the move to ""advanced"" biofuels is not only allowing for emissions reductions in the more complex hard to abate industries, but is also developing a more resilient, agile and independent biofuels supply chain.

BIOFUELS AND BIODIESEL MARKET SEGMENTATION

BY TYPE

Based on Type, the global market can be categorized into Bioethanol, Biodiesel:

Bioethanol: Bioethanol, an alcohol produced from the fermentation of sugars from crops (primarily corn and sugarcane, but also from biomass), has evolved into one of the foremost renewable fuel projects in the worldwide marketplace. Bioethanol is most often used in raw form or blended with gasoline to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing a fossil fuel source with renewable fuel source. Most of the bioethanol use will be in transportation fuel use going forward - with ethanol mandates already in place - meaning bioethanol use in transportation will remain in the forefront. Bioethanol is also being utilized in commercial applications in the chemical industry to produce solvents and other derivatives, and with environmental awareness and supportive regulatory framework, there is a flurry of investment towards next-generation ethanol, which is derived from agricultural/biomass waste. Bioethanol will continue to evolve with the inclusion of new innovations with an emphasis on efficiencies, scalability, and versatility with varying feedstocks.

Biodiesel: Biodiesel comes from renewable feedstocks such as animal fats, vegetable oils, and recycled greases, which can be used as diesel or blended with conventional diesel in all diesel applications including vehicles and machinery and power generation. Since biodiesel has lower emissions, improved engine lubricity and uses waste products as feedstock, it has become the preference in sustainability-led occupations. Biodiesel is also advantageous in places that have strong agriculture sectors, as that is where feedstock and locally sourced. Interest in biodiesel is now expanding with the development of novel transesterification processes, emergence of hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) technologies and start of the regionally available circular economy. With diesel emissions regulations tightening, we imagine biodiesel demand across all sectors will increase steadily.

BY APPLICATION

Based on application, the global market can be categorized into Agriculture, Transportation, Chemical, Pharmaceuticals:

Agriculture: Biofuels and biodiesel are becoming more popular in the agricultural industry as they can be used to help operate farm machines and vehicles, move farms away from fossil fuels, and create an absorbable and sustainable farming system. Farmers are already using biodiesel blends in tractors, harvesters, and irrigation pumps to reduce diesel emissions and impact, and to operate in a cleaner manner. Crop residues used to produce biofuels creates a purposeful loop in the agricultural waste lifecycle, while providing biofuels a way in which to extend energy access to rural areas often limited in their access to traditional fuel logistics (i.e., air, rail, water, km's of road access.). Biofuels also fit the bill of a more general move towards low carbon/green routes associated with farming systems. One can conclude that with an increase in bio-based energy use, agricultural industries, as in many of the industries highlighted within the sourcing section, will use biofuel or biodiesel blends in a far more prominent and integrated manner.

Transportation: Transportation is the largest user of biofuels, mainly bioethanol and biodiesel blends because efforts underway across the globe to cut vehicle emissions and pursue climate goals have prioritized this sector in decarbonization strategies. Bioethanol has become a prominent fuel in petrol (gasoline) motor vehicles, while biodiesel has become and remains one of the primary substitutes for diesel-based motor vehicles. The public transport fleet sector, aviation, and marine sectors are now actively seeking higher blend options as well as advanced biofuels to transition away from fossil-fuel-based transportation. With the use of biofuels being dictated by fleet fuel standards, mandates around government subsidies, as well as tax incentives, many public transport fleets have embraced biofuels with demonstrations and a growing number of trials to assess viability. As hybrid vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles gain favor in many markets, the biofuels market is benefiting from higher demand. Transportation continues to be an important sector for innovation and potential large-scale deployment of bio-based fuels considering the urgency to decarbonize all aspects of transportation in the growing push on climate change.

Chemical: Biofuels have found many applications in the chemical sector, for feedstocks to solvents, resins, lubricants, and other bio-based chemicals. The derivatives of bioethanol and biodiesel are used in many green chemistry and bio-based initiatives to develop clean and green interchangeable inputs for petroleum or fossil-based inputs. The motivation for using bio-based chemicals is common demand for sustainable sources and non-toxic counterparts for current petroleum sourced inputs in both industrial and consumer products. Additionally, biodiesel produces glycerin, an input used in many cosmetics and pharmaceutical products as inputs. Biofuels do not require new processes for chemical processes, providing ease of use and compliance with environmental regulations. The chemical sector is also looking to increase usage for bio-based input to achieve relatively carbon neutral production expectations.

Pharmaceuticals: Biofuels are used in pharmaceuticals as solvents and processing agents in drug formulation and manufacture. Bioethanol is preferred for its purity, safety, and compatibility in sensitive pharmaceutical formulations. Bioethanol is used frequently in the preparation of syrups, tinctures, sanitizers, etc. Most pharmaceutical companies are now being pushed towards bio-based inputs due to the focus on green manufacturing as they seek to reduce their environmental footprint. In medical products, prescription medications increasingly include biofuels as biodiesel-derived ingredients such as glycerol in topical products. Since regulators favor cleaner and safer production the use of biofuels in pharmaceutical processing environments is anticipated to grow.

MARKET DYNAMICS

Market dynamics include driving and restraining factors, opportunities and challenges stating the market conditions.

DRIVING FACTORS

Government Policies and Environmental Regulations to Boost the Market

Favorable government policies and extreme environmental legislation have been the most significant drivers for the markets for Biofuels and Biodiesel market growth. The global governments and others have established regulations and blending mandates for biofuels to reduce consumption of fossil fuels and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, so that various incentives, stimulus and tax credit opportunities, and renewable energy targets and mandates are encouraging further use of bioethanol and biodiesel. Most of the time these regulations are creating new demands and opportunities to innovate and invest in new infrastructure as well. Climate accord commitments are further stimulating interest from the industry to explore and implement renewable energy alternatives, making it more favorable for long-term growth and investment in biofuels.

Advancements in Feedstock Technology and Production Efficiency to Expand the Market

An additional driver of growth is technological improvement of the feedstock itself and the efficiency of the processing aspects. The availability of the first-generation biofuels to second and third generation biofuels that cover agricultural wastes, algae or non-edible oily feedstocks has widened feedstock availability and has led to more sustainable options. In addition, efficacy in production through things like enzymatically hydrolyzed feedstocks, improved processes like hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO), not only can improve emissions, quality of fuel but also reduce costs and improve energy yield. There is no denying that as research and development continues, biofuels are becoming more reliable and competitive with conventional fuels making them a viable alternative across many industry sectors. This development is pivotal to meeting the ever-growing global energy demand sustainably.

RESTRAINING FACTOR

Competition with Food Supply and Land Use Concerns to Potentially Impede Market Growth

A significant limitation in the biodiesel and biofuels market is ongoing concern over competition with food supply and land use. First-generation biofuels are based on food crops such as corn, sugarcane, and soybeans, raised concerns about global food security. An increased demand for these similar crops, at the same-scaled volume for fuel production, can impact prices of food and apply pressures on food supply. Alternatively, and dedicating large tracts of arable land for biofuel feed stocks, can lead to loss of land, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity altogether, indicating that the sustainability goals of the biofuels and biodiesel market are no more plausible and meaningless. Environmental and attitudinal concerns have led to criticisms and heightened policy resistance in some areas, which pose challenges for market scale.

OPPORTUNITY

Integration with Circular Economy and Waste Utilization to Create Opportunity for The Product in The Market

With potential opportunities in the biofuels and biodiesel industry against a backdrop of a boom in global ruined used cooking oil and animal fat supplies, not to mention agricultural waste, waste recovery supports a circular economy. This gives biofuel producers access to a cost-effective feedstock while addressing some of the waste disposal and landfilling issues we face in the environment. Besides ensuring that reasonable sustainable fuels are derived from waste sources consumers are not pressured to utilize the land or purchase from food crops. As waste being turned into energy is a global initiative there are increased opportunities for support from both governments and investors. With the world continually focused on moving towards greener initiatives in the waste energy markets, waste-to-fuel technologies ensure that biofuels become a sustainable and enviro-friendly product and a growing opportunity in the marketplace.

CHALLENGE

Infrastructure and Distribution Limitations Could Be a Potential Challenge for Consumers

A major obstacle to market growth for biofuels and biodiesel is the lack of sufficient infrastructure and distribution networks. Unlike conventional fossil fuels which are usually interchangeable, biofuels require special handling, storage, and blending facilities and this infrastructure is not universally available in a region. The lack of established regional biofuel logistics creates inefficiencies in delivery and distribution; in addition, it limits access in areas with emerging and rural markets. The cost of retrofitting fueling stations and transportation systems for biofuel blends is further complicated by the need for collaboration amongst stakeholders and policy. While it can take significant time to establish and deploy new supply chains and storage without a reliable supply chain distribution, large scale adoption of biofuel is challenging, especially in the case of advanced biofuels. Overcoming this barrier will require active collaboration between governments, energy companies, and logistics companies to harness the power of the complete infrastructure ecosystem.

Among the vanguard is Haffner Energy, a French firm that has staked its future on renewable hydrogen infrastructure. Its FY2024-25 results reveal both the challenges and opportunities of this pivot—and suggest the company could be nearing a critical inflection point.

The Financial Crossroads: Losses, but Momentum

Haffner's net loss of €12.31 million for FY2024-25 underscores the risks inherent in scaling novel technologies. Yet beneath the headline loss lies a story of progress. EBITDA improved to -€10.01 million, a significant reduction from prior years, while cash burn dropped to €0.6 million per month—half the rate of 2023. This cost discipline, paired with a €7 million capital raise that expanded its free float to 25%, has bought the company time. The goal? Breakeven EBITDA by March 2026, backed by a robust sales pipeline of €388 million as of March 2025.

This metric will be key for investors. If the company can meet its breakeven target, it could signal the start of a self-sustaining growth cycle.

Strategic Shifts: From Fossil Fuels to Biomass Hydrogen

Haffner's most compelling play is its focus on green hydrogen derived from solid biomass—a niche with fewer competitors than electrolysis-based approaches. The Marolles site, operational since February 2025, is the world's first industrial-scale facility of its kind, producing 120 tonnes of green hydrogen annually. More than a production hub, it serves as a testing ground for clients, demonstrating the viability of biomass-derived hydrogen in industries like transportation and manufacturing.

The recent €8.3 million contract with H2 bois SA for a Swiss hydrogen-electricity-biochar plant is a direct outgrowth of this strategy. Such projects not only generate revenue but also validate Haffner's technology in diverse geographies.

Partnerships as a Launchpad

Haffner's alliances with industry leaders like LanzaJet, LanzaTech, and ATOBA Energy are equally critical. The tripartite SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) agreement with LanzaJet and LanzaTech, for instance, opens doors to a sector projected to grow at 14% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, ATOBA's financing support for SAF projects reduces Haffner's capital constraints.

The company's innovation grant of €500,000 from Bpifrance further underscores government confidence in its approach—a valuable signal in regulated markets.

Market Tailwinds: The Green Hydrogen Boom

The renewable hydrogen market is expected to hit $120 billion by 2030, driven by mandates like the EU's REPowerEU plan and corporate net-zero commitments. Haffner's early-mover advantage in biomass-derived hydrogen positions it to capture this upside. Its new product, the Hynoca® Flex 500 IG—a modular, cost-effective hydrogen production unit—could give it an edge over competitors reliant on larger, less adaptable systems.

Risks and Realities

The path is not without hurdles. Scaling biomass-based hydrogen requires stable feedstock supplies and regulatory clarity on sustainability standards. Competitors like Siemens Energy and Air Liquide are also expanding rapidly. Execution risks persist, as delays in project timelines could strain cash reserves.

Investment Takeaway: A High-Reward, High-Risk Play

Haffner Energy is a classic “growth at all costs” story in a sector that demands it. For investors, the question is whether the company can convert its pipeline into revenue—and fast enough to sustain momentum.

If the pipeline materializes as projected, the company's valuation could surge. However, with a still-negative EBITDA and no dividend, this is a bet for long-term, risk-tolerant investors.

Final Verdict

Haffner Energy's FY2024-25 results highlight a company in transition: bleeding cash but gaining traction. Its strategic focus on biomass-derived hydrogen and partnerships in high-growth sectors like SAF positions it well for the green economy's next phase. For those willing to ride the volatility, Haffner's stock could be a leveraged play on the energy transition. But tread carefully—the road to profitability remains narrow.

When President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order on June 6th, 2025, quickly dubbed the “Concorde Bill” he lifted a decades-long ban on supersonic passenger flight. Originally imposed due to concerns over sonic booms and environmental impact, it stifled supersonic innovation by preventing flights over land. The new regulation is expected to open the path to a new innovation in aviation, built on the legacy of the iconic aircraft which pioneered commercial supersonic passenger flight.

The new jet will be 50% lighter, using next-gen composite materials, powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with an 80% reduction in emissions. The elegant exterior form will not change, but everything else about the airplane will be modern and ground-breaking. The interiors will feature a refined Japanese aesthetic designed by leading sustainable architects. Operating at 60,000 feet, the new version will fly cleaner, greener, quieter, and faster than it did before. Backed by five decades of advances in aerospace engineering, materials science, supersonic travel it will be safer, more sustainable, and commercially viable. But it will be in every other sense — “The Concorde” that is still so beloved around the world.

“Beyond its appeal as arguably the most majestic plane to ever take to the skies, it is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability,” said Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited.

Leading the comeback is Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, CEO and Founder of the Concorde Co. of Washington state. Sir Winston Churchill, launched the original model as a post WWII Peace Initiative, and his legacy lives on in Dr Churchill who has set his sights on flying again by 2026, 50 years after the first one flew.

A triple PhD and trained physicist from Oxford, Dr Churchill has dedicated over 23 years to solving the sonic boom challenge, culminating in the world’s first Patent on Sonic Boom Suppression, finally awarded just in May of this year — just in time for the tidal change in aviation progress ushered in by the US Executive order.

Underpinning its aviation development, Fly-Concorde is embracing digital innovation with the launch of Concorde Coin (CSSC) — a stable coin backed by the assets and operations. As global markets show increasing confidence in blockchain-based financial instruments, CSSC offers a new way to engage with the future-forward vision.

The Concorde brand has long been revered as a symbol of aviation excellence. Today it is estimated to be worth $50 billion and is poised to reclaim its position at the pinnacle of luxury global aviation.

I. 2024-2025: ADVANCES ILLUSTRATE HAFFNER ENERGY'S TECHNOLOGICAL MATURITY

During the FY 2024-2025, Haffner Energy took crucial steps to accelerate its commercial and industrial development, with the creation of the Marolles showcase site and the signing of major partnership agreements, particularly in the SAF industry.

Operational commissioning of the Marolles hydrogen and renewable gas production, testing and training center: a strategic priority for the year

During the period, the attention of the Haffner Energy team was particularly focused on the installation and commissioning of a showcase site for the Company's technologies and expertise in the Vitry-Marolles business park (Marne County), near its headquarters. Started in late 2023, the development of this production, testing and training center unfolded in several stages: after archaeological excavations, site preparation and equipment assembly, the center entered the renewable gas (syngas) production phase on June 18, 2024 (cf. 06/20/2024 press release). Equipped with new-generation equipment and intended to operate continuously 8,000 hours per year, this site was inaugurated on November 22, 2024, during Industry Week (cf. 11/22/2024 press release and press kit).

After obtaining regulatory approvals and installing additional equipment, the team dedicated to this project reached a strategic milestone for Haffner Energy's industrial and commercial development with, in February 2025, the commissioning of mobility-grade green hydrogen production (cf. 02/26/2025 press releases). Green hydrogen produced as part of the activities on the Marolles site - 120 tonnes/year - is to be commercialized. Haffner Energy already signed an offtake Memorandum of Understanding on December 16, 2024, with a French operator specializing in hydrogen removal and resale in order to decarbonize mobility and industry.

This site now allows the Company's customers and prospects to test the range of possibilities offered by Haffner Energy technologies at full-scale and with their own biomass: production of ""super green"" gas and hydrogen, co-production of electricity, production and/or gasification of biocarbon and/or biochar. This site is also intended to train their teams in operating and maintaining the equipment.

This project, which has resulted in the world's first known site producing hydrogen from solid biomass residues, was made possible thanks to the support and commitment of the French public authorities through various local and national entities. It has thus benefited from more than €1.5M in public funding3, demonstrating the trust placed in Haffner Energy to contribute to the green reindustrialization strategy led by the French government.

While the success of this structuring project attests to Haffner Energy's technological and industrial maturity, it will also demonstrate the economic and ecological relevance of its technologies. Indeed, compared to alternative technologies, water electrolysis in particular, the ""super green"" hydrogen produced by Haffner Energy through its thermolysis technology is especially competitive due to the low cost of the primary energy used (biomass), combined with excellent energy efficiency (+ 75% for installations > 20MW). In addition, this hydrogen is carbon negative when co-produced biochar is used to sequester biogenic carbon.

This showcase site is therefore a decisive tool to realize the Company's commercial potential. In the short term, it will allow several contracts awaiting signature to move forward, as evidenced by the recent signing of a first contract for the construction of a hydrogen, electricity, and biochar production unit from forestry residues on the Corbat Group site in Glovelier, Switzerland, for H2 bois SA. This unit, which is expected to be commissioned in July 2026, represents a total order value for Haffner Energy that is likely to reach €8.3M including options (cf. 03/12/2025 press release).

2024-2025: new strategic partnerships with leading players

The growing maturity of Haffner Energy’s technologies in their various applications has enabled the Company to amplify the process of building strategic partnerships already underway and to gain the trust of leading players. During this past year, new agreements have mainly occurred in the SAF industry, the Company's priority segment given its market potential.

Haffner Energy established a first partnership with the American company LanzaJet in June 2024 in the context of its SAF production plant project, Paris-Vatry SAF (cf. 06/06/2024 press release). A global leader in ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) technology, LanzaJet is a remarkably advanced player in the industry with more than 90 SAF projects in its portfolio. It was named in 2024 by Time Magazine as one of the ""100 Most Influential Companies"". Its investors include the Aéroport de Paris (ADP) group, British Airways, Airbus, Southwest Airlines and Microsoft, among others.

A key agreement was also signed in September 2024 with IðunnH2, the green hydrogen and sustainable e-fuel project developer in charge of Iceland's largest e-SAF production plant project (65,000-tonne capacity). Located near Keflavík International Airport, the site is to be commissioned in 2028, using biogenic carbon from on-site biocarbon gasification with Haffner Energy's patented technology. This solution was chosen by IðunnH2 for its ability to significantly reduce costs and increase productivity in the e-SAF production process. Indeed, in Iceland, the limited volumes of local biomass mean low access to biogenic carbon, an essential component of SAF. Haffner Energy's supplies of solid biocarbon, gasified on-site by its Gasiliner®, will provide a competitive and flexible alternative to the usual option of biogenic CO2, a gas that is expensive to capture, transport and store. (cf. 09/02/2024 press release).

Keen to amplify the scope of their first partnership, Haffner Energy and LanzaJet announced another partnership agreement in January 2025 (cf. 01/28/2025 press release), accompanied by LanzaTech, the developer of a differentiating solution for transforming syngas into ethanol and a LanzaJet shareholder. The Nasdaq-listed company is a recognized leader in commercial carbon management solutions.

The objective of the tripartite agreement is to explore joint projects for the conversion of biomass residues into sustainable aviation fuel across the entire SAF production value chain by combining the technologies of the three companies. It also involves exploring a variety of opportunities, including the development of industrial facilities, fuel purchase agreements, and joint technology licenses, as well as financial support and/or investment in specific SAF projects.

Haffner Energy also entered into a partnership agreement with ATOBA Energy in February 2025 (cf. 02/20/2025 press release), a SAF aggregator whose purpose is to solve the financial dilemma between airlines and producers by allowing different players to benefit from long-term SAF contracts at optimized prices, in particular through off-takes from diversified producers and technologies. This partnership should facilitate the financing of Haffner Energy's SAF projects by removing the barriers of this value chain, as production plant projects struggle with signing the necessary contracts to guarantee investment returns. The identification of Haffner Energy by ATOBA Energy as a strategic player in the SAF ecosystem is another testament to the competitiveness of its technological solutions.

Lastly, after the end of the fiscal year, Haffner Energy announced a partnership agreement with global business aviation leader Luxaviation to accelerate the production and promotion of SAF. Luxaviation is to take an active role in SAF Zero (cf. 06/18/2024 press release), an initiative launched by Haffner Energy in September 2024 (cf. 09/12/2024 press release).

In addition, Haffner Energy has pursued its partnership approach aimed at diversifying its sustainable biomass supply sources. In France, a new agreement was signed in August 2024 with Bambbco, leader in the development of the bamboo industry in France (cf. 09/24/2024 press release). The partnership aims to improve the energy use of biomass, particularly on marginal lands and semi-desert areas, by creating local ecosystems for SAF projects. In a similar fashion, Haffner Energy had signed a partnership early 2024 with the US company Hexas, specialized in the production of raw plant-based materials from its regenerative crop: XanoGrass™ (cf. 03/13/2024 press release).

II. SUCCESSFULLY RAISING THE FUNDS NEEDED TO FINANCE THE COMPANY'S GROWTH

Shortly before FY 2024-2025 ended, Haffner Energy launched a capital increase through the issue of shares with share subscription warrants (ABSA), while maintaining shareholders' preferential subscription rights (DPS).

This operation’s final completion, materialized by the settlement-delivery of the shares on April 4, 2025, i.e. just after the close of the fiscal year, enabled the company to raise €7M and expand its free float, which now stands at almost 25% of the capital.

As announced in June 2024, and within the framework of the authorizations granted by the Annual General Meeting of September 12, 2024, Haffner Energy raised funds to accelerate the Company's development. Following a decision by the Board of Directors at its meeting of March 12, 2025, this took the form of a €7M capital increase through the issue of ABSAs with shareholders' preferential subscription rights (DPS).

A two-stage transaction: €7M through the issue of ABSAs, potentially doubled if the warrants are exercised within 18 months.

As a reminder, the operation had the following characteristics:

- Transaction eligible for the IR-PME, PEA and PEA-PME, FIP-FCPI and Article 150-0 B ter schemes

- Allocation of preferential subscription rights (DPS): on the basis of 1 preferential subscription right for 1 share held on 03/14/2025

- Negotiability of DPS from 03/17/2025 to 03/26/2025 inclusive

- Subscription ratio: 9 ABSA for 23 Existing Shares

- Subscription price per ABSA: €0.40, i.e. a 59% discount to the closing price on 03/12/2025, the day before the transaction was announced (€0.98).

- ABSA subscription period from 03/19/2025 to 03/28/2025 inclusive

- Final completion of the issue recorded on 04/04/2025, for an amount of €6,995,497.60, of which €1,748,874.40 par value and €5,246,623.20 issue premium, bringing the Company's share capital to €6,218,220.10.

- Settlement-delivery of the ABSA: 04/04/2025

- Trading of New Shares (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 - Ticker: ALHAF) and BSAs (ISIN FR001400Y4X9) on Euronext Growth in Paris since 04/04/2025Trading of New Shares (ISIN: FR0014007ND6 - Ticker: ALHAF) and BSAs (ISIN FR001400Y4X9) on Euronext Growth in Paris since 04/04/2025

- Terms and conditions of exercise of the warrants attached to the ABSAs (on the basis of 1 warrant per New Share): as from 04/04/2026 for a period of 6 months, 3 warrants entitling the holder to subscribe to one New Share at a price of €1.20. Exercise of all the warrants would ultimately represent a potential capital increase of €6,995,498 gross.

This operation benefited from the renewed support of historical shareholders (Haffner Participation, VICAT, EUREFI) and new investors, who had committed to participate in the transaction up to €5.5M.

It was carried out with the assistance of Gilbert Dupont, as global coordinator and bookrunner, and CIC Market Solutions as custodian.

Post-transaction, a modified capital structure and a near-doubling of the free float

The gross capital increase recorded by the Board of Directors at its meeting on April 1, 2025 amounted to €6,995,497.60, including €1,748,874.40 nominal value and €5,246,623.60 share premium, and resulted in the issuance of 17,488,744 ABSAs at a subscription price of €0.40 per share, including €0.10 nominal value and €0.30 issue premium (cf. press releases of 2/04/2025 and 4/04/2025).

Following the issuance of ABSA, Haffner Energy's share capital was increased to €6,218,220.10 divided into 62,182,201 ordinary shares with a nominal value of €0.10.

The operation led to a change in the breakdown of capital and voting rights. In particular, the capital increase led to a significant increase in the free float (from 12.83% to 24.75%), which should ultimately prove positive for the share's attractiveness.

Table: Impact of the ABSA issue on the breakdown of share capital and Differential Voting Rights

For the record, a shareholder who did not take part in the operation and previously held 1% of the capital saw a dilutive effect of 0.72% applied to his position.

After the operation, stock price in turmoil

Mechanically, and all other things being equal, Haffner Energy's share price should have fallen by around 28%, in line with the dilutive effect. However, following the capital increase, the share experienced unexpectedly high trading volumes, due first and foremost to massive and disorderly selling, leading to a drop in the share price to a low of €0.25 on 04/18/2025. Since then, the stock price has begun to rise again (to €0.35 on 06/23/2025). Trade is still occurring in very high volumes, without Haffner Energy having any specific information on their origin.

III. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS OF LOW SIGNIFICANCE, MARKED BY EFFORTS TO IMPROVE EBITDA AND PRESERVE CASH

The consolidated financial statements presented below, for which audit procedures are in progress, were approved by the Board of Directors at its 06/27/2025 meeting. The scope of consolidation and accounting methods used at March 31, 2025, are unchanged from the previous year: Haffner Energy's consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS; the only consolidated subsidiary is Jacquier.

In terms of consolidated financial results, FY 2024-2025 displays a similar profile to the previous one, albeit with a few changes.

At 03/31/025, consolidated revenue remained amounted to €378k. It mainly comprised sales of boiler-making equipment by Jacquier and various services and studies by Haffner Energy.

As a reminder, consolidated revenue was negative for FY 2023-2024 (-157 k€) due to the impact of the termination of the R-Hynoca contract in December 20235 (cf. 14/12/2023 press release).

Confirmed EBIDTA improvement thanks to cost-cutting measures

Extending the trend of the first half of the year, EBITDA6 continued to improve to -€10,011k, under the combined effect of the decrease in purchases consumed (-15%), personnel costs (-17%) and external expenses (-23%), resulting from the full impact of the cash preservation plan initiated in November 2023.

Operating result nevertheless deteriorated (-€12,275k at 03/31/2025, down €2,012k compared to 03/31/2024). This change is mainly due to the reversal of provisions for losses on completion from the previous year in the amount of €5,787k.

As of 03/31/2025, consolidated net income stood at -€12,311k, registering a larger loss than last year (-€9,935k at 03/31/2024).

After appropriation of net income, shareholders' equity amounted to €14,300k, excluding the impact of the capital increase which will be taken into account in FY 2025-2026 due to its completion after the closing date.

Haffner Energy's other assets and liabilities are as follows:

On the assets side, non-current assets (€11,250k, or +€309k) were almost stable, mainly composed of intangible assets representing the Company's intellectual property (€8,105k as of 03/31/2025 compared to €7,843k as of 03/31/2024). Current assets, on the other hand, contracted significantly to €22,456k (-€12,321k), mainly due to:

the consumption of a significant portion of cash (€559k as of 03/31/2025 compared to €11,042k as of 03/31/2024).

the decrease in other current assets (advances paid to suppliers for €2,464k and Research Tax Credit for €941k).

Conversely, inventories and outstandings increased, reaching €13,432k at the end of the financial year (+€3,287k) mainly due to the installation of the Marolles site.

On the liabilities side, shareholders' equity amounted to €14,300k at 03/31/2025 (a decrease of €12,468k) mainly due to the allocation of the year's profit to reserves. It should be noted that the capital increase is not taken into account as of 03/31/2025.

Non-current liabilities decreased slightly (-€268k at 03/31/2025 to €5,833k). This change takes into account the €500k RDI loan received from Bpifrance in March 2025.

Current liabilities, meanwhile, increased +€725k to €13,574k at 31/03/2025. This change is mainly due to the net increase in provisions ongoing litigations (+€882k to €1,116k at 31/03/2025).

It should be noted that, as the proceedings with Sara and Carbonloop are still in progress, the balance sheet position of previous years has been maintained. In addition, a provision has been booked in respect of employee-related litigation.

Net cash position necessitates fundraising despite reduced cash-burn rate

As of 03/31/2025, net cash and cash equivalents amounted to €559k.

As a reminder, the main measures of the cash preservation plan initiated since November 2023 and implemented during the year have focused on:

Overheads in addition to reinforced budget management and expense control measures, the company reduced fees, cancelled non-essential service or subcontracting contracts whose tasks could be handled internally, changed payroll managers, renegotiated the commercial terms of other contracts, and limited travel and related expenses to essentials.

Payroll: in addition to the freeze on recruitment and replacements, as well as the absence of a general salary increase over FY 2023-24 and FY 2024-2025, Haffner Energy implemented a targeted redundancy plan in the summer of 2024, resulting in the loss of nine (9) positions. Subsequent to the balance sheet date, a redundancy plan for economic reasons was launched at SAS Jacquier. This redundancy plan resulted in the departure of three (3) employees from the workforce on 06/16/2025.

Leased surface areas: these have been reduced in both Nantes and Paris, thanks to the relocation of the Paris offices in January 2025 and the termination of the lease on the 1st floor of the Nantes offices.

Postponement of non-priority investments, such as the deployment of a new ERP system (€1.3M).

Renegotiations with strategic partners and service providers to review certain delivery schedules and invoice payment deadlines (€3M)

Deferrals of payments illustrating the commitment of all internal stakeholders to the company, such as the deferral of the payment of the individual portion of employees' target-based bonuses and the payment of directors' fees; lastly, we note the waiver by the two executives and founding investors, Philippe and Marc Haffner, of the variable portion of their remuneration for FY 2023-2024, as well as the temporary two-stage reduction of part of their fixed remuneration for FY 2023-2024 and FY 2024-2025. These amounts have been provisioned in the financial statements.

Thanks to the implementation of these cost-saving measures, the average monthly cash-burn rate was significantly reduced during the year, gradually falling from €1.4M at the end of 2023 to €1M at the end of 2024, to about €0.6M per month in Q1 2025 (calendar year), excluding income and non-recurring expenses.

In order to ensure that the Company would have the necessary resources to pursue its development until the expected ramp-up in revenue, and as announced as early as June 2024, Haffner Energy therefore initiated the above-mentioned capital increase during the year (see page 4).

Having carried out a review of its liquidity risk, the Company considers that it will have sufficient cash to finance its activities until at least 03/31/2026.

This cash outlook takes into account:

- The €7M capital increase finally subscribed on April 4, 2025, after the closing of FY 2024-2025;

- The receipt, in March 2025, of a €500k innovation grant from Bpifrance (RDI loan) for the hydrogen production, testing and training center project in Marolles (Marl'Hy);

- Cost reductions undertaken by the Company (see page 8) that cap the average monthly cash burn-rate, excluding non-recurring income and expenses, at around €600k (compared with €1M at the end of 2024).

In the 1st half of the year, this is subject to the successful completion of the endurance test at the Marolles site and the signature of the resulting contracts, as well as to the obtaining, during the year, of additional financing linked to the equipment at the Marolles site.

IV. PROJECTS AND PROSPECTS: FOUR NEW OPERATIONAL PRIORITIES

For the current financial year, the Haffner Energy team, boosted by the confidence and support from its business partners, shareholders and institutional ecosystem, has set four new operational priorities: accelerating the conversion of its pipeline, moving forward with the implementation of targeted strategic projects, continuing to structure its action, and simplifying its governance.

Accelerating pipeline conversion

At the end of FY 2024-2025, Haffner Energy had an estimated total sales pipeline of €1.55Bn compared to €1.4Bn at 03/31/2024, confirming a high level of commercial activity due to the various initiatives undertaken since mid-2023: launch of a high-capacity offer for the renewable gas market (syngas) and a SAF offer; business development in the United States through the creation of a subsidiary; increased presence in various US trade fairs dedicated to renewable energies and hydrogen7.

On the occasion of its capital increase, and in order to offer a clearer and more representative view of its business and prospects, the Company decided to adopt a communication based on a weighted sales pipeline** instead of medium-term annual revenue targets, as was previously practiced, as projects typically convert into backlog over a two-year cycle. This weighted pipeline is determined by applying a probability of success to the potential revenue of each project that counts in the sales pipeline

At the end of March 2025, Haffner Energy's weighted sales pipeline stood at €388M.

Two contracts for hydrogen production equipment had been identified as likely to be signed following the start of hydrogen production at the Marolles site in February 2025 (cf. 02/26/2025 press release).

The first of these is the H2 bois project, for which Haffner Energy signed an initial contract on 03/12/2025, which is essential for the creation of this unit to produce hydrogen, electricity, and biochar from biomass at the Swiss Corbat group's site (cf. 03/12/2025 press release). With delivery of the site scheduled for July 2026, orders for Haffner Energy are expected to be staggered between now and the end of FY 2025-2026.

The second regards REFORMERS' Renewable Energy Valley project in Alkmaar in the Netherlands. The latter was awarded the 2025 World Hydrogen Award, ""Clean Project"" category, May 22, 2025, in Rotterdam, thanks to the choice of HYNOCA® as the green hydrogen production technology included in the project.

Advancing the implementation of a number of targeted strategic projects: R&D, Marolles, and commercial partnerships

While growing the market for existing solutions is the priority for the current financial year, Haffner Energy has continued and will continue to invest time in Research & Development in order to offer its customers new or optimized solutions. The performance of its biomass thermolysis technology is indeed the source of the recognition enjoyed by the Group. In particular, before the end of FY 2024-2025, the Company was awarded the “Innovative Company” label by Bpifrance. This recognition enabled the company to welcome an FCPI fund to its capital.

In April 2025, the Group presented a new line of production units, Hynoca® Flex 500 IG, capable of producing 12 tonnes per day of marketable green hydrogen for less than €3/kg without subsidies, and of generating profitable renewable electricity at peak times (cf. 24/04/2025 press release). Competitive with grey hydrogen and fossil fuels thanks to its energy efficiency of over 80%, this new solution offers all the flexibility of hydrogen and electricity cogeneration, enabling producers’ sites to manage random hydrogen demand and benefit from continuous operation without having to lock themselves into rigid off-take contracts.

The current year's priorities also include optimizing equipment at the strategic Marolles site, and in particular finalizing the installation of the Gasiliner® (cf. 11/22/2024 press release).

The Haffner Energy team has also been working to advance the strategic Paris-Vatry SAF project. During FY 2024-2025, the Company finalized the creation of SPV (Special Project Vehicle) PARIS VATRY SAF SAS. In addition, Luxembourg-based Luxaviation, a global business aviation leader, confirmed its interest in playing an active role in spin-off SAF Zero at the International Paris Air Show this month. Luxaviation's participation could take the form of financing the initial development of SAF activities, supporting strategy and global visibility, as well as off-take agreements in SAF Zero projects such as Paris-Vatry SAF (cf. 06/18/2025 press release).

Finally, the FactorHy project of a first plant to assemble renewable gas and hydrogen production modules is still underway. Preliminary studies have been completed and detailed studies for the building permit application are continuing.

Continuing to structure its action

Having completed the creation of Haffner Energy Inc., an unconsolidated US subsidiary, in May 2024, Haffner Energy will continue to work on structuring its action and future developments with a view, in particular, to making effective progress in the SAF market. For current FY, the Company intends to launch SAF Zero, a spin-off designed to maximize its potential in this booming market (cf. 12/09/2024 press release and 18/06/2025 press releases).

Simplifying its governance

In addition, Haffner Energy has decided to simplify its corporate governance to enhance efficiency.

At its meeting on 05/09/2025, the Board of Directors decided to propose the following to the 06/23/2025 Combined General Meeting of Shareholders:

a reduction in the number of Board members, with the early termination of the terms of office of Kouros France and Kouros SA, who also undertook to reduce their shareholding following the capital increase in which they did not wish to participate;

a partial renewal of the Board's membership, to allow the entry of a new director representing the Luxembourg company Eren Industries, one of Haffner Energy's industrial shareholders. A partner of Haffner Energy’s since the Company's IPO, this recognized player in the energy transition is dedicated to technological innovation in the service of the natural resource economy. Eren Industries develops and invests in infrastructure projects, particularly in low-carbon energy production (hydrogen, biogas, biomethane, etc.), some of which could be projects of interest to Haffner Energy, and will provide the Board with all its sector expertise.

An update of the statutes simplifying the majority rules applicable to certain Board decisions, in line with common practice.

All the resolutions were adopted at the June 23, 2025 General Shareholders’ Meeting.

It should be noted that the Board of Directors has decided to reduce the attendance fees of independent directors as from the next financial year. Non-independent directors will not be remunerated.

In addition, Mrs Bich Van Ngo and Mrs Sophie Dutordoir, independent directors, resigned from the Board at the close of the Annual General Meeting on 06/23/2025.

Mr. Olivier Piron (Société E-Venture Management and Investment srl) was co-opted to the Board of Directors as an independent director at the close of the Board meeting of 06/27/2025.

As a result, Haffner Energy's Board of Directors is now composed of six (6) members, up from eight (8) previously:

Mr. Philippe Haffner, Chairman and CEO of Haffner Energy

Mr. Marc Haffner, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of Haffner Energy

Mrs. Francesca Ecsery, independent

Société E-Venture Management and Investment srl, with Mr. Olivier Piron as permanent representative

Europe and Growth, with Mr. Xavier Dethier as permanent representative

Eren Industries SA, with Mr. David Corchia as permanent representative

Glossary:

The Company is now adopting a communication based on a weighted sales pipeline instead of medium-term annual revenue targets, as was previously practiced, as projects typically convert into backlog over a two-year cycle.

* Pipeline designates a business opportunity when at least one of the following situations occurs:

- a preliminary feasibility study for the installation of equipment is, or has been, carried out; or

- a budget offer, or a preliminary business plan for the project, or a complete commercial offer including specifications, has been sent to the customer and Haffner Energy is awaiting its response; or

- a letter of intent has been sent to Haffner Energy by the customer; or

- Haffner Energy has received an invitation to participate and is part of a tender process.

** The weighted pipeline is determined by applying a probability of success to the potential sales of each project included in the total pipeline. Thus, given a total pipeline of projects worth €1.55Bn at March 31, 2025, the weighted pipeline at March 31, 2025 stood at €388M, with “hydrogen projects” now accounting for only 18% of the weighted pipeline.

1 Subscription period for the Capital Increase closed on 03/29/2025, Settlement-Delivery on 04/04/2025.

2 In order to offer a clearer and more representative view of its business and prospects, the Company is now adopting a communication based on a weighted sales pipeline instead of medium-term annual revenue targets, as was previously practiced, as projects typically convert into backlog over a two-year cycle. This weighted pipeline is determined by applying a probability of success to the potential revenue of each project that counts in the sales pipeline.

3 Including an Innovation-Research and Development Loan (PIRD) in the amount of €500k granted by Bpifrance and received in early March 2025.

4 Cash and cash equivalents at 03/31/2025 do not include the €7M fundraising, which was completed after closing on 04/04/2025

5 The termination of the R-Hynoca contract was accompanied by a memorandum of understanding under which Haffner Energy will have to make two residual payments (€1M before 12/31/2025 and €0.85M before 12/31/2026).

6 EBITDA corresponds to operating income before depreciation and amortization, impairment net of reversals of fixed assets and current assets, and before operating provisions net of reversals.

7 Since January 2025, Haffner Energy has participated in Hyvolution Paris 2025, Bio360 Expo 2025 in Nantes, World Electrolysis Congress 2025 in Cologne, World Hydrogen Summit 2025 in Rotterdam, for example.

SEA biodiesel industry looks to decarbonise: Correction

SEA biodiesel industry looks to decarbonise: Correction

Corrects figure for capital expenditure forecast in paragraph 15 Singapore, 30 June (Argus) — Regional biodiesel associations from Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia called for stakeholder support to further decarbonisation goals during the 5th Palm Biodiesel Conference in Bangkok over 23-24 June. Thai electrification shift competes with biodiesel industry Thailand has been driving a shift toward electric vehicles (EVs) under the 30@30 policy, targeting at least 30pc of total motor vehicles produced annually by 2030 to be EVs, while support for biodiesel producers is waning, said Thai biodiesel producer association Chairman Sanin Triyanond. Thailand will no longer subsidise the price of biofuels such as biodiesel under the oil fund act after 24 September 2026, said Supatchalee Sophonthammaphat, an official with the Thai department of alternative energy development and efficiency (DEDE). Triyanond called for both the EV and biodiesel industries to coexist, citing a study that said an EV and biofuel energy mix was recommended for the country. A low biodiesel blend target in Thailand resulted in only 30pc of Thailand's 11.7mn l/d in installed biodiesel capacity being utilised, and high operating costs across its 14 registered companies, Triyanond said. When domestic crude palm oil (CPO) stocks fall below 200,000t, local prices also increase in comparison to the global price, he added. This raises the cost of production when biodiesel producers import CPO as it is subject to 143pc import tax and exempt from export duties in Thailand. Thailand manages CPO supplies and prices by altering its volumetric blend target for biodiesel under the alternative energy development plan (AEDP). However, the biodiesel industry has been struggling with a low blending policy and feels that the stock management program needs to be redesigned to better support producers. Indonesia needs more investment to hit B50 biodiesel blend goal Indonesia is targeting 15.6mn kl of domestic biodiesel consumption in 2025 and has been conducting road tests for a higher B50 biodiesel blend with fossil diesel this year. To meet higher biodiesel blend ratios in subsequent years, new investment from the private sector and policy support from the government on pricing, funding and legislation is needed to drive infrastructure upgrades and capacity expansions, said deputy of promotion and communication at the Indonesian biofuels producer association (APROBI) Ravi Farkhan Pratama. For suppliers, complex logistics resulting in higher costs for transporting biodiesel to remote regions remain, said manager of biofuel and additive supply chain at PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Adi Rachman. A price disparity between public service obligation (PSO) and non-PSO (NPSO) biodiesel blends in the market poses a challenge in ensuring each fuel is supplied to the right customer group, he added. The PSO sector includes state-owned firms that serve the public. Fuel suppliers in this sector receive subsidies from the oil plantation fund management agency (BPDPKS) to fund the difference between palm oil-based biodiesel and the indexed price of diesel, while non-PSO fuel suppliers do not. Biodiesel plants in Indonesia have been running at an average 80pc of Indonesia's 20.9mn kl/yr installed capacity across 24 producers this year, said Pratama. Indonesia consumed about 20pc of annual CPO production under the B35 blend mandate in 2024. This year's B40 biodiesel blend mandate could eat into exports and other avenues including food use, Pratama added. Any further increase to blending mandates would exacerbate how palm supplies are distributed between food and fuel. There are also additional costs around infrastructure upgrades such as coating pipelines and storage tanks, said Rachman. A move to a B50 blend mandate would likely happen in 2027 or later, said head of B40 road test and B40 commercial test team at LEMIGAS research and development center of oil & gas technology, ministry of energy and mineral resources Cahyo Setyo Wibowo at the event. Malaysian biodiesel producers push for higher blending mandates Malaysia's B20 biodiesel blend mandate set in January 2020 has been limited to Pulau Langkawi, Kedah, Labuan and Sarawak in the transport sector. A separate 7pc biodiesel blend is required in the industrial sector, first mandated in July 2019. President of Malaysian biodiesel association Tee Lip Teng sought a nationwide B20 implementation for on-road fuels, and a B30 blend ratio by 2030. However, Tee said that a capital expenditure of more than 600mn ringgit ($142mn) would be required to achieve a full B30 nameplate biodiesel production capacity for the transport sector in Malaysia. On the other hand, the country is set to introduce a carbon tax as early as next year, allowing palm oil methyl ester (PME) prices to be more competitive, he added. Lower palm oil prices in relation to gasoil amid oil market uncertainty and during the upcoming peak palm production season could also drive voluntary blending. But fossil diesel continues to be subsidised for qualified businesses in the transportation and logistics sector, increasing the funding burden needed to subsidise PME in these sectors. While PME production continues to face challenges, Tee cited the potential to expand waste-based biodiesel production in Malaysia. Biodiesel exports out of Malaysia rose up to 2019 before declining afterward due to the EU ban on palm-based biofuels, Tee said. Majority of the biodiesel exported now comprises used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) and palm oil mill effluent oil methyl ester (Pomeme) rather than PME, he added. First generation biodiesel producers should be incentivised through government grants to retrofit their plants to use waste-based oils to complement their existing palm oil feedstock, Tee said. Other alternative feedstocks carrying a lower levelized cost of production such as palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) should be considered as a feedstock of choice, said general manager for strategy and sustainability at Petronas Dagangan Berhad Ms. Harlina Pikri.

GENEVA – The International Air Transport Association (IATA) announced the release of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Matchmaker platform, to facilitate SAF procurement between airlines and SAF producers by matching requests for SAF supply with offers. When there is a match, airlines and suppliers can connect and take their negotiation offline to agree on specific terms including price and payment terms.

Specifically, the SAF Matchmaker addresses three critical issues:

Efficiency: The availability of a central platform will simplify SAF procurement by making it easier and faster for all parties to connect without additional fees. It will therefore facilitate further development of the voluntary market for SAF purchasing.

Connectivity: SAF producers and suppliers can post available or planned SAF volumes while airlines are able to register their interest in purchasing shown or desired SAF volumes. Subsequent trades will take place outside the platform.

Visibility: The platform carries comprehensive information regarding the available SAF, such as volumes, feedstock used, the location and technology of production, the emissions reductions, as well as compliance with the Carbon Offsetting Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or the European Union’s Renewable Energy Directive (EU RED).

“To reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, we need an accessible, transparent, liquid, and efficient SAF market. The SAF Matchmaker is another example of the work that IATA is putting in place to create a fully functioning market for SAF. The SAF Matchmaker platform will accelerate the uptake of SAF by reducing the costs and complexity that airlines face when searching for SAF suppliers,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

Former President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, a $4 trillion legislative package, recently cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate (51–49), moving it closer to final passage ahead of the self-imposed July 4 deadline. A major focus of the bill is the overhaul of federal tax policy, particularly the elimination or tightening of dozens of existing tax credits, with clean energy incentives among the most heavily targeted.

Here’s a breakdown of all the credits that would be repealed or significantly restricted under the proposed legislation:

Clean Vehicle and Alternative Fuel Property Credits

Used Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 25E(g)): Ends after September 30, 2025

New Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 30D(h)): Ends for vehicles purchased after September 30, 2025

Qualified Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit (Section 45W(g)): Ends after September 30, 2025

Alternative Fuel Refueling Property Credit (Section 30C(i)): Ends after June 30, 2026

Residential & Commercial Energy Efficiency Credits

Energy-Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 70505): Ends for expenses after December 31, 2025

Residential Clean Energy Credit (Section 25D(h)): Ends for expenses after December 31, 2025

Energy-Efficient New Homes Credit (Section 45L(h)): Ends after June 30, 2026

Commercial Buildings Energy Efficiency Deduction (Section 179D): Phased out for construction starting after June 30, 2026

Clean Energy & Nuclear Production Credits

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (Section 45V): Ends January 1, 2028

Clean Electricity Production Credit (Section 45Y): Ends for facilities in service after December 31, 2027.

Also restricted if construction involves “material assistance from prohibited foreign entities” (after June 16, 2025, or December 31, 2025 for others)

Credit denied to foreign-influenced taxpayers or foreign leasing entities

Clean Electricity Investment Credit (Section 48E): Ends for facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027

Includes same foreign entity restrictions

Energy percentages drop to 0% for certain facilities started after June 16, 2025

Zero-Emission Nuclear Production Credit (Section 45U):

Ends for taxpayers classified as foreign entities or influenced by foreign actors

Ineligible if nuclear fuel used was sourced or traded from covered nations/entities after December 31, 2027

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit

Section 45X Credit: Phased out and denied for components tied to prohibited foreign entities or foreign-influenced taxpayers

Fuel and Carbon Sequestration Credits

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Credit (Section 6426(k)): Ends for sales/use after September 30, 2025

Clean Fuel Production Credit (Section 45Z(f)):

Eligibility restricted to fuels sourced only from the U.S., Mexico, or Canada

Denied for foreign-influenced taxpayers

Carbon Sequestration Credit (Section 45Q(f)): Ends for foreign entities or foreign-influenced taxpayers starting with tax years after enactment

Saver’s Credit (Retirement Savings)

A key provision (Section 70116(a)) treating some retirement savings as matching contributions by the Treasury will be repealed after December 31, 2025

Foreign Tax Credit Restrictions

A 10% portion of certain foreign income taxes paid or accrued on amounts excluded due to Section 951A(a) will be disallowed

Applies to distributions made after June 28, 2025

A Shift in Fiscal and Energy Priorities

These proposed repeals and restrictions—part of a broader package that also includes deep social spending cuts—represent a major pivot away from clean energy incentives and toward fossil fuel production, a stance that has drawn sharp criticism. Notably, Elon Musk labeled the plan “totally nonsensical and destructive,” warning of millions of lost U.S. jobs and strategic setbacks.

These examples demonstrate that circular economy solutions are not abstract theories but tangible, scalable projects already delivering environmental and social returns.
Enabling the Transition: Policy, Technology, and Knowledge ADB’s circular economy vision is supported by strong enabling mechanisms.
To build the necessary capacity and knowledge base, ADB has launched the Circular Economy Data Room, a central hub for policy briefs, blogs, training sessions, and webinars.","In “Advancing the Circular Economy: Creating a Sustainable Future in Asia and the Pacific”, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) outlines a transformative economic vision centered on sustainability, innovation, and regeneration. Drawing on research by leading institutions including the United Nations Environment Programme, Global Plastic Action Partnership, Agence Française de Développement, KfW Development Bank, and National Plastic Action Partnerships, the document makes a strong case for abandoning the linear economic model of “take, make, waste.” Instead, it champions a circular economy that designs waste out of the system, keeps materials in use for as long as possible, and regenerates natural systems. By weaving together environmental urgency and practical solutions, the brochure signals a new chapter for development across Asia and the Pacific, one where economic growth no longer comes at the expense of ecological integrity.

The Numbers Don’t Lie: Why the Region Must Act Now

The stakes for Asia and the Pacific could not be higher. Despite being a major consumer of global resources, the region attracts only 8% of global investment in plastic circularity. It is also responsible for much of the estimated 14 million tons of plastic that enter the ocean every year, accounting for a staggering 80% of all marine litter. According to the brochure, if global population trends continue and reach 9.8 billion by 2050, the world would require the natural resources of three Earths to sustain current consumption levels. In the Asia-Pacific region alone, the average food waste per person is 120 kilograms annually. The mismatch between resource use and circular investment highlights a glaring gap, one that ADB seeks to address through comprehensive, cross-sectoral interventions. The message is clear: unless patterns of consumption and production shift dramatically, the environmental and economic future of the region is at serious risk.

Mainstreaming Circularity: ADB’s Integrated Sectoral Approach

ADB’s Environment Action Plan 2024–2030 puts circularity and pollution control at the center of its sustainability strategy. The bank applies a “One ADB” approach to unify expertise across sectors such as agriculture, energy, water, transport, and urban development. In agriculture, projects are turning food waste into organic fertilizers and bio-based packaging. In energy, waste streams like animal manure and used cooking oil are being repurposed into sustainable fuels. Transport systems are benefiting from roads made with recycled plastic and infrastructure designed for resource efficiency. In cities, ADB is promoting “sponge cities,” green roofs, reverse logistics, and wastewater reuse, creating urban systems that are both climate-resilient and resource-efficient. Water programs now include optimizing operations, reusing sludge, and restoring watersheds and aquifers. This systemic and synchronized model enables countries to leapfrog to a new development paradigm, where resource efficiency and economic growth go hand in hand.

Transforming Ideas into Action: Investments That Lead the Way

ADB is already deploying significant investments that illustrate the circular economy in practice. In Nepal and the Philippines, a 2024 technical assistance program supports the development of bamboo-based industries for construction, biofuel, textiles, and furniture. In India, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines, a $100 million financing package with Indorama Ventures aims to recycle 5 billion PET bottles, diverting them from landfills and oceans. A follow-up $44.2 million blue loan in Indonesia supports a new recycling facility with the potential to reduce 30,500 tons of CO₂ emissions. In Changzhi, PRC, a $300 million loan promotes circular urban infrastructure by reusing construction waste and deploying digital tools for solid waste management.

Pakistan has become a regional pioneer in circular fuel with an $86.2 million investment in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility that uses cooking oil and poultry waste to replace conventional jet fuel. This project also supports bioplastics production and includes a pilot program for women's participation in biowaste collection. In China, ADB’s support for a zero-waste cities initiative targets e-commerce packaging with reusable and recyclable materials, helping to green supply chains. These examples demonstrate that circular economy solutions are not abstract theories but tangible, scalable projects already delivering environmental and social returns.

Enabling the Transition: Policy, Technology, and Knowledge

ADB’s circular economy vision is supported by strong enabling mechanisms. In 2024, it approved a $500 million loan to Indonesia to support the National Action Plan for Marine Debris, aiming to cut ocean plastic by 70% by 2025. The program includes extended producer responsibility, city-level bans on single-use plastics, and new data systems for waste monitoring. Financing remains a critical bottleneck, but ADB is addressing this through facilities like the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility and the Ocean Resilience and Coastal Adaptation Partnership. Digital innovation also plays a key role: ADB is developing digital roadmaps for waste tracking in Indonesia and Vietnam, and creating a digital twin model for the Pasig River in the Philippines to map pollution patterns in real time.

To build the necessary capacity and knowledge base, ADB has launched the Circular Economy Data Room, a central hub for policy briefs, blogs, training sessions, and webinars. In 2025, ADB hosted its first-ever regional conference on the circular economy, bringing together stakeholders from across the development spectrum to align on goals and strategies. The bank also works closely with international partners to co-finance projects and run joint programs, ensuring that best practices are shared and localized solutions are scaled efficiently.

Ultimately, the study ends with a rousing call to action: ADB invites public and private sector partners to co-invest, share innovations, and collaborate to accelerate the shift toward circularity. Through collective effort, Asia and the Pacific can not only mitigate the impacts of climate change and resource scarcity but also unlock a future that is regenerative, resilient, and inclusive. The path forward is not only possible, it is already unfolding.",https://www.devdiscourse.com/remote.axd?https://devdiscourse.blob.core.windows.net/devnews/29_06_2025_10_04_11_1466422.png?width=920&format=jpeg,N,,2025-06-30 03:00:01.789213

Beside using palm oil waste, palm oil used cooking also becoming another important source for biodiesel.","Q. What is the global significance of palm oil today and how does CPOPC play a role in this evolving landscape?

Palm oil holds immense global significance as one of the most productive oil crops in the world due to its versatility, efficiency, and widespread use. It has become one of the key ingredients in food products, household goods,cosmetics, and biofuels . Its high yield per hectare makes it a crucial crop for meeting the needs of a growing global population while using relatively less land compared to other vegetable oils. The oil used by over 3 billion people daily, either directly (in cooking) or indirectly (in processed goods).Nations such as India, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, and the European Union rank among the top importers, underscoring the global dependence on this vital commodity.

The Council of Palm Oil Producing Countries (CPOPC) is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of the global palm oil industry. Founded by Indonesia and Malaysia, who together account for over 80% of global production has now five member countries and three countries as observers. These countries collectively produce nearly 90% of the global palm oil. As such, CPOPC aims to harmonize the voices of producing nations and ensure the industry grows in a sustainable, inclusive, and equitable manner. More importantly CPOPC is seen as the face of palm oil champion in the global stage.The rising demand for palm oil has also brought increased scrutiny regarding environmental and social impacts. This is where the CPOPC plays a vital role in safeguarding the interests of palm oil producing nations by promoting sustainable production practices and supporting inclusive growth, especially for smallholders.

The Council has adopted a ‘triple-track approach’ in advancing its international agenda. First, it leverages existing palm oil platforms across member states, other producing nations, and key consuming countries to strengthen cooperation and influence. Second, the CPOPC collaborates with producers of other vegetable oils to promote a unified front on sustainability. Third, it actively engages with United Nations platforms to reshape the global narrative on palm oil, advocating for a more balanced and science-based perspective.

CPOPC promotes and supports national certification schemes like Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) and IndonesianSustainable Palm Oil(ISPO) which uphold environmental and social responsibility in palm oil production. These standards ensure traceability, reduce deforestation, and protect workers’ rights, aligning with international sustainability expectations.Among other core task of CPOPC is to actively counter misinformation, foster international cooperation, and ensure that palm oil continues to be produced in a way that respects people’s right and protect the planet.

CPOPC also acts as a united front to respond to discriminatory trade practices, negative campaigns, and non-tariff barriers faced by palm oil in international markets. Through international meetings, policy platforms, and South-South cooperation, CPOPC strengthens collaboration among producing and consuming countries. It works to align palm oil development with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), emphasizing food security, poverty reduction, and climate action.

Q. Can you share insights on current trends in palm oil consumption globally and what this means for importing nations like Pakistan?

Palm oil has emerged as the most globally significant agricultural commodities due to its exceptional high yield as compared to other vegetable oils. It has become a cornerstone of global supply chains, due to its affordability and functionality making it critical for ensuring food security, especially in developing countries. Global palm oil consumption is experiencing a notable shift, particularly in Asia, which has significant implications for importing nations like Pakistan.

Asia-Pacific region’s consumption of palm oil has surged to 66 million tons in 2024, a 21% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven by rising demand in countries like India and China, where palm oil is favored for its affordability and versatility in food and industrial applications. Whereas, Pakistan also heavily relies on palm oil imports, with approximately 90% of its 3 million-tons vegetable oil requirement fulfilled through palm oil, sourced from Indonesia and Malaysia. Pakistan has imported 2.489 million tons between July 2024 andFebruary2025 recording an increase of 10%.

There are evolving dynamics to global palm oil consumption, particularly in Asia, which presents both challenges and opportunities for Pakistan. While increased demand in neighboring countries may strain supply and elevate prices, they also highlight the strategic importance of securing stable import channels and investing in domestic production capabilities to ensure food security and economic stability. Pakistan’s domestic edible oil demand stands at 4.5 million tons per year, while local production is only around 0.5 million tons. To bridge this gap, Pakistan imports approximately 3 million tons of edible oil annually, with palm oil accounting for 2.9 million tons in 2023. This underscores the role of palm oil in ensuring food security in Pakistan.

Q. How does the palm oil supply chain work? and what value does it bring to countries like Pakistan?

The palm oil supply chain is a complex and integrated system that begins with cultivation and spans through processing, refining, logistics, and distribution, supporting various value-added industries. For importing nations like Pakistan, this supply chain offers significant economic and industrial development potential.

Pakistan as net importer of edible oil for its food security is dependent on crude or semi-refined palm oil. Numerous refineries in Pakistan can refine these products into edible form, which is widely used as cooking oil and in manufacturing value-added products like vanaspati ghee, soaps, surfactants, and personal care items. Since palm oil is affordable than other edible oils in the market, it has become a key ingredient in processed foods, supporting bakeries, snack producers, and confectionery companies.

Q. What frameworks like ISPO and MSPO ensure palm oil is sustainably produced, and how can Pakistan benefit from engaging with these mechanisms?

To ensure palm oil is produced responsibly, sustainability certifications such as the ISPO and the MSPO standards have been established by producing countries. These national certification schemes are designed to align palm oil production with internationally recognized principles of environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and economic viability. Both ISPO and MSPO promote transparency, reduce deforestation, and protect the rights and livelihoods of smallholder farmers.

For a country like Pakistan, which is a major consumer and is exploring opportunities in palm oil processing and cultivation, engaging with frameworks like ISPO and MSPO can offer several advantages. By adopting or benchmarking these standards, Pakistan can enhance the sustainability and traceability of its palm oil value chain; this could open doors for technology transfer, capacity building, and stronger trade relationships with leading producer countries like Indonesia and Malaysia.

Moreover, aligning with established sustainability standards would position Pakistan as a responsible player in the global palm oil landscape, attract environmentally conscious partners, and support the development of local certification systems tailored to national needs.

Q. What would you say to critics concerned about palm oil’s health effects and environmental impact?

Criticism surrounding palm oil often centers on its health implications and environmental footprint. While these concerns are not unfounded, it’s important to reframe the debate with science-based evidence and recognize the significant progress being made in sustainability across the palm oil industry.

Palm oil is frequently criticized for being high in saturated fats, but in nuanced reality palm oil is roughly 50% saturated fat, 40% monounsaturated, and 10% polyunsaturated—comparable to animal fats but with no cholesterol.Additionally, red palm oil contains tocotrienols (a form of Vitamin E) and beta-carotene, which have antioxidant properties. Numerous scientific studies have shown that moderate consumption of palm oil does not raise LDL cholesterol. In fact, it may help maintain a healthy ratio between LDL and HDL cholesterol.

On the other hand, legitimate environment concerns exist,regarding deforestation and habitat loss, particularly in Southeast Asia. Significant reforms have been initiated by the palm oil producing countries to address these issues which are;

Many major producers and traders have adopted No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policies, which ban the clearing of primary forests and protect workers’ rights.

Traceability and Certification systems have been put in place. Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) Certification now covers nearly 20% of global production. While advanced traceability systems and satellite monitoring are being used to track the origin of palm oil and ensure compliance. While RSPO is volunteer basis, both Malaysian and Indonesian Governments has taken pro-active steps in making MSPO and ISPO as a mandatory requirement for all palm oil industry players.

Palm oil is the most efficient vegetable oil crop, requiring 4–10 times less land than soybean, sunflower, or rapeseed oil for the same output. Globally, palm oil utilizes about 29 million hectares for cultivation while soybean more than 136 million hectares, rapeseed 44 million hectares and sunflower 30 million hectares as of 2023.

When responsibly produced and consumed in moderation, palm oil is nutritionally sound and environmentally viable and can be part of a more sustainable and healthier global food system. The real solution lies not in boycotts, but in supporting sustainable production, transparency, and encouraging policy engagement.

Q. How is technology shaping the future of sustainable palm oil-from farm to frying pan to biofuel?

Technology has transformed the palm oil industry across its entire value chain from plantations to processing to end-use applications; ensuring greater sustainability, transparency, and efficiency. Lately, global expectations have risen for responsible production and climate-smart agriculture, innovative tools are also reshaping how palm oil is grown, traded, and consumed.

Palm oil industry has started adopting various technological aids to improve the entire value chain and making palm oil more sustainable, accountable, and future-ready. Following are few examples of technologies are being used;

1.) Digital traceability systems are now integral to tracking palm oil from plantation to final product. These systems use blockchain, QR codes, and integrated supply chain software to a) Map origins of fresh fruit bunches (FFB); b) Monitor custody transfers across mills, refineries, and distributors; c) Provide real-time data to regulators, buyers, and consumers. This transparency builds trust and ensures that palm oil is produced without contributing to illegal land use or deforestation.

2). Introduction of satellite imagery and remote sensing technologies allow near real-time monitoring of palm oil plantations. This helps to detect- a) Illegal land clearing or encroachment; b) Deforestation in high conservation value (HCV) areas; c) Fires and land degradation risks. These tools enforce sustainability commitments and quick response to environmental threats.

3). Digital certification and smart auditing tools are being used in palm oil certification processes to reduce bureaucracy and increase integrity. Tools such as- a) Mobile apps for field assessments; b) Digital dashboards for compliance tracking; c) AI-enabled audit systems. These help smallholders and companies to meet national and international sustainability standards more efficiently and cost-effectively.

Technology is also enabling palm oil to contribute to low-carbon energy transitions. The advanced processing techniques are improving the quality and yield of palm-based biodiesel and hydro-treated vegetable oil (HVO). Currently, research is underway into second-generation biofuels that utilize palm oil waste such as empty fruit bunches and palm kernel shells to generate clean energy.

These developments align with global climate goals and also diversify palm oil’s role beyond food use. By embracing above mentioned tools, the industry is striving to enhance its global image, protect the environment, and ensure long-term economic viability—truly transforming palm oil “from farm to frying pan to fuel” in a sustainable way.

Q. Beyond food-what are some industrial and non-food applications of palm oil relevant to Pakistan’s growth sectors?

While palm oil is widely recognized as a staple in the global food industry, its non-food applications play an equally critical role in powering industrial growth in emerging economies like Pakistan. These applications span across cosmetics, personal care, pharmaceuticals, and bioenergy, offering immense value-added potential for domestic industries and export diversification.

Palm-based methyl esters are a viable alternative to fossil fuels. While biodiesel adoption in Pakistan is still in its early stages, the country has ambitious renewable energy targets. Palm oil-based biodiesel could offer a cleaner energy source for industrial fleets and agricultural machinery, especially if supported through government incentives.

With proper lobbying, Pakistan can align its industrial policy with global sustainability goals while unlocking new economic opportunities.Palm oil’s non-food applications offer Pakistan a chance to deepen industrial linkages, reduce reliance on imports, and move up the global value chain. By strategically investing in oleochemical processing and fostering public-private collaboration, Pakistan can transform palm oil from a raw import into a cornerstone of industrial innovation and sustainable growth.

Q. How does CPOPC currently engage with Pakistan, and what shared interests guide this collaboration?

CPOPC engages with Pakistan through a combination of policy dialogue, trade relations, and cooperative initiatives aimed at strengthening the palm oil supply chain and fostering mutual economic interests.

In the past several ministerial-level dialogues have taken place between CPOPC member countries and Pakistani officials. These talks typically emphasize on ensuring uninterrupted palm oil supply, addressing tariff and non-tariff barriers, promoting the use of certified sustainable palm oil, strengthening bilateral relations through agro-industrial cooperation. Pakistan has also expressed interest in securing long-term supply agreements and technical support from Indonesia and Malaysia.

In addition, there is ongoing engagement between private sector players in the palm oil industry producing countries and Pakistani companies. These collaborations include joint ventures in refining and downstream processing, technical partnerships to improve logistics and storage and market development for palm-based consumer products. Currently, there are a number ofIndonesian and Malaysian firms have established a presence in Pakistan through direct investments or local distribution agreements.

In short, CPOPC’s engagement with Pakistan is multifaceted, with active trade, government-level dialogues, formal agreements, and business-to-business collaboration.

Q. Why is palm oil essential to Pakistan’s food security and affordability compared to other edible oils?

Palm oil plays a crucial role in Pakistan’s food security due to its unique combination of year-round availability, cost competitiveness, and a reliable nutritional profile. As a net-importing country with limited domestic oilseed production, Pakistan depends heavily on palm oil to meet the nutritional needs of its growing population. Unlike many oilseeds that are harvested seasonally, palm oil is produced consistently throughout the year. This steady global supply allows Pakistan to maintain stable inventories, avoid seasonal price shocks and ensure consistent availability of edible oils in both urban and rural markets

Palm oil remains as the most affordable edible oil on the international market. Its high yield per hectare and efficient production makes it comparatively cheaper than alternatives like soybean, sunflower, and canola oil. Palm oil is seen as a more economically viable option for every Pakistani household, which keeps food inflation under control and a preferred choice for bulk food producers, bakeries, and street vendors. Embracing palm oil as a cornerstone of edible oil policy can help Pakistan safeguard its food system against global volatility and domestic price pressures.

Q. What are your top policy recommendations to deepen cooperation between palm oil producers and Pakistan?

To strengthen cooperation between palm oil producers and Pakistan, a strategic, multi-dimensional policy approach is essential. CPOPC open to have dialogue with Pakistan Government to discuss on investment protection agreements, land and subsidies for palm oil refining industries as well as export incentives for value-added palm oil products. A deeper Pakistan–CPOPC partnership will require policy dialogue, targeted incentives, and mutually beneficial capacity-building initiatives. By implementing these recommendations, both partiescan secure a resilient, value-added, and sustainable palm oil partnership.

Q. Could palm oil contribute to Pakistan’s clean energy goals—especially in the biofuel space?

Emerging technologies have now enabled the conversion of palm oil and its residues into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a game changer for countries with growing air travel needs. Palm oil is fast becoming a leading feedstock for biodiesel due to its high oil yield and chemical composition that allows efficient conversion into Palm Methyl Ester (PME). Biodiesel blends (e.g., B10, B20) are already in use across Southeast Asia, proving their viability in both commercial and public transport sectors. Beside using palm oil waste, palm oil used cooking also becoming another important source for biodiesel. Hence, Pakistan could also craft policies to utilize its used cooking oil in achieving its clean energy goals.

Palm oil has the potential to play a strategic role in supporting Pakistan’s transition toward cleaner energy, particularly through its application in biofuels. As the country moves to meet its 2030 green energy targets under international climate commitments, palm-based fuels could offer a practical, scalable, and regionally-aligned solution. In addition, Pakistan can also position itself as a regional biofuel hub by forming strategic alliances with Indonesia and Malaysia, the world’s top palm oil producers. Pakistan also could engage with international agencies like ICAO and UNDP for funding and technical support.

Palm oil’s role in clean energy particularly as a feedstock for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel offers Pakistan an opportunity to align economic pragmatism with environmental responsibility. By integrating palm-based biofuels into its national energy and transport strategies, Pakistan can take meaningful strides toward its 2030 climate goals, while also stimulating innovation, investment, and energy security.",https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Final-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-30 03:00:08.307672

Malaysia Oil & Gas Sector 2025: Industry Consolidation, Energy Transition, and Top Stock Picks in the Age of Electricity

Overview: Navigating the “Age of Electricity” and Polycrisis in Malaysia’s Oil & Gas Sector

2025 is shaping up as a transformative year for Malaysia’s oil and gas (O&G) sector. Industry consolidation, new geopolitical risks, energy transition pressures, and Petronas’ ongoing right-sizing are reshaping the investment landscape. As global focus intensifies on electricity-driven investments—artificial intelligence, data centers, and grid/battery upgrades—the local O&G ecosystem is experiencing fundamental changes. The sector outlook is downgraded to MARKET WEIGHT, balancing near-term oil price optimism against structural and execution risks.

Brent Oil Price Outlook: War Premiums and Profit-Taking in Focus

Brent oil price forecasts for 2H25/1H26 have been raised to US\$80/bbl and US\$70/bbl, respectively, incorporating a US\$15-20/bbl war premium due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.

Consensus forecasts remain lower, with Bloomberg at US\$67-65/bbl and EIA at US\$62-60/bbl for 2H25/1H26. Only one forecaster expects 2H25 Brent as high as US\$80/bbl.

Base case scenario (70% probability): US\$70-80/bbl on gradual diplomatic de-escalation.

Escalation (20%): US\$90/bbl if Iran targets regional or US assets in the Middle East.

Worst case (10%): >US\$100/bbl if the Straits of Hormuz are severely blocked.

Markets are betting on no major trade route disruptions and assume the Israel-Iran-Gaza conflict will not persist beyond 2025, allowing for profit-taking as prices decline towards year-end.

Industry Consolidation and the Petronas-Petros Polycrisis

The sector faces continued consolidation amid a “polycrisis,” driven by both global and local factors:

Petronas’ right-sizing and reduced transparency complicate project and procurement visibility.

The Petronas-Petros local geopolitical dispute is now considered a permanent sector risk, with ongoing court cases and unresolved legal issues impacting sector stability.

Energy transition imperatives, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), are demanding significant investments and may dilute sector returns and margins.

Quarterly reviews of non-O&G ventures will be a recurring feature as the transition accelerates.

Investment Strategy and Stock Recommendations: Riding the Near-Term Oil Price Upside

Given the sector downgrade to MARKET WEIGHT, investors are encouraged to capitalize on near-term oil price strength and consider profit-taking by 4Q25. Select stocks with strong oil price correlations are preferred for short-term momentum, with a wait-and-see approach recommended for 2026 due to lingering sector uncertainties.

Local Geopolitical Risk: Petronas vs. Petros and Sector Uncertainties

Sector was upgraded to OVERWEIGHT in 1H25 on expectations of recovery post-Petronas-Petros dispute, but ongoing legal battles and an interim injunction for Shell MDS highlight persistent risks.

Sarawak is pushing for greater autonomy, citing constitutional guarantees and seeking exclusion from federal energy laws. Next key court hearing is slated for 25-26 August 2025.

Energy Transition: Clean Energy Investment and Malaysia’s Strategic Advantages

Clean energy will account for over 70% of the US\$3.3 trillion global energy investment in 2025.

Malaysia’s abundant depleted offshore reservoirs make it a natural hub for carbon capture and storage (CCS).

As a major palm oil producer, Malaysia is also positioned as a key global player in Used Cooking Oil (UCO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) supply chains.

Delays in implementing key policies (National CCUS Bill, National Gas Roadmap) could slow the country’s energy transition progress.

CCS: The Next Growth Engine and Policy Readiness Concerns

Petronas has invested up to RM5 billion in CCS initiatives, targeting a minimum capacity of 80 million tonnes/year, though Japan’s demand alone is 120-200 million tonnes/year.

23Tcf of Malaysia’s gas resources require CCS, but full-scale CCS projects may cost up to RM4.7 billion and remain a long-term earnings driver—immediate contributions are limited to the Kasawari gas project.

Petronas’ EBITDA is forecast to decline from RM114b to RM100m-110m, with free cash flow possibly turning negative as high dividends and capex persist.

Policy readiness and the risk of increased competition (especially from Sarawak’s early moves to establish independent carbon storage legislation) are key concerns.

Legal and Regulatory Developments: The Petronas-Petros Case

Sarawak challenges Petronas over bank guarantees, operating licenses, and contractual obligations, emphasizing state rights under the 1963 Borneo States Legislative Powers.

Other key issues include Sarawak’s exclusion from federal energy laws and the 2021 exemption of gas distribution from the Petroleum Development Act.

Winners for three offshore carbon storage sites in Sarawak are expected to be announced by end-2Q25.

Sector Execution Risks: 2025 Earnings and Manpower Challenges

1Q25 saw sector core profits plunge 53% year-on-year, with earnings misses at Bumi Armada, Dayang, Dialog, and Yinson. Project timelines, such as PTTEP’s Lang Lebah, have been delayed by the Petronas-Petros dispute.

2Q25 is expected to be execution-risk-heavy, especially for maintenance players, due to skilled manpower shortages. Petronas estimates 2Q26 and 1Q27 as peak manpower periods (25,000 workers); 2Q25 will require around 15,000 workers, focused in Sabah, Sarawak, Labuan, and Kertih.

Conclusion: Navigating Risks and Opportunities in Malaysia’s Oil & Gas Sector

Malaysia’s O&G sector in 2025 is marked by short-term oil price upside, persistent geopolitical and execution risks, and a strategic pivot toward clean energy and CCS. Investors should focus on near-term oil price plays and select structural winners while monitoring sector consolidation and the evolving policy landscape. Top picks include Dialog Group and Yinson Holdings, with MISC, MMHE, and Petronas Dagangan offering thematic exposure to CCS and clean energy. The sector’s long-term prospects hinge on resolving regulatory uncertainties and successfully managing the energy transition.",https://www.minichart.com.sg/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Dialog-Group.png,N,,2025-06-30 03:00:20.564638

Dialog Group Berhad, a cornerstone of Malaysia's energy infrastructure, faces a pivotal moment. Despite its dominant position in tank terminal operations and upstream oil projects, the company has grappled with declining returns on capital employed (ROCE) and earnings per share (EPS). Recent expansions in renewable fuel storage and marginal oil fields aim to reverse these trends, but challenges like oil price volatility and project execution risks loom large. Is now the time to bet on Dialog's turnaround?

The Strategic Play: Tank Terminals and Marginal Oil Fields

Dialog's growth strategy hinges on two pillars: tank terminal expansions and upstream oil field developments. Both are critical to lifting ROCE from its current depressed levels (2.3% in 2024, down from 9.1% in 2020) and stabilizing EPS after a 64% drop in the first nine months of FY2025.

Tank Terminal Capacity: A Renewable-Fueled Boost

Dialog is aggressively expanding its terminal network to capitalize on Asia's surging demand for renewable fuels. Key projects include:

Tanjung Langsat Terminal:

A 150,000-cubic-meter expansion, split into phases. The first 100,000 cbm is leased to EcoCeres for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) storage, secured via a take-or-pay agreement.

Phase 2 (50,000 cbm) targets third-party renewable fuel customers, with completion slated for 2027.

Pengerang Deepwater Terminals (PDT):

Phase 2: Adds 250,000 cbm for Petronas' biorefinery, operational by late 2026.

Phase 3: Seeks to add 1 million cbm for an unnamed client and ChemOne's Pengerang Energy Complex (PEC), contingent on securing financing by Q3 2025.

Total Tank Capacity Expansion:

Dialog's terminal capacity is set to grow by 55% on an equity basis by FY2026, reaching 7.55 million cbm from 5.3 million cbm. This expansion aligns with Malaysia's push for low-carbon infrastructure and could lift ROCE by stabilizing recurring revenue streams.

Upstream Oil Fields: Doubling Production by 2029

Dialog aims to double oil and gas output through marginal field developments, which offer high returns even at moderate oil prices. Key projects include:

- Baram Junior Cluster: Production began in early 2027, contributing 200,000 barrels/year.

- Raja Cluster: Targeted for early 2029 production, pending final investment decisions (FID).

- Mutiara Cluster: Expected to come online in mid-2029.

These projects, leveraging Dialog's operational expertise and strategic partnerships (e.g., Petros for Baram Junior), promise a 3–5 year doubling of output, driving long-term revenue growth.

Financials: Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain?

Current Challenges:

- ROCE Decline: Caused by rising capital employed without proportional sales growth. The 2024 ROCE of 2.3% is far below the industry average of 13%.

- EPS Drop: FY2025 EPS fell to RM0.08 from RM0.11 in FY2024, driven by impairments (e.g., a RM90.7 million write-off for a malic acid plant) and project delays.

Catalysts for Recovery:

- Terminal Revenue: The PDT expansions could add 60% to FY2026 core net profit, as terminals generate stable, long-term cash flows.

- Upstream Production: Oil price stability ($70–80/barrel) would make marginal fields viable, boosting ROCE.

Balance Sheet Strength:

- Liquidity: RM1.39 billion in unrestricted cash and strong operating cash flows (RM409 million in 1H2025) support ongoing investments.

- Debt Management: Net gearing is expected to rise to 37.4% by FY2027, but the company emphasizes disciplined capital allocation.

Risks to Consider

Oil Price Volatility: A $5/barrel drop could cut FY2026 EPS by 2–3%. OPEC+ production cuts or global demand shocks could delay upstream FIDs.

Project Delays: PDT Phase 3's financing (due by Q3 2025) is critical. Delays here could extend the earnings dip into FY2026.

ESG Execution: Dialog's ESG initiatives (e.g., carbon capture, recycled PET) face market headwinds, such as weak demand for recycled materials.

Investment Thesis: Buy the Dip or Wait for Catalysts?

Bull Case:

- Valuation: A RM2.58 per share sum-of-parts (SOP) valuation (vs. a current price of RM1.52) implies a 70% upside. Analysts highlight undervalued terminal assets and upside from upstream projects.

- Execution Success: Timely completion of PDT Phase 3 and Raja Cluster FID would solidify Dialog's growth story.

Bear Case:

- Near-Term Earnings Slump: FY2025 EPS is unlikely to rebound meaningfully until FY2026, testing investor patience.

- Overleveraged Risks: Rising debt could strain margins if projects underperform.

Recommendation:

Dialog presents a high-conviction long-term play for investors willing to ride out short-term headwinds. The stock's current discount to SOP suggests value, but wait for execution milestones (e.g., PDT Phase 3 financing closed, Raja Cluster FID announced) before entering. For a conservative stance, consider a gradual buildup of positions as catalysts materialize.",,N,,2025-06-29 23:00:13.554142

“The UK Emissions Trading Scheme plays a key role in the UK’s progress towards its net zero goals.
“After the successful transition from the EU cap and trade scheme, the Scheme has encouraged green investment and decarbonisation in some key sectors.","Successful and timely transition to the UK Emissions Trading Scheme from its EU equivalent has allowed operations to run smoothly, ensuring the UK’s carbon-intensive industries remained subject to carbon-pricing.

Overall carbon emissions reduced by 11 million tonnes between 2021 and 2023 in the sectors the Scheme covers.

But the relatively low price of carbon in the Scheme may have limited incentives for industry adoption of low-carbon technologies.

According to a new NAO report,1 while emissions have fallen in the three sectors covered by the UK’s flagship ‘cap and trade’ scheme,2 a fall in the price that Scheme participants must pay for emitting carbon could undermine the extent to which it limits future greenhouse gas emissions.

The UK Emissions Trading Scheme is a crucial part of the UK government’s net zero strategy. By placing a price on carbon emissions, the government expects that, over time, businesses will invest in low-carbon technologies such as renewable energy, or switch the type of fuel used, as the carbon price becomes higher than the cost of that investment.

The Scheme raised £17.8 billion in revenue for the government from 2021 to 2025 through the auction of allowances, each equal to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide.3

More than 1,000 organisations in the power, industrial and aviation sectors are participating in the Scheme,4 and the government plans to expand it to include other industries in coming years.5

The post-Brexit transition to the UK Scheme from its EU equivalent was delivered on time despite a tight timetable, leading to no losses in revenue. Loopholes that allowed firms participating in the Scheme to make windfall profits (worth up to £49 million in 2022) have also now been closed.

Between 2021 and 2023, the carbon emissions covered by the Scheme decreased by 11 million tonnes overall. However, it is difficult to conclude whether this reduction can be attributed to the Scheme.6

The Scheme’s decarbonisation incentives also risk being undermined by the relatively low price set for UK carbon emissions. Despite initially exceeding the price in its EU equivalent, the price of carbon within the UK Scheme has decreased since 2023 and remains lower than EU carbon prices.7 The Scheme’s future effectiveness could be undermined by uncertainties around the availability and take-up of low-carbon alternatives.8 Some technologies – for example, carbon capture and sustainable aviation fuel – are in their infancy and may take many years before they start making a difference to emissions.

Stakeholders have expressed concerns that the Scheme could impact UK industry competitiveness, with international competition from firms facing lower carbon prices potentially resulting in economic activity moving abroad and continuing with unabated emissions (known as ‘carbon leakage’).9

While the UK ETS Authority (the joint body responsible for overseeing the Scheme) is a good example of innovative, collaborative policymaking,10 the relative size of administrative resources can make it challenging for the Authority. The NAO recommends that the Authority includes a broader commentary on the effectiveness of the Scheme as part of its existing annual reports on the functioning of the UK carbon market, and gathers data on the type of investments made in low-carbon technology by Scheme participants.

The Authority should also consider working with other government bodies involved in the UK’s industrial and energy sectors and improve communications with the Climate Change Committee to help anticipate the Committee’s advice on the Scheme.

“The UK Emissions Trading Scheme plays a key role in the UK’s progress towards its net zero goals.

“After the successful transition from the EU cap and trade scheme, the Scheme has encouraged green investment and decarbonisation in some key sectors.

“But to fulfil government’s ambitions to expand the UK Scheme, the Authority must ensure that the Scheme is combining with other policies to create sufficient incentives for industry to invest in low carbon technologies and for organisations to participate in the Scheme.”

UK Emissions Trading Scheme

Notes for editors

The report will be available on the NAO website via the following link from 00:01 Monday 30 June: https://www.nao.org.uk/reports/uk-emissions-trading-scheme/

The Scheme works by setting a cap, divided into individual allowances, on the level of emissions which UK participants in the Scheme, are allowed to emit over a given period. An allowance is equal to 1 tonne of carbon dioxide. Participants in the Scheme can trade allowances in order to account for their emissions, which in turn sets a price on the carbon they emit.

HM Treasury collects the revenue raised from auctioning allowances. HM Treasury does not regard the Scheme as a revenue-raising scheme. It expects that, over time, the Scheme should raise less revenue as participants invest in decarbonisation and then pay less into the Scheme.

In June 2024, there were 490 participants in the industry sector, 387 in aviation and 191 in power generation, with a total of 1,068 participants in the Scheme. DESNZ estimates that the three sectors in the Scheme covered around 25% of total UK greenhouse gas emissions as at 2023.

The government has announced plans to expand the Scheme to the domestic maritime sector in 2026, and in the waste incineration and energy from waste sectors in 2028. This is with the aim of capturing more emissions under the Scheme and increasing decarbonisation across the economy.

Across the three sectors in the Scheme, CO2 emissions have decreased from 108 million tonnes in 2021 to 97 million tonnes in 2023, although the aviation sector saw an increase in emissions. This overall reduction is largely a result of the power sector moving away from carbon intensive fuels such as coal to lower carbon alternatives such as gas and biofuels and decarbonising because of other interventions, such as government subsidies for renewables. Emissions may also be reducing because of a downturn in economic activity in those sectors.

At the end of May 2025, the UK carbon price was £50 per tonne of carbon dioxide and in the EU equivalent it was £60. See Figure 11 in the report for further comparative carbon pricing between the UK and EU Schemes.

Uncertainty about future carbon reduction technologies was the most commonly cited barrier to reducing emissions in the 2023 evaluation of the Scheme, with respondents highlighting that the necessary technical solutions for large scale emissions reductions are at an early stage of development. Some industrial stakeholders were concerned that, in the absence of available technologies and wider government-led infrastructure (for example, on hydrogen and carbon capture networks), they would have few options in the future to decarbonise.

The government is introducing a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) to tackle carbon leakage. Through the CBAM, the government would aim to ensure equal treatment of domestic and imported carbon-intensive goods: where imported goods come from countries with lower carbon costs, a charge would be applied to equalise their carbon costs with those of domestic producers. In May 2025, the government announced a commitment to link the UK ETS with the EU Emissions Trading System, with the suggestion this would improve conditions for low carbon investment and save UK industry from paying the EU CBAM.

The UK ETS Authority is made up of the UK Government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government, and the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland. The Department for Energy Security & Net Zero (DESNZ) provides the main ministerial and administrative lead on behalf of the UK Government, as well as the overwhelming majority of resources for the Authority.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero.","30th June 2025 By Contributor

Is sustainable aviation fuel still the ‘game changer’ it was initially heralded as? UK researcher Salman Ahmad takes a look.

As you wait in the departure lounge for your flight this (northern hemisphere) summer, you may notice your aeroplane being pumped full of fuel ahead of takeoff. And then you may start to wonder why flying is still so dependent on fossil fuels, and whether you should have booked a holiday destination that’s accessible by a more environmentally friendly form of transport.

So what happened to plans for so-called sustainable aviation fuel? Wasn’t it supposed to be the “game changer” that would make flying a much greener travel option than it used to be?

Clearly, the move to adopt the technology is facing difficulties. One problem seems to be that there simply isn’t enough sustainable fuel to go around.

But the business side of the process is also holding back sustainable fuel uptake.

Research my colleagues and I conducted in 2021 revealed a deeply fragmented landscape at pretty much every step of sustainable fuel development. There are obstacles everywhere, blocking the paths of the producers developing these fuels, the airlines who might use them and the governmental and campaign groups pushing for change.

Everyone seems to agree that sustainable fuel matters. They just don’t all agree about how to really get it off the ground.

Our findings demonstrate that producers, for instance, were understandably focused on more research and development to improve efficient production. They were also worried that scaling up facilities could disrupt production that is already in place.

Airlines meanwhile, are grappling with the economics of moving to sustainable fuel, which is around three to ten times more expensive than conventional fuel. Right now, a litre of conventional aviation fuel costs around £0.96 per litre in the UK – for sustainable aviation fuel it’s around £1.97. (Depending on the length of the journey and the size of the engine, a plane could need around 13,000 litres per hour of flying.)

They spoke about inconsistent supply (especially at major airports), and the need for clearer regulations and incentives across the industry.

“Cost is clearly the most important driver,” one airline executive told us, explaining that dealing with those costs would ultimately depend on passenger demand for greener travel – and how willing those passengers are to pay a premium for sustainable fuel.

Distribution companies that take the sustainable fuel where it needs to go, have found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of an emerging supply chain. They spoke of the logistical challenges of transporting and storing sustainable fuel, and a lack of clear communication between producers and airlines.

They saw themselves as a crucial part of the sustainable aviation fuel puzzle, but were concerned about investing in logistics and infrastructure without guaranteed demand.

Elsewhere, politicians and climate campaigners tend to view the adoption of sustainable fuel from a broader perspective, stressing the urgency of action on climate change. Their thinking is dominated by environmental strategy and sustainable aviation fuel regulation.

But here, trust becomes an issue. Some of those involved with sustainable fuel development said they doubted government promises to support the sector over the long term. Others are cynical about whether airlines will really prioritise climate action over their very tight profit margins.

Up in the air

So sustainable fuel inspires plenty of different viewpoints and concerns. But one common thread was an overwhelming concern about cost and scale of production.

Aside from being far more expensive than fossil-based jet fuel, building enough production facilities to make more will require billions of pounds of investment.

The big question is who will foot the bill.

Some of this will need to be tax funded. For if the UK wants to become a leader in the use of sustainable aviation fuel, as the government says it does, it needs more than ambitious targets. It needs to start making things happen.

And our research suggests that the industry as a whole would benefit from some certainty to encourage investment right across the supply chain. Without a clear and stable regulatory framework, everyone will remain hesitant about committing significant resources to sustainable fuel.

Collaboration between the key players could also be improved, with a better dialogue between those in the industry and regulators, potentially leading to a shared vision for the future of sustainable aviation fuel.

That future is by no means doomed. Major commercial airlines like Air France-KLM, IAG (British Airways) and United Airlines in the US are working with sustainable fuel producers around the world.

But while the desire to decarbonise aviation seems clear, the path forward is not straightforward. It is a complex picture of politics, economics, trust and differing priorities.

By navigating this turbulence wisely, the sustainable fuel sector can be part of a broader flight path to net zero. But if managed poorly, targets to dramatically increase its use will remain elusive.

What do you do with a tangle of pipes, furnaces and crackers like the Grangemouth refinery?","Every morning in Grangemouth, chemists at Celtic Renewables’s small factory feed a vial of microbes with a precisely tailored cocktail of food – liquid residues from the scotch whisky industry.

In vessels surrounded by a web of metal pipes and gleaming stainless steel valves, the microbes multiply into something other than drink: a starter solution for batches of acetone, butanol and ethanol – chemicals essential for countless everyday products.

Celtic Renewables wants more: a plant 10 times its current size. That could form part of plans to sustain Scotland’s chemicals industry after Grangemouth sustained a crushing blow: the closure of the 100-year-old refinery in April, with the loss of 400 jobs. The huge complex will be reduced to a fuel import terminal, staffed by only 75 people. As many as 4,600 jobs in the refinery’s supply chain could also be affected.

That closure has made Grangemouth one of the earliest tests of a “just transition”: the idea that the economy can move relatively painlessly from fossil fuels to net zero, helped along by judicious government interventions to spur new jobs in place of the old.

The Labour government fears that failure could mean voters turn their backs on it – and on the pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 – throughout what remains of Scotland’s largely fossil fuel-dependent industry. Climate action by government remains popular in Britain, but parties on the right, and particularly Nigel Farage’s Reform UK, believe opposition to net zero can win them power.

As the government this week unveiled a new industrial strategy, this article – the second in a series on the battle for Britain’s deindustrialised areas – looks at the future for one of Scotland’s industrial icons.

After the second world war, deindustrialisation wiped out much of the coal mining, shipbuilding and steelmaking that dominated employment in Scotland’s central belt from Glasgow to Edinburgh. While those industries all but disappeared, Grangemouth held out, refining crude oil to feed Scotland’s cars and planes taking off from Edinburgh and Glasgow.

Grangemouth’s refinery traces its history back to 1924, making it the second oldest in Europe, but since 2005 it has been part of Jim Ratcliffe’s Ineos chemicals empire. Ratcliffe’s investments bolted together assets that others did not want, and generated huge profits. Ineos agreed a deal in 2011 for Chinese state-owned PetroChina to partner in a joint venture, Petroineos.

Expensive energy

Petroineos executives argued in Scottish parliamentary hearings that Grangemouth was not able to compete with newer, more efficient plants in the Middle East and Africa. UK chemicals output has slumped 42% since peaking in March 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics.

Ratcliffe has faced significant criticism for cutting jobs in chemicals and at Manchester United Football Club – which he took control of last year. But he has claimed that it was UK energy policy, not his decisions, that made Grangemouth unviable. Chemicals companies report UK energy costs are five times higher than in the US and well over double those in the EU, according to the Chemical Industries Association, a lobby group. Ratcliffe is also a staunch opponent of carbon taxes on businesses.

“We are witnessing the extinction of one of our major industries as chemical manufacture has the life squeezed out of it,” Ratcliffe told the Financial Times in January. Deindustrialising Britain achieves “nothing for the environment,” he said. “It merely shifts production and emissions elsewhere.”

Cutting energy costs was the flagship measure of the government’s industrial strategy, with exemptions for chemicals businesses for the costs of renewable energy programmes and discounts for levies to fund the grid. The measures did not include short-term help on driving down wholesale prices, the key complaint of big energy users.

What do you do with a tangle of pipes, furnaces and crackers like the Grangemouth refinery? A Scottish government-funded study, known as Project Willow, described nine options for chemical industries that could happen on the site, including plastics recycling, making chemicals from wood, or – perhaps most ardently desired – making so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Westminster has set aside £200m to support private sector investments at Grangemouth, plus £25m from the Scottish government, to support projects. Senior government sources said more money could be available if the right projects come up.

Yet each of those options comes with a price tag, ranging from the relatively manageable (£15m for turning organic waste into methane, with up to 70 jobs) to the truly enormous (up to £2.1bn for a SAF plant, and 270 jobs).

The transition does not feel pain-free in Grangemouth town centre, with the refinery chimneys visible from the end of the road. A pleasant park, rows of sandstone homes and later semi-detached houses evidence the prosperity of the early 1900s and the boom times of the 60s and 70s, but the town also has several areas counted among the 10% most deprived in Scotland. Manufacturing in 2023 accounted for 11.1% of jobs in the broader Falkirk council area. That compared with 6.9% across Scotland that year – down from 35% in 1951.

‘You don’t see anybody’

Mohammad Saleem, the shopkeeper at Sweet Talk, is already feeling the effects of the refinery closure, and has cut back opening hours, with fewer workers passing through to grab chocolate or a paper on the way to work.

“Quiet,” is his description of business in recent months. “It used to be good before corona. After corona, that’s it. This time, lunchtime, you would see crowds. Now you don’t see anybody.”

“It’s a disgrace,” said another shopkeeper in the centre. “But what can you do?”

Marilyn McIlvaney, the secretary of the Kersiebank Community Project, a volunteer-run charity shop that runs a food bank, said they had seen more people under pressure in the weeks since the closure of the refinery. Redundant workers got a relatively generous 18 months of pay, but they are still tightening belts.

“They’re cutting back,” she said. “It’s having a knock-on to the other businesses. It’s getting worse. Food banks are queueing out the doors – some of them [users] are working.”

The question now for workers is whether Project Willow jobs come through before they have to look elsewhere. Those hopes are looking increasingly forlorn, according to Cliff Bowen, who has worked at Grangemouth for 33 years, and is now a convener for Unite, a union. He argues that the political implications will be huge.

“All we asked for is another couple of years until these technologies come online,” Bowen said. “It breaks my heart. Labour are done for a generation in this area.”

Bowen, a lifelong Labour supporter whose anger is palpable, believes that Reform UK will benefit from the loss of jobs at Grangemouth, and throughout Scotland’s oil and gas economy, because it appears to offer a chance for those businesses to continue to operate.

“They’re talking sense when it comes to energy supply,” said Bowen. “People are going to vote for that, regardless of the colour on their rosette.”

Reform’s support is notably strong in areas around other refineries: near Stanlow refinery it won the Runcorn Westminster byelection, while Reform is leading Westminster polls in each of the constituencies that host the UK’s other refineries at Fawley in Hampshire, Pembroke in west Wales, and the plants at Humber and Lindsey in Lincolnshire. Richard Tice, the Reform deputy leader, said: “Reform will scrap net zero which will enable lower energy costs and investment in the chemicals and refining industries, thus creating jobs and leading to the reopening of Grangemouth.”

That prescription is not seen as realistic by industry experts, even if big subsidies were offered. It would also lead to continued UK carbon emissions: the refinery was responsible for more than a quarter of all Scotland’s carbon. Yet the pledge may resonate with people struggling to find work.

Labour managed a surprise victory in a Scottish parliamentary byelection earlier this month in Hamilton – leaving the Scottish National party (SNP) in second and Reform a close third. Yet Brian Leishman, who won Grangemouth back for Labour only last year in the Westminster general election, said the closure was a “failure from the political class” – including Labour, after it failed to live up to a pre-election pledge by the Scottish Labour leader, Anas Sarwar, to “step in to save the jobs at the refinery”. The SNP is keen to win back an area it held for nearly a decade at Westminster, but also has limited room for manoeuvre because of its nearly two decades leading the Scottish government.

Leishman argued that the government should take ownership stakes in return for Project Willow funding, to prevent the area being vulnerable to the whims of distant bosses in the future. He said that Labour needed to invest in Scotland if it wanted to hold on to its previous gains.

“If you give people good jobs, good life chances, that’s now you get a second term,” he said. “If you do the basics of government well and you improve people’s living standards, you’ll beat Reform.”

Looking for answers

Scottish Enterprise, the lead agency on Project Willow, is hopeful that some of the interest will translate into action soon.

Jane Martin, the managing director for innovation and investment, said she was “aware of the need for short-term wins to turn the narrative around”. The agency is working to triage projects, and work out which will be most likely to succeed. They are a mix of “inside the fence” at the refinery, and others outside.

“Project Willow is a really important lever but we are not only focused on those technologies,” Martin said. “We’re not shutting anything down at this stage.”

It does appear increasingly unlikely that a single employer will emerge to replace the refinery’s jobs. One much vaunted possibility was an investment to produce SAF to meet the UK’s mandate of 10% of all aviation fuel by 2030.

However, Michael Liebreich, a clean energy expert, said SAF was still seen as too risky for investors. SAF production (either from biological sources or using green hydrogen) is still several times more expensive than refining oil into kerosene, and nobody has dared to make the huge investment needed without a cast-iron guarantee that the product will be bought.

There does not appear to be much hope for a neat solution. The question now appears to be whether smaller projects can let the town retain a chemical industry. That could allow it to salvage something from the devastation of the refinery’s closure – and prove whether a messy transition can also be just.

“We’ve got a redundant petrochemical facility that has land, utilities and access to great people, if we can be courageous,” said Mark Simmers, the chief executive of Celtic Renewables. “And it does require bravery and courage, particularly for governments to say, ‘We’re going to create these low-carbon manufacturing jobs, and repurpose all that land and utilities and people to do something which is all about the future’.

“That then becomes an example for the world. So I really believe if people are brave and courageous and say ‘let’s do this’, it will provide a blueprint for lots refineries in the UK and the world.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3577411defa555c724febd10dc673fdc765211a0/0_0_5000_4000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e26303ab9e04addeb0f2984ba83bf06a,N,,2025-06-29 13:04:08.089078

""Now the investigation is underway to understand the origins of the breakdown and implement actions to prevent a recurrence of the problem,"" the president of the National Civil Aviation Authority (Enac) Pierluigi Di Palma told the Ansa news agency.

The tale of a tourist stranded in Pisa

Andrea, an Italian citizen who left Saturday from Maspalomas in Gran Canaria headed to Bergamo's Orio al Serio airport, told Euronews about his misadventure: ""Less than two hours before arrival, the captain informed us that we would be landing at Pisa airport with the promise of replacement buses to reach Bergamo. When we arrived at the airport, loudspeakers announced that buses were not available and that we would have to find a solution ourselves"", he explained.

""The few taxis available were asking 1,700 euro to share with six other people, train tickets from Pisa station to Milan were either sold out or also at exorbitant prices. The only solution for me was to find a hotel half an hour from the station and leave on Sunday morning for Milan. On arrival I had to return to Bergamo airport where I had left the car for my return home"", Andrea recounted.

The website Flightradar24 published an image of the airspace involved, where for two hours no aircraft passages were recorded.

Associations demand explanations from the Ministry of Transport

User associations have taken action to provide support and to request details on the breakdown from the Ministry of Transport and Enav. Consumer rights NGO Codacons has announced a complaint to the Milan Public Prosecutor's Office for possible interruption of a public service. ""What has happened in the past few hours represents a very serious episode that has brought the air transport sector to its knees, involving thousands and thousands of passengers,"" the Codacons note reads.

""An even more serious disruption because it occurs during the summer period, when Italians are leaving for holidays and leisure trips. Many of those who have had their flights cancelled or have been subjected to prolonged delays were leaving to reach their holiday resorts, thus suffering further economic and moral damage.""

""It is unacceptable that in 2025 a single technical failure could bring the entire radar system of a large national geographical area to its knees. New technologies must be a guarantee of continuity and reliability, but yesterday's event shows that adequate risk management protocols are lacking"", said civic and consumer rights NGO Assoutenti president Gabriele Melluso.

""European legislation on protection systems must be radically changed: an alternative system cannot simply 'integrate', but must guarantee one hundred per cent of data transmission in all conditions,"" Melluso further commented, adding: ""With the extreme heatwaves that are affecting our country, it is our duty to ascertain whether data centres have maintained the thermal conditions necessary to guarantee the operation of sensitive systems, and what prevention tools have been adopted. We demand that Enav and the Ministry of Transport open an independent investigation into the incident. We will collect reports from travellers affected by the inconvenience, in order to assess possible compensation actions,"" the president of Assoutenti concluded.

How to apply for refunds for cancelled flight tickets

RimborsoAlVolo, a company specialising in air transport refunds, underlined that passengers affected by the air disruption linked to the breakdown at Enav's North-West Radar Centre are entitled to refunds and assistance, as provided for by EC Regulation 261/2004.

""If the flight is cancelled or suffers a long delay, the airline is obliged to guarantee assistance to passengers in the form of meals and beverages in relation to the duration of the wait, hotel accommodation if one or more overnight stays are necessary, transfer from the airport to the place of accommodation and vice versa, two telephone calls or messages via telex, fax or e-mail"" the company explained, adding that ""if the assistance is not guaranteed and the passenger has had to pay for meals, drinks, taxis or hotels, the airline must reimburse the expenses incurred, provided that they are reasonable and appropriate: to this end, it is a good idea to keep all receipts certifying such expenses, preferably named ones, especially for taxis"".

With regard to the case of Saturday flight cancellations, RimborsoAlVolo points to the fact that airlines must offer the choice between: reimbursement of the ticket and, in the case of a connection, a return flight to the departure airport as soon as possible, boarding on another flight to the final destination as soon as possible, or boarding on another flight at a later date.

However, a flat fee ""compensation of up to 600 EUR per passenger is not foreseen: since it is a case of force majeure, the delay or cancellation of the flight is not attributable to the airline's responsibility,"" Kathrin Cois, general manager of RimborsoAlVolo, clarified.",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22189900/800x450_cmsv2_799689f9-0ecf-5620-83fd-a8209b7e68dc-9348592.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 13:04:17.608790

Charting the Path Ahead: What Needs to Happen If Indonesia is to move from compliance to climate leadership in aviation, a few critical steps must be prioritized.","- Advertisement -

When the international community, through the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) in 2016, it was more than just another environmental regulation—it was a symbolic departure from business-as-usual for one of the fastest-growing contributors to global emissions. For a country like Indonesia, where aviation serves as a critical lifeline connecting thousands of islands and enabling global economic integration, CORSIA represents both a regulatory obligation and an opportunity to redefine sustainability in aviation.

From Consensus to Commitment: Understanding CORSIA’s Origins

CORSIA was born out of a paradox. Aviation, once seen primarily as a vector of development, has become a significant source of carbon emissions. Yet, unlike land-based sectors, international aviation remained largely outside the purview of climate agreements like the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris Accord. CORSIA filled this gap.

Indonesia, a member of ICAO, did not just sign up as a formality. Our participation stemmed from a genuine awareness that climate vulnerability is not theoretical. Rising sea levels, disrupted weather patterns, and environmental degradation already impact our archipelagic nation. The aviation sector could not be exempt from the collective responsibility to act.

Readiness Begins with People: The Manpower Behind the Mandate

One of the least discussed, yet most crucial, elements of CORSIA implementation is people. Not just policymakers drafting regulations, but the frontline actors—airline operations officers, environmental auditors, data analysts, legal experts—tasked with turning policy into practice.

Indonesia’s aviation sector is no stranger to adaptation. Over the years, it has responded to shifting security protocols, passenger safety reforms, and digital transformation. However, climate policy presents a different challenge. It requires a convergence of environmental literacy, regulatory clarity, and financial acumen—skills not traditionally bundled into aviation training.

To meet this challenge, several major carriers began internalizing sustainability as a core competency. Sustainability units were established, staff trained to monitor emissions, and dialogue opened with government regulators. But the learning curve remains steep, especially for mid-tier and smaller carriers less resourced than their flagship counterparts.

On the government side, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had to rapidly build its institutional capacity. It was not simply a matter of issuing compliance guidelines; it involved setting up national data reporting protocols, coordinating with ICAO’s global registry, and accrediting third-party verifiers capable of assessing carbon offsets under evolving international criteria.

Interdependence in Action: The Stakeholder Web

- Advertisement -

CORSIA’s implementation does not unfold in a vacuum. It reveals a deeply interconnected ecosystem. Airlines depend on verifiers to validate their emissions reports. Verifiers need clear standards from regulators. Regulators, in turn, must interface with ICAO and global offset credit markets. And all actors rely on accessible knowledge and sustained institutional memory to ensure continuity.

Coordination mechanisms began emerging, albeit organically. Roundtable discussions led by industry associations became forums for practical exchange. Some universities began offering modules on sustainable aviation policy. International partners contributed technical assistance. Yet, these efforts still lack integration. What’s missing is a formalized national platform that brings together regulators, operators, financiers, academia, and civil society in an ongoing dialogue—not only to interpret rules, but to shape a shared vision of low-carbon aviation.

Beyond Metrics: Output, Outcomes, and the Meaning of Progress

Progress in CORSIA is often measured in tonnes of carbon offset and credits purchased. But these figures, while important, tell only part of the story. The more consequential outcome is the slow but steady mainstreaming of climate consciousness in a sector historically dominated by efficiency metrics.

Within some airlines, emission monitoring is no longer just a reporting function—it’s becoming part of route planning and fuel management. In the regulator’s office, sustainability is no longer the responsibility of a single directorate—it’s increasingly cross-cutting. For many younger professionals entering aviation, CORSIA is their first encounter with environmental governance—seeding a new culture that blends operational excellence with ecological accountability.

Still, outcomes remain uneven. Implementation is heavily reliant on a few committed individuals and institutions. When these champions rotate out or face institutional fatigue, continuity suffers. There is a risk that CORSIA becomes a compliance checkbox rather than a catalyst for transformation.

The Tough Conversations: Unpacking the Challenges

Every meaningful reform is accompanied by resistance, uncertainty, and trade-offs. CORSIA is no different.

Some airlines express concern over the unpredictability of offset credit markets—prices fluctuate, and eligibility criteria can shift. For others, especially those recovering from pandemic-related losses, the added financial burden feels misaligned with their current fiscal realities.

On the verification side, the lack of domestic capacity means relying on a handful of approved firms—often at significant cost. The risk of bottlenecks, or worse, compromised quality, is real. Moreover, gaps in technical expertise and a fragmented data landscape make accurate emissions reporting a persistent challenge.

But perhaps the most systemic challenge is one of governance. Indonesia’s climate policy is spread across multiple ministries—transport, energy, environment, finance—each with its own priorities. Without a coherent national framework that links CORSIA with our broader climate goals (including Nationally Determined Contributions and net-zero targets), efforts may remain siloed, reactive, and ultimately less effective.

Charting the Path Ahead: What Needs to Happen

If Indonesia is to move from compliance to climate leadership in aviation, a few critical steps must be prioritized.

First, investing in human capital must be more than a slogan. Building climate literacy within the aviation sector—from pilots and engineers to policy advisors and accountants—requires structured training pipelines. It is here that international collaboration plays a vital role. The ICAO Assistance, Capacity-building and Training for CORSIA (ACT-CORSIA) programme has already been instrumental in helping States—including Indonesia—build internal capacities to meet CORSIA’s requirements. ACT-CORSIA facilitates knowledge transfer, workshops, and practical tools that enable regulators and operators to interpret and implement ICAO standards effectively.

This initiative embodies the best of ICAO’s No Country Left Behind vision—a commitment to ensure that developing countries are not sidelined in global regulatory transitions. Indonesia has benefitted from this collaborative approach, and moving forward, deepening our engagement with ACT-CORSIA will be critical, especially as the scheme transitions from a voluntary phase to full compliance by 2027.

Second, institutional continuity must be prioritized over ad-hocism- A tendency to address issues through temporary, unstructured, and often reactive measures without a long-term strategy or institutional continuity. Creating dedicated, permanent CORSIA units within Indonesia’s Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), supported by inter-ministerial task forces, would ensure implementation is not disrupted by changes in personnel or policy direction.

Third, innovation in compliance mechanisms—from digital offset tracking platforms to early experimentation with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) frameworks—can position Indonesia as a thought leader among developing aviation markets. These innovations can also help reduce compliance costs and increase transparency.

Fourth, a formal national CORSIA forum would help align diverse actors—airlines, regulators, verifiers, academic institutions, financial players, and community stakeholders—into a unified conversation. This forum could serve as a platform for sharing updates, co-designing solutions, and aligning with broader climate and development strategies.

Fifth, wherever possible, offset mechanisms should be linked to local co-benefits. Prioritizing offset projects in Indonesia—such as forest conservation, renewable energy, or peatland restoration—ensures that the economic value of CORSIA contributes directly to local sustainability and job creation, instead of flowing outward through imported credits.

Toward an Aviation Sector That Leads by Example

CORSIA may have originated as a top-down global framework, but its success will depend on how meaningfully it is localized. In Indonesia, the scheme can be more than a compliance obligation—it can become a compass that guides aviation into a low-emission future.

To get there, we must treat CORSIA not just as a technical instrument, but as a strategic opportunity to redefine what sustainable aviation means in an archipelagic, rapidly growing economy. It is a chance to rethink how we train aviation professionals, how we collaborate across sectors, and how we balance growth with responsibility.

With the continued support of ICAO, particularly through ACT-CORSIA, and with our own commitment to capacity-building, inclusive dialogue, and innovation, Indonesia can lead not only in participation—but in shaping the narrative of climate-resilient aviation in the Global South.

In the end, the path forward demands more than policy—it demands partnership, purpose, and persistence. Above all, it demands that no country, no region, and no citizen be left behind in the skies of tomorrow.",https://geotimes.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/geotimes-Navigating-CORSIA-Reflections-on-Indonesias-Readiness-for-a-Sustainable-Aviation-Future.jpg,N,,2025-06-29 13:04:48.081907

The closure serves as a critical test for the 'just transition' to net zero.

Political implications include potential voter shifts towards Reform UK and challenges for Labour and SNP.

Government and Scottish Enterprise are investing in new chemical industry projects on the site, but a single large employer is unlikely to replace the refinery's jobs.

What: The closure of the Grangemouth refinery is causing job losses and economic hardship, serving as a test case for the 'just transition' to net zero, and impacting the political landscape in Scotland.

When: The refinery closed in April (2025). The article was published on June 29, 2025. UK chemicals output slumped since March 2020. The refinery traces its history back to 1924. Petroineos deal was in 2011. Jim Ratcliffe made comments in January. A Scottish parliamentary byelection occurred earlier this month.

Where: Grangemouth, Scotland (Falkirk council area), UK (Westminster, Stanlow refinery, Fawley, Pembroke, Humber, Lindsey).

Why: The refinery closure was attributed to its inability to compete with newer, more efficient plants in the Middle East and Africa, and high UK energy costs. The broader context is the UK's transition from fossil fuels to net zero, and the economic and political challenges associated with deindustrialization.

How: The refinery has been reduced to a fuel import terminal. The Labour government and Scottish Enterprise are supporting 'Project Willow' to explore new chemical industry options (e.g., plastics recycling, sustainable aviation fuel) with government funding. Reform UK is capitalizing on public discontent by advocating against net zero policies.

Amid this uncertainty, Alaska Airlines (ALK) has emerged as a standout performer, leveraging fuel efficiency, route expansions, and disciplined cost-control to navigate the post-pandemic recovery. Recent financial results and strategic initiatives underscore its potential to outperform peers in a consolidating market. Let's dissect why ALK could be a compelling long-term investment.

Fuel Efficiency: The Engine of Profitability

Alaska Airlines has long prioritized sustainability, but its latest advancements in fuel efficiency now deliver measurable financial benefits. In 2025, the airline was recognized as the most fuel-efficient U.S. carrier by the International Council on Clean Transportation. This achievement stems from a combination of fleet modernization—transitioning to Boeing 737 MAX and Bombardier Q400 aircraft—and operational innovation.

The Air Space Intelligence Flyways AI Platform has been a game-changer. By optimizing flight paths in real time using weather, wind, and air traffic data, the system reduced fuel consumption by 3–5% for flights over four hours. In 2024 alone, this innovation saved 1.2 million gallons of fuel, equivalent to 11,958 metric tons of CO₂ emissions.

These savings are no small matter. Fuel costs typically account for 20–30% of an airline's operating expenses. By cutting this overhead, Alaska is improving margins at a time when competitors struggle with rising fuel prices. The airline's adjusted net loss of $0.77 per share in Q2 2025—in line with estimates—reflects progress, but the 40.5% year-over-year revenue growth to $3.137 billion signals underlying strength.

Route Expansion: Building a Resilient Network

Alaska's strategic route expansions are another pillar of its growth story. The airline is aggressively scaling its San Diego hub, adding nonstop flights to Phoenix, Chicago O'Hare, and Denver, while boosting frequencies to key markets like Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. These moves capitalize on pent-up demand for leisure travel and strengthen connectivity in the Southwest, a region critical to its network.

The integration with Hawaiian Airlines, finalized in late 2024, is also paying dividends. Combined operations at hubs like Los Angeles and New York JFK are reducing redundancies and improving asset utilization. Co-located stations and shared cargo systems are expected to cut costs while expanding Alaska's reach to Hawaii and the Pacific.

Cost Control and Financial Discipline

Alaska's financial discipline is evident in its balance sheet. As of Q2 2025, the airline held $2.5 billion in unrestricted cash, a war chest to weather macroeconomic headwinds. Management also prioritized shareholder returns, repurchasing $149 million in shares year-to-date.

Cost-control extends beyond fuel savings. The airline has ratified collective bargaining agreements with flight attendants, reducing labor-related uncertainties. Meanwhile, investments in AI-driven training programs—like VR simulators for pilots—aim to address staffing challenges while lowering long-term costs.

Q2 2025 Results: A Foundation for Long-Term Profitability

Despite a reported net loss, Alaska's Q2 2025 results are a testament to its strategic execution:

- Unit revenue led the industry, outperforming competitors in a challenging environment.

- Operating cash flow hit $459 million, signaling strong liquidity.

- Guidance for $1 billion in incremental profit by 2027 (via its Alaska Accelerate plan) is ambitious but achievable, given its operational leverage.

The airline's focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) partnerships—such as Twelve's Washington state facility—also positions it to meet ESG mandates, a growing priority for investors.

Why Invest in Alaska Airlines?

Alaska's blend of operational efficiency, network expansion, and financial prudence makes it a rare bright spot in an otherwise volatile sector. Key catalysts for upside include:

1. Fuel savings scalability: The Flyways AI system can be expanded to cover more flights, further reducing costs.

2. Hawaiian integration synergies: Full network optimization could unlock $100 million+ in annual savings.

3. Demand resilience: Leisure travel trends remain robust, and Alaska's focus on high-margin routes (e.g., Hawaii) insulates it from corporate demand volatility.

Risks to Consider

Fuel price spikes could pressure margins if not offset by hedging or further efficiency gains.

Labor disputes at other airlines could create industry-wide staffing shortages.

Economic slowdowns might dampen discretionary travel demand.

Final Analysis: Buy the Dip, Hold for the Long Game

Alaska Airlines is executing a clear growth strategy that aligns with both sustainability trends and shareholder value creation. Its Q2 results, while showing a short-term loss, reflect disciplined investments in its future. Investors should view dips below $30—its 52-week low—as buying opportunities. With a forward P/E ratio of 12 (vs. industry averages of 15+), ALK is undervalued relative to its peers.

Recommendation: Buy ALK for a portfolio seeking exposure to a well-positioned airline with structural tailwinds. Hold for the next 12–18 months as integration benefits materialize and the stock approaches its $40 price target.

Abstract

Addressing the urgent need to decarbonise aviation and valorise agricultural waste, this paper investigates the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from corn stover. A preliminary evaluation based on a literature review indicates that among various conversion technologies, fast pyrolysis (FP) emerged as the most promising option, offering the highest fuel yield (22.5%) among various pathways, a competitive potential minimum fuel selling price (MFSP) of 1.78 USD/L, and significant greenhouse gas savings of up to 76%. Leveraging Aspen Plus simulation, SAF production via FP was rigorously designed and optimised, focusing on the heat integration strategy within the process to minimise utility consumption and ultimately the total cost. Consequently, the produced fuel exceeded the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) limit for the final boiling point, rendering it unsuitable as a standalone jet fuel. Nevertheless, it achieves regulatory compliance when blended at a rate of up to 10% with conventional jet fuel, marking a practical route for early adoption. Energy optimisation through pinch analysis integrated four hot–cold stream pairs, eliminating external heating, reducing cooling needs by 55%, and improving sustainability and efficiency. Economic analysis revealed that while heat integration slashed utility costs by 84%, the MFSP only decreased slightly from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L due to unchanging material costs. Sensitivity analysis confirmed that hydrogen, catalyst, and feedstock pricing are the most influential variables, suggesting targeted reductions could push the MFSP below 2 USD/L. In summary, this work underscores the technical and economic viability of corn stover-derived SAF, providing a promising pathway for sustainable aviation and waste valorisation. While current limitations restrict fuel quality during full substitution, the results affirm the feasibility of SAF blending and present a scalable, low-carbon pathway for future development.

1. Introduction

Fossil fuels have dominated global energy systems for over two centuries, providing accessible and economical energy sources. However, their pervasive utilisation has precipitated significant environmental degradation through greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and pollutants affecting terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems.

The 2015 Paris Agreement established critical climate targets: limiting global temperature increases to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to restrict warming to 1.5 °C. However, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO)’s State of the Global Climate reported that 2024 was the first full year with a global average temperature more than 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels (1850–1900), which made it the hottest year in the 175 years of recorded data [1]. Current global warming is already fuelling more dangerous heatwaves, extreme rainfall, severe droughts, melting of glaciers, and rising sea levels. With projections of annual global temperatures for 2025 to 2029 estimated to range from 1.2 °C to 1.9 °C above the 1850–1900 average, urgent actions must be taken to combat escalating global warming [1].

Despite the overwhelming global temperature rise, global efforts to mitigate GHG emissions are accelerating, driven by international agreements, technological innovations, and increased public awareness [2]. Among all sectors, the aviation industry is considered the hardest to decarbonise due to its reliance on high-temperature processes and energy-dense fuels. The aviation sector faces immense pressure to decarbonise, as it contributes approximately 2.5% of global GHG emissions annually [3], with its projected growth posing significant challenges for global emission reduction targets. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) target to achieve net-zero CO2 in the aviation sector by 2050 calls for rigorous transformative shifts in energy production and consumption patterns for this hard-to-abate sector [4]. Unlike other transport sectors, direct electrification and hydrogen propulsion remain largely impractical for long-haul flights, making Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a critical pathway to achieving net-zero emissions.

Bioenergy systems like SAF production from biomass offer promising pathways to decarbonise the aviation sector by providing renewable alternatives to conventional jet fuels while also mitigating the global waste accumulation problem. Within this context, the type and source of biomass, together with the production pathway, largely determine the real sustainability of SAFs. Hence, careful selection of the feedstock and pathway is required to optimise the system to achieve its full potential.

Various feedstocks have been explored for SAF production, and they are broadly categorised into four generations based on the type of feedstock used for their production. Mainly leveraging their abundance, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability, this study focused on second-generation biofuel feedstocks, which are produced from non-food-based feedstocks (e.g., municipal solid waste (MSW) and agricultural residues), as opposed to the first, third, and fourth generations, which compete with food supplies (e.g., food crops), face scarcity and scalability challenges (e.g., oils and microalgae), and are genetically engineered (e.g., electro-biofuels), respectively. While second-generation biofuel feedstocks like MSW and food waste present unique advantages, agricultural residues appear promising due to their abundance, low cost, and minimal land-use change impact.

Agricultural waste is an abundant waste, with approximately 5 billion tons of residues generated annually [5]. Its generation peaks during harvest seasons, but decentralised production and competing uses, such as animal feed or bedding, limit its availability for bioenergy. Processes like shredding or grinding reduce the size and bulk density of the feedstock, making it easier to transport [6]. While its abundance is unmatched, efficient collection and storage systems are critical to overcoming logistical challenges, mainly during its seasonal production.

Common residues like corn stover (CS), rice straw (RS), wheat straw (WS), and sugarcane bagasse (SB) were prioritised for biofuel production in this study due to their high abundance and consistent availability globally. For instance, CS is a widely available agricultural residue in the United States, accounting for millions of tons annually, while RS and WS dominate in Asia and Europe, respectively, due to extensive rice and wheat cultivation [7] and SB is highly concentrated in sugar-producing regions such as Brazil and India [8]. Moreover, their utilisation reduces environmental issues such as open-field burning of RS and WS, which contributes significantly to air pollution [9]. SB and CS are particularly advantageous due to their relatively centralised availability, which minimises logistical challenges [10]. Additionally, the high biofuel potential of these residues, as demonstrated by the efficiencies of their conversions to SAF, makes them promising [11].

Although SB, RS, WS, and CS are comparable in terms of availability, the cost-effectiveness of acquisition, and overall sustainability, based on their compositions and physical properties [12,13,14,15], CS and SB are the top candidates for SAF production feedstock owing to their energy density and conversion efficiency potential (i.e., high hemicellulose contents, volatile matter contents, and H/C ratios and low ash contents). However, CS is prioritised since the preliminary selection of a feedstock and a process design is a research-based process and research on SAF production from CS is significantly more abundant compared to SB, covering a wide array of conversion processes such as gasification and Fischer–Tropsch (G-FT) synthesis, FP, and alcohol to jet (ATJ), highlighting its versatility. Additionally, techno-economic analyses of CS-based SAF show strong potential for integration with existing agricultural infrastructure [16]. In contrast, while SB is well-studied for biochemical conversions, studies focusing on SAF pathways are limited to fermentation-based ATJ pathways due to its high cellulose content and compatibility with sugarcane processing facilities. Therefore, with significant untapped potential for biofuel production to produce SAF, abundant research availability, and favourable integration feasibility, CS emerged as the most attractive feedstock option for SAF production in this study.

Several thermochemical and biochemical routes have been investigated for converting CS to SAF, including G-FT synthesis, ATJ, and FP. G-FT converts biomass into synthesis gas (syngas: CO + H2) via gasification, followed by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis to make liquid hydrocarbons, including jet fuel [17]. Meanwhile, the ATJ process converts biomass-derived alcohols (ethanol, butanol, and isobutanol) into jet-range hydrocarbons through dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation [18]. Finally, FP involves rapidly heating biomass in the absence of oxygen to decompose it into a mixture of vapours and char. Some of the vapours then condense into bio-oil, which is further upgraded into aviation fuel [19].

Based on a preliminary evaluation of the fuel yields, environmental impacts, economic viability, and technology readiness of the routes from the literature review, FP emerged as a more attractive pathway for SAF production from CS compared to the other two pathways. FP offers the highest fuel yield (22.5% compared to 19.7% and 0.9% for ATJ and G-FT, respectively) among the three pathways, signifying efficient biomass conversion into bio-oil for SAF production [17,18,20,21]. Moreover, a cost reduction opportunities study by Tanzil et al. reported that FP stands out as the most cost-effective pathway, as its MFSP can reach as low as 1.78 USD/Liter when costs are optimised, compared to 2.31 USD/Liter and 1.94 USD/Liter for ATJ and G-FT, respectively [21]. Additionally, FP demonstrates a moderate environmental impact with 68–76% GHG savings, making it a viable option for reducing emissions [22]. Finally, although FP and G-FT are comparable in terms of resource availability, while ATJ is more limited in this regard, FP currently lags behind G-FT in terms of its Fuel Readiness Level (FRL), as its resulting fuel remains in the developmental stage. In contrast, G-FT is nearing commercial maturity. Nonetheless, considering FP’s overall potential and ongoing advancements toward increasing its FRL, it emerged as the most promising pathway for producing SAF from CS.

While the technical feasibility of producing SAF from various feedstocks is gaining traction, comprehensive techno-economic analyses, particularly for processing CS via FP, remain crucial for commercial deployment. This study aimed to address this gap by comprehensively designing the process, optimising the process by leveraging a heat integration strategy to minimise utility consumption using Aspen Plus, evaluating its economic viability, and identifying key parameters for scalability, thereby providing valuable insights into the potential of this pathway for SAF production.

2. Methodology

Process design and optimisation for SAF production from CS were carried out according to the steps in Figure 1, and Aspen Plus V12.1 commercial software was used to model the process [23].

2.1. Process Development

A process flow diagram of the FP is presented in Figure 2. The process is divided into four stages: pretreatment of CS, FP of CS, hydrotreatment of bio-oil, and separation of biofuels. Before the biomass undergoes fast pyrolysis, the feedstock needs to be pretreated by grinding it into smaller pieces (0.3 mm) and drying it to reduce moisture, ensuring optimal conditions and efficiency during the FP process.

The FP reactor, which is a fluidised bed reactor, is operating at 500 °C and 101 kPa [20], with nitrogen extracted from the atmosphere, without an additional purchase, as the carrier gas. The products of FP are mainly categorised into three phases, bio-oil, biogas, and biochar, where the main bio-oil compounds are made up of alcohols, esters, acids, phenolics, furans, aromatics, and ketones, while the biogas mainly consists of CO, CO2, H2, methane, and ethylene.

The FP products are sent to a cyclone that is operating at 500 °C and 100 kPa to separate the biochar from the vapour products [19]. The vapour products, which consist of bio-oil and biogas, are condensed at 25 °C to retrieve the condensable part (bio-oil) and further separated through a flash drum and a liquid–liquid separator to achieve high-purity bio-oil.

The separated bio-oil is sent to two-stage hydrotreatment reactors with the reactors operating at 220 °C and 400 °C (at 10.7 MPa), respectively [19,20]. Low-temperature hydrotreatment can be utilised to pretreat unstable bio-oil, targeting the reduction of highly reactive oxygenated compounds before undergoing complete deoxygenation under more intense hydrotreatment conditions.

Finally, the product of the hydrotreatment, upgraded oil ranging from C6 to C18, is separated into its respective fuel types (Naphtha, SAF, and heavy oils) with a flash drum, a liquid–liquid separator, and two serial distillation columns.

2.2. Building the Process Model

2.2.1. Selecting the Thermodynamic Model

The commercial software Aspen Plus [23] was used to simulate the entire process. The NRTL thermodynamic model was used, as it is well-suited for systems such as pyrolysis vapour condensation, which generally function at moderate to low temperatures (ranging from 120 °C down to ice-trap conditions). Furthermore, bio-oil is commonly classified as a highly polar solution, where the presence of electrolytes is typically insignificant. Ultimately, the experimental results obtained by Liu and Wang’s research team showed good agreement with the predictions of the NRTL model, confirming its accuracy in representing the interactions during this process [19].

2.2.2. Feedstock Characterisation

The CS feedstock was modelled via non-conventional components using ultimate and proximate analysis data obtained from a Vario-Micro CHN elemental analyser (Elementar, Rhein-Main-Gebiet, Germany) and the DIN 51718 [24], DIN 51720 [25], and DIN 51719 [26] standard methods reported by A. Elsagan et al., as presented in Table 1 [13]. Additionally, Aspen Plus V12.1, the software used to simulate the process that facilitates accurate component property predictions via databank access, does not have unified molecular formula data for biomass. Hence, MIXCINC (Mixed, Conventional Inert Solid and Non-Conventional Stream) was used as the global stream class. The enthalpy and the density were the two attributes of the non-conventional components calculated via HCOALGEN and DCOALIGT models, respectively. HCOALGEN and DGOALIGT are built-in Aspen Plus property models used to estimate the thermodynamic properties of the feedstock based on its elemental composition. A plant capacity of 600 tonnes/day of CS feedstock was selected based on typical scales for commercial biofuel production.

2.2.3. Fast Pyrolysis (FP) Process Modelling

The FP process was modelled based on the design parameters from Liu and Wang presented in Table 2, assuming the operating conditions of the process are similar since the type of feedstock used shares many similarities with CS [19]. Although Liu and Wang simulated the process for rice husks, the design parameters were applicable, while the feedstock-specific yields of the products were adapted to represent the use of CS. An RYield unit was used to simulate FP of CS as a feedstock and the specific product yield with CS as the feedstock, which were obtained from the work by Howe et al. [20].

The components and composition of the products of FP, namely bio-oil, biogas, and biochar, were assumed to be represented by a pseudo-component approach, as detailed in Table 3. The original yield data was sourced from Heng et al. and adjusted so that the yield of each product type summed to 100%, simplifying the input for the Aspen Plus RYield simulation based on the percentages of the CS bio-oil, biogas, and biochar [20,27]. Bio-oil mainly comprises alcohols, esters, acids, phenolics, furans, aromatics, and ketones, while biogas mainly consists of CO, CO2, H2, methane, and ethylene. Biochar cannot be modelled with chemical compounds due to a lack of unified molecular formula data. Hence, it is modelled by its ultimate analysis data, which are presented in Table 3.

2.2.4. Hydrotreatment (Bio-Oil Upgrading) Modelling

A model simulating hydrotreatment of bio-oil from pine was reported by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and the compounds, model, and yields used in that report are assumed to be applicable to modelling hydrotreatment of CS based on the following reasoning [28]. Based on an elemental study of hydrotreated oils from pine plants and CS by Howe et al., it is reported that both upgraded oils’ elemental compositions vary minimally—despite dissimilar feedstocks—suggesting similar final yields [20]. This is because although pine and CS differ in their raw compositions, the pyrolysis and subsequent hydrotreatment steps standardise their outputs, leading to bio-oils with similar elemental compositions. This outcome is driven by the chemical goals of the upgrading process (e.g., hydrodeoxygenation, hydrogenation, etc.), rather than the feedstock characteristics [29]. The two-stage hydrotreatment units were simulated using RYield with the design parameters in Table 4.

2.2.5. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Separation Modelling

The distillation section was modelled according to the design parameters reported by the NREL [28]. However, the objective of this study was to separate the products to obtain biodiesel. Therefore, the parameters were adjusted to fit the objective of the current work, which was to separate SAF (Table 5). The parameters were optimised to achieve maximum separation of hydrocarbons ranging from C7 to C17 for SAF.

2.3. Process Optimisation via Heat Integration

Leveraging Aspen Plus simulation, SAF production via FP was rigorously optimised, focusing on the heat integration strategy within the process with the aim to minimise utility consumption and ultimately the operating and total costs. Heat integration was applied via pinch analysis. This involved recovering heat from hot process streams to meet the energy demands of cold streams within the same system. For instance, the bio-oil stream was heated to 400 °C before entering the hydrotreatment reactor to match its operating conditions.

Pinch analysis was employed to develop a heat exchanger network (HEN) strategy. This method does not account for phase changes in a process, as it assumes a constant heat flux [31]. As a result, it may underestimate or overestimate heat transfer requirements, leading to suboptimal HEN design. Research by Liporace et al. found that failing to account for phase changes can lead to errors in the determination of pinch points, which affect overall utility consumption [32]. Despite this limitation, streams undergoing phase changes were incorporated into the analysis to optimise heat integration. While the presence of non-constant heat flux in these streams may introduce some inaccuracies, this analysis still serves as a useful tool for identifying potential matches and estimating heat transfer between streams.

According to the process flow sheet presented in Figure 3, in total two hot streams and four cold streams were identified, as presented in Table 6.

2.4. Economic Evaluation of Process

An economic evaluation of the SAF production process was essential for assessing its financial feasibility and the MFSP required to achieve a break-even point. This methodology involved calculating the total process cost, which consists of both capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenditures (OPEX), as well as estimating potential income from biofuel sales. This approach provided a comprehensive economic assessment, allowing for cost optimisation and strategic pricing decisions to enhance the project’s viability.

The annual OPEX comprised both fixed and variable operating expenses. The fixed OPEX covered equipment and labour costs (Table 7), which remained constant regardless of the production volume. Additionally, 16% of the labour cost was factored into the fixed costs, covering employee benefits. On the other hand, the variable OPEX fluctuated based on the production volume. Table 8 outlines the variable operating costs, which included the feedstock (factored as an acquisition cost), catalysts, and hydrogen gas for reactions. These expenses were determined by process consumption and the market price. Meanwhile, the costs of the utilities (electricity, steam, and cooling water) were obtained from the Aspen Process Economic Analyzer (APEA) in Aspen Plus V12.1 and were generated based on the process flows [23].

The CAPEX accounted for the initial investment in infrastructure, equipment, and installation. This cost primarily depended on assumptions and estimations that were based on the Inside Battery Limits (ISBL) cost, which was the total cost of the equipment and its installation. The equipment and installation costs were generated and obtained from the APEA for both cases, the base case and the optimised (heat-integrated) case, as listed in Table 9, since different equipment was used in these cases. Equipment costs that were not generated by the APEA and were not reliable were estimated based on market prices.

Consequently, using the ISBL cost as the base value, the total capital investment (TCI) for the project could be calculated using various reasonable assumptions listed in Table 10 [19]. The TCI was determined by combining fixed capital investment (FCI), working capital (WC), and land costs. The total direct cost (TDC) consisted of the ISBL cost, along with additional expenses such as a warehouse (5.7% of the ISBL cost), site development (12.9% of the ISBL cost), and additional piping (6.4% of the ISBL cost). The total indirect cost (TIC) accounted for engineering and supervision (13.7% of the TDC) and construction expenses (34% of the TDC). Adding the TDC and TIC resulted in the total direct and indirect cost (TDIC), which formed the basis for FCI. FCI also included off-site battery limits (OSBLs), contractor costs (5% of the TDIC), and contingency (10% of the TDIC) to cover unforeseen expenses. Additionally, WC was set at 10% of FCI, ensuring sufficient funds for operational needs, while the land cost was estimated at 5% of the ISBL cost. Ultimately, the total CAPEX was derived from the sum of FCI, WC, and land expenses, providing a comprehensive estimate of project investment.

Furthermore, other financial assumptions are listed in Table 11 based on typical scales for a general production plant [19]. The economic analysis was conducted assuming the plant would operate for 8088 h per year. The project was partially financed with a loan covering 60% of the total investment, carrying an interest rate of 6% over a five-year term. While the general plant and steam plant had lifespans of 7 and 20 years, respectively, an 8-year linear depreciation period was derived from a weighted average of general and steam plant lifespans, where the general plant constituted most of the investment. This resulted in a depreciation period that leaned closer to the general plant’s 7-year life while still accounting for the longer life of the steam plant. The construction phase was planned for three years, with investment distributed over time: 30% spent in year 2, another 30% in year 1, and the remaining 40% in year 0 for final payments and test runs. To assess financial feasibility, the analysis applied a discount rate of 10%, ensuring future cash flows were appropriately valued. Additionally, an income tax rate of 30% was considered, which impacted net profitability. These financial parameters provided a structured framework for evaluating project viability, loan repayment schedules, and cost recovery strategies.

3. Results and Discussion

Based on the methodology described in Section 2 for building the Aspen Plus model of the process, Figure 3 presents the Aspen Plus model of the conversion of CS to SAF through FP and hydrotreatment.

3.1. Aspen Plus Model Validation

The primary objective of model validation was to ensure that the simulation results accurately reflect real-world production of SAF. In this study, the hydrotreatment process was modelled using Aspen Plus V12.1, where the reactor was simulated using RYield based on product yields obtained from the literature. As the yield data itself was derived from existing studies, directly comparing the simulation yields with those reported in the literature would have been redundant and not meaningful for validation purposes.

Therefore, to establish the validity of the model, the simulation results were compared to the elemental composition of the final product, SAF (hydrotreated CS bio-oil), reported in the literature, as presented in Table 12. This approach ensured that the model accurately produces SAF with the same composition of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur contents rather than merely reproducing yield data. By doing so, it provided an independent validation method that focused on composition accuracy, which was critical for evaluating the quality and suitability of the SAF for downstream applications.

The comparison between the simulation results and those from the literature in Table 12 demonstrates good agreement. The minor discrepancies between the simulated elemental composition and that from the literature are attributed to differences in process assumptions and model scope. The simulation assumes more efficient hydrotreatment, resulting in near-complete deoxygenation and a slightly higher hydrogen content. The trace sulphur in the simulation may originate from conservative assumptions related to gas clean-up, whereas the literature likely reports post-polishing data with sulphur below detection levels. Despite these minor differences, the close agreement in the carbon and hydrogen contents validates the reliability of the simulation model for predicting SAF composition and the following discussion of the results derived from it.

3.2. An Evaluation of the Properties of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The Aspen Plus simulation results yielded a comprehensive breakdown of the chemical composition of the SAF, including the proportions of paraffins, naphthene, aromatics, oxygenates, and other relevant components, as presented in Table 13. The system was simulated via a steady-state deterministic method using fixed inputs with no variation or uncertainty. Therefore, the results represent a single point of operation.

The critical outcome of the simulation of SAF production from CS was the final composition of the SAF product. To assess its suitability, the properties of the SAF were instead validated based on the final composition of the SAF by comparing the simulation composition with the compositions of jet fuels reported in the literature (100% waste wood-derived (WWD) SAF and 100% conventional jet fuel) [33]. This approach was logical and scientifically sound because the chemical composition directly influences the physical properties and performance characteristics of a fuel. The properties presented in Table 14 reflect the combustion performance, efficiency, fluidity, cold-temperature pumpability performance, and stability of the fuel, which are crucial to characterise the quality of jet fuel.

Upon comparing the composition of the simulation results with two reference fuel compositions (100% WWD SAF and 100% conventional jet fuel) in Table 15, it was observed that the product composition fell within the range between the two reference fuels. Such an outcome indicates that the chemical properties of the produced SAF are between those of the WWD SAF and the petroleum-based fuel.

Therefore, the results indicate that the most practical application of the SAF would be as a blended fuel that could be mixed with conventional jet fuel to form an SAF blend that meets the necessary ASTM standards for aviation fuel. A study by Jeon et al. suggests that a 10% SAF blend with conventional jet fuel offers the optimal jet fuel quality that achieves all ASTM standards, with a final boiling point (FBP) of 299.5 °C [33]. An aviation fuel blend review by Lau et al. confirms the relevancy of the proposed blend, as a blend percentage of 10% is also recommended for SAF produced from Jatropha plants, Babassu seeds, palm kernels, and Lignin-based plants [35]. A low-percentage blend is expected for SAF derived from lignocellulosic biomass, as it tends to have a higher oxygen content and more complex aromatic structures compared to SAF produced from oilseed crops like Canola and Camelina, which comply with the standards as 20% and 50% blends, respectively [35].

3.3. Energy Savings Analysis

From the pinch analysis, four streams were matched to maximise the heat recovery in the system, and the results are reported in Table 16 and Figure 4.

Each heat source available provides heat to more than one heat-sink stream. On that account, pairing hot streams with cold streams that require higher outlet temperatures needs to be prioritised to avoid outlet temperature cross. As a result, H1 and H2 integrate with C1 and C4 first, respectively, before directing their excess heat to the other two cold streams.

When the heat integration network obtained from the pinch analysis was applied in the Aspen Plus simulation, it was observed that the total cooling utility requirement (8092.12 kW) was slightly higher than the result from the pinch analysis (7967.59 kW). This discrepancy primarily arose because Aspen Plus is capable of accurately modelling phase transitions, including the latent heat that occurs during condensation or vaporisation. Unlike pinch analysis, which assumes constant heat flux, Aspen Plus dynamically calculates the enthalpy changes during phase transformations. This results in a more realistic estimation of the cooling duty.

Despite the discrepancy between the cooling utility requirements obtained from pinch analysis and Aspen Plus simulation, pinch analysis remains an effective and practical method for estimating and designing HENs. The discrepancy observed is relatively small, indicating that pinch analysis still serves as a reliable guide for preliminary HEN design and effectively identifies pinch points and heat recovery potentials, making it useful for conceptual design.

After heat integration optimisation, the utility requirements were significantly reduced from 9701 kW to none for the heating utility and from 17668 kW to 7967 kW for the cooling utility. These remarkable reductions indicate that 9701 kW of energy was successfully integrated between the hot and cold streams, achieving 100% energy savings for the heating utility and 55% savings for the cooling utility.

Consequently, the need for heating utilities such as high-pressure steam and fired heat was eliminated. Additionally, the significant reduction in cooling demand minimised the reliance on cooling utilities. As a result, the types of utilities required were reduced from high-pressure steam, fired heat, cooling water, and refrigerant to just cooling water and refrigerant.

3.4. Economic Analysis

The results of an economic analysis that included the CAPEX and the OPEX for both the base case and the optimised case (after heat integration) are presented in Table 17.

The analysis suggests that the material costs were the dominant contributors to the OPEX in both cases, driven by feedstock acquisition, hydrogen, and catalyst costs, while utility costs were minimal. Despite an 84% reduction in utility costs through optimisation, the overall impact on the total OPEX was negligible due to unchanged material costs.

For the CAPEX, the FCI remained the largest component. Optimisation led to a 12% reduction in the total CAPEX, but its impact was limited relative to the total costs.

Overall, based on the 600 tonnes/day plant capacity and annual SAF production of 32.5 Liters/year, the MFSPs for the base and optimised cases were calculated to be 2.35 USD/Liter and 2.29 USD/Liter, respectively. The MFSP decreased slightly by 6 cents/Liter when optimisation was applied, reflecting a modest economic improvement primarily constrained by high material costs.

Figure 5 shows the cost distribution between the main steps in SAF production, pyrolysis, hydrotreatment, and separation, where the credits of the feedstock and the product are not included in the distribution. The results indicate that the equipment costs involved for all steps are minimal when compared to the operating costs. For pyrolysis, since nitrogen is extracted from the atmosphere without an additional purchase, the operating cost mainly comes from the utilities. The hydrotreatment operating cost is significantly larger than those of the other two steps due to additional hydrogen and catalyst sourcing, which are the main drivers of the material costs. Finally, the separation of SAF has the lowest operating cost due to its moderate operating temperatures compared to the other units used in the other two steps.

The results of a sensitivity analysis of the cost variables that have the greatest impact on the MFSP are presented in Figure 6. The nominal value of the MFSP is 2.35 USD/Liter, and the possible ranges of the MFSP shown take both cases into account, where the base case represents the maximum value and the optimised case represents the minimum value.

The sensitivity analysis highlights that material-related cost variables have the largest influence on the MFSP. In the original case, conservative assumptions were made by selecting the highest hydrogen cost (7 USD/kg), the shortest catalyst life (1 year), and the highest feedstock cost (0.10 USD/kg), which collectively contributed to a higher MFSP.

However, the analysis implies that optimising these material costs can significantly lower the MFSP. If the hydrogen cost is reduced to 3 USD/kg, the catalyst life is extended to 3 years, and the feedstock cost is lowered to 0.08 USD/kg, the combined effect can bring the MFSP below 2 USD/L, as shown by the lower bounds of the sensitivity bars, which is consistent with the range reported by Tanzil et al. [21]. This suggests that targeted cost reductions for key input materials—whether through improved sourcing, catalyst durability, or feedstock agreements—have the potential to substantially improve the economic feasibility of the fuel production process.

In contrast, the discount rate and payback period have a smaller influence on the MFSP. The original case uses a 10% discount rate and an 8-year payback period. These assumptions position the MFSP closer to the midpoints of their respective sensitivity ranges, indicating that changes in capital recovery conditions are less critical than variations in material costs.

To conclude, this section demonstrates the technical feasibility of producing SAF from CS via FP, followed by hydrotreatment and separation, with Aspen Plus simulations indicating realistic fuel outputs. While the standalone SAF does not meet ASTM standards due to its high FBP, a 10% blend with conventional jet fuel is compliant, highlighting its potential as a transitional solution. Process optimisation through heat integration yielded full heating utility savings and significant cooling savings of 55%, enhancing energy efficiency and sustainability. Economic analysis revealed that while heat integration slashed utility costs by 84%, the MFSP only decreased slightly from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L due to unchanging material costs, which were identified as the primary cost drivers. However, sensitivity analysis shows that further cost reductions for feedstock, hydrogen, and catalysts could make SAF more economically competitive.

4. Conclusions

Through an analysis of GHG emissions across various sectors, the aviation industry was recognised as one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise due to its dependence on high-energy-density fuels and limited alternatives. Simultaneously, the waste management sector was highlighted for substantial GHG emissions from landfills and its potential for valorisation. Utilising the strategic intersection between aviation and waste management, production of SAF from waste feedstocks presents dual benefits. This approach not only mitigates emissions from aviation but also addresses the environmental impact of waste accumulation.

Comprehensive process design of SAF production from CS via FP was implemented in Aspen Plus, which included pyrolysis, hydrotreatment, and separation as the main steps. The results from the simulation indicate that the produced fuel is realistic but does not comply with ASTM specifications as a standalone jet fuel, as it exceeds the final boiling point (FBP) limit. A 10% SAF blend with conventional jet fuel is suggested to enhance fuel quality and satisfy all ASTM requirements. This limitation is expected, as the technology for SAF production from lignocellulosic biomass is relatively young, particularly upgrading oil through hydrotreatment. Nevertheless, the ability to produce an SAF that meets standards in a 10% blend is a promising step forward, offering a transitional pathway toward increased SAF adoption as the technology matures and scalability improves.

To further optimise the process, a heat integration strategy was implemented by combining four pairs of hot and cold streams. This resulted in 100% energy savings for the heating utility and 55% savings for the cooling utility while eliminating the need for high-pressure steam and fired heat in the utility system. Simultaneously, this reduced the reliance on external utilities by maximising heat recovery within the system, making the process more sustainable environmentally and economically.

An economic evaluation was conducted to determine the value of the product. Among the key findings, material costs—particularly those related to hydrogen, catalysts, and feedstock—are the dominant drivers of SAF production economics, significantly influencing the MFSP. Despite the reduction in utility costs, high material costs limited economic improvement, as the MFSP was only reduced from 2.35 USD/L to 2.29 USD/L. However, a sensitivity analysis revealed that targeted cost reductions in material pricing could reduce the MFSP below 2 USD/L, indicating strong potential for economic competitiveness. Although the price of SAF is not yet competitive with conventional jet fuel, its significant advantage in reducing carbon emissions presents a compelling value proposition and serves as a key driver for its adoption.

Overall, the aim of this study to seek sustainable pathways for the transition to a low-carbon energy system while addressing the gap in the technical feasibility of SAF production, particularly for CS via FP, by utilising a waste resource to produce high-value biofuel via an optimised process was achieved. While further improvements are needed to reach its full potential, this work represents a meaningful step forward in advancing sustainable biofuel development.

5. Future Outlook

From the process perspective, the final SAF product from this study exhibits an FBP exceeding the ASTM standard, limiting its direct use as a standalone jet fuel. It is only suitable for use as a blend component, with blends up to 10% in conventional jet fuel meeting standard requirements. Future work should focus on exploring strategies to reduce the FBP of the upgraded oil, such as optimising the hydrotreatment conditions, integrating additional upgrading steps, or tailoring the catalyst selection. Furthermore, the current upgrading process loses carbon as CO2 and CO while removing oxygen, which reduces its efficiency and releases GHGs, indicating the need for technologies that remove oxygen as H2O. These efforts could enable more sustainable production of an SAF that fully complies with ASTM standards for higher blend ratios, and eventually, use as a standalone jet fuel.

From the sustainability perspective, future work should focus on improving supply chains, catalyst life, and feedstock agreements to enhance viability. Additionally, the high hydrogen demand during hydrotreatment remains a critical limitation, indicating the need for process intensification to reduce hydrogen consumption. Finally, future work should also incorporate environmental assessments, such as life cycle analysis (LCA), to quantify the GHG emissions associated with the SAF production process. This would provide critical insight into how effective the pathway is in achieving its intended goal of transitioning to a low-carbon energy system. Evaluating the overall sustainability of the process will help validate its environmental benefits and identify further opportunities for improvement.

Since commencing operations in June 1990, Emirates has carried over 10 million passengers on more than 65,000 flights between Singapore and Dubai.

Throughout the years, Emirates has become a preferred choice for travellers heading from Singapore to Dubai and beyond. The most popular outbound destinations in the last year ending March 2025 include London Heathrow, London Gatwick, Paris, Manchester, Rome, Amsterdam, Jeddah, Madrid, Istanbul, Frankfurt, and Munich.

Emirates currently operates four daily flights between Singapore and Dubai with a mix of Airbus A380s and Boeing 777s, as well as a non-stop daily service connecting Singapore with Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Emirates’ Country Manager for Singapore & Brunei, Rashed Alfajeer, said: “We’ve come a long way in our Singapore operations, from carrying just over 12,000 passengers on a daily flight between Singapore and Dubai in 1990, to connecting over 800,000 travellers between the two gateways on four daily services in the last financial year. The past 35 years have been marked by remarkable growth for Emirates, further supported by strong and reliable partnerships we’ve established with local entities. As we look ahead, we remain committed to serving the Singaporean market with our best-in-class products and world-class service, while exploring innovative solutions to provide industry-leading customer-centric experiences.”

In June 2023, Emirates launched its Premium Economy cabin on the Singapore-Dubai route, making Singapore the first market in Southeast Asia to receive this iconic and highly appreciated product. Offering more space, comfort, and premium touches, Emirates’ Premium Economy has become a standout choice for passengers seeking an elevated travel experience.

To date, Emirates has welcomed over 87,000 passengers in this cabin class from Singapore. The industry recognition speaks volumes, too, with Emirates’ Premium Economy having won ‘Best Premium Economy Class’ at the 2024 Business Traveller Asia-Pacific Awards and ‘Best Premium Economy Class Airline in the Middle East’ at the 2024 Skytrax World Airline Awards.

In May 2024, Emirates resumed its daily Phnom Penh service via Singapore, linking the two trade and leisure centres in the region with a conveniently timed schedule. Over the past year, the service has connected nearly 66,000 passengers between the two gateways, with over 60% of them having started their journey in Singapore.

In June 2024, Emirates powered flights departing Changi Airport with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) as part of its fuel agreement with Neste, marking its inaugural SAF investment in Asia. Approximately 3.3 million litres of blended SAF — which reduces lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel—was integrated and used over a few weeks.

Reinforcing its long-term commitment to Singapore, Emirates also opened its first Emirates World retail store in Singapore on 6 May 2025. Strategically located at Odeon 333, just across from the iconic Raffles Hotel, the new store offers personalised travel planning and expert advice from dedicated consultants. The space is designed to be experiential and immersive, featuring interactive installations and the airline’s First-Class Suite on display.

To mark Emirates’ 35th anniversary in Singapore, the airline is offering special fares on bookings made until 30 June 2025, for travel through 30 November 2025.

A single private jet flight can emit two metric tons of carbon dioxide per hour, according to Transport & Environment.","As wildfires, floods, and heatwaves intensify around the globe, one thing remains clear: The climate crisis isn't hitting everyone equally. While everyday people are urged to recycle and drive less, some of the world's wealthiest are burning thousands of gallons of jet fuel for weekend trips.

That's what's sparking frustration online after a post on the ""r/TimotheeChalametDaily"" subreddit revealed that the actor and girlfriend Kylie Jenner ""took her private jet to Puerto Rico for some alone time.""

Celebrities' private jet usage has been heavily scrutinized over the last few years. Kylie Jenner herself came under fire in 2022 for taking a 17-minute flight across Los Angeles County. Around the same time, Taylor Swift topped a list of celebrity private jet users, with her aircraft logging more than 170 flights in under seven months.

This moment reignited that ire. ""Celebrities are the real reason for climate change. One private jet does more damage in a single year than if you were to drive multiple cars at the same time non stop for a year,"" one commenter wrote.

""Fun fact, celebrities like this produce more pollution in [90] minutes than you in your whole life span!!"" another added.

They're not far off. A single private jet flight can emit two metric tons of carbon dioxide per hour, according to Transport & Environment. That's more than the average person emits in a year.

These trips may look like luxury, but to many, they symbolize the unchecked emissions of the ultra-wealthy. ""Time to ban private jets,"" one commenter said, echoing a growing movement calling for stricter regulation of high-polluting travel.

Organizations like Possible and Stay Grounded are advocating for taxes on private air travel, while some European countries are considering restrictions or bans on short-haul private flights. Investing in high-speed rail, electrified regional air travel, and sustainable aviation fuel can also help, but only if the wealthiest flyers are held accountable.

Because when private luxury comes at the cost of a livable planet, it's not just a personal choice; it's everyone's problem.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Kylie-Jennerimage-reckHMYgyU6LOB96p.jpg,N,,2025-06-28 22:58:38.958206

YPF está llamada a liderar la industria para que la Argentina exporte U$S 30 mil millones en 2031.","En milésimas de segundos recorre su pasado y cae en la cuenta de que la última vez que estuvo en Córdoba fue cuando tenía 16 años y vino a jugar un torneo de tenis. “Creo que lo gané, no me acuerdo”, dice entre risas.

Horacio Marín, el presidente y CEO de YPF, es frontal, casi sin filtros. Tanto que a veces parece que hasta se muerde la boca para frenar un pico de verborragia. Algo aprendió cuando se filtró una expresión suya sobre el debut de Franco Colapinto en la actual temporada de la Fórmula 1 con Alpine.

En su celular mirá el minuto a minuto del precio del petróleo y del valor de la acción de la compañía, pero también sabe cuántos litros de combustible se despachan y hasta cuántas hamburguesas se facturan en las tiendas de las estaciones de servicio de la marca.

“El mes pasado vendimos 502 mil, somos los segundos hamburgueseros de la Argentina. Yo lo quiero cagar (sic) a McDonald’s, pero todavía estamos lejos”, bromea. Aunque desafía que eso podría ocurrir dentro de cuatro años.

Lo de cuatro no es antojadizo. Es un número clave. Un plan 4x4, que en la cresta se traduce como la meta de cuadruplicar el valor de la empresa en cuatro años. “No te pongas adelante, porque si me querés sacar del objetivo, te paso por arriba”, afirma. La frase lo define.

Ese fue el Marín puro que pasó por el 16º Congreso Córdoba del Instituto Argentino de Ejecutivos de Finanzas (Iaef) y con quien La Voz mantuvo antes una entrevista exclusiva para entender cómo piensa la persona que está sacudiendo todos los eslabones de YPF.

–Avanzan en el plan de microprecios en las estaciones de servicio. ¿Córdoba está en la fase piloto?

–No, no está en el plan piloto; son cinco estaciones (N.d.R.: tres en Buenos Aires, una en Rosario y otra en Mendoza). Podemos ver distintos precios en distintos horarios, pero la idea conceptual es que por cada litro que yo vendo a las 3 de la mañana, a las 6 de la tarde vendo 40. No hace falta hacer cuentas para entender que YPF pierde dinero durante la noche, pero es un servicio esencial. Entonces, lo que uno tiene que hacer es ver cómo bajar esa pérdida y ver si logra rentabilidad nocturna. Hay una posibilidad en Argentina, como en todo el mundo, de autoabastecimiento. Y eso baja los costos nocturnos. Una manera de ir cambiando la forma de pensar de los consumidores, para que vean que somos honestos con ellos, es que si yo les pido que hagan autoabastecimiento y tengo una ganancia mayor, compartirla.

–¿Cómo es la estación de servicio del futuro?

–La veo con un Full (la tienda que la petrolera tiene en cada estación) extraordinario, con más productos regionales, que en Córdoba se vendan productos típicos y en el norte, otros. La veo con autoservicio en los momentos que perdemos y dar mejoras en precios, y que, en los horarios pico, trata de bajar los tiempos de carga, pero dejar autoservicio, que tiene que tener un precio de nafta menor que el otro. Y otra cosa que estamos haciendo es que haya una experiencia del cliente muy importante.

–¿Todo a través de la aplicación?

–Que tengas la aplicación y si querés comprar acciones de YPF las puedas comprar, una aplicación con una experiencia muy grande, no solamente nuestros productos, sino que te ayude a pagar los impuestos, un montón de cosas.

–Eso es disruptivo para nuestro mercado.

–Todo es disruptivo, pero estamos en YPF y tenemos que trabajar para cumplir esas palabras.

–¿Cuánto tiempo durará la fase piloto?

–Como es muy disruptiva, hay que tener mucho cuidado en los primeros días, porque es posible que haya mucha gente que la utilice y hay que encontrar los niveles estacionarios.

–¿Pero el esquema estará funcionando en Córdoba en julio?

–Bueno, veremos. Te digo que estamos viendo cosas que no te quiero adelantar, pero que van a sorprender…

–¿Qué inversión demandó el centro de datos de tiempo real?

–No te lo voy a decir por la competencia, pero no son números fuera de juego. Realmente me llama la atención que no se haya hecho antes, y no es el único. Estamos terminando el cuarto; el primero fue el de Vaca Muerta, que es extraordinario.

–Otras compañías movieron precios cuando subió el valor del petróleo. ¿Están pensando en un ajuste en julio?

–Estamos viendo, lo decidiremos en los próximos días.

–¿Está atrasado el precio de la nafta?

–Poco. Muy poco.

–¿Qué es muy poco?

–No te lo voy a decir porque en estos días, no sé, sábado o domingo, decidiremos el precio. Está muy volátil el valor del barril.

–Cambio el foco. Un eje del plan estratégico es salir de los campos maduros. ¿Cuándo termina esa etapa?

–Te diría que está finalizada. Falta un área de Río Negro que ya está, la tienen que aprobar en la Legislatura, pero está terminada. Mendoza, Neuquén, Chubut están terminados. En Santa Cruz, también. Y la única que nos falta, en la que estamos haciendo el mismo modelo que en Santa Cruz, es Tierra del Fuego, donde estamos muy adelantados y deberíamos llegar a un acuerdo. El objetivo es que, el 1º de enero de 2026, YPF sea una compañía netamente no convencional.

–¿Por qué salen también de Manantiales Behr, donde no pierden plata?

–Es cierto que Manantiales Behr (Chubut) no da pérdida, pero tiene un costo operativo de más de U$S 20 por barril, cuando en Vaca Muerta es de U$S 5. Y un inversor de YPF quiere que inviertas en otro lado. No es que se vayan a quedar sin trabajo ni mucho menos. Es un área excelente, tiene futuro, tiene terciaria, pero no tiene mucha lógica que YPF siga en las (áreas) convencionales. YPF está llamada a liderar la industria para que la Argentina exporte U$S 30 mil millones en 2031. Ese es el punto focal y esas áreas no son para lograr eso.

–En muchas industrias hay renegociaciones de contratos con los proveedores para bajar costos. ¿Están en lo mismo?

–A las grandes les estamos diciendo: “Vení, porque estás cobrando caro”.

–¿Cuánto más caro?

–Hay distintos números. Hay de 40%, hay más, hay de todo tipo, porque estabas como en otro país. En cuanto al upstream, en Neuquén estamos trabajando con un modelo disruptivo, que se llama Toyota Well, que es aplicar lo que ustedes en Córdoba saben muy bien, que son las eficiencias de la industria automotriz en la industria de oil & gas.

–Le escuché una comparación entre los costos para producir acá y los de Permian. ¿Cuál es la diferencia hoy?

–Lo debería volver a calcular, porque hay algunas empresas grandes que ya nos están dando un precio más lógico para lo que es hoy Argentina y lo que es YPF. El problema es que las compañías de servicio nos toman como una compañía estatal, te cobran mucho y eso es lo que estoy tratando de romper. Pero los números son parecidos. Ahora, no sólo es por la diferencia de costo unitario.

–El costo pozo.

–Claro, el costo unitario termina llevando al costo pozo. Hay una parte que es costo unitario y hay otra, sin entrar en cosas particulares, pues no quiero herir ninguna susceptibilidad, que yo llamo costo argentino. Te lo voy a poner en números que no son correctos, sino para que sea fácil de entender: si yo pongo una herramienta que en Permian (cuenca no convencional en Estados Unidos) sale 100 y acá la pongo en Neuquén, y, sacándole el transporte, podés llegar a incrementar 50, 60 y hasta 70%.

–Mucho…

–Y eso para Vaca Muerta y para GNL (gas natural licuado) es determinante, porque competimos con Estados Unidos.

–Pasemos en limpio lo de GNL. ¿En qué fase están?

–Son tres. En la uno estamos con Pan American (PAE), Pampa Energía, Harbour Energy y Golar. Es un alquiler. A finales de julio tenemos que hacer el FID (decisión final de inversión), pero lo del segundo barco te diría que está cerrado y hay que empezar a hacer un gasoducto rápidamente. Eso empezará a exportar a fines de 2027 y a fines de 2028 llegaría el otro barco.

–¿Y con la italiana ENI?

–Con ENI firmamos en Roma un head of agreement, que son 34 hojas que dicen todos los pasos que vamos a hacer para llegar al final investment decision. Nuestro objetivo es que eso ocurra en la primera quincena de enero (2026). Después de eso, creemos que dentro de tres años y medio estaría el primer barco, y, a los seis meses, el otro barco, y creo que hay altísimas probabilidades de que se logre. Estaríamos completando el consorcio con una empresa que no la puedo comentar y puede que entre otra con un porcentaje menor, una argentina muy posiblemente, para completar el consorcio.

–¿Y con Shell?

–Con Shell estamos trabajando de forma extraordinaria, estoy muy contento. Nos vamos a juntar en julio para ver todos los temas y cerrar. Puede ser que el FID sea a fines del año que viene. Y con eso cumplo mi promesa personal de lograr los objetivos a 2031 e irme de YPF. No irme porque me quiera ir, sino por haber cumplido todo el ciclo de desarrollo de hidrocarburos. Y, por supuesto, estamos trabajando en nuevas energías también para 2030.

–¿Y con YPF Luz?

–Es una excelente compañía que genera electricidad. Somos la segunda empresa en generación de renovables de la Argentina, vamos a llegar a un giga (GW).

–Sorprendió cuando hablaron del uranio en Chubut. ¿Hay un compromiso político?

–No, no. Venimos trabajando en Chubut, se me acercaron. Siempre estoy coordinando con un experto como Demián Reidel (presidente de Nucleoeléctrica, la compañía a cargo de la operación de las tres centrales nucleares). Coincido con él y con su visión, porque la energía nuclear es algo del futuro muy importante y me parece brillante tratar de explotar uranio para generar, si Argentina tiene la tecnología, los reactores modulares y tratar de que en la Argentina haya data centers mundiales muy grandes y exportar energía a través de internet. Me parece una idea brillante y lo vamos a intentar con Demián.

–¿Cómo le explicaría a un ciudadano de a pie lo que va a implicar Vaca Muerta directa e indirectamente?

–Lo primero que le digo es que en 2031 le vamos a dejar, por lo menos, un campo adicional (en referencia al aporte del sector agropecuario). Vamos a tener inversiones realmente gigantes y Argentina será un exportador neto, tanto de petróleo como de gas, y habrá mucho trabajo. Por supuesto que habrá mucho en Neuquén; YPF va a invertir de U$S 6 mil millones a U$S 7 mil millones de dólares por año. Y eso tendrá un gran efecto multiplicador, también para Córdoba. Yo hice un solo desarrollo grande de gas (N.d.R.: Fortín de Piedra, en Vaca Muerta, con Tecpetrol) en el que trabajaron mil pymes de toda la Argentina. Lo tenemos mapeado. Imaginate lo que va a hacer esto. Y otra cosa: la contribución de la energía ayuda mucho al país a salir adelante para que luego entren otras industrias que tardan más en poder desarrollarse. Es un cebador natural económico para el país y para el trabajo.

–¿Y eso se traducirá en menores tarifas de energía, en general?

–Sí, por supuesto. A ver, el precio de la nafta es un valor internacional, el petróleo es una commodity, y si vos tratás de subsidiar petróleo o planchar el precio, ya sabés lo que pasó, no hay inversión. En gas, que no es commodity, cuando Argentina evolucione con el GNL, está claro que el precio interno será menor o igual. Con este proyecto aseguramos que haya energía barata. Habrá muchísimas posibilidades de desarrollo para las industrias.

–¿Y qué oportunidades hay en la cadena de valor para proveedores desde Córdoba?

–Para mí es gigante. Te lo digo simple, la cantidad de pozos que tiene YPF para perforar en toda la historia de Vaca Muerta son más de 15 mil. (Hay oportunidades para) todas las pymes, las empresas de metalmecánica, porque no viene todo de afuera, lo que vienen son herramientas de mucha tecnología. Cuando YPF llegue al pico, tiene que invertir billones de dólares por año para mantener la producción.

–Córdoba es la principal productora de maíz. ¿Miran algo en biocombustibles?

–Bueno, el biotanol es obligatorio en los cortes. Estamos cerca de generar YPF Bio, pero para exportar combustible para la aviación.

–El SAF (por las siglas en inglés de “sustainable aviation fuel”).

–Exacto. Tenemos una refinería básicamente abandonada en Santa Fe y llegamos a un acuerdo con una empresa que hace biocombustible. Quiero que operen ellos, que son los que saben de biocombustibles.

For air cargo charters in Australia, adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and verified carbon offsetting offers tangible ways to meet climate targets—while enhancing brand reputation and future-proofing logistics models.

This article explores how SAF is being adopted in charter freight, what carbon offsets mean in aviation, and how Australian businesses can make air transport more sustainable today.

1. What Is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, made from feedstocks like:

Waste oils (e.g., cooking oil, animal fats)

Agricultural residues

Municipal solid waste

SAF can reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% and is fully compatible with current aircraft engines (drop-in fuel). In Australia, major SAF providers include:

Qantas Biofuel Initiative

Gevo (imported supply)

BP & Neste partnerships at Brisbane Airport

2. SAF Use in Charter Freight Today

While SAF availability is still limited in Australia, several charter operators now:

Offer SAF-blended flights on request (e.g., 30–50% blend)

Partner with fuel providers at major hubs (Perth, Sydney, Brisbane)

Offer carbon declarations per flight to help clients assess scope 3 emissions

Note: SAF premiums currently add 10–30% to fuel cost, but may be tax-deductible under sustainability programs.

3. Carbon Offsetting Explained

If SAF isn’t available for your route, offsets provide an alternative. Offsetting means investing in certified climate projects that reduce or absorb emissions equal to your flight’s footprint. Common project types:

Renewable energy (wind, solar)

Reforestation & conservation

Indigenous fire management programs (Australia-specific)

Offset costs vary: ~$10–$30 per tonne of CO₂. A Perth → Darwin charter with a King Air (~2.1 tonnes CO₂) may cost ~$40–$60 to offset.

4. Choosing Verified Offset Programs

Make sure offsets are:

Gold Standard, VCS, or Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU) verified

Auditable with third-party certification

Preferably local or aligned with your corporate ESG goals

Some charter providers bundle offsets into quotes or offer opt-in tick boxes during booking.

5. Sustainability Checklist for Charter Clients

✅ Ask if SAF is available for your charter hub

✅ Request CO₂ emissions estimate for route & aircraft type

✅ Choose offset program that aligns with your brand or sector

✅ Ensure flight documents include emissions + SAF usage %

✅ Prefer blended fuel where 100% SAF is not available

“Les clients peuvent profiter des trajets à vide gratuitement pour eux ou des personnes qu’ils désignent”, indique Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore.","La société luxembourgeoise Jetfly se positionne sur le créneau des avions suisses Pilatus, à hélice ou à réaction. Pour en limiter l’impact environnemental, Jetfly propose d’acheter des carburants durables et, si possible, de partager les vols.

La Belgique est un pays plutôt ouvert aux avions d’affaires. On recense une petite centaine d’appareils, généralement utilisés par des entreprises et des particuliers – souvent entrepreneurs – qui apprécient la flexibilité de ce moyen de transport évitant les aérogares surpeuplés et les longues files d’attente. Une demi-heure après avoir garé la voiture, l’avion privé décolle de la zone d’aviation générale de Zaventem, d’Antwerpen-Deurne, de Kortrijk- Wevelgem ou de Brussels South Charleroi Airport.

Depuis octobre dernier, une société luxembourgeoise, Jetfly, propose des avions en propriété partagée sur le marché belge. “Nous avions déjà quelques clients gérés depuis Luxembourg”, précise Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore, qui développe le marché belge depuis la fin 2024. Jetfly compte actuellement 14 clients en Belgique, sur un total de 550 clients pour le groupe.

Le Pilatus à hélice, l’avion d’affaires le plus utilisé

La société Jetfly s’est concentrée sur les avions d’affaires fabriqués par le Suisse Pilatus. Le fabricant, connu pour ses avions d’entraînement capables d’atterrir sur des glaciers, s’est assuré un beau succès avec des petits avions d’affaires. Une niche dans laquelle s’est engouffrée Jetfly. Le modèle le plus vendu est le mono turbine PC-12, qui peut transporter six à huit passagers à plus de 500 km/h sur une distance qui peut dépasser les 2.000 km. Pour ceux qui veulent aller plus vite, Jetfly propose un biréacteur Pilatus PC-24 de huit places, volant à plus de 800 km/h, jusqu’à 3.300 km.

On est loin des avions d’affaires transatlantiques, des Falcon et des Gulfstream qui illustrent généralement les articles et les reportages télé sur ce type d’avionsl.

Ces avions couvrent en fait une bonne part des besoins. En Belgique comme en Europe, l’avion d’affaires le plus utilisé, selon l’association européenne du secteur (EBAA), est le mono turbine Pilatus PC-12. Il ne s’agit donc pas d’un jet, mais d’un avion à hélice à coût raisonnable, pouvant se poser sur des pistes en herbe. Il ne lui faut que 650 mètres de gazon pour atterrir, ce qui lui permet de se poser à des endroits inaccessibles aux jets privés : aéroclubs, altiport de Courchevel ou Spa la Sauvenière. “Cela lui permet d’atteindre des lieux éloignés des aéroports, explique Marion Fabiani, sales director pour la France et Monaco. Nous comptons des clients qui ont des équipes de motos ou de voitures, qui peuvent alors se poser très près des circuits de course. Des entrepreneurs de la distribution peuvent faire le tour, sur une journée, de plusieurs implantations situées dans des zones sans aéroports proches.”

La propriété partagée, mode d’emploi

La formule développée par Jetfly, depuis sa création en 2009, est la propriété partagée. “Nous proposons des parts dans un avion, à partir de 1/16e“, précise Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Pour un PC-12, cela représente un investissement de 500.000 dollars. S’ajoutent ensuite des frais de gestion qui incluent les assurances, la maintenance et les réparations, proportionnels au nombre d’heures de vol annuelles souscrites. Pour une part de 1/16e, cela peut aller de 15 à 35 heures de vol. Les vols sont réservés jusqu’à 24 heures à l’avance, et il reste à payer les frais de pilote et de vol (4.500 à 5.000 euros/heure pour un PC-12).

Jetfly commande l’avion et en vend les parts avant la livraison. Le contrat porte sur 10 ans, après quoi l’avion est revendu. “Les PC-12 gardent plutôt bien leur valeur : 40 et 50% de la valeur d’achat après 10 ans”, indique Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Il est possible de revendre la part après cinq ans.

Les clients sont directement (co)propriétaires de l’avion. Il ne figure pas dans le bilan de Jetfly, qui assure le service depuis l’achat, la vente des avions, leur maintenance, leur exploitation et la gestion des vols. Étant en copropriété, les avions ne sont pas personnalisables par les clients. Mais ils ne manquent pas pour autant de cachet, puisque leur intérieur et la livrée ont été conçus par Philippe Starck.

Les clients ne voyagent pas forcément avec “leur” avion. Jetfly attribue l’avion le plus proche du copropriétaire pour le jour de la réservation.

L’approche de la propriété partagée est très populaire aux États-Unis, où NetJets domine le marché avec des avions à réaction et est aussi actif en Europe. Jetfly, qui emploie 500 personnes, dont 250 pilotes, et réalise un chiffre d’affaires annuel de 200 millions d’euros, s’est concentrée sur l’Europe et les Pilatus. Elle assure la maintenance et la formation des pilotes et gère la plus grande flotte d’affaires d’Europe, avec 25 PC-12 et 12 PC-24 en copropriété. Les vols les plus fréquents en Belgique vont vers le Bourget (Paris), Genève, Nice ou Cannes-Mandelieu. Beaucoup de vols sont courts (Luxembourg).

Jetfly est dirigée par un tandem français, Cédric Lescop et Maxime Bouchard, respectivement CEO et CFO. L’actionnaire majoritaire est Jean-Pierre Millet, descendant du fondateur des vêtements sportifs Millet, et fondateur de Carlyle en Europe. En plus des avions en copropriété, la société assure aussi la gestion d’avions Pilatus pour le compte de personnes propriétaires à 100%.

Carburant durable

Les clients peuvent opter pour l’achat de carburant durable (Sustainable Aviation Fuel ou SAF), et ainsi réduire les émissions des vols, sujet délicat dans le monde des avions privés. Les avions peuvent voler avec un maximum de 50% de SAF, fabriqué par Neste à Rotterdam, à base d’huile de friture et de déchets animaux, réduisant ainsi jusqu’à 80% les émissions de CO2.

Comme ce carburant est plus cher que le kérosène, il faut rajouter 175 euros de l’heure de vol pour un Pilatus PC-12, ou 190 euros pour un jet PC-24. Acheter 100% de SAF coûte 345 euros par heure pour un PC-12. Le vol du client ne sera pas forcément réalisé avec du SAF, mais la quantité acquise sera achetée et utilisée par les autres avions Jetfly.

Vols à vide gratuits

Les perspectives de voir des avions zéro émission, volant à l’hydrogène ou en motorisation électrique, sont encore hypothétiques. La compagnie belge ASL vient d’annoncer l’achat d’un Microliner (fabriqué par Væridon), avion électrique d’affaires à neuf places parcourant 300 à 400 kilomètres. Le premier vol du prototype est prévu en 2027, et sa mise en service pourrait intervenir en 2030. Jetfly reste encore en retrait sur ce genre de projet qui doit encore faire ses preuves.

Le PC-12 reste l’un des avions d’affaires le plus propre. Jetfly estime réduire les émissions (et les coûts) en limitant les repositionnements des avions entre deux vols réservés et en favorisant l’utilisation des vols à vide. “Les clients peuvent profiter des trajets à vide gratuitement pour eux ou des personnes qu’ils désignent”, indique Jean-Baptiste Fabbricatore. Ils peuvent aussi accepter de partager le coût d’un vol en proposant des sièges sur un vol qu’ils ont réservé.","https://img.static-rmg.be/a/view/q75/w1600/h836/f50.00,50.00/7266860/img-2509-jpg.jpg",N,,2025-06-28 20:57:46.686988

Isola Moses | ConsumerConnect

Sequel to decades of silence when the unique aircraft operations were rested, iconic Concorde is about to return to become the world’s leading supersonic passenger aircraft once again.

Concorde is preparing to return to commercial skies by 2026, marking 50 years since its first historic flight.

ConsumerConnect learnt Fly-Concorde Limited aims to relaunch “supersonic passenger service” from the United States (US), under a groundbreaking aviation policy shift.

US President Donald Trump, June 6, 2025, at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD), through an Executive Order (EO), signed the “Concorde Bill”, lifting the long-standing ban on supersonic flight over land, Aviation A2Z report.

It is noted that the American country’s aviation regulatory reversal has unlocked a new era of innovation in high-speed, sustainable air travel.

Positioning US leadership in next-generation aerospace innovation, sustainability

The recent Executive Order has cleared the American regulatory airspace that had long blocked overland supersonic travel due to sonic boom and environmental concerns, report stated.

It was learnt the new aviation legislation positions the US as a leader in next-generation aerospace innovation and sustainability.

Some features of new Concorde

The new Concorde will remain true to its iconic silhouette, but will be 50 percent lighter and use advanced composite materials and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), cutting emissions by 80 percent, according to report.

The jet also will cruise at 60,000 feet, significantly higher than conventional commercial jets, while operating faster, quieter, and cleaner than the original.

The interior will reflect minimalist Japanese aesthetics, developed by leading sustainable architects.

Every feature, from cabin design to propulsion systems, will incorporate cutting-edge aerospace technologies rooted in decades of research and development.

On leadership, legacy and supersonic breakthroughs

Dr. Pano Kroko Churchill, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Founder of The Concorde Co., based in Washington State, in the US is at the helm of this supersonic revival, report noted.

Armed with a triple Ph.D from Oxford and expert physicist, Dr. Churchill is credited with solving the long-standing sonic boom challenge.

His patented Sonic Boom Suppression technology, granted in May 2025, enables Concorde to fly overland without disturbing ground-level communities.

Dr. Churchill is a direct descendant of Sir Winston Churchill, whose original Concorde initiative was launched as a post-World War II peace project.

Interestingly, his legacy continues through the rebirth of this aviation legend, targeted for launch on its 50th Anniversary.

Patricia Bader-Johnston, Vice-President and Chief Development Officer at Fly-Concorde Limited, was reported to have emphasised the aircraft’s broader vision.

Bader-Johnston said: “Concorde is set to become the global benchmark for sonic boom suppression and sustainability.”

Financial innovation

Besides the unique features of its new aircraft, Fly-Concorde is also innovating on the financial front.

The company has introduced Concorde Coin (CSSC), a stablecoin backed by Concorde’s aviation assets and operations.

It is also stated that with Blockchain technology gaining global traction, CSSC is designed to attract investors aligned with futuristic, environmentally responsible air travel ventures.

This digital currency initiative aims to fund development while enabling broader engagement in Concorde’s mission, report said.

Value of new Concorde brand

The move reflects growing synergy between aerospace advancement and decentralised finance.

Globally recognised as a pinnacle of aviation excellence, the Concorde brand is now valued at approximately $50 billion. The upcoming relaunch aims to restore its reputation as the epitome of luxury air travel, now aligned with modern values of environmental stewardship, digital innovation, and safety.

History of supersonic era

The Concorde, a joint marvel by British Airways (BA) and Air France (AF), revolutionised high-speed air travel with its supersonic performance. Operating primarily between London Heathrow (LHR), Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), and New York John F. Kennedy Airport (JFK), Concorde represented the peak of technological ambition in commercial aviation.

The aircraft’s inaugural transatlantic flight occurred on September 26, 1973, marking a new era of rapid travel.

Despite initial global fascination, the Concorde’s commercial future was constrained by high operational costs, limited routes, and its eventual involvement in a fatal accident in 2000.

Birth of a supersonic dream

It is recalled that Concorde’s development began with the 1962 treaty between France and the UK, aiming to share the cost and innovation challenges of producing a supersonic transport (SST).

British Aerospace and Aérospatiale collaborated on the aircraft’s frame, while Rolls-Royce and SNECMA developed its powerful Olympus 593 engines.

This cooperation marked a defining moment in European aerospace engineering, report noted.

After its maiden flight on March 2, 1969, the Concorde entered commercial service on January 21, 1976.

British Airways (BA) initially operated the London (LHR) to Bahrain route, and Air France (AF) flew from Paris (CDG) to Rio de Janeiro (GIG).

Shortly after, both airlines launched regular services to Washington Dulles (IAD) and New York JFK (JFK), offering transatlantic flights in under three and a half hours.

Although capable of cruising at Mach 2.04 (2,179 km/h), the Concorde was never economically viable.

Only 14 production aircraft entered commercial service, with persistent financial losses leading to route reductions until JFK remained the only regular destination.

The aircraft’s sonic boom and high noise levels also restricted route expansion.

The Tupolev Tu-144, the world’s first supersonic transport (SST) aircraft, was a milestone in Soviet aerospace engineering. Designed by legendary aircraft designer Andrey N. Tupolev and his son Alexey, the Tu-144 symbolised the USSR’s ambition to lead in high-speed aviation during the Cold War era.

First flown in December 1968 and surpassing Mach 1 in June 1969, the Tu-144 predated Concorde’s first supersonic flight.

It was publicly unveiled in Moscow in May 1970 and stood as a technological marvel with futuristic design elements and record-breaking performance.

Despite its technical achievements, the Tu-144’s career was marred by high-profile incidents, according to him.",https://consumerconnectng.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/facebook.png,N,,2025-06-28 16:01:24.164336
