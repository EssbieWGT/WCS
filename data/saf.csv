The job includes helping the agency get to its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, the same year Massport turns 75.
At the Barr Foundation, Horwood worked as director of its Boston Waterfront Initiative, which focused on promoting access and development focused climate resilience.
Overall, aviation fuel accounts for two to three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Davey.
“But still, we take care all of that, it’s only a 10 percent reduction of our own greenhouse gas emissions.","THE MASSACHUSETTS PORT Authority, which owns and operates high emissions-producing Logan International Airport, has hired its first chief climate and resilience officer.

The agency, also known as Massport, announced the hiring of Jill Valdes Horwood, who has worked for the Barr Foundation, a grant-making private foundation, and advocacy group Boston Harbor Now, as the new chief. The job includes helping the agency get to its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, the same year Massport turns 75.

“Jill brings a strong track record in climate policy and advocacy that will be critical as we continue our Net Zero initiatives and prepare for the long-term impacts of climate change,” Rich Davey, Massport’s CEO, said in a statement.

At the Barr Foundation, Horwood worked as director of its Boston Waterfront Initiative, which focused on promoting access and development focused climate resilience. She served as Boston Harbor Now’s director of policy, and she previously has done legal work for victims of domestic violence and underserved populations.

Aside from Logan Airport, Massport’s portfolio of facilities includes Worcester Regional Airport; Hanscom, an airfield 20 miles northwest of Boston; the Port of Boston’s Conley Terminal serving container ships; and the Flynn Cruiseport, which serves cruise ships.

Massport’s emissions come from a central heating plant, cargo handling equipment, its maritime facilities, emergency generators, and snow melters, among other machinery. But the largest generator of emissions is aviation fuel.

“Ninety percent of greenhouse gas emissions at Logan Airport come from aviation fuels,” Davey said during a recent talk to members of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM) at a local law firm. Overall, aviation fuel accounts for two to three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Davey.

“We’re doing all the things you would expect a manager of facilities to do. We’re changing our light bulbs, we’re buying electric vehicles, we’re putting in charging plug-ins for customers. We’re doing all that,” he said. “But still, we take care all of that, it’s only a 10 percent reduction of our own greenhouse gas emissions. So sustainable aviation fuel is still reasonably new and there are some promising technologies. We’ll see how far off they are.”

Massport is interested in helping the technology along. “We’re really focused on how we can scale it, how we can get some adoption going, at Hanscom for example, or at Worcester or Logan,” Davey said. “It’s exciting to be at the forefront of that question.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_Logan-Airport_Plane_Sunset.png,N,,2025-04-17 20:57:06.301742

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has received a Level 4 accreditation in the Airports Council International (ACI) Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program, the second-highest level awarded by ACI. “Level 4 recognizes an airport for measuring carbon emissions from both an airport authority and third parties operating on site, and for demonstrating emissions reduction progress,” said Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which runs LAX. LAX achieved Level 3 accreditation in 2017. “In 2023, a 26% reduction of [non-aeronautical] energy consumption per passenger at LAX from 2011 levels was achieved, two years ahead of LAWA's 2025 goal,” LAWA noted. Airports in the ACI APA program can ultimately achieve as high as a Level 5 accreditation, which means the airport has “reached net zero for emissions under their control and committed to full decarbonization across all scopes by 2050,” according to ACI.

Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport plans to build a new $1.5 billion passenger terminal. The facility—described by the National Airports Office of Morocco as a “hub-style terminal” aimed at facilitating connectivity—will have capacity to handle 20 million passengers annually. The project is targeted for a 2029 completion.

Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) was the busiest cargo airport in the world in 2024, according to Airports Council International World (ACI). HKG handled 4.9 million metric tons of cargo in 2024, up 14.1% year-over-year. ACI noted that combined volumes at the top 10 busiest cargo airports in the world in 2024—representing nearly 26% of global volumes—rose 9.3% year-over-year to 32.3 million metric tons. “The increase in cargo is attributed mainly to strong e-commerce demand, maritime shipping disruptions and declines in jet fuel price,” ACI said. Shanghai Pudong International Airport (3.8 million metric tons, up 9.8% over 2023) and FedEx base hub Memphis International Airport (3.7 million metric tons, down 3.3%) were the second- and third-busiest cargo airports in the world, respectively, in 2024, according to ACI. Four through 10 on the ACI busiest cargo airports list for 2024 were: Anchorage, UPS Airlines base hub Louisville, Seoul Incheon, Miami, Doha, Guangzhou and Taipei. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remained the busiest passenger airport in the world in 2024.

New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) will roll out trials of four full body scanners at security checkpoints in May. “These advanced scanners detect both metallic and non-metallic threats, including explosives, significantly improving upon traditional metal detectors,” DEL said. “The technology … enables rapid screening, with each scan taking just three seconds and a maximum throughput of 1,200 scans per hour, dramatically improving efficiency while minimizing passenger inconvenience.” The scanners generate a 2D image on a preset human avatar and images are not stored, DEL noted. The machines have already been installed—two in DELs Terminal 1 and two in Terminal 3. DEL said the trial of the four scanners will last 3-4 months, after which a committee will evaluate the findings and determine whether and how a full-scale implementation could be put in place. The airport noted similar scanners are being used at some major airports around the world, including in Australia and the U.S. DEL CEO Videh Kumar Jaipuriar said the machines are “a game-changer in security screening, allowing for faster and more effective checks without compromising privacy.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-17 12:57:09.336764

CORSIA requires airlines to purchase offsets for emissions above 2020 levels on international routes, effectively placing a price on carbon-heavy operations.

While CORSIA is a global step toward aviation decarbonization, its rollout raises tough questions: Who will pay for greener flying? And how will Indian carriers remain cost-competitive while absorbing higher operational costs? Answering such tough questions on carbon emissions airline leaders pooled together their thoughts at recently held India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025. Speaking on Air India Express’ objectives Aloke Singh, managing director, Air India Express said: “We have started a green flight program to optimize fuel consumption and reduce emissions.” But Singh also emphasized the need for robust planning: “It is vital to involve finance teams early to understand the cost implications of CORSIA compliance,” he added.

This concern over cost is echoed across the industry. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as a key enabler of low-carbon flight, currently costs five times more than traditional jet fuel, a pricing mismatch that makes large-scale adoption challenging without subsidies or policy incentives. In spite of this, industry leaders are optimistic. Aditya Ghosh, Co-Founder of Akasa Air and former President of IndiGo, believes India can play a pivotal role in reshaping the economics of green aviation: “India can play a leading role with respect to sustainable aviation fuel by plugging into the global supply chain opportunities.” However, he warned of a growing financial gap, adding: “There is a funding gap of around $350 million between traditional aviation fuel and a 10% SAF blend.”

This gap poses a serious question for airlines: Should passengers absorb this cost through ticket prices, or will governments and fuel producers step in to help bridge it? So, what does aviation need? The answer lies in Tech-Led innovation and policy reform.

Beyond SAF, Indian airlines are also investing in data-driven efficiencies and emerging aircraft technologies to reduce carbon intensity. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet, offered a forward-looking perspective: “We need to use technology advances like artificial intelligence and machine learning to find new ways to burn fewer fossil fuels. We need to aggressively pursue the development of electric aircraft for our future flying needs.” He further urged the government to foster a more supportive ecosystem: “India needs to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel and improve the business environment to make the sector globally competitive.”

These structural reforms, combined with strategic partnerships, could position India as both a hub for sustainable aviation and a leading voice in shaping equitable global climate policy.

As India’s aviation market is projected to become the world’s third-largest by 2030, the country has a unique opportunity to demonstrate how rapid growth can coexist with environmental responsibility. The transition won’t be easy: high fuel prices, regulatory compliance, and supply chain hurdles for SAF and offsets will require shared responsibility across the aviation value chain.

But with forward-thinking leadership, fleet investments, and a collaborative approach to sustainability, Indian aviation could become a case study in how to scale responsibly lifting passengers and carbon standards at the same time.",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/image/contentid/policy:1.10329823:1740314637/flight.jpg?$p=c600d7d&f=16x9&w=1080&q=0.8,N,,2025-04-17 14:56:41.401124

Problems at the facility have caused toxic chemical releases and a record air quality fine.

Its closure would mean Benicia would lose millions of dollars a year and hundreds of jobs.

It could also mean the price you pay for gas may rise dramatically.

RELATED: Valero may close Benicia refinery by next year, citing CA regulations and high costs

Valero has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to ""idle, restructure, or cease refining operations"" at the Benicia Refinery, drawing strong reactions across the state. UC Berkeley's Severin Borenstein is an expert in this field and has testified in front of lawmakers on refinery matters.

""It's quite disturbing that the refinery produces about 9% of the gasoline in California,"" Borenstein said.

According to a statement from the company, the refinery is seeking closure because of the high costs and strict environmental regulations in California.

""Certainly, one has to wonder how much this is a negotiating stance because they have recently seen a lot of pressure from the city of Benicia to change their operations,"" Borenstein said.

Denton Cinquegrana, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, gave his perspective on the future of the refinery.

""Closing the refinery is one of the options; they could also decide to reconfigure it to make it a facility to make something like renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said.

The real question here is if this refinery closes, will California gas prices rise?

""So yeah, it's gonna be a tight-rope and has the potential to swing prices potentially higher,"" Cinquegrana said.

Borenstein and Cinquegrana both point to the closure of the Phillips 66 Refinery in Southern California. They say that with another possible closure, the state must plan to import more gas to keep prices from rising too drastically.

""We just need to do it in a way that's not going to disrupt the supply-demand balance,"" Borenstein said. ""If we lose too many refineries too quickly, we're going to end up with a shortage, but we could very well see a 25 to 30 cent increase as a possibility.""

""The refinery is not scheduled to close for another year, so a lot can change in another year,"" Cinquegrana said.

There is a hope that the state and company work together on the matter, so drivers aren't impacted too much at the pump come next year.

Valery released this statement from Chairman, CEO and President Lane Riggs:

""Valero Energy Corporation announced today that its subsidiary, Valero Refining Company-California, has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations at Valero's Benicia Refinery by the end of April 2026.

Kim Reynolds announced she will not seek reelection for another term after nearly a decade as the 43rd governor of Iowa. Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) members sincerely thank Gov. Reynolds for her many years of leadership, especially for her success in advancing Iowa agriculture and renewable fuels.

“Today is a bittersweet day,” said IRFA Executive Director Monte Shaw. “While IRFA members are disappointed Gov. Kim Reynolds won’t be running for reelection, we have very fond memories of her many accomplishments. The Governor has been a tireless advocate for growing the state’s renewable fuels industry, championing nation-leading public policy that always pushes the needle.

Reynolds for her outstanding leadership in ensuring Iowa agriculture continues to feed and fuel the world today and long into the future.”

In her decade as Iowa’s chief executive, Gov. Reynolds led efforts to:

Establish the nation’s first E15 Access Standard, ensuring Iowa consumers have access to E15 which usually costs 15-20 cents less per gallon.

Create the nation’s first ever B20 and B30 retailer tax credits to maximize the use of biodiesel in Iowa.

Secure new regulations for 8 Midwest states from the U.S. EPA that allow E15 to be sold year-round.

Appropriate record funding for Iowa’s nation-leading Renewable Fuels Infrastructure Program (RFIP), a public-private cost-share program to help Iowa retailers install the equipment necessary to offer higher blends of ethanol and biodiesel to consumers.

Enact a first-of-its-kind E40 future proofing standard for Iowa fuel dispensing equipment, ensuring Iowa retailers will be ready when higher blends enter the marketplace. As a result, the two largest fuel pump manufacturers (representing over 90% of the market) have made E40 compatibility their base offering from coast-to-coast.

Shift Iowa’s renewable fuel tax differentials from low blends to E15 and B20 or higher blends, thereby increasing funds for Iowa’s roads and bridges while also driving greater renewable fuel sales.

Protect the federal renewable fuel standard (RFS) blending levels to grow demand for Iowa corn, soybeans and animal fats.

“I suppose some would mention Gov. Reynolds’ time as a high school cheerleader in an effort to undercut her,” added Shaw. “But I was always impressed with her inherit confidence. Rather than shy away from that, she leaned in. She knew who she was; she was Iowa’s cheerleader. She was the best cheerleader for Iowa farmers and renewable fuels producers you could ever hope for.

An old plane for a greener future

The original idea was to rehabilitate a light and reliable aircraft, suitable for an aeroclub's needs, while making it sustainable and environmentally friendly. This is how the Phoenix project was born. The team recently received the plane, a Jodel D119, a two-seat taildragger aircraft dating from 1958. It is a homebuilt aircraft, maintained by its previous pilot, accumulating about 2,000 flight hours. The purchase of the aircraft was made possible thanks to a $60,000 donation from the Howmet Aerospace Foundation. The original gasoline engine will be replaced by a Citroën C4 Picasso Diesel engine, modified to use SAF, a more ecological alternative to the typical fuel used for light aviation, Avgas 100LL.

Mathis Blanchard, co-leader of the project, explains: ""The challenge today for aviation is learning to fly cleanly. Through this project, we are exploring solutions on our scale.""

She added that in coordination with the Ministries of Petroleum and Civil Aviation, her ministry is working to develop a clear roadmap that supports this project, with stimulating investments and building partnerships with the private sector as its main pillars. She noted that this type of biofuel is a clean, safe alternative that meets international environmental standards.

She pointed out that selling or trading carbon certificates is not permitted except in accordance with specific controls and standards. Moreover, the Ministry of Petroleum has set emission reduction rates within the national contributions plan for several high-priority projects.

Discussing waste management, Fouad said that it is an area with plenty of green incentives and privileges available for investors under the investment law. Four areas where opportunities for effective private sector participation in investment are especially vast are: green hydrogen, electric transportation, waste management, and alternatives to single-use plastic bags.

Fouad revealed that the Waste Management Regulatory Agency will soon present a business model for using biofuel production inputs from used cooking oils, agricultural waste, and other sources. The model will determine economic feasibility and cost to ensure the sustainability of the field, and its long-term ability to attract investments, she said.

For his part, Minister El-Hefny underlined the importance of localizing SAF production in Egypt following international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

He added that establishing the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company is a major milestone in the journey towards leading this promising industry in Africa.

El-Hefny praised the pivotal role played by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources with its advanced expertise in the fields of refining and energy. It is greatly contributing to supporting local and international high-quality production. He also said that a comprehensive feasibility study is crucial. It should include technical, economic, and operational aspects, and be approved by the concerned authorities.

Equally important is the development of effective logistical mechanisms to ensure the efficiency of the supply and distribution chain, both within Egyptian airports and internationally. This would guarantee high performance and sustainability.

During the meeting, Chairman of ECHEM, Ibrahim Mekki, noted that ESAF, a first-of-its-kind project in Africa and the Middle East, relies on a modern, internationally-approved technology to produce SAF from used cooking oil.

He noted that creating a joint follow-up team from the three concerned ministries is a catalyst for the project’s implementation and the maximization of its economic and environmental returns.

During the meeting, Tamer Heakal, Chairman of ESAF, reviewed the project’s business plan, objectives, and implementation procedures.

Production is planned to meet local demand and support exports to global markets. The project spans an area of 100,000 square meters near the Dekheila Port, Heakal noted.

He revealed that selecting a manufacturing license and an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is still in progress. Additionally, the selection process of international financing agencies is underway and is seeing notable progress. Similarly, efforts to market the project’s output to global companies and secure input from used cooking oil are advancing steadily, according to Haekal.

He concluded by further reviewing the necessary support to accelerate the project and yield the highest profits possible through the combined efforts of the Ministries of Environment and Civil Aviation.",https://egyptoil-gas.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/490674920_986254943689477_2330941780082433607_n-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 11:58:15.262514

But with the challenges of geopolitics, ever-changing regulations, and the need to adapt to disruptions, supply chain leaders are rethinking operations on many levels.

At Microsoft, prioritizing sustainable practices with suppliers has also helped us uncover new opportunities for innovation and cost optimization.

Our new guide, Reduce Risk, Create Resilience: Advancing Supply Chain Sustainability, outlines how data intelligence and collaboration can transform supply chains to be more agile, sustainable, and resilient. We offer lessons from our own experience as we strive to meet our ambitions to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030, all while protecting ecosystems. And we provide actionable insights and practical steps to help customers address reporting pressures, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities for innovation, ultimately driving resilience and long-term value.

Aligning data and systems for the road ahead

Organizations are facing growing regulations and customer expectations to prioritize sustainable practices. To make meaningful change, organizations and their suppliers must share data and work together to address challenges across the ecosystem.

Advanced analytics and AI are transforming supply chain sustainability at Microsoft. By leveraging these technologies, we accelerate day-to-day work, gain real-time insights, and drive co-innovation to meet sustainability reporting requirements as well as business continuity needs.

For instance, our procurement team used Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to centralize supplier emissions data and streamline processes. By integrating AI-powered automation, such as automated review of supplier assurance letters, we reduced survey processing time by 92%.

Eckes-Granini, a European producer of name-brand fruit juices, is committed to ensuring that all its raw ingredients are sustainably sourced by 2030. The company used Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform including Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to connect to essential data sources and create precise visualizations of suppliers’ progress. This enables Eckes-Granini to track risks and follow up with suppliers accordingly. Now almost 70% of Eckes-Granini’s juice ingredients meet sustainability standards, and the company is better prepared to respond to Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.

Choosing carbon-free electricity solutions

Carbon-free electricity (CFE), such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, can be a powerful lever for decarbonization, helping companies achieve up to 50% of their decarbonization goals through improved fuel efficiency and reduce exposure to varying fuel prices.1 2 Organizations can help scale the benefits of CFE in supply chains by launching supplier enablement programs.

To help meet our own carbon reduction targets, Microsoft now requires suppliers to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity for the goods and services delivered to Microsoft by 2030. We’re making this easier for suppliers through our Supplier REach Portal, co-created with 3Degrees, to streamline access and procurement of CFE; and Zettawatts’ Supplier CFE Program, to provide assistance for reaching our CFE requirement, from understanding CFE procurement to discussing goals, developing plans and budgets, and reviewing agreements.

Turkish energy company Enerjisa Üretim established a round-the-clock remote operation center that receives more than 50,000 signals per second from its large network of hydropower, wind, and solar plants. It processes the data using an Azure-based solution including Azure IoT Hub, Azure Digital Twins, and Azure Machine Learning. The solution delivers real-time monitoring and data analytics on power plant performance—all in one centralized location. It also uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to forecast future outcomes, predicting average daily production for turbines for up to two months.

Creating new value from resource optimization

The World Economic Forum estimates that adopting circular business models could unlock up to USD4.5 trillion in value by 2030.3 By adopting circularity, companies can not only help meet regulatory requirements but also drive new innovation, enhance their brand reputation, and differentiate their business.

With a focus on the long-term value of resources, companies can uncover ways to reduce environmental impact while also increasing value for the business. Supply chains are central to this opportunity.

To help meet our goal of becoming a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft set a target of reusing or recycling 90% of our cloud hardware by 2025. We not only reached that target a year early—we exceeded it. In 2024, we reached a 90.9% reuse and recycling rate of our cloud servers and components.

Within our global datacenters, Microsoft Circular Centers are foundational to this work, enabling us to process and route decommissioned servers and hardware components to their next useful lives, such as internal reuse, other electronic supply chains, or academies that train datacenter technicians.

Reinventing supply chain logistics

Supply chain logistics challenges are bigger than any one company. To meet growing regulatory and market pressures, organizations need to leverage data and AI technology across their ecosystems and industries. Sharing data at a more granular level, they can identify opportunities to improve infrastructure and boost sustainability across whole logistics networks.

Applying this principle, Microsoft has moved our cloud supply chain to renewable diesel in our road freight operations in Europe and California while keeping existing equipment in use.

We’re also advancing aviation decarbonization by integrating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into shipments of cloud hardware. Through multi-year agreements, we’re working to reduce air freight emissions and help scale the adoption of SAF across the industry.3

Results so far include:

50% lower emissions for road freight operations in Europe and California, using renewable diesel.

17,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) saved through SAF, compared to conventional transportation fuels.

73% lower relative carbon intensity of our cloud logistics supply chain since 2022 through lower-carbon transportation and logistics consolidation.

(Jet Zero) has moved into the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase for its planned Project Ulysses, a grassroots development involving construction of a renewable fuels plant in the Townsville State Development Area of North Queensland, Australia (OGJ Online, Dec. 23, 2024).

Following preliminary agreements in December 2024, Jet Zero in April finalized award of a contract to Technip Energies (T.EN) for delivery of FEED services on the project that, if completed, will be equipped to produce 102 million l./year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 11 million l./year of renewable diesel from a feedstock of Australian bioethanol, Jet Zero and T.EN said in separate releases.

T.EN’s scope of work under the contract covers an extensive package of engineering activities, documentation, and planning, all aimed at refining a cost estimate and detailed timelines for the project, the service provider said on Apr. 16.

Alongside the FEED contract award, Jet Zero also confirmed continuance of an engineering services contract with Melbourne-based Long Energy and Resources (Aust) Pty. Ltd. (LERA), which will provide specialist project management and owner engineering services to assure FEED engineering is delivered to Jet Zero’s design philosophy and in compliance with the FEED contract.

Award of the T.EN and LERA contracts—each of which are anticipated to run for several months—to complete Project Ulysses’ estimated $36.8-million (Aus.; $22.1-million) FEED program was made possible through crucial funding support from Jet Zero’s investors and industry partners, the operator said.

External partners supporting the project include aviation affiliates Airbus SE and Qantas Airways Ltd., as well as Japanese petroleum producer and refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd.

Financial support for Project Ulysses also came from the government of Australia via Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program and the Queensland government’s Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, which together awarded Jet Zero a combined $14 million (Aus.) in late 2024 to help take project development through the FEED stage into final investment decision (FID), Jet Zero said in a release dated Oct. 9, 2024.

Additional project details

Slated to become Australia’s first alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) low-carbon liquid fuels production (LCLF) plant by its targeted startup in late 2027 or early 2028, Project Ulysses will use LanzaJet Inc.’s proprietary ATJ technology that incorporates T.EN’s patented Hummingbird technology for converting a feedstock of Australian bioethanol to ethylene, the latter of which will subsequently be transformed—using LanzaJet’s oligomerization and hydrogenation technology—into SAF and renewable diesel, according to Jet Zero and ARENA.

An official project description from ARENA indicated the FEED study for Project Ulysses is due for completion by Jan. 1, 2026.

Should Jet Zero take positive FID on the development, Project Ulysses will be operated by Ulysses Bioenergy Pty.

In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.
Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.
And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.
Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now.","Minnesota’s electric grid is cleaner than ever, and the state is well positioned to take advantage of emerging energy industries, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said Thursday.

But federal policy chaos — driven by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and general preference for fossil fuels — as well as shifting consumer behavior and lagging implementation of environmentally friendly technologies hint at bigger challenges ahead for one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state’s economy, analysts and industry representatives said at a Monday press briefing.

“Certainly there’s a lot going on right now…that makes predicting the future and [even] predicting today a little bit unsteady,” said Becky Wacker, director of energy services sales in North America for Trane Technologies.

The U.S. power sector saw a “dramatic transformation” in recent years thanks to falling costs for wind and solar power, state clean energy policies and long-term clean power purchase commitments by tech giants like Amazon and Google, said Derrick Flakoll, Bloomberg NEF senior policy associate. In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.

More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spurred investment in nascent clean-tech industries like low-emissions hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, which airlines and jet manufacturers see as key to their long-term sustainability goals. CEEM’s factsheet touted the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit, which pays $1.50 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced and sold in Minnesota through June 2030, and a biofuels startup’s plan to build a $5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant in Moorhead that could eventually produce nearly 200 million gallons of fuel each year.

These investments “now face significant market risk” due to the Trump administration’s hefty — and self-contradictory — import tariffs, and the very real possibility that Congress narrows or repeals key IRA tax credits later this year.

“The fate of this is hanging in the balance (due to) a lot of political and economic factors,” Flakoll said.

State-level policy looks steadier in the near term, Wacker said. That could be a silver lining for HVAC and refrigeration businesses like Trane, which has rebranded itself as a leader in building efficiency and decarbonization.

“A number of states are staying pretty consistent in how they’re approaching things,” she said.

Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. A 2021 law that boosted utility-led efficiency programs saved residents and businesses more than $307 million over two years, CEEM said.

But Minnesota’s ambitious efficiency and sustainability policies haven’t translated into action to the extent seen in nation-leading states and cities, Wacker said. She nodded to Washington state, which will begin holding larger buildings to strict sustainability standards next year; and New York City, where Local Law 97 encourages landlords to swap out creaky boilers for efficient heat pumps.

On electric vehicle uptake, Minnesota lags the national trendline. New registrations fell 44% from 2023 to 2024, slipping below 10,000, as EV sales grew 6.5% nationally, CEEM found. Minnesota had 65,679 plug-in EVs on its roads in November 2024, according to CEEM — less than 2% of total light-duty vehicle registrations. Plug-in vehicles accounted for 1 in 4 vehicle registrations last year in California, the top U.S. EV market, though the total share of EV registrations there remains far lower.

And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.

“That’s a little different from past years, when we had a combination of wind and solar [added to the grid],” said Cathy Liebowitz, director of member engagement for CEEM.

Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now. Most of the windiest areas already have working turbines; solar farm construction costs are rapidly declining; and the massive scale of the typical wind project can complicate projects, he said.

State lawmakers passed a major energy permitting reform bill last year that could accelerate approvals for large-scale wind and solar installations, but the law won’t take effect until July.

Despite the wind slowdown, CEEM’s latest factsheet had some qualified good news for Minnesota utility customers. The average consumer paid 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, up 1.2% from 2023 and 30% from 2015, CEEM said. But that’s lower than the 2024 national average of 12.99 cents per kilowatt-hour — up 2.4% from 2023.

Minnesotans should blame the aging electric grid and volatile natural gas prices for steadily rising electricity rates, rather than wind and solar farms, Liebowitz and Flakoll said.

Transmission and distribution grid infrastructure account for 63% of the $45 billion Xcel Energy plans to invest through 2029, compared with 11% for renewable power, the utility said in November.

“The grid is old in general, so updating it regardless of whether it’s clean or not is something states are working on,” Liebowitz said.

Meanwhile, the actual cost of generating power is closely correlated with natural gas prices because gas-fired power plants tend to be the “last” units called on to meet demand, Flakoll said.

“If you rely on natural gas at the margin, you are going to affect bills,” he said. “To say renewables are the driving force behind these electricity rate increases would be overly simplistic and probably not true.”

With more than 1,900 delegates in attendance, this year’s edition drilled into the industry's top priorities: digital transformation, sustainability, and resilience.

From geopolitical disruptions to supply chain pressure and green targets, the air cargo sector is being reshaped—and WCS Dubai served as a platform to align ambition with action.

Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, set a serious tone, emphasising that “civil aviation must never be used as a pawn in geopolitical disputes,” while underlining the need for compliance and accountability in handling dangerous goods like lithium batteries. Safety, he stressed, cannot be compromised.

UAE Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, welcoming delegates to Dubai, pointed to the aviation sector's central role in the country’s economic growth, contributing 13% to the national GDP, and highlighted the UAE’s bold push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy solutions.

There was no shortage of ambition on display. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, called data the most transformative force in air cargo today. “Because of digitalisation, we’re able to secure critical shipments and push the industry toward full automation,” he said. Still, he voiced concern over the high costs of e-SAF and the challenges ahead for net-zero goals.

Executives from dnata, Emirates SkyCargo, Cathay Cargo, and Kuehne+Nagel shared a candid look at how the industry is navigating its digital shift. Badr Abbas, Emirates’ new Divisional SVP for Cargo, and Clive Sauvé-Hopkins, CEO Airport Operations at dnata, emphasised Dubai’s growing influence as a logistics hub—powered by advanced cargo infrastructure and investments in sustainability.

From predictive AI in inventory management to the adoption of IATA ONE Record, digitalisation took centre stage. Speakers urged that tech-led transformation needs to extend beyond airlines and reach every node in the cargo chain—from ground handlers to freight forwarders.

Alina Fetisova, from the International Trade Centre, raised an important warning: “40% of young professionals are leaving the industry because of outdated systems.” Attracting and retaining talent, she noted, must be part of any digital strategy.

On the economic front, Maja Marciniak, Senior Economist at IATA, forecast a 6% growth in cargo demand for 2025. While yields remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, she cautioned that the net-zero transition is straining financial performance, and called for greater support from regulators and the value chain.

As the symposium concluded, one thing was clear: air cargo is no longer just about moving goods. It’s about moving faster, smarter, and greener. With global trade dynamics shifting and pressure for transparency growing, the industry is preparing for the future—with innovation at its core.

Looking ahead, IATA announced that WCS 2026 will take place in Lima, Peru, marking the event’s first appearance in South America—a nod to the growing global footprint of air cargo.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/17/81119-1500-x-900-39.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 12:57:26.415018

Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene.
Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.","This week the ECO2Fly project offered an insight into how captured CO2 emissions from a cement plant could be reused in the production of synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF). Holcim's Villaluenga de la Sagra plant is capturing CO2 for this project. Meanwhile, Europe is leading the way in pioneering this type of project with further trials being carried out at the Ruedersdorf and Schwenk plants in Germany as well as methane generation at Finnsementti Oy.

ECO2Fly involves a partnership of Holcim, IGNIS P2X and Exolum. The Villaluenga de la Sagra plant in Toledo, Spain, is aiming to capture 0.7Mta of CO2 and it will combine this with green hydrogen developed from renewable energy, which can then be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. The project could see 10,0000tpa of aviation fuel produced, but Holcim will still need to permanently store any remaining captured CO2 in geological repositories. It is expected that the first decade of the ECO2Fly project will reduce CO2 emissions by 6.5Mt. However, the company is still waiting to submit a request for the European Union Innovation Funding in the next call-out, but global investment firm KKR has injected EUR400m to extend the timeline and scope of ECO2Fly and the green initiatives of Ignis P2X.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonisation of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction.”

Additional carbon utilisation projects with cement industry input

There are further e-SAF projects under development that will involve the cement sector. The European Commission has granted a EUR350m grant to the company, Concrete Chemicals, to produce 30,000t e-SAF annually from 2028. Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene. Initially, the project has targeted 100t of captured CO2 to combine with 12t of hydrogen produced at Rüdersdorf. In the second stage, larger quantities of hydrogen will be supplied by pipeline. The green hydrogen production is part of the ENERTRAG-IPCEI 'Electrolysis Corridor East Germany' project, which will have an electrolysis capacity of 210MW and 35,000t of e-Kerosene annually.

Meanwhile, Schwenk Zement, Stuttgart Airport and SkyNRG have teamed up in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, to aid the STRzero climate strategy. Stuttgart Airport is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2040 and its STRzero plan involves working with Schwenk Zement’s Heidenheim-Mergelstetten plant and SkyNRG to produce 50,000tpa of e-SAF. The three partners are contributing EUR1m to the project which is targeting e-fuel production in 2028.

“For the cement industry, the project is of enormous importance, because the meaningful use of carbon dioxide from the exhaust air of cement plants as a raw material is a major contribution to climate protection,” said Thomas Spannagl, CEO of Schwenk Zement.

A third project is participated in by Finnsementti Oy’s plant in Lappeennranta, Finland. Started in 2019, the collaboration with the Kemira chemical plant in Joutseno aimed to produce 270,000tpa of synthetic methanol. Methanol can be used to create petrol, kerosence or diesel. Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.",https://www.cemnet.com/images/opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 09:58:37.587413

FincoEnergies joins FuelEU compliance market

London, 16 April (Argus) — Netherlands-based fuel supplier FincoEnergies has launched a pooling service to help shipowners comply with FuelEU Maritime requirements. The service will enable undercompliant ships to meet their FuelEU requirements by pooling them with vessels that run on marine biodiesel supplied by FincoEnergies' own GoodFuels brand. The pooling service is also based on a partnership with maritime classification organisation Lloyd's Register, the company said. FincoEnergies said it will take the role of ""pool organiser"". The FuelEU Maritime regulation, which came into effect this year, sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets of 2pc for vessels travelling in or out of Europe. The reduction jumps to 6pc from 2030 and gradually reaches 80pc by 2050. The pooling mechanism built into FuelEU Maritime allows shipowners to combine vessels to achieve overall compliance across the pool, enabling a system by which compliance can be traded. Argus assessed the values of FuelEU Ucome-MGO abatement and Ucome-VLSFO abatement, prices which can be used as a metric to value compliance, at an average of $302.56/t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and $337.46/tCO2e, respectively, so far this year.

Funding cuts could delay US river lock work: Correction

Corrects lock locations in paragraph 5. Houston, 14 April (Argus) — The US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) will have to choose between various lock reconstruction and waterway projects for its annual construction plan after its funding was cut earlier this year. Last year Congress allowed the Corps to use $800mn from unspent infrastructure funds for other waterways projects. But when Congress passed a continuing resolutions for this year's budget they effectively removed that $800mn from what was a $2.6bn annual budget for lock reconstruction and waterways projects. This means a construction plan that must be sent to Congress by 14 May can only include $1.8bn in spending. No specific projects were allocated funding by Congress, allowing the Corps the final say on what projects it pursues under the new budget. River industry trade group Waterways Council said its top priority is for the Corps to provide a combined $205mn for work at the Montgomery lock in Pennsylvania on the Ohio River and Chickamauga lock in Tennessee on the Tennessee River since they are the nearest to completion and could become more expensive if further delayed. There are seven active navigation construction projects expected to take precedent, including the following: the Chickamauga and Kentucky Locks on the Tennessee River; Locks 2-4 on the Monongahela River; the Three Rivers project on the Arkansas River; the LaGrange Lock on the Illinois River; Lock 25 on the Mississippi River; and the Montgomery Lock on the Ohio River. There are three other locks in Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois that are in the active design phase (see map) .

IMO GHG pricing not yet Paris deal-aligned: EU

Brussels, 14 April (Argus) — The International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism ""does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals"", the European Commission has said. ""Does it have everything for everybody? For sure, it doesn't,"" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the commission's climate and energy spokesperson said. ""This is often the case as an outcome from international negotiations, that not everybody gets the most optimal outcome."" The IMO agreement reached last week will need to be confirmed by the organisation in October, the EU noted, even if it is a ""strong foundation"" and ""meaningful step"" towards net zero GHG emissions in global shipping by 2050. The commission will have 18 months following the IMO mechanism's formal approval to review the directive governing the bloc's emissions trading system (ETS), which currently includes maritime emissions for intra-EU voyages and those entering or leaving the bloc. By EU law, the commission will also have to report on possible ""articulation or alignment"" of the bloc's FuelEU Maritime regulation with the IMO, including the need to ""avoid duplicating regulation of GHG emissions from maritime transport"" at EU and international levels. That report should be presented, ""without delay"", following formal adoption of an IMO global GHG fuel standard or global GHG intensity limit. Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, told Argus that the EU's consideration of whether the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough won't be until ""well after October"". Commenting on the IMO agreement, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) pointed to the ""neutral"" approach to feedstocks, including first generation biofuels. ""The EBB welcomes this agreement, where all feedstocks and pathways have a role to play,"" EBB secretary general Xavier Noyon said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-governmental organisation Transport and Environment, called for better incentives for green hydrogen. ""The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels. But unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,"" he said.

Malaysian Fathopes to reach SAF plant FID by 1Q 2026

Singapore, 14 April (Argus) — Malaysian biofuel feedstock supplier Fathopes Energy's planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant will reach a final investment decision (FID) in the first quarter of 2026, it said. Intital engineering design will be done from July to December 2025, Fathopes' director Eddy Leong said at an event on 10 April, speaking on behalf of the company's chief executive Vinesh Sinha. The plant's capacity is unconfirmed. Fathopes signed an initial agreement at the event with testing, inspection and certification company AmSpec Group. They aim to identify, assess and document feedstocks across Asia-Pacific, Australia and New Zealand that can be used at the planned plant. The agreement will take effect from 1 June. Besides used cooking oil (UCO), other waste feedstocks such as palm oil mill effluent (Pome) oil and spent bleaching earth oil (SBEO) will be explored. Fathopes will take the lead in collecting feedstock samples, while AmSpec will analyse their suitability for SAF production. Amspec will help develop an on-site SAF laboratory at the plant to ensure compliance with industry standards and environmental regulations. Fathopes had signed an initial agreement with Danish technology firm Topsoe in February, in which Topsoe agreed to provide catalysts and engineering expertise to assess feasibility of building the refinery.

Earth Day 2025 serves as a global call to action, highlighting the urgent need to transition towards renewable energy solutions. The theme, “Our Power, Our Planet,” reinforces the connection between clean energy and a sustainable future, urging industries worldwide to accelerate their decarbonisation efforts.

Aviation and corporate travel remain essential for global business and connectivity, yet they contribute significantly to carbon emissions. While reducing travel altogether would be the most sustainable option, for many businesses and industries, flying remains a necessity. This is particularly true for sectors like marine, energy, and sports, where travel is critical to operations.

To address this challenge, the aviation industry must look beyond carbon measurement tools—which report on emissions but do not mitigate them—and focus on practical solutions for emissions reduction, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF represents a key pathway to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel while ensuring essential mobility continues.

Why Aviation Needs Alternative Energy Solutions

Aviation accounts for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, making it a priority sector for decarbonisation. While emerging technologies such as hydrogen and electric aircraft hold long-term promise, SAF is the most viable and scalable solution available today to reduce aviation emissions.

SAF is produced from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, SAF is a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring infrastructure modifications.

Despite its benefits, widespread adoption of SAF faces challenges related to availability, production scaling, and cost. Greater industry commitment and corporate action are essential to drive demand and investment in SAF production, just as policy support.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Corporate Travel

For businesses committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions—which include travel-related emissions—SAF presents an immediate opportunity to make meaningful reductions. Corporate travel policies can integrate SAF procurement alongside other sustainability initiatives, such as optimising travel schedules, reducing unnecessary trips and investing in verified offset programmes.

Neste is the world’s leading producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has partnered with ATPI to help businesses reduce their travel-related emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is in commercial use today and available at a growing number of key airports worldwide, and can also be accessed via the ATPI x Neste partnership.

Key benefits of SAF:

Immediate carbon reductions – Up to 80% lower GHG emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel.

Ready to be used – SAF can be used in existing aircraft and refuelling systems.

Scalable for corporate travel – Businesses can incorporate SAF procurement into travel policies.

Driving Corporate Action: Business Travel & SAF

While airlines and governments play a role in scaling SAF, corporate buyers also have the power to accelerate adoption by integrating SAF into their travel programmes. ATPI and Neste provide solutions such as Neste Impact, a book-and-claim system aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) standards. This allows businesses to purchase SAF and claim emissions reductions even if the fuel is not available at their departure airports.

How Businesses Can Take Action Today:

Set concrete emissions reduction targets to track and reduce the impact of business travel.

Incorporate SAF into travel programmes to enable immediate, credible emissions reductions.

Use carbon measurement tools to monitor travel activity and inform sustainability decisions.

ATPI x Neste: A Shared Commitment to Decarbonisation

Through their partnership, ATPI and Neste are working to empower businesses to make low-carbon travel choices and support the shift towards renewable energy in aviation.

UK LCC easyJet Director General Javier Gándara, TUI director of communications for airlines, hotels and cruises, Aage Dünhaupt, and Aena head of environmental sustainability, Susana Gallart Peñas, discussed aviation sustainability last week during a conference panel at Routes Europe 2025 in Seville.

All were asked how confident they were in the air transport industry being able to achieve the self-imposed net zero goal after IATA Director General Willie Walsh acknowledged earlier this year that the 2050 target may slip because of government policies and the lack of SAF.

But the panelists remained optimistic.

“I think it will still be possible. Thirty years ago, people were saying flying would not be affordable and now it is. We have a clear roadmap,” easyJet’s Gándara said. “SAF is something that will be important in the short, medium and long term. At easyJet, we are working with Airbus on developing a hydrogen-powered, zero-emissions aircraft. The problem is with regulators. They have to have political courage. They have to work to get SAF production scaled up and to address issues like action on the [European Union air traffic management modernization] Single European Sky.”

Aena’s Gallart Peñas, whose company manages 46 airports and two heliports in Spain and participates directly and indirectly in the management of some 16 airports in Europe and the U.S., agreed—but she also stressed the time to move the dial on aviation sustainability is running short.

“2050 must be possible, but the next five years will be critical for us,” she said. “I think we have just five years to change things.”

TUI’s Dünhaupt added: “You have to be ambitious, and when you have targets, they should be ambitious. But we don’t want to change the behavior of flying. We need politicians’ support for things to happen, and SAF is a big part of the solution. But we also need to do some honest stock-taking, and if there’s not enough SAF, we need to move the [net zero] target to the right.”

Dünhaupt also said that North American sustainability policy would be different under U.S. President Donald Trump and that it is important that competitive playing fields remain level across the air transport industry, which is global, as sustainability rules and mandates come into effect.

Gándara agreed. “The biggest challenge is that sustainability doesn’t affect air travel affordability,” he said. Gándara also emphasized that European regulators are missing “a huge opportunity for Europe to become energy self-sufficient” if they do not take action on scaling up SAF production.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-17 06:56:07.952261

“If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express.
According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%.
For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.","India, now the world’s third-largest aviation market, is responsible for 2.5% of global emissions but contributes just about 1% of national carbon emissions—below the global average. Yet, this relatively benign share masks a fast-growing challenge. With air travel demand projected to grow exponentially, emissions are set to rise in tandem.

Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of SpiceJet, put it bluntly at a panel discussion hosted by MakeMyTrip Foundation's India Travel and Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025: “Sustainability clearly was not on [the airlines’] minds” during the COVID-19 pandemic, when survival was paramount. But as recovery takes hold, Singh adds, “Sustainability will again be front and centre... but it has to make economic sense.” The cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is 2.5 times the cost of conventional fuel, is simply unaffordable for most carriers. “You can’t pass that on to consumers... they will not pay that kind of money,” says Singh.

Experts at the panel also feared that with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set to become mandatory in 2027, airlines will face additional cost burdens if SAF production doesn’t ramp up. Yet, there is no mature carbon offset market in India today. “We’re doing nothing,” Aditya Ghosh, co-founder of Akasa Air admitted candidly while other panellists agreed. “And we’re just two years away from CORSIA kicking in.”

CORSIA is a global initiative led by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Starting in 2027, it enters a mandatory phase for most major aviation nations. Under the scheme, airlines will need to offset any carbon emissions that go beyond their 2020 levels by buying approved carbon credits.

“CORSIA has set impossible targets. It tries to limit countries to the emission levels of the number of aircraft that they had in 2020. That has to be opposed,” said Singh.

“The 2027 CORSIA targets are unrealistic and unfair for countries like India. We will continue to work with ICAO and see that these norms are not unfair to developing countries and not biased towards developed countries,” he added.

In tune, Aloke Singh, managing director of Air India Express, said that CORSIA will pose a significant burden on airlines. “If the SAF production gets further delayed, the burdens of carbon offset, due to CORSIA, will rise further.”

CAPA’s CEO Kapil Kaul, who moderated the session, opined that given that none of the Indian carriers are ready to meet the targets set under CORSIA, it’s possible the target could be deferred.

Where SAF Stands

SAF has emerged as the only viable short-term lever for reducing aviation emissions. The good news is that India has shown technical capability. SpiceJet, for instance, flew India’s first SAF-powered flight in 2018—from Dehradun to Delhi—using fuel made in a laboratory at the Indian Institute of Petroleum. “The engines don’t need to be modified. It works just really well,” Singh emphasised.

Trending Stories

But the barriers to commercial scaling are immense. Current SAF production is just 0.53% of total fuel consumption globally, and even in Europe—the leader in SAF adoption—KLM and Air France clock just 0.84% and 0.42% respectively. According to CAPA India’s internal assessment, the world is more than 5 million tonnes short annually of the SAF needed to hit 2030 targets.

Ghosh argued that India actually has a unique opportunity: “India now has about 160 million tonnes of feedstock... which can be used for SAF production. Ironically, we have a chance to become a net SAF exporter.” But for that to happen, “you have to identify the feedstock, build manufacturing, logistics and treat this as an export-focused sector.”

The challenge, then, is not technical feasibility but economic and logistical scale. Singh noted that the cost of building even one SAF unit—like the pilot project at Panipat with IOCL—was just ₹150 crore. “These are not large sums of money,” he said, “but the political will is missing.” According to Ghosh, government support in the form of viability gap funding could kickstart production, just as it did for electric bus infrastructure in India.

Targets and the Reality Check

India’s SAF blending target—1% by 2025, increasing to 2% by 2027 and 5% by 2030—is far too modest, the panellists unanimously agreed. “If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express. He added, “The sum of money required isn’t humongous. Just let them blend more.”

Yet, scaling SAF isn't only about blending targets. There's also a technological bottleneck. Of the 13 ASTM-approved pathways for SAF production, only a few have been commercialised. “80% of SAF facilities globally are using hydrotreatment technology,” pointed out Kaul. “Other technologies are not getting clearances or are still in the research phase.”

Economics Over Environment

One of the core dilemmas underscored was that while sustainability measures tend to align with cost savings in areas like engine efficiency and operational performance, they become a burden when it comes to SAF.

“There’s no free lunch,” said Singh of Air India Express. “If we don’t pay as industry, the taxpayer will pay. If the consumer doesn’t pay, someone has to pay.” Today, sustainable alternatives drive up costs rather than bringing them down, which reverses the economics that previously spurred efficiency in aviation.

The industry is currently relying on gradual efficiency gains—about 2 to 2.5% annually over the last few decades—through better engines, newer aircraft, and improved operational techniques. “Per passenger emissions have halved since I joined the industry,” shared Singh, “and that was when sustainability wasn’t even a buzzword—it was driven purely by economics.”

Small Gains Matter, But Are They Enough?

Several small but significant practices—like continuous descent operations, better climb optimisation (OptiClimb), single-engine taxiing, and cleaner aircraft surfaces—offer immediate gains. According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%. But implementation remains erratic.

“There’s been talk of continuous descent and shorter air routes for years,” Kaul pointed out. “Yet Delhi-Bombay block time is now 2 hours 10 minutes, and congestion is only increasing.” The larger question, he added, is “Who takes leadership and who takes ownership?”

The answer, the panel seemed to agree, lies at the highest levels of government. “Flexible use of airspace is possible. Better routing is possible. But unless the top political leadership is sensitised, it won’t happen,” Singh asserted.

Even if airlines adopt best practices and strive for fleet modernisation, without meaningful SAF production or an offset market, the industry will struggle to comply with global frameworks.

What the Future Looks Like

Despite the odds, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Indian carriers are already investing heavily in next-gen aircraft. “In five years, we will be flying the youngest fleet in the sky,” Ghosh said. “Which basically means, by math, we will be emitting the least.”

Air India Express, for example, moved from just 10% of its fleet being new-gen aircraft to 50% in a year. “By next year, two-thirds will be new-gen,” confirmed Singh. But he also noted that sustainability should not be limited to fuel and emissions—it must encompass water, circular economy practices, and broader social impact.

The panel agreed that while the airline industry can and should do more, it cannot go it alone. As Singh summarised, “You cannot expect airlines to bear an additional 15-20% cost to make this happen. For petroleum companies, it’s marginal. For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-04-17%2F980cxqer%2F1000279020.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-04-17 04:56:06.801673

Paradoxically, this trend persists even as these financial companies pursue net-zero goals.

In fact, around half (52%) of respondents see themselves as on track to meet their climate goals, while a much larger 86% said they are either on track or at least ‘partially on track’. Organizations in the Americas were generally the most on track with climate goals – more than those in Europe or Asia Pacific.

“The survey results demonstrate that financial institutions continue to back investments in green infrastructure and are willing to increase their exposure to climate-resilient assets and portfolio companies,” said Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole.

“However, it is also clear that the sector is no longer taking an active role in shifting the balance and will continue to finance fossil fuels. Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

When asked what they feel is holding financial institutions back, more than half (55%) pointed to a lack of clear industry-specific guidelines and 47% cited a lack of progress from organizations they provide financing to. Another 42% cited a lack of support from government policy.

Climate transition plans

Another important part of making progress on net-zero goals is having a climate transition plan. Exactly half of the financial institutions surveyed reported having an ‘extensive and credible’ climate transition plan in place already. The vast majority of respondents (88%) said they currently have at least some form of plan in place.

The report found that larger institutions have made more significant strides in their climate transition plans when compared with their smaller counterparts. That may come as no surprise, considering that the smaller organizations are far less likely to have extensive funding available for climate initiatives.

Financial institutions in major hubs like the UK, Singapore, and the US overwhelmingly favor investing in companies with climate transition plans, finding them more attractive. This preference stems from financial organizations seeking climate-prepared entities with ambitious net-zero goals, as many struggle to meet their own climate targets due to insufficient progress from their financed companies.

Carbon credits

Many financial institutions also have carbon credit strategies in place. Carbon credits serve two main purposes: To go beyond the immediate value chain in mitigating climate change and to neutralize remaining emissions on an institution’s path to achieving net zero.

Many investors see carbon markets and projects as a potential new asset class, recognizing the increasing demand for high-quality carbon removal credits. This has been driving investment in this sector.

Financial institutions have also been pushing their portfolio companies towards using carbon credits in their net-zero strategies. The growing significance of compliance carbon markets is expected to further increase demand and prices, presenting a notable opportunity for the financial sector.

Delaying climate action means more risk

Put simply, financial institutions are increasingly looking to reduce their exposure to risk, which is seen as a crucial part of future-proofing a business. Organizations that have ESG initiatives in place are seen as far less exposed to climate-related risks, which have clearly been on the rise in recent years around the world.

“While the financiers surveyed continue to drive climate-related engagement with their clients, it also becomes clear that financial institutions have to walk a tightrope, balancing the long-term resilience and efficiency of their business against returns for investors in the short term,” said Klier.

“It is important to embrace the positive tipping points created by new, cleaner, and more competitive technologies; but the sector is running major transition and physical risks when it delays its response to obvious climate tipping points.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-04-16-024336793-Most_financial_institutions_still_see_fossil_fuels_as_a_key_part_of_the_investment_mix_spot.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 07:56:25.189570

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world’s largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy’s novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy’s novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy’s revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

“Syzygy’s groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy’s first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.”– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Syzygy will continuously enhance performance and test various feedstocks to support further project development opportunities, customer testing and validation of the GHG e-Reforming ™ unit capabilities.

Gevo Inc. and Future Energy Global are pleased to announce that they have signed a pioneering offtake agreement for carbon abatement attributes, to enable airlines and other companies to reduce their CO2 emissions through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Under the multi-year agreement, FEG will acquire from Gevo the Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF production facility, Gevo ATJ-60, to meet demand from FEG customers, both airlines and corporates, seeking to decarbonize their operations. The agreement also includes an option for FEG to increase the off-take at a later date.

This agreement is expected to help enable Gevo’s financing of the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. Gevo has secured a loan guarantee conditional commitment of $1.63 billion (including capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) and is originating equity from project level capital providers. Under development in Lake Preston, South Dakota, ATJ-60 is designed to address the market need for cost-effective jet fuel while abating carbon and to respond to growing worldwide demand for SAF. Gevo's proprietary plant design is expected to be able to produce 60 million gallons of SAF per year at similar production costs to conventional jet fuel, but with far lower carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has targeted net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two thirds of the necessary emissions reduction, but to achieve this, its production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold. SAF is not yet available at all major airports worldwide so FEG provides SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines who wish to buy additional SAF but who cannot easily source the physical fuel at their own airports. Similarly, when companies purchase and retire SAF-derived Scope 3 credits to compensate for their business travel emissions, they mitigate the added cost of SAF to airlines and thus enable the faster scale-up of SAF production.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines different “scopes” of responsibility for emissions. The emissions from a flight fall under an airline’s direct responsibility (i.e., Scope 1), but a company with staff flying for business on that flight is responsible for its staff’s share of the flight’s emissions (i.e., Scope 3 or indirect emissions). Separating the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical fuel, an approach known as “Book and Claim,” reduces fuel transportation and storage costs and carbon emissions, and unlocks a global SAF market both for airlines and for indirect aviation fuel customers around the world who are seeking to mitigate their emissions.

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster,” says Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors and our corporate customers,” says Natasha Mann, CEO and co-founder of FEG. “It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

FEG’s unique business model brings together investors, suppliers, and buyers to help accelerate and scale SAF production globally. FEG generates additional revenue streams by commercializing the carbon credits which SAF provides, enhancing the business case for faster production scale-up. FEG’s offtake agreement with Gevo is expected to fulfill a market need by giving buyers access to SAF credits at predictable prices, while providing financial commitments and revenue certainty that are expected to allow suppliers like Gevo to expand. FEG’s initial focus has been on aviation, though its sustainable-fuel credit solutions span the transport spectrum, including marine and land transport.

So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.” John Carberry is a freelance writer for Cornell Engineering.","With a dedication to transforming scientific discovery into real-world impact, Tobias Hanrath, a Cornell Engineering nanomaterials and energy researcher, has been appointed Croll Professor of Sustainable Energy Systems and lead for the college’s research pillar in Engineering Energy Transitions.

As the designated point person for one of the college’s strategic research priorities, Hanrath will provide strategic advice about new research initiatives, facilitate collaborations with the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and others, and shape academic programs that equip students and faculty to advance the future of clean energy technologies.

“The next phase of our Cornell Engineering 2030 plan calls for strategic investments in people, programs and infrastructure that position the college for meaningful societal impact in priority research areas,” said Lynden Archer, the Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering. “I see value in identifying faculty champions who can help focus these investments, inspire students and advise their dean. Piloting this approach with Tobias was a natural decision given his reputation as an innovator and leader in the energy systems area.”

By his own admission, the mission suits Hanrath, who is based in in the R.F. Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and is a longtime fellow in the Atkinson Center.

“One of our unique advantages is that, at a place like Cornell, which is big and has a wide range of fields and disciplines, there are a lot of great minds,” Hanrath said, citing the pioneering research of peers in everything from chemistry, artificial intelligence and energy storage to innovations at the interface of agriculture and engineering. “There are real opportunities at the intersections. My approach is to ask: What are people passionate about on campus? What is the collective skill set that we have?”

An illustrative example of this approach in action is Hanrath’s earlier work co-founding Dimensional Energy, a startup company that emerged from a collaboration between his research lab and that of David Erickson, director of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. By leveraging breakthroughs in catalysis and materials science, Dimensional Energy is developing technology to transform carbon dioxide emissions into sustainable aviation fuel.

The company’s success reflects Hanrath’s commitment to bridging academic research and commercial viability. In a major step toward industry adoption, Dimensional Energy announced in 2022 a partnership with United Airlines in which the aviation company would purchase at least 300 million gallons of fuel and invest into further research and development.

In addition to entrepreneurship, Hanrath also sees opportunity to bridge research and education. He hopes to prepare students for the evolving energy landscape by introducing new courses on energy policy and regulations, and by building new design studios for Master of Engineering students working directly with industry partners on research and development challenges.

Hanrath said he sees his role as facilitating an evolution rather than a revolution. Helping Cornell Engineering leap forward in energy transitions is not about changing what students and faculty are doing around energy and sustainability, he stressed, but instead taking a “systems-level approach” to increasing awareness of academic and research efforts across campus, and finding mechanisms to translate that work into close partnerships with other institutions and energy industry leaders.

This systems-level approach is exemplified by the establishment of the Cornell Advanced Platform for Testing, Utilization, and Research in CO2 Capture and Conversion Technologies, also known as the CAPTURE-Lab, in which nine faculty members from across campus will establish an experimental facility at Cornell’s Combined Heat and Power Plant.

The project is led by Hanrath; Phillip Milner, assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences; and Greeshma Gadikota, associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The team plans to establish a mobile lab adjacent to the plant that will analyze gas emissions and provide real-time information about its composition. They will then examine and test materials for carbon capture and conversion, supporting interdisciplinary research on both basic science and lab-to-market feasibility.

By finding the paths and the collaborations that promise the greatest real-world success, Hanrath hopes to build at Cornell Engineering a “center of gravity” in which talent and partners from across campus – and around the world – will organically convene.

Creating that center of gravity requires internal and external awareness, and Hanrath said he plans to invest a significant portion of his new position into communicating broadly about Cornell Engineering’s energy research and its impact.

“Part of what we need to establish here is, if you want to have impactful work in energy and translate ideas into impacts, Cornell should be on your radar,” Hanrath said. “In the future, we all want to have a world that is better than what it is now. So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.”

The industry has tough net zero emissions-related SAF adoption targets to meet and working collaboratively on fuel procurement and investment is crucial to increase SAF usage, agreed a sustainability panel duringt IATA's 2025 World Cargo Symposium (WCS).

Helene Goury, sustainability manager at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo said that AFKLM aims to reach 10% of SAF in its fuel usage by 2030.

The business currently has around 1.5% SAF fuel usage, which is three times the industry average.

Partnerships aided this SAF adoption and other sustainability initiatives within the airline, said Goury. In fact, the group has major partnerships with DG Fuels, Neste and TotalEnergies.

“It’s collaboration. Air France KLM has looked into investments since 2023. For example, we invested $4.7bn into DG Fuels (into its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production plant in the US).”

She added: “We also did a partnership with Neste to try 100% of SAF into (aircraft) engines. That was successfully demonstrating the positive use of SAF.

“More recently we collaborated with TotalEnergies, which will supply up to 1.5m tons of SAF over a 10-year period.”

Additionally, she added that Air France KLM was working with partners to invest in an e-SAF plant.

Finnair Cargo has also been partnering with Neste since 2020 and Janike Heimonen, sales and sustainability manager at Finnair Cargo simply stressed: “Partnerships are important for SAF.”

She said that collaboration is also important in ascertaining cutomers’ awareness of SAF and its value to them and further, how to support them in uptake of the fuel.

“It’s all about the collaboration between the whole value chain,” she said.

From the perspective of a customer, Kintesu World Express is focused on robust relationships with airlines, credibility and transparency of SAF, price and information sharing.

In alignment with this, shippers are more interested in SAF, declared Frederik van de Ven, director of sustainability (EMEA) and lead supply chain sustainability (Global) at Kintesu.

“Shippers are more committed to SAF you see that SAF price per kilo is being asked about in RFQs,"" he commented.

This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.
According to the data, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel.
According to Reginelli, SAF production is projected to begin in earnest by 2027, with more investment being made in bringing new production capacity online.","A few weeks ago, we presented a look at the future of renewable diesel and what this might mean for soybean demand. In addition, another alternative fuel that also promises to grow U.S.-grown crop demand as a feedstock source is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

By its basic definition, SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft. It is made from non-petroleum feedstocks (derived from such crops as corn and soybeans) and is a “drop-in” fuel. This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.

According to Michael Reginelli, Risk Management Consultant at Advance Trading, Inc., SAF could be “a very big deal” when it comes to ethanol demand.

“The aviation industry is definitely looking at this,” said Reginelli, speaking at the 2025 Ohio Agribusiness Association annual meeting in late January. “As environmental regulations change – not only in the U.S. but in other countries as well – aviation companies are going to increasingly look for alternatives.”

And given the facts, it’s easy to understand why SAF is an attractive alternative to traditional aviation fuel. According to the data, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. As Reginelli summed up: “The carbon reduction with SAF is massive.”

Right now, reported Reginelli, the U.S. has a mandate in place to have the country’s aviation industry reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by the end of this decade. Some individual airline companies have set their own emission reduction numbers as well.

“Southwest Airlines wants to be a net carbon zero company by 2030,” he said.

Valero Energy Corporation (“Valero”) announced on April 16, 2025, that its subsidiary, Valero Refining Company-California, has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations at Valero’s Benicia Refinery by the end of April 2026. Valero continues to evaluate strategic alternatives for its remaining operations in California.

As of March 31, 2025, in connection with the evaluation of strategic alternatives for Valero’s operations in California, Valero evaluated the assets of the Benicia and Wilmington refineries for impairment and concluded that the carrying value of these assets was not recoverable. Valero recorded a combined pre-tax impairment charge of $1.1 billion for the Benicia and Wilmington refineries, which is expected to be treated as a special item and excluded from first quarter 2025 adjusted earnings. Included in this amount is the recognition of expected asset retirement obligations of $337 million as of March 31, 2025, which mainly reflects a change in the expected timing of estimated costs for certain legal obligations to retire the assets.

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world's largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy's novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy's novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy's revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

""Syzygy's groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy's first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.""– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Technip and Lanzajet join LERA who serves as a project manager, as contractors for Project Ulysses.

Named after North Queensland butterfly, Papilio ulysses, the project in Australia’s Townsville State Development Area seeks to produce renewable diesel and SAF from bioethanol. The two renewable fuels to be pumped into the aviation market are sourced from agricultural by-products. Set to deliver 11 million liters of renewable diesel and 102 million liters of SAF annually, Project Ulysses will utilize Lanzajet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) technology.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses targets completion and commissioning by 2028. This will set precedence for the achievement of sustainability goals. At its core is the reduction of jet aircraft CO2 emissions. This is an estimated reduction of around 65% when compared to traditional fossil fuel, like jet kerosene, used in the aviation industry.

Janelle Poole MP, an Assistant Minister in Queensland termed Project Ulysses as a means for the exploration of “new industries across Queensland, particularly focusing on economic growth in the regions.”

Sustainability at Forefront of Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses

According to the International Energy Association (IEA), aviation accounts for up to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. The number stood at 940.6 metric tons (Mt) of CO2 as of 2023. According to IEA, this number will surpass 1000 Mt of CO2 by 2030 if the aviation industry lags in change. This also sets the aviation industry’s emission growth rate in the two previous decade, higher than other means of transport like road and rail.

To achieve the global, and International Civil Aviation Organization’s, Net Zero by 2050 goal, several mechanisms have been put in place in the aviation sector. These include use of low carbon fuel like SAF and renewable diesel from bioethanol from Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses. These are also coupled by engineering and design changes to aircraft, like improving airframe and engine designs. Also proposed are technologies like electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft in place of kerosene-powered aircraft.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses and the local economy’s long-term outlook

Also in Project Ulysses’ long term development goals is the expansion Townsville economy. Jet Zero’s SAF and renewable diesel project in Townsville will create more than 100 operational jobs at the facility once its commissioned. This will also be superposed by the 1,000 construction jobs to be delivered once Project Ulysses starts construction. The project will also supply renewable diesel to the local Australian energy market, ramping up renewable energy use in sectors like mining, transport, and tourism.

In the rather, grand scheme of things, Project Ulysses also aims to make Townsville in Australia’s Northern Queensland a renewable energy hub. Also in Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses mission is to make Queensland a global leader in the low-emissions biofuels industry.

Other SAF project in Australia include Project Mandala. A partnership project steered by Jet Zero and Apeiron Bioenergy. It is currently advancing feasibility studies after grant funding award by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Enterprise Singapore.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Technip-Joins-Jet-Zeros-Renewable-Diesel-and-Bioethanol-Aviation-Fuel-Project-Ulysses-as-FEED-Contractor-png.webp,N,,2025-04-16 17:56:58.845900

The articles in this special issue report on innovative approaches and technologies aimed at reducing carbon emissions across various sectors. Key themes include advancements in CO2 capture and utilization, the development of sustainable aviation fuels, and the optimization of industrial processes through novel materials (including catalysts) and operational strategies. Within these, researchers are working to improve the efficiency and selectivity of CO2 conversion processes, to integrate renewable energy sources, and are applying machine learning to enhance predictive capabilities in chemical engineering. These studies collectively underscore the critical role of interdisciplinary research and technological innovation in achieving decarbonization and addressing the global challenge of climate change.

Chuah et al. report that solid sorbents, particularly amine-appended adsorbents, are crucial for Direct Air Capture (DAC) due to their strong affinity for CO2 at low partial pressures, showing the potential of solid sorbents in advancing DAC technology and contributing to reaching net-zero CO2 emissions. (1) The review by Low et al. highlights recent advancements in electrochemical CO2 capture technologies, focusing on membrane-based reactors. The Review suggests areas for improvement and future research directions to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of these technologies for practical applications. (2) Another contribution on the topic of carbon capture from Yi et al. reports on the potential of chemical looping combustion for CO2 capture and utilization. The work provides theoretical insights into the feasibility of integrating CO2 capture and utilization within industrial processes. (3)

The work of Zhang et al. investigates the impact of different traceability methods (chain of custody models) on decision-making in expanding low-carbon ammonia supply chains. The study sets the stage for future research on the broader application of such models in sustainable supply chains. (4) Fu et al. report on the use of plasma technology to enhance propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a process limited by thermodynamics. Their findings aim to guide the design of efficient plasma-assisted PDH systems for sustainable catalysis. (5)

Direct applications to fuels are also reported. The study of Dowling et al. concludes that bio jet fuel from sugar cane, using alcohol-to-jet technologies, is a viable option to reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the optimal operation of integrated sugar cane mills helps in developing effective bio jet fuel policies and technologies. (6) Zhang et al. review the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the CO2AF process, which converts CO2 into kerosene in a single step. By comparing this approach with other research efforts, the Review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial-scale SAF production, and accelerate the development of SAF technologies. (7) Morais et al. conclude that producing jet fuel-range alkanes from lignocellulosic biomass is essential for achieving carbon neutrality in aviation. These results indicate that fine-tuned acidic zeolites are effective for catalyzing HAA reactions to produce jet fuel precursors. (8)

In the materials realm, Zhang et al. investigate the structure–activity relationships of PtFe@S-1&ZSM-5 tandem catalysts in the propane dehydro-aromatization (PDA) reaction. (9) Ramdim et al. quantify the stability and performance of Ag-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO in alkaline media, focusing on the impact of binding materials. The performance loss is attributed to flooding, bi(carbonate) precipitation, and catalyst agglomeration. These findings enhance the understanding of stability issues in GDE-based CO2 electrolyzers. (10) Meanwhile, the contribution from Sarazen et al. focuses on the chemisorption of adsorbents on silica-supported Pd nanoparticle catalysts during benzyl alcohol oxidation. Their results show that titrant adsorption–desorption dynamics, binding energies, and solvent stabilization significantly influence titration efficiency in the liquid phase. (11) In a Review, Peng et al. discuss advances in enhancing CO2 conversion using copper-based catalysts. The Review emphasizes the importance of mass transfer, electrolyte optimization, and electrode structure modification. (12) Cui et al. introduce ZU-301a, an oxalate-functionalized metal–organic framework, for efficient CO2/CH4 separation. The strong CO2 binding is due to electrostatic interactions, making ZU-301a promising for natural gas and biogas upgrading. (13) The study of Zhou et al. explores plasma-assisted dry reforming (DRM) of methane using a Ti–Ni catalyst to produce syngas, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions. The study attributes the catalyst’s excellent performance to the enhanced capacitance of the discharging area and highlights the potential of Ti–Ni catalysts in industrial plasma-catalyst hybrid DRM systems. (14)

Li et al. have successfully synthesized lightweight, strong nanocellular polymer foams using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and defective UiO-66 nanoparticles. The resulting foams have high cell density and improve thermal insulation, making them suitable for multiple applications. (15) The investigation from Yang et al. reports on the impact of surface properties of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) on their orientation during the wet-spinning process. It is found that CNF surface properties influence rheological behavior during extrusion, affinity with antisolvents during coagulation, and capillary forces during drying. These factors collectively determine the mechanical properties of CNF-based fibers, providing insights for developing high-performance man-made fibers. (16)

A numerical framework to predict and analyze the flammable range of ammonia and ammonia-hydrogen mixtures is presented by Stagni et al. (17) They find that ammonia-related radiation significantly influences the rich extinction limit, especially at high initial temperatures, and that the upper flammability limit is sensitive to third-body reactions. The results recommend incorporating ammonia collision efficiency into kinetic models to improve the predictive accuracy of numerical tools for safe storage conditions. Another predictive study is reported by Wang et al., (18) who model the heat capacity (Cp) of molecular liquids using machine learning (ML) methodologies.",https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/iecred.2025.64.issue-15/asset/iecred.2025.64.issue-15.cover.social.jpeg_v03,N,,2025-04-16 16:56:29.659830

If approved, this would greatly accelerate many fixed bottom wind projects, which are key to delivering clean power by 2030.
While the government hopes that this regulatory change will in time apply to all technologies, for AR7 it will apply to fixed-bottom offshore wind only.
Allowing repowered onshore wind projects to participate in AR7 The government's October 2024 response to a previous consultation confirmed that repowered wind projects (i.e.
Allowing floating offshore wind projects (FLOW) participating in AR7 to build in phases Currently, only fixed offshore wind CfD participants are allowed to build in several stages, with FLOW historically being deemed too small to justify inclusion.","Allowing fixed-bottom offshore wind projects to apply for a CfD with pending planning consent

Currently, projects must have all required planning consents in place before they can bid for a CfD. However, due to considerable lead-in times for obtaining Development Consent Orders, fixed-bottom offshore wind projects have been under-represented in previous allocation rounds. The government believes that removing the requirement to secure planning consent prior to bidding in AR7 will attract more project bidders, who may then be able to deliver more quickly without a gap between obtaining consent and making a CfD application. It is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, and means developers will be ""at risk"" for a shorter period of time, hopefully reducing project costs.

The government does recognise the risk of early-stage projects failing to deliver as a result of being refused planning consent or submitting bids that are proved to be too low. Conversely, they may incorporate a risk premium into their bids in order to combat project cost uncertainty, which will result in increased costs to consumers. However, the government believes such risks do not outweigh the benefits.

The government has asked industry for its opinion on the proposed change, as well as a host of resultant amendments; for example, unconsented projects won't be able to commit to existing time and cost restricted milestones. The government suggests that such milestones be deferred until the developer receives the planning decision. Moreover, while the government believes unconsented projects should still be subject to NDD (the Non-Delivery Disincentive that prevents projects that fail to sign a CfD with LCCC within 10 working days of offer from participating in the next two allocation rounds for which they are eligible), it suggests that NDD may be waived in certain circumstances. If approved, this would greatly accelerate many fixed bottom wind projects, which are key to delivering clean power by 2030.

Publishing a capacity ambition in place of a budget and allowing the Secretary of State greater visibility of auction information

The sixth auction round, in 2024, resulted in unspent budget for fixed-bottom offshore wind. This was due to project owners having to bid in a later round because their bid prices came in over budget. The government looks to amend auction processes in AR7 to create greater certainty of outcome by announcing a capacity ambition rather than budget, with the aim of procuring more fixed-bottom offshore wind projects. The government also plans to publish the budget after the allocation round has run (rather than prior to bidding opening, as is currently the case) in the hopes that this will encourage projects to bid at their minimum viable price.

The government is also considering allowing DESNZ to use anonymised bid information for fixed-bottom offshore wind in making its final budget decision, on the basis that the government has a greater chance of purchasing the correct volume of offshore wind. However, the Consultation does acknowledge the risk of gaming and inflated bids. While the government hopes that this regulatory change will in time apply to all technologies, for AR7 it will apply to fixed-bottom offshore wind only. Commentators have said that this is likely to be to push up prices for offshore wind, as potential auction participants will have visibility of their competitors and be able to identify where the likely breakeven points for projects are. Given that the budget could be unconstrained, this incentivises projects to bid at what they estimate will be the highest price they could reasonably receive.

Increasing contract term for future projects

Contracts with LCCC currently have a 15-year term. However, longer contracts may reduce the exposure of renewable assets to ""price cannibalisation"" (where renewable sources generate an oversupply of electricity, causing a drop in market prices) post-CFD, thereby reducing project risk and cost. Longer contracts would also align with increased lifespans of modern technology. The Consultation, however, does not give any indication of what this increase will look like, as the government intends to first assess how such changes will affect consumer interest. Depending on the outcome of further review, it may be that this amendment will apply only to certain technologies. Increasing the 15 year term is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. If the 15-year term is extended, there will likely be advocacy to increase the tenor of other CfD-style support mechanics, e.g. the guaranteed strike price for sustainable aviation fuel currently being designed.

Increase Target Commissioning Window (TCW) for solar projects

Generators have a fixed TCW in which to commission their projects, after which the 15-year payment term begins, regardless of whether the project is live. While most technologies' TCW is 12 months, Solar PV has only three months (given its faster build time). The solar industry has expressed concerns that the TCW does not allow for the increasing size, and associated risk, of solar projects and requested that solar be brought in line with other technologies. The government has proposed increasing the TCW, as mentioned in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, but only to six months at this time.

Temporarily restricting the entry of surrendered CfD capacity into AR7

Currently, developers may reduce their contracted capacity prior to commissioning the construction of their power stations (i) by 25% before the Milestone Delivery Date; and/or (ii) by meeting only 85% (for offshore wind) or 95% (for all other technologies) of their Installed Capacity Estimate by the Longstop Date. Under existing rules, developers can then enter any surrendered contracted capacity in future allocation rounds.

However, such opportunity for capacity re-bidding may encourage generators to increase their income under CfD beyond that agreed in their original contract, with consumers ultimately bearing the additional cost. The government therefore proposes to prevent generators from bidding for previously reduced capacity in AR7, while the government reviews and clarifies its policy in time for AR8. Participants in AR7 will therefore have to confirm that their applications do not include any capacity that was previously subject to a CfD awarded in ARs 1-6.

Allowing repowered onshore wind projects to participate in AR7

The government's October 2024 response to a previous consultation confirmed that repowered wind projects (i.e. old wind farms that have their old turbines replaced with new) would be able to participate in AR7. The Consultation looks to set out eligibility criteria for such projects: for example, developers must demonstrate that the project commenced commercial operations at least 25 years before the Target Commissioning Date set out in their CfD application (thereby evidencing that the project has reached end-of-life). Developers must confirm they will not use any pre-existing assets other than refurbished foundations and show separation between existing and repowered facilities. This ensures that the projects are genuinely being repowered, rather than simply undergoing a life-extension. The key will be designing a process where repowered and new projects compete on an even playing field, so that repowered projects with potentially lower costs for some items do not crowd out new projects. If there are material differences (which may depend on the technology type), one way to solve this will be to have a separate pot for repowered projects.

Allowing floating offshore wind projects (FLOW) participating in AR7 to build in phases

Currently, only fixed offshore wind CfD participants are allowed to build in several stages, with FLOW historically being deemed too small to justify inclusion. However, the government is keen to increase the UK's offshore wind capacity by 2030 and FLOW, being situated in deeper waters further from shore, can gain access to higher, more consistent wind speeds. In a positive change for FLOW developers (and as is the case with fixed offshore wind projects), they will be able build in up to three phases, subject to a 1,500MW total maximum capacity.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white/energy-wind-renewable-teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 14:56:07.507956

Green-hydrogen power, produced from renewable-energy sources such as wind and solar, has emerged as a promising solution in the global shift away from fossil fuels, and Spain’s strategic location on the Iberian Peninsula makes it a strong contender to lead this transition.

Nature Spotlight: Spain

The region experiences the highest number of sunshine hours and some of the highest wind speeds in Europe, making it an ideal base for the renewable-energy production needed to generate hydrogen power. For these reasons, the nation’s leaders have set ambitious targets for renewable hydrogen deployment, aiming to use their network of green hydrogen valleys — several initiatives focused on producing, storing and transporting hydrogen — to reach an electrolyser capacity of 4 gigawatts by 2030.

Lluís Soler Turu, deputy director of the Specific Center for Hydrogen at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain, thinks that this can be done. His work, which involves investigating the production and transformation of hydrogen as a sustainable-energy option, has given him insight into its future, and he describes the opportunities and challenges in the industry.

Why is hydrogen technology important for Spain?

There’s no doubt that climate change is already causing higher temperatures and extreme weather in this region: last year, Catalonia experienced its worst drought on record. The country’s leaders know that they must switch from fossil fuels to green technologies such as hydrogen power. The cost of climate-change impacts is mounting, but it’s still possible to change the trajectory.

Hydrogen power is made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, a process called electrolysis. ‘Green’ hydrogen is produced from renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, without producing pollution or carbon emissions, and unlike solar or wind, it can be stored easily. It is a clean alternative to gas, coal and diesel, and is versatile: you can use it to generate electricity, as a raw material or even burn it to heat homes. But green hydrogen is an energy carrier, not a source — expanding hydrogen’s production will require more renewable-energy infrastructure, which will include building more solar panels and wind turbines on the Iberian Peninsula.

What work are you doing with the UPC Hydrogen Laboratory?

In 2021, my research group received funding to develop a ‘living laboratory’ — integrating research and practical, real-world innovations between academia and industry — for research into the production, storage and use of hydrogen. The hydrogen and electricity used in the lab for experiments such as fuel-cell testing is produced sustainably, on the roof of our building: we have our very own microgrid, consisting of 24 solar panels and 6 electrolysers, which allows us to produce 6 kilograms of hydrogen per day. We can also store up to 16 kg at any one time, which is enough to power our research all day, as well as the training activities and industry collaborations that we host on-site.

The lab also has a 3-square-metre environmental-testing chamber, in which we can tune the relative humidity and temperature to test things such as fuel cells. These are devices that convert hydrogen gas into electricity to power an electric motor, and they can be used for larger vehicles, such as a bus or a truck. The testing chamber is capable of mimicking extreme temperatures (40–80 °C), with a maximum power of 100 kilowatts, which means that the device will be safe and efficient in real-world conditions — even during a Finnish winter or a Moroccan summer.

One of our most exciting projects is with the Catalan government to turn one of the region’s airports, Lleida–Alguaire, into a self-sustaining hub for hydrogen production and research. The airport, which is located around 150 kilometres from Barcelona and serves around 40,000 passengers annually, has been open for 15 years, but it will soon start to produce its own green hydrogen, using 1,768 solar panels and a 100-kW electrolyser, with the aim of generating 5–6 tonnes of hydrogen annually (enough to power a car for up to 600,000 km), supporting local industries and sustainable aviation-fuel development.

What needs to happen for hydrogen to become widely used?

At the UPC, we produce green hydrogen through electrolysis using renewable electricity, which means that no carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. We also investigate catalysts for producing blue hydrogen from methane or bioalcohol steam, in which the CO2 is captured, not released — because the CO2 can be used in many ways in research. For this reason, I prefer the term defossilization rather than decarbonization when we talk about the green-energy transition.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01025-y/d41586-025-01025-y_50850450.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 11:56:33.320966

UAE leader in development of low carbon aviation fuel: IATA

Kamil Al-Awadhi, IATA Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East, praised the UAE as a global role model for aviation development due to its rapid progress, high-quality infrastructure, and efficient operations.

Share

Kamil Al-Awadhi, Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East at International Air Transport Association (IATA), described the UAE as a ""global role model"" for aviation development, pointing to the speed of progress, quality of infrastructure, and efficient operations in the country.

In statements to the Emirates News Agency (WAM) on the sidelines of the IATA World Cargo Symposium 2025 in Dubai, Kamil Al-Awadhi praised the UAE for its outstanding achievements in the aviation sector.

He noted that the country has established itself as a role model—even for developed nations—due to its integrated and well-coordinated aviation ecosystem.

He highlighted that this system includes airlines, airports, ground services, security, and safety, all functioning at high levels of efficiency.

Additionally, he pointed to the UAE’s streamlined visa procedures and the exceptional treatment of passengers at its airports, which reflect the nation’s commitment to quality and world-class service standards.

He confirmed that the UAE is taking a leading role on the global stage in developing Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF), which, unlike Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), is derived from conventional sources but has lower carbon emissions. It remains under study and development.

‘’The UAE is a leader in the development of LCAF,’’ he noted.

On IATA's forecast for air traffic in 2025, he said that IATA expects air traffic growth in the Gulf and Middle East to reach approximately 9%, which is higher than the expected global rate of around 5.6%.

He emphasised that UAE airlines in particular will be among the fastest growing, and may even exceed this rate, due to their modern infrastructure and ambitious expansion strategies. He noted that this growth includes both passenger and air cargo traffic.",https://mastercms.alhilalgroup.com/source/TA/2025/04/16/TA_20250416172554.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 11:56:47.205275

Firefly aims to build a First-of-a-Kind SAF production facility in the UK to be operational by 2029. Like all FOAK SAF facilities, scaling up production and at pace is very challenging. As this pathway utilises a readily available feedstock, there is real potential to scale the production globally. Securing new partnerships around the world will therefore be critical to the success of that objective.

As this production route is a new fuel pathway (Sewage Biosolids to Jet, SBtJ), obtaining fuel qualification through ASTM is a critical milestone to commercialisation and can take several months or years to approve a new fuel.

Innovate UK Business Connect was instrumental in supporting the early development of Firefly Green Fuels, facilitating access to key services and expertise. This included working with Firefly to secure their first offtake agreement with Wizz Air, Europe’s fastest growing airline, and will be the first European airline to fly on UK-produced SAF.

As Firefly Green Fuels is developing a new fuel pathway, Innovate UK Business Connect recognised the need for Firefly to engage with the right experts to start the fuel testing and approval process. They connected Firefly to the UK SAF Clearing House, a Department for Transport funded facility to support companies access jet fuel testing. Firefly is now making positive progress on the fuel testing.

However, this represented only 0.5% of the aviation industry’s fuel demand, highlighting the steep challenge of scaling up supply.
In Brazil, Vibra recently took a first step by importing 550,000 liters of SAF.
“Our goal is to bring the product to market at commercial scale in the first half of 2025,” it said.
“In Brazil, the infrastructure for SAF production and distribution is still under development and requires significant investment,” she said.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is beginning to establish a foothold in Brazil’s market. On one front, distributing company Vibra has started importing the product at a commercial scale. At the same time, domestic production is nearing launch, with Petrobras forecasting deliveries as early as June.

SAF is a key pillar in the aviation sector’s strategy to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a promising player in the global supply of this renewable fuel, which can be produced through various methods—the most advanced being HEFA, which uses waste oils. While Brazilian regulations have progressed, companies warn that regulatory gaps and high costs are still major barriers to further investment.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production reached 1.9 billion liters in 2024, triple the volume from the previous year. However, this represented only 0.5% of the aviation industry’s fuel demand, highlighting the steep challenge of scaling up supply.

In Brazil, Vibra recently took a first step by importing 550,000 liters of SAF. According to Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s executive vice president of operations, logistics, and sourcing, that amount could fuel 1,000 flights based on a 10% blend.

“We’re in talks with clients about supplying certain routes with this product. We intend to bring in more shipments to Galeão and potentially other airports,” Mr. Bragança said. Vibra is expected to announce its first domestic customers shortly. Currently, SAF imported by the company is about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel—one of the main obstacles to broader adoption.

The company has been studying sustainable fuels since 2004 through its vegetable oil co-processing route—blending renewable oils during the refining process. However, under Brazilian law, only 5% of the final SAF product can come from co-processing.

“We’re currently developing projects for SAF production through co-processing, much like we already produce renewable-content diesel (Diesel R),” the company said in a statement. Petrobras noted it has completed production tests at its Reduc and Regap refineries and plans further testing at Revap.

A final decision on production capacity is still pending. “Our goal is to bring the product to market at commercial scale in the first half of 2025,” it said.

Even Petrobras faces uncertainties. SAF produced through co-processing is already used in international aviation under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules, particularly for compliance with the global emissions reduction program CORSIA. However, Brazilian law does not yet recognize co-processed fuel as SAF—an issue under active debate. The industry is betting that approval will eventually come.

Another company exploring SAF is Be8, based in Rio Grande do Sul. For competitiveness reasons, Be8 chose to launch its SAF initiative with a HEFA-based plant in Paraguay, scheduled to start sales in 2028. The project represents a $1 billion investment.

“Public policy in Latin America should be more advanced. Brazil was way behind, but caught up last year with the Future Fuel law. Now it needs proper regulation,” said Erasmo Carlos Battistella, Be8’s president. The company is also exploring SAF plants in Brazil but is awaiting regulatory clarity. Among the technologies on its radar are alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) conversion and synthetic fuels.

Milena Fajardo, fuel and sustainability director at the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), said the region is well-positioned for SAF production thanks to its diverse biomass sources, which allow for multiple technological pathways. However, she cautioned that insufficient public policy is holding back development. “In Brazil, the infrastructure for SAF production and distribution is still under development and requires significant investment,” she said.

Brazil adopted emission reduction targets under the Future Fuel law in 2024. Under the rule, airlines operating domestic flights must cut emissions by 1% in 2027 using SAF. The requirement will rise incrementally to 10% by 2037. The National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) and the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) have signed a technical cooperation agreement to develop the regulatory framework for the law.

Despite progress, companies still face uncertainty. Questions remain over whether minimum SAF blending requirements will apply to all airports or just select terminals, whether SAF can be sold directly without distributors, and how the fuel will be taxed.

ANP told Valor that the regulatory agenda has completed a public consultation phase and is now being finalized. The timeline for implementation is set for 2025–2026. Some legal definitions are still pending executive orders.

While some jurisdictions have set minimum SAF blending mandates, Brazil chose a feedstock-based approach, according to Marcela Anselmi, ANAC’s manager for environment and energy transition.

Technologies like HEFA are more advanced and less costly, but offer lower carbon reduction potential than, for instance, ethanol-to-jet conversion. By focusing on volume rather than emission impact, Brazil may be favoring the cheaper option.

Ms. Anselmi also expressed concern about the direction of international policies. “We’re seeing protectionist measures shaping the SAF market,” she said, citing the European Union’s restrictions on biomass feedstocks—only allowing second-generation or waste-based inputs—arguing that SAF should not compete with food production.

However, Brazil, with its fertile soil and tropical climate, could supply SAF without jeopardizing food security. “There is real concern that this market could be stifled by international restrictions framed as technical requirements but essentially serving as trade barriers,” she said.

Airlines are among the most eager for SAF availability. Latam has set a target for SAF to account for 5% of its global fuel consumption by 2030, aiming to spur production through early demand signals.

Latam told Valor that the high cost of SAF—up to five times more expensive than conventional fuel—is a key concern. “Without appropriate public policies, SAF could drive up travel costs, impacting flight demand and regional connectivity.”

Filipe Alvarez, Azul’s sustainability manager, said the industry is serious about meeting its targets. Azul has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. “However, without a structured and growing SAF supply, no airline in the world will be able to meet its decarbonization goals,” he pointed out.

Aircraft manufacturers are also making moves. Landon Loomis, Boeing’s president for Latin America and the Caribbean, noted that all aircraft in operation today can run on up to 50% SAF blends. “Boeing remains committed to ensuring our aircraft are fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030,” he said.

The agreement outlines the airline’s plan to purchase up to 7.5 million litres of SAF between 2025 and 2029, which will help Volotea reduce the carbon emissions of its operations in France.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), pure SAF can lower CO₂ emissions by up to 90% over its entire lifecycle when compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. SAF is usually blended with standard kerosene before being used in aircraft and is compatible with existing infrastructure and engines.

The fuel supplied under this agreement will be made from waste products, including used cooking oils and animal fats, making it a cleaner alternative that doesn’t require changes to aircraft systems.

Carlos Muñoz, Founder and CEO of Volotea, said the partnership marks a meaningful step in the airline’s sustainability efforts. “This agreement with TotalEnergies strengthens our commitment to more sustainable aviation and supports the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050,” he said.

He also highlighted the importance of government incentives to support greater use of SAF. “France is progressing in SAF infrastructure, but we need a system that encourages all players in the industry to invest in sustainable fuel, research, and large-scale production,” Muñoz added.

Volotea has launched several initiatives in recent years to reduce its environmental footprint. In 2024, the airline reported a 47% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometer compared to 2012 levels—bringing it close to its target of a 50% reduction by 2030, which it may reach as early as 2025.

Louise Tricoire, Senior Vice President of Aviation & Marine Fuels at TotalEnergies, said the company is proud to support Volotea’s sustainability goals. “This agreement shows how we can help our partners transition to cleaner energy and contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry,” she said.

In this episode of SAF Talks, we dive deep into the world of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with Carlos Ayuso, Director of Projects and Innovation Processes at Moeve. Carlos Ayuso begins by talking about Moeve's longstanding presence in the jet fuel market and the company's recent strides in sustainable aviation. Last year, Moeve made headlines by introducing sustainable aviation fuels across Spain's main airports.

Innovation at the core

As the Director of Projects and Innovation Processes at Moeve, Carlos plays a crucial role in overcoming the technical challenges associated with SAF. From dealing with contaminants like lithium and phosphor to finding solutions for corrosion issues, Moeve's innovation team is at the forefront of developing and implementing new technologies. They often collaborate with research centers and technology companies, including Topsoe.

Pathways to 2030 and beyond

Carlos provides a clear roadmap for SAF production leading up to 2030 and beyond. One of the biggest hurdles in SAF production is feedstock availability. Moeve has secured a long-term agreement with Apical, a global leader in vegetable oil production, ensuring a steady supply for their initial units. Additionally, Moeve is fostering alliances with small producers in Spain and collaborating to develop cover crops with an investment of 1.2 billion euros, Moeve is building a bios plant that will make it second-generation biofuel energy park the largest in southern Europe, with a flexible production capacity of 500,000 tons per year of SAF and HVO. In this way, the company aims to reach an annual SAF production of 800,000 toons by 2030.

To achieve this, Moeve has secured a long-term agreement with strategic partners to ensure a steady supply and is exploring ways to diversify its feedstock sources while also promoting a circular economy.

A vision for the future

When asked about the most transformative change needed to accelerate SAF adoption, Carlos highlights the importance of technology, regulation, and feedstock availability. While technology is crucial, he acknowledges that a holistic approach involving regulatory support and sample feedstock is essential for scaling up SAF production.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/What%20awaits%20SAF%20in%20the%20months%20ahead%20%282%29.png,N,,2025-04-16 09:56:37.419754

Topsoe’s role in India’s Roadmap At Topsoe, we are well positioned to contribute to India’s clean energy transition.
Over the decades, Topsoe has been active in supporting India ammonia plants to continuously reduce energy use through revamps, for instance.","In early April, a key moment in India’s clean energy journey was reached with the launch of the India’s Green Fuels: Baseline Market Study and Roadmap. India is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies, and one determined to diversify and transform its energy sector. With its ambitious climate goals, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, and a rapidly growing demand for sustainable energy solutions, India presents a unique opportunity for collaboration and innovation in low-carbon and clean energy.

Topsoe is proud to be part of this journey, contributing our expertise in advanced fuel technologies to the Baseline Market Study and Roadmap report. Commissioned by the Trade Council of Denmark in India and developed under the Green Transition Alliance India (GTAI), the report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state of clean fuels in India.

It maps existing capacities, identifies key stakeholders, analyzes policy frameworks and highlights emerging opportunities for India and for Danish companies. It is hoped that the publication will be an invaluable resource to navigate the complexities of India’s clean fuel landscape and chart a path forward for industry leaders, policymakers and investors.

As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Denmark has the skills, India has the scale, and the world has the need for new technologies.” This sentiment was expanded upon by Pooja Kapur, the former Indian Ambassador in Copenhagen: “India has the scale as well as the skills and we are cooperating with Denmark to acquire even more skills and technologies for the green transition. There is a beautiful synergy between Denmark’s skills and technologies and India’s requirements.”

India: a market poised for transformation

India’s energy needs are vast and diverse. Currently, 88% of the country’s primary energy requirements are met by coal and oil. However, this dominance is gradually diversifying to renewable energy sources, which now account for 3.4% of the primary energy supply. With over 203 GW of installed renewable energy capacity as of October 2024, India ranks fourth globally in renewable energy deployment. Solar power leads the way, followed by wind and hydroelectric power.

Despite these advancements, the industrial, transportation and power sectors remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. This is where clean fuels, such as biofuels, synthetic fuels (e-fuels), green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), come into play. These fuels offer transformative solutions to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, shipping, heavy transport and steel production.

India’s strategic focus on these fuels is evident in its policies, including the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the Methanol Economy Program and the National Policy on Biofuels. These initiatives aim to reduce fossil fuel dependency, promote renewable energy adoption and foster innovation in clean fuel technologies.

India’s Green Fuels report zeroes in on five key fuels: second-generation (2G) bioethanol, low-carbon and green hydrogen, low-carbon and green ammonia, methanol and SAF. Each of these fuels holds significant potential to drive India’s decarbonization efforts. For instance, India’s abundant agricultural residues and municipal solid waste provide a robust feedstock base for biofuels. Similarly, the country’s growing chemical and transportation sectors create a strong demand for low-carbon methanol and SAF. However, challenges such as infrastructure gaps, high production costs and regulatory hurdles must be addressed to unlock the full potential of these fuels.

Topsoe’s role in India’s Roadmap

At Topsoe, we are well positioned to contribute to India’s clean energy transition. With decades of experience in fuel production technologies, we are at the forefront of developing solutions for renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green and low-carbon hydrogen, green and low-carbon ammonia and methanol.

For instance, Topsoe currently provides the technology behind 30% of global SAF production. As global aviation and transport sectors face mounting pressure to reduce emissions, SAF and renewable diesel have emerged as critical solutions. Topsoe’s innovative technologies and catalysts enable the production of these fuels from renewable feedstocks, offering a viable pathway to decarbonize these sectors.

Green and low-carbon hydrogen are other key areas from Topsoe. Hydrogen is a cornerstone of the energy transition. Topsoe is expected to begin production of SOEC electrolyzer cells this year for green hydrogen using renewable electricity, with our SynCOR™ technology is a leading solution for low-carbon hydrogen production. Topsoe’s technologies are designed to optimize efficiency and reduce costs in low-carbon ammonia production, enabling production of fertilizers and progressing the future role of ammonia as a shipping fuel.

Over the decades, Topsoe has been active in supporting India ammonia plants to continuously reduce energy use through revamps, for instance. This has allowed them to stay in line with the energy levels mandated by the Indian government. Now, our technology in SAF and green ammonia are finding markets in India, while late in 2024, we signed an agreement with developer Hygenco to provide our Topsoe technology for their upcoming green ammonia plant in Odisha, India.

Collaboration and challenges line the path ahead

The collaboration between India and Denmark under the Green Strategic Partnership (GSP) demonstrates the power of international cooperation in addressing global challenges. Initiatives like the Green Transition Alliance India (GTAI) bring together Danish companies with advanced technologies and Indian industries with ambitious decarbonization goals. This partnership not only accelerates the adoption of new fuels in India but also boosts economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.

However, the road ahead is not without challenges. Green hydrogen and ammonia production, for example, requires substantial renewable electricity and specialized infrastructure, such as pipelines and storage tanks. Similarly, the high costs of renewable electricity and electrolyzers make green ammonia and hydrogen production significantly more expensive than their conventional counterparts.

Infrastructure gaps, such as the lack of SAF production facilities and carbon capture systems pointed to in the report, further complicate the scaling of clean fuels. Additionally, India’s regulatory framework, while evolving, still lacks the specificity and incentives needed to support large-scale clean fuel projects.

Despite these barriers, the opportunities are immense. India’s rising energy demand, expanding chemical sector and focus on sustainability create a fertile ground for clean fuel adoption. State-level initiatives in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu for green hydrogen and ammonia and in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab for biofuels, highlight the regional potential for clean energy projects. Policies incentivizing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) further enhance the feasibility of producing green fuels like methanol and ammonia.

A shared vision

The India’s Green Fuels: Baseline Market Study and Roadmap report is a tribute to the shared vision of India and Denmark for a sustainable future. By using Danish expertise in advanced technologies and India’s ambitious clean energy goals, we can collectively overcome challenges and make the most of opportunities in the evolving fuel sector. At Topsoe, we remain committed to driving this transformation, working together with our partners to build a more resilient energy present and future.

The journey to a low-carbon economy in India is and will be complex, but with collaboration, innovation and determination, we can turn challenges into opportunities and pave the way for a bright future.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Thaioil%20will%20use%20Topsoes%20SNOX%E2%84%A2%20to%20remove%20sulfur%20and%20nitrogen%20oxides%20and%20dust%20emissions%20from%20their%20Sriracha%20Refinery%20-3-1.jpeg,N,,2025-04-16 09:56:41.848149

,,2025-04-16 10:57:36+00:00,www.defenceconnect.com.au,Australian Defence Force continues movement to sustainable aviation fuel,Robert Dougherty,,,,,https://www.defenceconnect.com.au/air/15904-australian-defence-force-continues-movement-to-sustainable-aviation-fuel,"The Australian Defence Force has begun moving to sustainable aviation fuel, derived from renewable sources, with the recent refueling of an Army CH-47F Chinook in southern Victoria last month.
The aircraft was refuelled with about 3000lbs of SAF, under a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group to move away from reliance on conventional fuels.
Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.
“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.
All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.","The Australian Defence Force has begun moving to sustainable aviation fuel, derived from renewable sources, with the recent refueling of an Army CH-47F Chinook in southern Victoria last month.

The aircraft was refuelled with about 3000lbs of SAF, under a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group to move away from reliance on conventional fuels.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

“The stopover by the Chinook at East Sale is an important milestone for the use of SAF across Defence, and Army Aviation looks forward to greater availability of synthetic aviation turbine fuels.”

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale reportedly demonstrates the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

“The UAE is a critical hub for global connectivity. And the benefits of its super connector role brings trade, tourism, investment, and jobs to the UAE. The leadership of the UAE has a strategic vision for aviation, supported by smart regulation and investment in world-class infrastructure. Supporting nearly a million jobs and 18.2% of GDP, aviation makes an enormous contribution to the UAE’s prosperity—both culturally and economically. And we can be confident that this contribution will strengthen as the UAE continues to facilitate opportunities for aviation to thrive,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key Priorities for the UAE

Building on its position as a global aviation leader, the UAE is well-placed to progress in three priority areas:

Sustainability: The UAE has been a leader in the development of Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) and is targeting an annual production of 700 million liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. IATA looks forward to the potential for even broader collaboration with the UAE, in pursuit of opportunities to advance progress towards aviation’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal such as the recently launched SAF Registry (operated by CADO).

Infrastructure: As the UAE continues to invest in world class-infrastructure to meet future demand, particularly with the development of Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) and Zayed International Airport (AUH), it is critical to work with industry to remain a cost competitive hub for airlines and passengers.

Workforce: The UAE is making significant investments in aviation training to ensure a skilled workforce to support growth opportunities. Maintaining a sustainable pipeline of aviation professionals will further strengthen the UAE's status as a global aviation hub. As part of this effort, a new IATA training center was recently opened in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

Defence’s move into sustainability comes as countries and airlines continue to invest in producing more sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for commercial carriers.

Earlier this month, for example, Qantas and Airbus pledged to invest $15 million in a climate-focused venture capital fund.

Virgin, meanwhile, has partnered with Viva Energy to trial SAF in departing flights from Whitsunday Coast Airport and Air New Zealand last year signed a deal for 9 million litres of SAF that will be blended with conventional jet fuel.

The initiatives followed strong lobbying by former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who in 2022 argued Australia should be beating other nations to produce large quantities of SAF itself.

“Australians are the most competitive people I’ve ever come across,” Joyce said. “We should be making it into a World Cup. I think we’d win if that were the case.”

Joyce was a long-term advocate of encouraging more production of SAFs in Australia, branding it a “huge opportunity” that would create “a huge amount of jobs”.

Biofuels maintained a leading position due to their well-established production and distribution infrastructure, as well as strong governmental support through incentives and subsidies. Their compatibility with existing aviation systems makes them easier to integrate than newer alternatives like hydrogen, which require significant infrastructure overhaul. Additionally, biofuels are considered both cost-effective and environmentally friendly, offering reduced carbon emissions without sacrificing performance.

(""Mitsui"", Head Office: Tokyo, President and CEO: Kenichi Hori) has invested in Infinium Holdings, Inc. (""Infinium"") Series C funding round. Infinium is a US based leading provider of gas conversion solutions and developer of eFuels technology and projects. This is Mitsui's second initiative in the synthetic fuel area, following the investment in Twelve Benefit Corporation announced on February 13, 2025.

Synthetic eFuels are liquid fuels produced through the catalytic chemical reactions that occur between green hydrogen (produced by electrolyzing water using clean energy) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These fuels are expected to play an increasingly important part in efforts to reduce GHG emissions, especially in the transportation and industrial sectors. They offer a number of specific advantages. For example, GHG emissions are over 90% lower compared with fossil fuel-derived products. Synthetic eFuels can also be used as drop-in fuels without the need to modify engines, including aircraft engines, or transportation and storage infrastructure. In addition, they are suitable for applications for which electrification is not viable, such as aviation, shipping, and long-distance land surface transportation.

Infinium is a leader in this industry and was the first in the world to start up a synthetic eFuel production operation using their proprietary reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and Liquid Fuel Production* processes. Its first production plant in Corpus Christi, Texas commenced production in late 2023. Customers include Amazon who uses the eDiesel produced at the plant to fuel its delivery trucks, and Borealis who take the eNaphtha to produce low-carbon plastics. Infinium's second facility is in development in West Texas with a focus on sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) production. Canadian asset management firm Brookfield, which has invested in a wide range of next-generation fuel-related business, and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a clean energy investment program, have invested directly into the project. Customers include the International Airlines Group (IAG) and American Airlines who have committed to buy eSAF produced at the new plant.

Mitsui is accelerating its initiatives across the entire carbon value chain, ranging from the recovery of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC) and other methods, to carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the use of CO2 to produce synthetic fuels, as well as the creation and sale of carbon credits. By deepening collaboration across its e-Fuel portfolio companies, Mitsui aims to expand its carbon-neutral fuel manufacturing and sales business, and link clean energy development and various CO2 materials from biomass, DAC, and other sources, with a variety of fuel needs, thereby maximizing the value of its value chain. Mitsui will contribute to the creation of the carbon management industry through the global development of a decarbonized fuel business on a significant scale.

For travel companies wanting to help - and also demonstrate to climate conscious travelers that they’re doing their part to help - incorporating a solution that helps reduce and clean up the emissions from air travel into their climate action plans is desirable.

Flight Emissions Basics

Carbon dioxide makes up 70% of all air travel emissions, while the other 30% is water vapor. Water vapor forms condensation trails in the atmosphere, trapping heat and acting as artificial clouds, which leads to a warming effect that is potentially greater than the direct impact of carbon dioxide emissions from flight. Did you know that of all the CO2 emissions a plane releases into the atmosphere, most of it will not dissipate until at least 100 years have passed? (Environmental Energy and Study Institute). This, and many other aspects of air travel emissions and efforts to curb it can be found in A Deep Dive on Aviation and Climate for the Climate Conscious Traveler.

Facing the realities of air travel’s impact on climate are at the heart of why Tomorrow’s Air exists: to make it easy for travel companies to contribute to innovative solutions that can reduce carbon dioxide emissions in our atmosphere - sustainable aviation fuel- and solutions that can clean up carbon dioxide emissions and store them permanently such as

direct air capture

Brave Travel Companies are Coming Forward to Help

It was February 2022 when kimkim joined Tomorrow’s Air, becoming the first travel business to incorporate funding support through Tomorrow’s Air for solutions that provide carbon removal with permanent storage in its booking process.

Kimkim’s approach called for sharing the cost of their climate initiative with local travel specialists and customers. As the company notes on its website, “each contribution is small - but cumulatively, they have a large and lasting impact.”

When Tomorrow’s Air introduced sustainable aviation fuel in September 2023, kimkim was again at the front of the line, becoming the first partner to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel investment directly into traveler bookings.

Kimkim says that “independent travel can and should be a force for social impact.” The company’s trips “support economic growth in our destinations, promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding, and embrace sustainable tourism principles.” They favor partnerships with small, local specialists and suppliers, and help them grow their businesses and improve the sustainability of their trips. And, kimkim understands “that the impact on the climate is one of the biggest challenges resulting from travel.”

They’ve been at the forefront of climate action in the travel industry, doing their part not only to address their own emissions, but through their support via Tomorrow’s Air, to help educate and inspire others to follow in their footsteps.

While conventional sellers of carbon offsets focus purely on generating as many offset transactions as possible, Tomorrow’s Air has a deeper mission at its core, striving not only to send much-needed funding to climate solutions, but also to help build awareness and galvanize broader support from the travel industry.

What makes hemp ideal for carbon removal in aviation?

Industrial hemp is one of the fastest-growing and most carbon-hungry plants on Earth. It captures CO₂ efficiently, and when turned into hempcrete or carbon fibre, it locks that carbon away for decades. It can also produce bio-based jet fuel. Hemp offers multiple sustainability benefits from one crop.

How are carbon removal credits from hemp verified?

Tao Climate’s MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) platform uses satellite imaging, AI, and field data to ensure every Hemp Carbon Removal Credit is real, traceable, and transparent. This is a leap forward in trust and integrity for the carbon removal market.

What is Tao CX and how does it help airlines?

Tao CX is our Customer Experience product. It integrates carbon removal options into the flight booking and loyalty journey, enabling passengers to contribute to real-time climate action. Airlines benefit from increased revenue, sustainability engagement, and brand trust.

What is Tao OPS?

Tao SAF helps aviation stakeholders access and scale sustainable aviation fuel. We focus on hemp seed oil as a high-potential feedstock and support the development of local, circular SAF supply chains to reduce emissions and increase resilience.

Is SAF made from hemp as effective as traditional jet fuel?

Yes. Hemp-derived SAF has a high energy density, performs well in jet engines, and significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions. It’s one of the most promising and sustainable SAF options available today.

How can airports use their land to remove carbon?

Airports can grow hemp on underutilised land, transforming their surroundings into green carbon sinks. This not only removes CO₂ but also enables local SAF production and sustainable material manufacturing—all measurable with Tao Climate’s MRV platform.

What are the main benefits of hempcrete for aviation infrastructure?

Hempcrete is a carbon-negative building material made from hemp stalks and lime. It continues absorbing CO₂ after construction, making airport terminals and hangars active carbon removers. It’s strong, sustainable, and perfect for aviation facilities.

What role does Tao Climate play in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?

Tao Climate directly supports SDGs like Climate Action (13), Affordable Clean Energy (7), Sustainable Cities (11), Responsible Consumption (12), and Partnerships for the Goals (17) by enabling sustainable farming, construction, and aviation practices.

What is the Ukraine pilot project?

In Ukraine, Tao Climate is helping rebuild communities with hemp. We support a local company that grows hemp, captures CO₂, and uses the hemp fibre to build hempcrete housing for people affected by war. This project combines carbon removal with humanitarian impact.

Who are Tao Climate’s strategic partners?

We work with Google, the European Space Agency (ESA BIC Ireland), and we’re in Elon Musk’s XPRIZE Carbon Removal Top 100. We’re supported by Enterprise Ireland, and Startupbootcamp’s AI accelerator programme. Our technology is being built to deliver the highest standards of climate impact and verification.

How can airlines generate revenue from sustainability?

As such, ""the design and structure of regulation is what drives investment and, by extension, the trading and optimization strategies that develop around them,"" he said.
There is ""a lot of synergy"" in managing the trade lifecycle and supply chain for fossil and renewable fuels in a single system, especially since the blending of fossil fuels and renewable fuels will remain common for a long time, Jaeger said.
However, renewable energy sources continue to be traded.
They are managing biogas alongside their existing gas activities and are scaling up their tracking of sustainability credentials through ION's energy trading and risk management solutions, he said.","Regulation design and the potential to optimize trades are driving biofuels and decarbonization strategies, according to commodities trading software firm ION Commodities.

With many production pathways for biofuels production available, regulations are emerging in different jurisdictions to establish clear standards and incentivize the development of new technologies such as synthetic fuels, and to promote market efficiency.

""A lot of biofuels simply aren't competitive without some form of carbon or sustainability incentive,"" Andre Jaeger, senior vice president at ION Commodities, told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights. As such, ""the design and structure of regulation is what drives investment and, by extension, the trading and optimization strategies that develop around them,"" he said.

Recent regulations include biofuels mandates in the EU, which stipulate that 2% of aviation fuel supplied at the wing at EU airports is sustainable aviation fuel and that from 2030 1.2% of all aviation fuel supplied is synthetic fuel or eSAF. Across the Atlantic, the US has chosen to prioritize subsidy and tax credit mechanisms.

Many of ION's clients incorporate their biofuels activity into their existing commodity trading activity. There is ""a lot of synergy"" in managing the trade lifecycle and supply chain for fossil and renewable fuels in a single system, especially since the blending of fossil fuels and renewable fuels will remain common for a long time, Jaeger said.

""To manage and report business performance of the biofuel portion of their portfolio, it's crucial for clients to be able to track both the physical fuel and its associated sustainability credentials via certificates,"" he said. ""Depending on the market, the value of these sustainability certificates can be what makes the business case for biofuels viable.""

Companies in certain member states such as the Netherlands can optimize the blending of physical fuel depending on market conditions but have the option to meet obligations through the purchase of biofuel compliance credits.

Platts last assessed Dutch renewable energy units (HBE-A) for advanced fuel at Eur11.54/Gj ($13.05/Gj) on April 14, up from Eur8.40/Gj when it launched in January 2024, via some volatility resulting from the limited supply of renewable diesel coinciding with a fire at a production unit. The assessment reflects the value of an HBE needed to comply with the Dutch annual obligation through advanced biofuel or bio-gas in the transport sector for the current year.

A shifting regulatory landscape

Biofuel markets and certification societies have come under fire in recent years over their environmental credentials. European biofuel producers have accused Asian biofuel imports of being fraudulently certified and this has resulted in tariffs from Brussels on biodiesel and renewable diesel imports.

It has also resulted in attention on International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, which certified the imports and which is reportedly under pressure from the European Commission recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels, following a row over imports.

A spokesperson for the commission said it had discussed issues related to sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, and avoidance of double-counting but had not made a decision.

In carbon markets, the Guardian newspaper published a report in January 2023 alleging that REDD+ carbon credits issued by Verra were largely ""worthless"" and did not represent genuine carbon reductions.

Energy transition versus other priorities

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, shortages of gas and concerns about heating have raised the profile of energy security and blunted appetites for reducing carbon emissions. Adding to this trend are current concerns in Europe about defense, which are further complicating budget-keepers' decisions.

However, renewable energy sources continue to be traded. ""There is stable and ongoing interest from clients looking to support renewable power adoption, especially around PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), intraday trading, and life cycle management of energy certificates,"" Jaeger said.

In addition, a couple of ION's European clients have recently started projects aimed at integrating biogas into their trading portfolios. They are managing biogas alongside their existing gas activities and are scaling up their tracking of sustainability credentials through ION's energy trading and risk management solutions, he said.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-15 23:56:12.016234

""We are concerned about the pace at which we are progressing particularly in the area of SAF,"" Walsh said.
""We are particularly concerned about the way some governments and regions are pushing this with mandates that are unrealistic.
He added that IATA was also concerned about the EU's focus on e-SAF because it is ""extremely expensive"".","IATA is concerned that airlines will be left footing the bill if the sector cannot meet unrealistic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates.

Speaking at the IATA World Cargo Symposium, the airline association’s director general Willie Walsh said that sustainability was a “must” for aviation but added that targets being set were not always achievable.

He highlighted the European Union’s RefuelEU target that from 2025, fuel uplift from member state airports must contain at least 2% SAF. The percentage will increase gradually, reaching 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The RefuelEU initiative is part of the wider European Commission ‘Fit for 55’ package to meet the emissions reduction target of 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels.

He said the pace of SAF adoption is slower than expected, but this was not the fault of airlines.

""We are concerned about the pace at which we are progressing particularly in the area of SAF,"" Walsh said.

""We are particularly concerned about the way some governments and regions are pushing this with mandates that are unrealistic.

""I don’t mind ambitions targets but what I do mind is if they aren’t met. The idea that the targets were set to drive the production of SAF is a positive, but the idea that it incentivises airlines because we are going to penalised financially if we don’t achieve them is wrong.

""There is no environmental benefit to penalising airlines for the failure of other players in the supply chain.""

Walsh said that aircraft manufacturers and fuel companies were not doing enough to help meet the targets and were even ""walking backwards"" in terms of their commitments.

He added that IATA was also concerned about the EU's focus on e-SAF because it is ""extremely expensive"".

""There is a real risk at the moment that we are off track in terms of the pathway to zero2050 (aviation's target to have net zero emissions) and the concern is it will be seized upon by people that like to penalise our industry and we will face more and more penalties and taxes because of the failure of other players to commit to playing their part.

GEVO and Future Energy Global (“FEG”) recently entered into an offtake agreement focused on carbon abatement attributes, helping airlines and other businesses cut their CO2 emissions using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Under this multi-year deal, FEG will purchase Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from Gevo tied to 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at the latter’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) facility, known as Gevo ATJ-60. These credits will support FEG’s clients — including airlines and corporations — in their efforts to decarbonize. The agreement also gives FEG the option to increase its offtake in the future.

This agreement is expected to support Gevo in securing financing for the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. The company has received a conditional loan guarantee commitment of $1.63 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office, which includes capitalized interest during construction. In addition, Gevo is raising equity from project-level capital providers. The ATJ-60 facility, which is under development in Lake Preston, SD, aims to meet the demand for affordable jet fuel while reducing carbon emissions. The plant is projected to produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually, at a production cost comparable to traditional jet fuel but with a much smaller carbon footprint.

The aviation industry has set a goal of reaching net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, with SAF expected to deliver roughly two-thirds of the required emissions cuts. However, achieving this will require a more than 400-fold increase in SAF production. Since SAF isn’t accessible yet at all major airports globally, FEG offers SAF-based Scope 1 credits to airlines that want to purchase additional SAF but can’t physically obtain the fuel at their locations. Likewise, when companies buy and retire SAF-based Scope 3 credits to offset emissions from business travel, they help reduce the additional cost of SAF to airlines, accelerating the expansion of SAF production.

GEVO stock has gained 92.8% in the past year compared with the industry’s 26.8% growth.

Reaffirmed by existing members through additional funding, the pioneering partnership continues to impact the country’s progress in its energy transition and, by extension, cleantech development. International partnerships like the JETP can be vital accelerators for local cleantech ecosystems in several ways:

Influencing institutional reform to prime existing infrastructure

Leveraging bilateral relationships to mobilize the private sector

Building capacity for widespread deployment

Laying systematic foundation for technological innovation

Let’s Take It from the Top: Prompting Infrastructural Reform Through Institutional Support

Multi-national public sector partnerships like the JETP announce high-level financial support from international partners ($8.5B originally, with an additional $5B including the global gateway package announced in 2025), enabling necessary policy shifts to prime the energy industry for widespread adoption and technology scaling:

The Just Energy Transition Investment Plan (JET IP) maps clean energy investment needs over five years

Lifting licensing exemptions for embedded generation facilitates private investment in solar/wind

Dedicated JETP Project Management Unit and Presidential Climate Commission to engage ecosystem actors to create inclusive energy transition plans

Passed Climate Change Bill in 2023 to facilitate institutional arrangements for climate policies and actions, as well as to mandate the implementation of a carbon budgeting system and the establishment of sector emissions targets

Published the Green Finance Taxonomy and JSE’s Sustainable Disclosure Guidance, prompting local financial institutions to publish climate-related policies and commitments

Multilateral development banks finance and explore local grid and energy storage reform in a more inviting environment, priming existing infrastructure for renewables integration and creating space for innovative grid technologies:

Concessional loans from the World Bank, AfDB and the New Development Bank funded Eskom’s Battery Energy Storage System (BESS), to install 1,440 MWh of grid-connected battery storage to improve reliability and absorb solar/wind fluctuations

A 2023 grant from the U.S. Trade and Development Agency enabled exploration of AI-enhanced grid management, energy storage integration, and cross-border electricity trading. The study was implemented by U.S. firm POWER to reduce load shedding and increase the grid’s renewables capacity

Engagement with the Chinese government, leveraging PowerChina’s expertise to upgrade high-voltage transmission and ‘smart distribution’ infrastructure bolsters local capacity for future renewable additions through modernizing Eskom’s existing infrastructure

Total Energy & Power Investments In South Africa 2020-2025 By Sector

It Takes Two to Tango: Targeted Partnerships Invigorate Innovation

In signalling global investor confidence, the JETP has attracted international and bilateral private sector collaboration targeted at scaling renewables generation, invigorating innovative development in renewables applications in mobility and battery production.

Envusa Energy is a joint venture between Anglo American and EDF Renewables to decarbonize Anglo American’s mining operations and add renewables generation to the national grid. Envusa is developing 600 MW of renewable capacity in its first phase, planning to scale up to 3 GW by 2030

Global independent power producers (IPPs) Enel Green Power (Italy), Scatec ASA (Norway), and Mainstream Renewable Power (Ireland) have secured over 7.7 GW in utility-scale wind and solar capacity through competitive auctions

Anglo American and ENGIE’s have collaborated on the world’s largest hydrogen-powered mining truck in 2022 and BMW South Africa and Vulcan Energy have invested in solar-powered EV charging networks and critical mineral supply chains from local renewables scaling

Foreign partners have invested in initiatives to grow local early-stage development capabilities:

Local mining councils partnered with the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in 2021 to foster research and development for advanced materials and sustainable mineral processing

The Hydrogen Valley Initiative, led by South Africa’s Department of Science and Innovation and partners like Anglo American, mapped potential hydrogen corridors and kicked off pilot projects ranging from forklifts to fuel cell bus routes

Universities such as the University of the Western Cape are partnering with global labs on battery storage developments that take local conditions into account

Invigorating investment in green hydrogen production/technology development, coordinated international efforts aim to capitalize on South Africa’s natural geographic suitability and influence future policy support:

$1B SA-H2 Fund launched alongside the Netherlands and Denmark (2023) to scale domestic green hydrogen production and position the country as a global export hub through mobilizing large-scale investments

German and South African bilateral Hydrogen Task Force, invested €23.1M in hydrogen “reference projects” including hydrogen-fuelled trucks, green ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel. Coordinated by KfW and South Africa’s IDC, financing aims to bridge funding gaps to attract private investors and value-chain development

Sasol’s various partnerships: Signed an MoU with ITOCHU to explore a green ammonia project in Northern Cape Town and partnered with ArcelorMittal South Africa to develop a hydrogen-powered “green steel” facility at Saldanha Bay

Picking Up Pace: Considerations As Plans Come to Fruition

Even with renewed financing, the JETP still contends with practical implementation hurdles. Accelerated planning has expanding the country’s pipeline of projects, inflating the partnership’s scale further than anticipated (no doubt contributing to the U.S.’s exit, among other factors). Financing continues to encounter distribution roadblocks with local companies (e.g., Eskom’s loan delays due to its debt). Green hydrogen’s absence from 2023’s IRP and local groups’ frustrations with the governments’ lack of transparency in developing related strategy complicates foreign interest in green hydrogen.

Local frustrations also extend into the private sector, as corporates struggle to connect with local innovators. Granted, we’ve seen recent initiatives that target local talent like certification and exchange programs facilitated by Germany’s GIZ and SARETEC for wind/solar engineers and a renewables training center/incubator for prospective innovators accompanying The World Bank’s initiative to convert former coal plant Komati Power Station into a solar PV/battery facility. Ultimately, time will tell if this groundwork laid by the JETP is enough to bridge the divide and inch innovators across the path to commercialization.

The technology combines fuel order management with live operational data, offering tighter control over resources and helping to meet carbon reduction targets.

It is a clear example of how better data usage can support sustainability in energy-intensive sectors.

As more airports adopt the i6 platform, the environmental impact of aviation fuelling is expected to lessen.

Future deployments include Dubai International, Birmingham and Singapore Changi, extending the reach of this digital-first approach.

Each airport added to the programme strengthens the case for digital fuel solutions in reducing emissions at scale.

“This is an exciting step forward in our partnership with Shell Aviation,” says Alex Mattos, Co-Founder and Managing Director at i6 Group.

“It demonstrates the tangible value of digital transformation and we’re thrilled to support Shell Aviation in delivering smarter fuel operations globally.”

Global expansion and local impact

Beyond Shell’s direct airport operations, the platform is also being extended through Shell Aviation Technical Services and Consultancy (TSA).

TSA provides support to fuelling companies within Shell’s network, helping them run safer and more efficient operations.

Now, these members can adopt i6’s cloud-based system, bringing the same digital upgrades to local and regional markets.

One of the first TSA member rollouts took place at Punta Cana International Airport in the Dominican Republic.

Key questions for Bailey and Edmond during the webinar were: Can aviation become sustainable and by when? Why does business aviation need to create its own narrative on sustainability? Will investment into new technologies continue? And, what regulatory hurdles will aviation face?

What is going to create real change in aviation and what time scales are realistic?

There is a lot of hype about hydrogen and new electric aircraft being developed Edmond noted. These new aircraft will come with time but will have initial drawbacks. For example, electric aircraft will initially be relatively small, regional aircraft while the notion of having hydrogen airliners that can transport a lot of people long distances is at least 20 years away .

A key feature of business aviation is that it provides access to flying when you want, where you want and with who you want. In the short term however, new alternatively fuelled aircraft will demand an entirely new airport fuelling infrastructure, therefore contrasting the advantages of business aviation in the short term.

Edmond predicts the biggest transformation over the next few years will come from sustainable fuel sources. SAF is going to be one of the hottest and most innovative developments in the industry to date. Whether influenced from mandates in the US and/or Europe, suppliers are actively exploring how to rapidly increase the production of SAF for market. The business aviation community is leading the way with SAF; one example is creating book and claim systems which has enabled the efficient uptake of SAF across the world .

Aviation needs to have its own narrative on sustainability. However, who should be leading this individual business or trade bodies like the BBGA?

As CEO of the BBGA, Bailey explained the industry is very interested in creating its own narrative. Our members are continually discussing the fact there is too much greenwashing in the media and not enough focus on the transformation aviation is currently going through .

The UK Government has announced its ambition to be a global leader in general aviation, however caution and realism are required. Bailey noted In order to be leaders we must make the UK highly attractive through the transformation process, which means we can t shut down aviation coming into the UK or do anything to undermine it. The narrative must explain that while we are working as a community to transition to electrification, hydrogen, and other new aircraft technologies, this takes time. It is important to demonstrate our progress and not destroy our industry while we are getting there .

Bailey went on to explain We asked students at Stansted College how they thought aviation was performing as an industry in terms of fuel burn and environmental impact; in a nutshell, they perceived aviation as the sinners of the universe.. Unfortunately, this view is shared widely outside of aviation. The wider public do not appreciate the comparatively small amounts aviation actually burns and what impact this has .

However, this is not a defence strategy Bailey explained. We can t simply react every time a question is asked in the media. We must get the narrative that says we want to move forward as quickly as we possibly can. We need to put ourselves in a position to be world leaders, and that means creating a different narrative .

In the commercial aviation sector, some airlines are taking a more proactive public narrative approach with clear statements about a movement away from carbon offsets (which have been widely discredited). EasyJet, for example, recently released a statement announcing they will no longer offset carbon emissions and instead invest funds into science-based targets initiative SPTI to focus on sustainable fuel. Edmond explained we see many airlines buying into the sustainable fuel narrative. This has also attracted the interest of airline leasing companies and other commercial aviation sectors, all wanting to be seen to invest in sustainable fuel production and to accelerate sustainable fuel availability .

Edmond noted There is a great opportunity for the business aviation community to come together and proactively own the narrative around sustainable aviation fuel and demonstrate it is more than greenwashing .

With multiple aircraft manufacturers competing for investment to develop new and sustainable aircraft, is there a risk this could this hinder global collaboration of new technologies to progress sustainable aviation quicker?

There are many different technology providers innovating in the sustainable fuel production business at the moment Edmond commented. While some early movers have established pathways and initial technologies, before investors provide large capital investment, they want to understand demand for the product and projected revenue. At present information on the demand for sustainable fuel and technologies that will result in sales is vague .

As SAF and new technologies develop it will become clearer to manufacturers where customer demand will come from and this will make investment easier. Further, it is likely that aviation will see a consolidation of small aviation development companies as larger businesses move quickly to acquire new technology ahead of rivals.

Do you feel there is a tension between the technological advances of aviation and the immediate politics of tax and regulation?

There is a current pressure on politicians to tax polluting industries. Bailey confirmed HMRC are under pressure and conflicted when it comes to aviation fuel taxes; if sustainability is to be driven forward in the UK, then the tax applied to aviation fuel has to be amended. Trying to get people to take up SAF is not an easy battle because there is a big price difference compared to normal aviation fuel; unfortunately, not everyone has the conscience we would like. We have an opportunity to drive the market forward into widespread use and distribution of SAF; we must ensure all sectors are taking sustainability seriously .

Willie Walsh, director general of the airline association IATA, has talked widely about public perception and acceptance of aviation. He has stressed that if airlines are to continue to fly and to develop, it will be contingent upon them taking environmental issues seriously.

More general aviation rules and policy are also being impacted by the pressure for aviation to become more sustainable. EU policy makers are preparing for a revision of the basic air services regulation; the rules much of commercial transport around Europe. It is clear these rules will be increasingly selective in what kind of aviation they want to support. Patrick noted it comes back to setting a narrative we must ensure aviation is working clearly and loudly toward a sustainable future rather than being perceived to be working against it .

The Energy Marketers of America (formerly, Petroleum Marketers Association of America) (“EMA”) submitted April 10th comments to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) addressing its:

…notice of intent to propose regulations (forthcoming regulations) implementing the clean fuels production income tax credits under § 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code (45Z), as added by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).

EMA initially states that it:

…supports expanding the availability and accessibility of biofuels, the guidance for Section 45Z—which defines key concepts and outlines rules for measuring carbon intensity—is unlikely to achieve its intended goal of reducing transportation costs for consumers.

The Clean Fuel Production Credit is a tax credit for clean fuel production. It is an income tax credit for the domestic production of clean transportation fuel and divided into two categories:

Sustainable aviation fuel.

Non-sustainable aviation transportation fuel.

The credit is equal to the product of:

The applicable amount per gallon (or gallon equivalent) for any transportation fuel that is produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility during the taxable year sold by the taxpayer in a qualifying sale; and,

The emissions factor for such fuel is determined under the Internal Revenue Code.

EMA describes itself as a federation of 49 state and regional trade associations representing family-owned and operated small business energy marketers throughout the United States. Its members are stated to be responsible for supplying 80% of all finished motor fuel and heating fuel products in the United States.

The Arkansas Oil Marketers Association is a state member of EMA.

EMA states that the proposed regulations fail to offer the economic incentives needed to drive greater adoption of biofuels. The organization identifies what it describes as “structural deficiencies” which include:

The shift in incentives from blenders to producers — and allocating added weight to aviation fuels —discourages energy marketers and retailers from including biofuel gallons into their sales portfolios.

The lack of harmonization between 45Z and the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) undermines compliance with volume mandates.

The barriers to pass-through mechanisms effectively cancel out the carbon reduction benefits of renewable heating oil.

The emissions rate model lacks a clear, consistent methodology for credit calculation.

To realize the full benefits of biofuel incentives, there must be alignment with infrastructure policy to ensure the safe and reliable availability of biofuels below the terminal rack.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15833_1120.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 10:57:03.740901

He called on governments and industry to remain focused on delivering the fundamental expectations of customers—safety and security, digitalization and sustainability.

“Whether supporting global trade, enabling e-commerce, or delivering vital humanitarian aid, the value of air cargo has never been clearer. To meet customer expectations and navigate an increasingly complex environment, the air cargo industry must continuously strengthen safety and security, fast-track digitalization, and deliver on its sustainability commitments,” Mr Sullivan said.

In terms of safety Mr Sullivan focused on the safe transport of lithium batteries and called on governments to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that comes increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” he said.

There was also a need for coordinated, risk-based measures for increased security and IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” Mr Sullivan said.

He also called for greater emphasis to be given to ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency.

The air cargo industry needed to continue to build sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics.

Momentum was also growing around reducing carbon emissions with more companies committing to sustainable aviation fuel.

Amid growing trade tensions, IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers, and economies.

“Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want,” Mr Sullivan said.",https://www.thedcn.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_512579389.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 11:56:39.106962

Nature play at any age Nature play is not limited to early childhood; these experiences benefit children at all stages.","Every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in Washington, D.C., peals of laughter ring from the Bird House exhibit. Children splash in the water, dig in the dirt, experiment with sand and build with moss and rocks at Little Critters: Nature Play. This free drop-in program gives children the opportunity to explore nature and early science concepts at their own pace and comfort level and in the company of their caregiver.

Nature play is a specialized type of nature-based learning that prioritizes child-directed, hands-on activities and emphasizes authentic interaction with nature and/or natural materials. It can take place outside but can also take place indoors by using loose, natural parts like sticks, leaves, rocks or soil. The flexibility of nature play means that it can be easily adapted to any environment and incorporated in schools or at home. Little Critters: Nature Play intentionally engages caregivers to build their comfort using natural materials so they can continue nature play at home.

Nature play activities also often incorporate imaginative play opportunities for children to play like animals and practice caretaking behaviors. This strengthens children’s developing sense of empathy and models how they can participate authentically in shaping and caring for the world around them.

More than fun

Though it may look like simple fun, nature play is underpinned by decades of research on its benefits. Introducing this type of play-based learning in nature during childhood has a long-term effect of increasing participation in pro-environmental behaviors in adulthood, according to a study from 2015 by Louise Chawla of the Environmental Design Program at the University of Colorado Boulder. These long-term benefits are particularly significant for young children from birth to age 8, as frequent, positive outdoor experiences during this period contribute to developing conceptions of the natural world as a desirable, valuable place. Reduced exposure to nature during this period can result in children developing fear or misunderstandings of nature, specifically surrounding certain less desirable parts of nature: bugs, dirt and germs.

These negative feelings can then perpetuate and systematize this feeling of nature as undesirable or other). Children growing up in urban environments with less immediate access to natural spaces can be at particular risk of developing fearful responses to wild places and feelings of anxiety, discomfort and disgust toward natural elements such as dirt, plants and animals, according to a 1994 study from Robert Bixler, et al. It is perhaps no wonder that nature play has been widely embraced by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and implemented at zoos, nature centers and schools around the world. At the Smithsonian’s National Zoo, nature play is at the core of our strategy for engaging and inspiring the next generation of learners and scientists.

The benefits of nature play are not limited to the connections that form between children and the natural world. The multisensory, experiential qualities inherent in nature play offer many different developmental and academic benefits when integrated into any learning environment:

Without the prescribed narratives and uses presented by built environments and materials, children have greater freedom to direct and create their play, strengthening decision-making skills and reinforcing self-confidence.

The sensory-rich experience of being outdoors (or bringing natural items inside) can make it accessible to a wider range of developmental levels, as children can approach and engage at their own pace and comfort level.

Activating experiential learning opportunities in nature has been shown to improve student outcomes in science, math, and language arts, according to a 2013 study by Dilafruz Williams and P. Scott Dixon.

Nature-based play provides a powerful opportunity to build empathy for other living things and the natural world through activities encouraging connection, comparison and consideration.

Using natural materials in the classroom instead of commercially produced materials (e.g., sticks and rocks instead of plastic blocks) helps build creative and critical pathways, strengthens symbolic representation skills, and enhances the future play value of these materials when encountered outside.

Nature play in your classroom

The benefits of nature play do not end with the students. Nature-based learning also offers teachers and caregivers one of our most treasured gifts: flexibility! Nature play can be activated in any environment, from rural to urban, and it does not require a special field trip. All it takes is stepping outside your school doors!

Don’t have a forest in your backyard? A patch of grass or puddles on a sidewalk can inspire nature-based learning. Take advantage of a sunny day to observe, measure, or sketch shadows on the playground or sidewalk as a part of your math, art, or science lessons. Spend time observing the shrubs outside your school entrance each day and identify new vocabulary words to describe any changes. Or create and illustrate stories about any insects students observe living in the shrubs; what changes do they see?

You and your students can also bring nature into your classroom with the outdoor treasures you collect or by using some of these supply and activity ideas.

Nature play at any age

Nature play is not limited to early childhood; these experiences benefit children at all stages. The Little Critters: Nature Play program about trees offers ways to adapt nature-based activities and is designed to engage students of various ages.

Early childhood (preschool)

Sensory play: Young children learn about the world around them through their senses. Sensory play is an important way to encourage sensory exploration. Try incorporating materials from trees that you can easily find outside (pinecones, acorns, branches, leaves) into sensory play stations to develop your students’ vocabulary. Need something academic to push sensory play to the next level? Encourage students to sort by type: can they group the pinecones together? Provide color-coded bowls for color sorting or labeled baskets for size sorting.

Early elementary (K-2)

Math manipulatives: Incorporate materials from trees as math manipulatives for easy, low-cost, nature-based learning. Instead of using plastic bears to count on a tens frame, provide your students with acorns to practice counting or other mathematical operations. Try using pinecones for informal measurement: how long is the table using pinecones instead of plastic measuring blocks? This will build your students’ comfort level with natural materials and also stimulate their creativity.

Late elementary (3-5)

Food chains/food qeb: Instead of drawing a food web on the whiteboard, take your students outside to observe the natural world: on the playground, on the sidewalk, on a trail, anywhere. Have students observe and illustrate any animal and plant interactions on a field notebook page. Are there birds eating seeds? Bugs nibbling leaves? Have each student document their food chain interaction and share as a group. Draw observations into a collective food web showing all the food chain interactions they witnessed on their outdoor adventure.

Middle school (6-8)

Exploring biodiversity: This activity will help your students practice scientific thinking and science skills while exploring the hidden biodiversity in your schoolyard. Find a spot under or near a tree to set up a “Biocube” and discover all the different organisms that live there.

Find more activities and learn more about nature play at the Smithsonian’s National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.

“Whether supporting global trade, enabling e-commerce, or delivering vital humanitarian aid, the value of air cargo has never been clearer. To meet customer expectations and navigate an increasingly complex environment, the air cargo industry must continuously strengthen safety and security, fast-track digitalization, and deliver on its sustainability commitments,” said Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo at the opening of the 18th World Cargo Symposium (WCS) in Dubai, UAE.

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Rogue Shippers

Safety is the top priority for air transport and in the case of air cargo the specific focus is on the safe transport of lithium batteries. IATA calls on government to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” said Sullivan.

Security: The Need for Coordinated, Risk-Based Measures

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes. This situation reinforces the importance of harmonized responses based on global standards.

“Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” said Sullivan.

Digitalization: Accelerating Industry-Wide Adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption IATA urged:

Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation

Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms

“ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognize ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks,” said Sullivan.

Sustainability: Commitment Strong, SAF Support Needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics. For example, IATA guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across the cargo supply chain is now reflected in operational standards.

Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge—reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use. The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.

However, SAF volumes remain far below what is needed, and production costs remain high. IATA urged governments to implement policy frameworks to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

“We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF—our strongest lever—has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking—or sidelining—planned investments in SAF. Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded. Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers,” said Sullivan.

Trade Tensions

Amid growing trade tensions, IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers, and economies.

“Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want,” said Sullivan.

Sullivan said: ""Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement.""

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes.

""Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

Digitalisation: Accelerating industry-wide adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance and transparency, the release added.

""The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption, IATA urged:

*Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation;

*Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements; and

*Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms.""

Sullivan said: ""ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72 percent of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognise ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks.""

Sustainability: Commitment strong, SAF support needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics, the release added.

""Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge—reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use. The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for SAF and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.""

Sullivan said: ""We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF - our strongest lever - has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking or sidelining planned investments in SAF. Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2-saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded. Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidising fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.""

Trade tensions worrying

IATA reinforced its position that trade drives prosperity, and that any measures undermining the free flow of goods ultimately hurt businesses, consumers and economies.

""Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want,"" said Sullivan.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/15/81002-aircargo07.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 11:56:42.285504

The job was for the Glenn ’65 and Heather Hilliard Endowed Professor of Environmental Sustainability. As intriguing as it appeared to him, Dwivedi was hesitant to apply, knowing he was still a freshly minted professor.

“I talked to a lot of other folks, family, friends, seniors, my advisors,” Dwivedi said. “They said this is a good opportunity; you should definitely go about it. So, after careful consideration, I applied for the position. I was really excited about it.”

After becoming a full professor in July 2024 at the University of Georgia, Dwivedi began his new position as Clemson’s Glenn ’65 and Heather Hilliard Endowed Professor of Environmental Sustainability on Aug. 15.

“It is a humbling experience to get this prestigious position,” Dwivedi said. “My lab at the Clemson University Department of Forestry and Environmental Conservation will be working on sustainable forestry issues in South Carolina and beyond to answer some critical questions for supporting a balance between prosperity, people and the planet. This is the exciting part about this position as it allows you to develop independent research projects in your area of expertise. This is also a great way to work with modern conservationalists like Glenn and Heather Hilliard to appreciate their vision for the state and the region overall.”

Glenn and Heather Hilliard started the endowed scholarship in 2010. Hilliard said growing up in the country and being involved in the Boy Scouts as a youngster showed him the importance of protecting the state’s forest lands, while also making them available to everyone for health, recreation and economic improvement.

“We believe that South Carolina is an absolutely spectacular and wonderful state that Heather and I love very much,” Glenn Hilliard said. “We want to do all we can do to keep it spectacular and wonderful. It’s filled with incredible natural and historic areas that certainly deserve to be identified and protected.

“I think the endowed professorship is environmentally going to help everything come together in a meaningful way and add value to a lot of work that’s already going on in this field. He is a world-class guy and really, really smart. I think he’s going to help us a lot. For Heather and I, one of our goals in life is to leave this world and our state a better and more beautiful place. We believe we can do it with this Clemson University professor because he’s going to be able to do that work long after we’re gone.”

Currently, Dwivedi’s research includes assessing the impact of federal conservation programs on ecosystem services and people, determining the role of urban forestry on the physical and mental well-being of city dwellers, as well as quantifying the role of wood-based sustainable aviation fuel in reducing wildfires. He is also starting new research programs on conservation and public health outcomes, forestry governance, climate-smart forestry and family forest landowners by working closely with faculty members at Clemson’s College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences, and beyond to highlight the role of sustainable forestry.

“There’s a lot of action on sustainable forestry. Many people are entrusted to use wood to make various products,” Dwivedi said. “I want to make sure we are undertaking high-quality research and, at the same time, we are educating people to ensure they are investing in new wood-based products and technologies.”

Since arriving at Clemson, Dwivedi has been meeting with other faculty members in the College of Agriculture, Forestry and Life Sciences to learn what projects they are working on. Those meetings will eventually expand to other colleges and universities in South Carolina.

“Then, I can see how to bring all of those ideas together in a single platform so that we can use all of those ideas in a cohesive manner to go for big proposals from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation to do more fundamental research to improve the sustainability of forest resources and further expand the markets of wood-based products to encourage people to participate in markets for ecosystem services to make sure everybody is getting benefits from the forest industry,” Dwivedi said.

In the meantime, Dwivedi has begun to establish his research lab. He currently has three postdoctoral research associates and two doctoral students. The first student is working on urban forestry and deliberating on policy initiatives needed for improving urban forestry management across the state. The other doctoral student is working on the management of wildfires and ways to plan for them to reduce economic and environmental losses. He also recruited seven more graduate students who will enroll at Clemson this fall to start their respective degree programs.

Dwivedi, who is from India, completed his undergraduate studies in mechanical engineering at Devi Ahilya University Institute of Engineering and Technology in 2003, but it wasn’t something he fully enjoyed. In looking at what he wanted to do in the future, Dwivedi stumbled upon forestry.

He received his master’s in forestry management in 2005 at the Indian Institute of Forest Management. After working in New Delhi for a year, Dwivedi realized he was interested in higher education and wanted to make that his career. His supervisor encouraged him to apply for the University of Florida’s doctorate program. He graduated with a doctorate in forest policy and economics in 2010.

Unable to find a faculty position due to tough market conditions, Dwivedi started as a postdoctoral research associate at Yale University for two years. After that, he worked as a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana for about a year. Dwivedi began working at the University of Georgia in 2013 where he was a faculty member for 11 years before coming to Clemson.

“He was a wonderful surprise,” Hilliard said. “I really enjoyed meeting him, first on the phone. I think he’s world-class. And I think South Carolina, Clemson and all are incredibly delighted that Puneet accepted the position. He’s a world-class environmentalist and professor. He’s going to play a major, important contributor to the important forestry business in South Carolina.”",https://news.clemson.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PuneetDwivedi1.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 08:56:07.300080

This year, the event takes place at a moment of transition for the industry and international relations, with tensions high due to tariffs and trade wars, demanding innovation, collaboration and world leadership.

The UAE Minister of Economy H.E. Abdulla Bin Touq Al Marri began the event, welcoming attendees to the three-day event and touching on the industry’s key priorities.

“We’re very proud to host this global gathering of thought leaders, industry innovators and the pivotal movement of aviation and logistics sectors as a global hub for connectivity, trade and innovation,” Al Marri stated.

“We want to take this opportunity to recognise the exceptional contribution of Emirates SkyCargo and all our national carriers and logistics players for their role in strengthening the UAE’s position.”

Pointing to the synergy between the UAE’s strategy and the focus points for the aviation industry, Al Marri highlighted the importance of connectivity, sustainability and partnership in the success of the sector.

“Let us use this forum to forge new partnerships, scale impactful solutions and turn our vision into globalisation, connectivity and free trade over fragmentation, polarisation and protectionism,” Al Marri declared.

Connecting through challenges

Recognising the nation’s role empowering connectivity, enabling resilience in supply chains and facilitating international cooperations, Al Marri highlighted how Dubai recorded a milestone moment in 2024 with over one million air traffic movements and the nation’s airport’s serving more than 40 million passengers.

“We’re seeing the sector expand rapidly, driven by surging e-commerce, increasing demand for just in time logistics and new marketing perishable and pharmaceuticals,” Al Marri stated. “On the other hand, we face confidence of global challenges, geopolitical volatility, tightening, revelations and historic imperative to decarbonise last and most recently, the global tariff conflict.”

Net Zero mission

Al Marri was clear in his opening that sustainability is also a key focus point for the industry, as it continues to aim to meet net zero by 2050 cargo: “The UAE recognises their responsibility and is acting decisively. As a recent host of the COP 28 summit, the UAE is advancing one of the most ambitious climate agendas in the global aviation dialogue.”

Looking to put sustainable aviation fuel front and centre, as the industry moves forward, the UAE has launched a SAF roadmap, which has set a target of producing 700 million litres of SAF annually by 2030.

“This could eliminate up to 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 emissions, while establishing the UAE as a region hub of sustainable aviation fuels,” Al Marri declared.

Innovation leads the industry

Recognised as an equally key part of the industry’s development is the introduction of digitalisation on a wider scale, from electronic airway bills and integrated logistics platforms to predictive analytics and AI enabled customs compliance.

“Technology is reshaping air cargo and it must embrace efficiency,” Al Marri said. “Visibility and traceability are no longer nice to have future. They are market expectations. Digital tools are critical, not just for competitiveness, but for regulatory compliance, especially in customs security and safety.”",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UAE-Minister.jpeg,N,,2025-04-15 08:56:17.333561

The report’s base case, the Economic Transition Scenario, finds robust adoption of clean power and electrification in road transport, growth in natural gas demand, and long-term decline in coal and oil could cut overall emissions by 22% by 2050

BNEF’s modeling indicates that emissions have potentially seen structural decline for the first time globally

LONDON, April 15, 2025 – Navigating the energy transition has never been more complex for investors and businesses as they face elevated policy risks and geopolitical tension. BloombergNEF’s (BNEF’s) New Energy Outlook 2025, published today, examines the strong case for clean energy technologies and how the global energy transition is expected to progress at the intersection of increasingly cost-competitive solutions and growing energy demand.

BNEF’s updated Economic Transition Scenario (ETS) maps out a route to a lower-carbon energy system in a world where cost-competitive technologies drive investment decisions to meet rising energy demand. Under this scenario, BNEF sees faster growth in power demand due to increased use of artificial intelligence, which presents both a major challenge and opportunity for businesses. According to the report, demand for electric power rises 75% by 2050 as economic development, electric vehicles, cooling needs and data centers increase overall use.

“Growing economies in Asia, the Middle East and Africa account for a large portion of the increase, David Hostert, global head of economics and modelling at BNEF, and lead author of the report, said. “It is here that the greatest opportunities for power infrastructure investment will lie. We expect data-center power demand in these markets to grow by six to 16 times by 2035 and reach 260 terawatt-hours.”

Specifically, data centers are emerging as one of the most important new sources of electricity demand, representing 4.5% of total global power demand in 2035 and rising to 8.7% in 2050. BNEF estimates that an additional 362 gigawatts of power generation capacity will be needed globally by 2035 to meet data-center demand. The US stands out as the single most important market in this trend. According to BNEF’s analysis in The US Data Center Market Outlook, which is also published today, US data centers are projected to grow from 3.5% of total electricity demand in 2024 to 8.6% by 2035 – a faster rise than any other major load class. Over the next five years, demand from US data centers could outpace even electric vehicles’ incremental demand, driven by the surge in AI training workloads that require significant compute capacity and highly energy-dense infrastructure.

In BNEF’s global ETS, renewables and electric vehicles continue to expand their role as they become more cost-competitive and maturing technologies drive faster adoption. Renewable generation increases 84% in the five years to 2030, and doubles again by 2050. Solar, wind and other renewable sources serve 67% of the world’s demand for electric power by 2050, up from 33% in 2024. Similarly, sales of passenger electric vehicles increase to 42 million in 2030 – up from 17.2 million in 2024 – and almost double again to 80 million in 2050. With the robust adoption of clean power and electrification in road transport in the coming decades, BNEF sees emissions in ETS fall 22% by 2050 (back to 2005 levels), a trajectory in line with global warming of 2.6C by 2100, with a 67% likelihood.

“Major investment and rapid deployment of clean energy technologies across markets is essential to materializing real change, said Matthias Kimmel, head of energy economics at BNEF and co-author of the report. “The total investment potential for renewables in our ETS is almost $6 trillion from 2025 to 2035, and $10.55 trillion from 2025 to 2050. Policy makers and investors should continue to take advantage of readily available solutions like renewables, storage and electric vehicles, and capitalize on emerging opportunities surrounding energy supply and security.”

While electrification helps deliver a 40% reduction in oil consumption in the transport sector by mid-century, gas plays a larger role in the ETS due to lower long-term fuel price expectations and higher electricity demand from data centers. Specifically, global natural gas demand increases 25% from 2024 to 2050. Meanwhile, unlike renewables and EVs, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage, clean fuels and low-carbon industrial processes all struggle to make an impact in the ETS.

The report also provides a comparison to BNEF’s previously published Net Zero Scenario (NZS), which charts a pathway to global net zero by 2050 and global warming of 1.75 degrees Celsius. The NZS calls for much faster deployment of clean technologies: by 2035, there are 16 terawatts of wind and solar installed globally, versus 12.6TW in the ETS. The passenger EV fleet is twice as large by 2035, at 952 million vehicles on the road. Nuclear power capacity rises above 750GW, hydrogen to 159 million metric tons, and demand for sustainable aviation fuel jumps to nearly 40 billion gallons, as multiple sectors race to decarbonize faster.

This year’s New Energy Outlook also contains a section focused on the 10 years to 2035, the year when countries will submit the third round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement, which are due this year in advance of COP30 in Brazil. While many countries have yet to share their emissions pledges, the report indicates that markets like the EU, Australia and South Korea need to target roughly a 70% reduction in emissions by 2035 to align to the NZS.

Other findings in the report include:

The need to scale key technologies like renewable energy, electric vehicles, battery energy storage, carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, sustainable fuels, heat pumps, grid infrastructure and more to reach net-zero emissions.

The investment volumes needed to achieve both the base case ETS ($185 trillion) and NZS ($213 trillion) and why there’s only a 15% difference between the two pathways.

,,2025-04-15 11:52:35+00:00,www.dentons.com,The challenge of project financing Europe's SAF projects - Dentons,Not Available,,,,,https://www.dentons.com/en/insights/articles/2025/april/15/the-challenge-of-project-financing-europes-saf-projects,"This article considers certain key challenges that have emerged with respect to the project financing of the early SAF projects in Europe or which are targeting export to Europe.
Airlines (the end-users of SAF) do not typically forward-hedge their fuel requirements beyond two to three years, making a long-term, fixed-price offtake agreement (that project finance lenders typically require) difficult to secure for a SAF project.
This competition for feedstock also adds a greater level of uncertainty to its cost and value in SAF production.
The most-proven technology for SAF production is the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses bio feedstocks.
Ideally, the costs of compliance with a change in SAF regulatory requirements (i.e.","In the era of ""Net Zero"", much legislation has evolved from the EU with respect to the imposition of mandatory decarbonisation targets and the composition of lower-carbon fuels.

One area of focus has been the aviation sector, which accounts for approximately 2.5% of global CO2 emissions.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation seeks to decarbonise the sector by imposing obligations on fuel suppliers, certain EU airports and aircraft operators to respectively supply, facilitate access to and lift sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Financial institutions also have greater internal mandates to support the development of sustainable projects.

However, notwithstanding the regulatory requirements for SAF production and usage, and the appetite in the market for projects to be developed, the number of project-financed SAF projects that have reached final investment decision remains low compared to the scale-up of the industry required to meet the EU's regulatory targets.

Many major airlines have also announced voluntary targets in terms of the proportion of SAF they are looking to incorporate into their aviation fuels mix.

This article considers certain key challenges that have emerged with respect to the project financing of the early SAF projects in Europe or which are targeting export to Europe.

How does the EU define SAF?

SAF is a ""drop-in"" fuel, meaning it can be blended with conventional jet fuel to reduce the carbon intensity of the aircraft's fuel batch.

It can be safely used by all aircraft and engines that are certified to operate with jet fuel, meaning SAF can already be used in the majority of operational aircraft, giving it a strategic advantage over other clean fuels which require aircraft to be fitted with different engines.

While SAF still contains carbon, and therefore emits CO2 when combusted, if the SAF is produced using certain sustainable pathways, it is not considered to be as carbon-intensive as conventional jet fuels.

The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation defines SAF as:

an aviation biofuel – liquid fuel produced from prescribed biomass sources such as cooking oil, animal manure or palm oil mill effluent which are not excluded sources (such as food and feed crops);

a synthetic aviation fuel, or e-fuel – fuels (such as e-SAF) made by synthesising green hydrogen with captured CO2 that fulfil the criteria for renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBO) under the Renewable Energy Directive III; or

a recycled carbon aviation fuel – produced from waste streams of non-renewable origin that meets the requirements of RED III (e.g. jet fuel made from synthetic crude oil derived from municipal solid waste).

Regulatory mandates for SAF usage

Given the cost differential between conventional jet fuel and SAF (in particular e-SAF), regulatory intervention is required to stimulate demand.

An example of this is the EU's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation which imposes the following targets:

aviation fuel suppliers must supply fuel to aircraft operators at EU airports containing an average minimum SAF share (2% from 1 January 2025, rising to 6% by 2030 and thereafter in increments to 70% by 2050);

SAF should contain a minimum amount of RFNBO (1.2% by 2030, rising in increments to 28% by 2050);

applicable aircraft operators are required to uplift at least 90% of their annual fuel requirements from an EU airport (to avoid tankering at airports outside the EU to avoid lifting SAF); and

airport managing bodies must facilitate access to aviation fuel containing the minimum SAF blend (for example, by having the required infrastructure for SAF storage and transmission to aircraft).

The effectiveness of this regulation in promoting the evolution of the aviation fuel market is due to be reviewed by the European Commission by 1 January 2027.

Key challenges of project financing SAF projects

Offtake

While the airline travel industry has in many respects recovered from COVID-19 travel lockdowns, many are not in the financial position to commit to a long-term offtake agreement for SAF, while prices are significantly higher than conventional jet fuel.

Airlines (the end-users of SAF) do not typically forward-hedge their fuel requirements beyond two to three years, making a long-term, fixed-price offtake agreement (that project finance lenders typically require) difficult to secure for a SAF project.

Even if an environmentally-conscious airline can agree to stretch their SAF purchase commitment to, for example, 10 years, this would still leave a large, uncontracted tail for a long-term debt tenor of perhaps 20-25 years (which producers will try to achieve to lower their production costs for the larger SAF projects).

Lenders will struggle to lend to a project with significant uncontracted exposure at the back-end. A potential solution to bridge the gap would be to interpose an intermediary (aggregator) of sufficient creditworthiness between the SAF producer (selling long term) and end-customer(s) (buying short/mid-term).

Trading houses may find this risk profile attractive as it allows potentially lucrative upside if SAF demand surges as the reality of regulatory compliance becomes clear.

Larger projects may also find it difficult to secure one offtaker for the entirety of the plant's production and a sole offtaker's balance sheet might not be sufficiently strong to underpin a large-scale financing.

These projects may therefore enter several offtake arrangements with different buyers (potentially from different sectors) to spread the credit risk.

Bullish SAF producers may seek to have an uncontracted portion of their production sold on the spot market, to capitalise on forecasted demand as the SAF mandates ramp up.

As discussed above, lenders will be reluctant to take significant merchant exposure for a new sector and any limited merchant offtake strategy will need to be supported by detailed marketing analysis and considered implications for debt-sizing.

SAF valuation

The long-term valuation of SAF is currently impossible as the premium for SAF is too uncertain to establish a reliable value.

The SAF price will be a function of demand, largely driven by uncertain regulatory drivers, and supply which combines feedstock costs and production costs.

Levelised cost models may provide some price guidance for the various production pathways, but can only reflect the current understanding and costs base, not a guarantee of future project economics.

In the absence of any well-established pricing index for SAF, project finance lenders will likely require offtake to be on a fixed-cost basis (or by reference to another commodity index with which lenders are familiar and comfortable).

Feedstock supply and pricing

For SAF produced from biogenic sources, there are concerns around competition for feedstock supply in light of other EU-mandated targets that also require the use of biogenic feedstocks for other fuels.

This competition for feedstock also adds a greater level of uncertainty to its cost and value in SAF production. As is customary, lenders will expect a long-term feedstock supply arrangement from a credible and reliable source (meeting the EU's strict eligibility criteria) and a back-up plan in case of critical feedstock unavailability.

For e-SAF requiring CO2, sources of eligible CO2 are also limited by regulation. Biogenic CO2 is most readily available. However, there may be project-on-project risk in the event a SAF project is relying on the delivery of a biogenic CO2 from newly built processing facilities outside the project perimeter. There is an overall challenge around whether there will be sufficient biogenic CO2 available for e-SAF production.

For both e-SAF and bio-SAF, the CO2 supply and other biogenic feedstock supply, respectively, will need to comply with the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction and sustainability criteria under RED III and the delegated acts (adding an additional layer of cost and complexity to these projects). Lenders will perform detailed due diligence and GHG modelling to ensure the SAF will meet the EU's regulatory requirements.

The route to market for SAF production into aviation supply to airports will also need to be considered, such as which market the SAF is best suited for, where it might be blended and what logistics are therefore required.

SAF technology

Uncertain and competitive production technologies make it more difficult to provide lenders with the certainty they crave to finance projects.

The most-proven technology for SAF production is the hydrotreated esters and fatty acids (HEFA) process, which uses bio feedstocks. This places production economics in direct competition with hydrotreated vegetable oil and bio-diesel.

While certainty of production costs makes for easier financing, European regulations limit the proportion of HEFA-based SAF in the mandates over time, in order to encourage development of other technologies.

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) has the advantage of access to large volumes of feedstock i.e. ethanol. A first-scale production plant started in the past year in the US, where ATJ is seen as a viable SAF pathway, subject to meeting carbon intensity targets.

RED III, however, caps the amount of biofuels produced from food/feed crops that can count towards the EU's decarbonisation targets for the transport sector (currently at 7%). As most bio-ethanol is produced from starch-rich crops, SAF using bio-ethanol may have less value in the EU market.

Given the fluidity of the market and the number of competing technologies, lenders are likely to favour SAF projects using technology that has a wide product slate and which can pivot to produce an alternative clean fuel (such as synthetic diesel or gasoline), should market conditions change.

While the technology used for e-SAF production (including electrolysers for green hydrogen, Fischer-Tropsch for hydrogen and CO2 synthesis) is proven at a smaller scale, additional risks are introduced when the technology is scaled up and integrated.

Lenders will undertake a rigorous technical due diligence and examine the robustness of the construction contractual arrangements (see below).

Construction

Given the integration of different technologies, SAF construction procurement may follow similar pathways to industrial downstream projects – whether to go down the single lump-sum turnkey engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract approach or procure the different components separately through an engineering, procurement and construction management contracting strategy (and lower construction costs and, ultimately, SAF costs).

Since the sector is nascent, lenders are likely to be more stringent in requiring an EPC contractor to provide a full technology ""wrap"" for the project.

Utilities access

SAF projects will need to consider any baseload power requirements not supplied by their dedicated renewable energy sources, such as any cooling and storage equipment requiring round-the-clock power.

Depending on location, using power from the grid may create issues in meeting the overall GHG emissions reduction requirements in EU legislation.

Lenders may be more comfortable supporting projects in locations where renewable sources are in abundance or where the average share of renewable energy in the grid exceeds 90% (in which case power can be taken directly from the grid and still be considered ""green"").

Non-HEFA SAF production is expected to be intense in terms of water requirements, meaning that this key utility needs consideration to determine plant and site feasibility.

Regulatory risk

The regulatory environment governing SAF is continuing to evolve and is extremely complex and uncertain. For instance, the pending review of the ReFuelEU Regulation in 2027 is creating apprehension on matters such as penalties.

More generally, given the extensive lobbying around the RED III sustainability requirements for clean fuels, projects can expect the change in law risk to feature prominently in lender due diligence.

Ideally, the costs of compliance with a change in SAF regulatory requirements (i.e. the further tightening of sustainability criteria for SAF) should be passed to the offtaker (SAF customer) under the offtake contract, as the end-user will ultimately only be interested in buying SAF to the extent it complies with the then-current SAF requirements in its market.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has called for urgent and coordinated global efforts to reinforce the resilience of the air cargo sector, stressing the need to meet evolving customer expectations through enhanced safety, digital transformation and sustainability measures.

Speaking at the opening of the 18th World Cargo Symposium in Dubai, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, Brendan Sullivan, highlighted the crucial role of air cargo in global trade, humanitarian support and e-commerce, urging governments and industry stakeholders to act decisively across key areas.

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Non-Compliant Shippers

Top of the agenda was safety—particularly regarding the transport of lithium batteries, which Sullivan identified as a growing concern. “The risks from undeclared or mis-declared lithium battery shipments are increasing,” he warned, calling on governments to enhance oversight and enforcement to support ICAO’s Annex 18 regulations.

Security: Need for Harmonised Global Measures

Sullivan also addressed the fragmented approach to air cargo security in the wake of recent incidents involving incendiary devices. IATA urged for globally aligned, risk-based measures and emphasised the importance of timely intelligence-sharing between states to mitigate threats effectively.

“Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures,” Sullivan said. “Global standards and cooperation are essential.”

Digitalisation: Push for ONE Record Implementation

On the digital front, IATA reaffirmed the importance of the “ONE Record” initiative, a standard for digital data exchange across the air cargo supply chain. With airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volumes already onboard, Sullivan called on governments to formally recognise the standard in regulatory filings.

“ONE Record transforms how we manage and share data, improving efficiency and compliance. But its full benefits depend on universal adoption,” he said.

Sustainability: More Action Needed on SAF

Sullivan noted the industry’s increasing efforts to embed sustainable practices, such as phasing out single-use plastics and implementing carbon-reduction measures. However, he expressed frustration over the slow progress in scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), citing high production costs and lack of policy support.

“We’re committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but we can’t do it alone,” Sullivan said. “Governments must act now with policy frameworks that encourage SAF production, just as they did with solar and wind energy.”

Trade Tensions and Global Prosperity

Finally, IATA warned against rising protectionism and trade restrictions, emphasising the role of air cargo in supporting economic growth.

“Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are,” Sullivan concluded. “Whatever the outcome of current trade tensions, air cargo will remain essential in keeping the world connected.”

The fire at one of the substations that provides power to Heathrow provided a reminder of the many hundreds of flights that the airport handles every day. Chancellor Reeves justified the recent government announcement supporting a series of airport expansions by stating that 'sustainable aviation fuel' (SAF) was a 'game changer' that will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 70 per cent.

It is planned that the SAF content will increase to 22 per cent by 2040 by which time it is forecast that passenger numbers will have doubled, equating globally to 200,000 flights day consuming over 18 million barrels of aviation fuel.

This will necessitate the use of multiple sources of feedstock such as municipal waste, sewage and a vast area of land dedicated to growing bioenergy crops.These are already grown on a massive scale to provide the E10 element in the petrol, thus further reducing the area of land available for growing food.

Alternatively SAF could be produced in the form of green hydrogen but this would require up to 3.4 times more wind and solar capacity than at present.

Clearly the Chancellor has not taken the trouble to read the report from the Royal Society which concludes that this course of action could be up to 69 per cent more carbon intensive than using standard kerosene jet fuel and could result in 'unacceptable collateral ecological damage'.

Airline operators may be keen to be seen as environmentally responsible but in reality they and the Chancellor are hiding behind another green smokescreen that fails to stand up to robust scrutiny.","https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjk3NTU3OTk0LTY0ZGMtNGMyYS04ZDlhLTMyZTNjNGJhYTIxNDoyYWQxYzhlNS05N2E3LTRlYTQtYjJmMi02NTZjNmQ1ZDM3YzI=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-04-15 07:56:08.001852

But international trade tensions were growing. And any measures that hampered the free flow of goods would, in the end, hurt economies, businesses and consumers.

“Current trade tensions are deeply concerning,” he said. “Trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want.”

Another challenge to the sector was posed by the need to combat climate change and protect the environment, which could together be subsumed under the rubric of sustainability. And the air cargo industry was continuing to entrench sustainability into all its operations, assured IATA. The sector was acting to reduce waste, phase out single-use plastics, and institute circular practices. Indeed, IATA had issued guidance, that was now reflected in operational standards, on the elimination of single-use plastics across the air cargo supply chain.

Further, there was the need to reduce aircraft-generated carbon emissions. Critical to this was the development, production and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). This was making progress. To further stimulate SAF production, IATA had recently launched a SAF Registry, operated by the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (more usually known as CADO, and which was created by IATA just for this purpose).

Safety: Zero Tolerance for Rogue Shippers

Safety is the top priority for air transport and in the case of air cargo, the specific focus is on the safe transport of lithium batteries. IATA calls on government to step up efforts to stop rogue shippers and support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention - the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

“Shipments of lithium batteries are growing in volume. With that come increased risks associated with undeclared or mis-declared goods. The industry has invested in training, certification, and technology. Governments must match that commitment with robust oversight and enforcement,” said Sullivan.

Security: The Need for Coordinated, Risk-Based Measures

IATA reinforced calls to governments for a coordinated, risk-based approach to air cargo security following recent incidents involving incendiary devices concealed in shipments. While some states implemented new measures, the lack of alignment led to inconsistent outcomes. This situation reinforces the importance of harmonized responses based on global standards.

“Recent security incidents highlight the need for better coordination among governments. Aviation security cannot be built on fragmented or reactionary measures. Global standards and cooperation are essential,” said Sullivan.

IATA also renewed its call to states to fulfill their Annex 17 obligations by sharing timely and accurate threat intelligence to enable informed risk assessments and operational decisions.

“The industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. But governments have infinitely more resources, particularly in intelligence gathering. The best results come when governments and industry work together,” said Sullivan.

Digitalization: Accelerating Industry-Wide Adoption of ONE Record

IATA reinforced the central role of ONE Record as the industry’s standard for end-to-end digital data exchange, supporting improved efficiency, compliance, and transparency. The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data. To accelerate industry adoption IATA urged:

Airlines and forwarders to move forward with implementation

Governments to recognize ONE Record in regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build secure, open, and compatible digital platforms

“ONE Record is a foundational shift in how we share, manage, and trust data across the supply chain. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned. To achieve full value, implementation must accelerate across all stakeholders, and governments must recognize ONE Record in their regulatory frameworks,” said Sullivan.

Sustainability: Commitment Strong, SAF Support Needed

The air cargo industry continues to embed sustainability into its operations, with growing efforts to reduce waste, implement circular practices, and phase out single-use plastics. For example, IATA guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across the cargo supply chain is now reflected in operational standards.

Progress is also being made on the sector’s largest environmental challenge - reducing carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is growing, with new agreements across the value chain and more companies committing to SAF use.

The SAF Registry, recently launched and operated by CADO, is designed to enable a global market for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and accelerate the industry's transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. In addition, IATA will soon launch CO2 Connect for Cargo to support accurate emissions calculation and reporting, including SAF usage.

However, SAF volumes remain far below what is needed, and production costs remain high. IATA urged governments to implement policy frameworks to scale up SAF production and reduce costs.

“We are committed to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. But the ramp-up of SAF - our strongest lever - has been disappointing. The major fuel producers have been slow-walking - or sidelining - planned investments in SAF,"" said Sullivan.

""Aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen-powered aircraft. And governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.

""Instead, they send mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction while aiming for net zero. Airlines are committed and determined but we cannot do it alone. We need action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers,” said Sullivan.

Earlier this year, Brazil’s national energy council decided to pause a planned increase in the blend due to concerns that it could drive up food prices. With inflation already a key issue, the government feared the change could affect public perception and further dent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva’s declining approval ratings. Inflation stood at 5.48% for the 12 months through March, well above the central bank’s 3% target.

Now, the situation has shifted. “With vegetable oil prices falling again, the conditions are right for the government to move forward with the blend increase,” Amaral said during an event in São Paulo. He pointed to improved global supply and demand for vegetable oils as a key factor behind the price drop.

“The industry has the capacity, we’re increasing crushing operations, everything is ready,” he said. “It’s now up to the government, and we hope the decision comes soon.”

The Ministry of Mines and Energy did not respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.

The original goal was to hit a 50% reduction by 2030—but Volotea now believes it could reach that milestone as early as 2025.
However, leaders in the aviation sector, including Volotea, stress the need for supportive policies to scale up SAF use.","Sustainable aviation fuel is taking center stage in Europe’s efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and Volotea is stepping firmly into the spotlight. The European low-cost carrier has announced a new agreement with TotalEnergies to purchase up to 7.5 million liters of SAF between 2025 and 2029. This cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel will power the airline’s flights departing from French airports, marking a significant step forward in eco-friendly air travel.

Unlike traditional fossil-based jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel is produced from waste materials such as used cooking oils and animal fats. It’s already compatible with today’s aircraft engines and fueling systems, meaning no special modifications are needed. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), using 100% SAF can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by as much as 90% over its lifecycle compared to conventional fuel. While SAF is currently blended with kerosene in practice, its potential to transform the aviation industry is massive.

Volotea’s decision to invest in SAF is part of a broader strategy to reduce its carbon footprint. The airline has been rolling out multiple initiatives over the past several years to improve sustainability and limit its environmental impact. In 2024, it achieved a 47% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometer compared to 2012. The original goal was to hit a 50% reduction by 2030—but Volotea now believes it could reach that milestone as early as 2025.

This early progress reflects not just internal company goals, but the broader momentum in France and Europe toward low-carbon travel. France is actively working on developing infrastructure to produce SAF domestically. However, leaders in the aviation sector, including Volotea, stress the need for supportive policies to scale up SAF use. Incentive systems could help encourage innovation and investment in production, research, and distribution networks.

For TotalEnergies, the agreement demonstrates a growing ability to provide cleaner fuel solutions to partners committed to the energy transition. SAF is expected to play a critical role in the future of aviation, especially as pressure mounts to curb emissions without reducing flight frequency or access.

As more airlines follow Volotea’s lead, the skies over Europe could begin to look a little greener—not in color, but in carbon.",https://www.rustourismnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Volotea.webp,N,,2025-04-15 07:56:29.659783

Good morning, and welcome to the 18th World Cargo Symposium here in Dubai. A big thank you to Emirates SkyCargo and dnata for hosting us in this dynamic and vibrant city. It's always a pleasure to return to the Middle East, a region that plays a vital role in global air cargo connectivity, innovation, and resilience.

I want to start by sharing a story.

Since October 2023, attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea brought one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes to a standstill. Supply chains were disrupted. Deliveries were delayed. Shockwaves were felt across global trade routes. Among the affected cargo was a shipment of vital medical supplies headed for clinics in Sudan and Yemen that were under strain from conflict and shortages.

With ocean freight stalled and the humanitarian clock ticking, relief organizations, had to act fast.

Direct Relief, one of the groups involved, made a crucial decision to shift part of the shipment from sea to air.

When the global supply chain stumbled, air cargo proved its agility—adapting, responding, and delivering.

That’s what we do. In moments of uncertainty, we bring reliability. When others stall, we keep moving. When time is critical, air cargo delivers. And we have seen that yet again as the world rushes to get relief supplied to Myanmar in the aftermath of March’s earthquake.

Of course, these are extreme circumstances. But they’re a powerful reminder of air cargo’s vital role—day in, day out—beyond the headlines of conflicts and relief efforts. On an average day, 180,000 tonnes of goods reach their destination by air. This is the lifeblood of global trade—driving growth, creating jobs, and spreading prosperity.

Current trade tensions are deeply concerning. It’s no secret—we believe trade drives prosperity. The more the world trades, the better off we all are. So, whatever the resolution of current trade tensions is, we know that air cargo will be there to deliver the goods people need and want. And to do that it is critical that we remain focused on the fundamental expectations of our customers—that we are safe, operate with modernized processes and are driving towards sustainability.

Today, I want to speak not just about policy or performance metrics—but about the real stories behind these priorities. Stories that illustrate how safety, digitalization and sustainability are driving our business today and into the future.

Safety & Security — The Battery That Wasn’t Declared

To start, let me take you to a cargo terminal in East Asia. A routine inspection. The airwaybill listed “mobile phone accessories” which is nothing out of the ordinary. But one package caught an inspector’s attention. It contained damaged, undeclared lithium batteries. The successful intervention of the inspector stopped a serious safety risk, that was just hours away from being loaded onto an aircraft.

And that happened because of our industry’s safety culture and the supports we have put in place. The inspector had just completed IATA’s dangerous goods training. He was helped by DG AutoCheck which caught the mismatch between what was declared and what was in the box. And the airline’s station was CEIV Lithium Batteries-certified, meaning strong, consistent processes were in place.

Shipments of lithium batteries continue to surge. More and more people are using devices powered by lithium batteries, with ever increasing amounts of stored energy— in addition to phones, cameras and tablets, we are seeing bigger batteries in power tools, e-bikes, and drones. As those shipments increase in number, the number of incidents or potential incidents will rise unless we are even more vigilant. We must step-up our efforts even further…

First, by stopping rogue shippers: Too many lithium battery shipments enter the system undeclared or mis-declared. That’s unacceptable. It puts aircraft at risk. It puts lives at risk. Civil aviation authorities must take firm enforcement action against non-compliant shippers. And we need governments to actively support ICAO’s work to strengthen Annex 18—the global framework for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air.

Second, we must ensure that training is rigorous, and compliance is universal. Last year over 85,000 professionals were trained through IATA’s Competency-Based Training and Assessment (CBTA) Center for Dangerous Goods. Our CEIV Lithium Batteries certification continues to expand—raising the bar across the supply chain, with 121 organizations already on board. From manufacturers and shippers to freight forwarders and airlines, every link in the chain must be competent, informed, and accountable.

Setting the Standard in Air Cargo

Let me take a moment to talk about CEIV, IATA’s Center of Excellence for Independent Validators. Now in its 10th year, CEIV is transforming how the industry handles specialized cargo by embedding compliance into everyday operations through rigorous, standardized training and assessment.

Since the launch of the first CEIV for Pharma in 2014, the program has expanded to include Live Animals, Fresh, and Lithium Batteries—each raising the bar in handling, transparency, and trust.

We’re seeing real impact:

Over 600 companies across 65 countries are CEIV Pharma-certified

More than 250,000+ trade lanes operate using CEIV standards

99% of certified companies say CEIV fosters a culture of continuous improvement

This is the future of air cargo standards—collaborative, transparent, and constantly advancing. We thank the industry for their trust, as together, we continue building the foundation of a modern safety culture.

Security: An Evolving Threat Landscape

Just as safety demands vigilance, so does security.

Civil aviation must never be used as a pawn in geopolitical disputes. Acts like forcing down aircraft or hiding incendiary devices in cargo must be condemned—clearly and without exception.

Following recent incidents where incendiary devices were concealed in packages and ignited, some States imposed new security measures. But without coordination, responses were inconsistent. Some were ineffective. Others were later reversed. It was far from the joined-up risk-based approach based on global standards that was needed.

IATA developed guidance to help airlines and supply chain partners manage the incendiary device threat—guidance that was endorsed across the industry. And we continue to collaborate closely with ICAO and its member states, the TSA, the European Commission and other civil aviation authorities in support of coordinated, proportionate, and effective policy responses. We urge states to live up to their Annex 17 obligations, to share baseline factual threat information so that airlines can assess risks and respond effectively.

Whether it is safety or security, the industry is best placed to understand its operations and the associated safety and security risks. And the best results come when governments and industry work together—collaboratively and transparently—to create and implement the global standards that have guided our industry for over a century.

Digitalization

Let’s shift gears to digitalization and another story that you will all be familiar with. A fire at an electrical substation closed a major airport hub in Northern Europe..... no prizes for guessing which one. A flight carrying a time-critical pharmaceutical shipment, destined for a cancer clinic in the country, was unable to land. Every hour counted.

Thanks to integrated digital systems, the shipment was instantly rerouted. Customs documentation was adjusted in real time. Tracking updates from a verified data logger verified through the IATA Air Cargo Device Assessment Program reassured both the shipper and the consignee that the shipment was still in good condition. And most importantly—the patient received their treatment on time.

That’s the power of digitalization in the future. If safety is our foundation, digitalization is our accelerator. It makes us faster, more transparent, and more resilient.

But digitalization is not just about speed. It is also about helping navigate an increasingly fragmented regulatory environment. Airlines are expected to comply with advance data requirements in the jurisdictions they operate to. These requirements are growing in number and complexity, increasing risks of inconsistent implementation or compliance. And when things go wrong, airlines can face penalties as high as USD 100,000 per violation. Not the governments that created system complexity. And not the supply chain partner who submitted erroneous data to the airline.

This fragmented data environment is especially challenging for e-commerce shipments, where multiple house waybill filings can conflict with the airline’s master air waybill.

This is where ONE Record comes in.

ONE Record enables seamless, end-to-end data exchange across the entire supply chain. It cuts out duplication, closes data blind spots, and strengthens compliance with regulatory requirements.

The industry’s goal is clear: by January 2026, ONE Record will become the preferred method of sharing data.

And we’re well on the way. Airlines representing 72% of global air waybill volume are on track to implement it. More than 100 IT providers and 10,000 freight forwarders are already aligned.

Open-source tools like NE:ONE, supported by a German government backed consortium, are making it easier for smaller players to adopt this standard. The goal is a single source of truth for every shipment—reducing ambiguity, error, and the risk of sanctions.

But implementation must accelerate. We urge:

Airlines and forwarders to act now and implement ONE Record

Governments to accept ONE Record in their regulatory data filing requirements

Developers to build compatible, secure, and open platforms

At the same time, digitalization isn’t one-size-fits-all. As air cargo advances on its digital journey, our standards must evolve with it. LAR Verify—our new web-based portal for live animal transport—is a prime example. It provides instant access to destination-specific regulations, helping improve compliance, enhance animal welfare, and reduce risk. It’s a clear model for how targeted digital tools can meet the specific needs of specialized cargo while supporting the broader vision of a fully digital, connected supply chain.

Beyond Documents: Toward Real-Time Visibility

Digitalization is not just about replacing paper with pixels. It’s also about culture. Our Digitalization Leadership Charter combined with the Digital Cargo Alliance brings together close to 40 signatories around shared principles: interoperability, data security, sustainability, and innovation.

And across IATA, we are exploring the potential of AI, insourcing digital talent, launching proof-of-concepts, and prioritizing cybersecurity.

Why does this matter? Because digitalization enables us to anticipate disruption—not just react to it. It empowers us to serve customers better, comply with regulators more easily, and reduce friction in global trade.

It is, in short, how we future-proof our industry.

Sustainability

The third pillar is sustainability.

Let me tell you one final story- a bit closer to home - illustrating our commitment to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

A Hokkaido scallop that was harvested in Japan yesterday morning will be eaten in Nobu, a Japanese restaurant in Dubai. This journey is remarkable—not just for its speed, but for the steps taken to reduce its environmental footprint. More than that, it represents a global supply chain that connects producers—whether from mature or emerging markets—to international customers, supporting livelihoods and driving economic growth around the world.

This scallop, together with other fresh produce from Japan, was flown on an Emirates aircraft partly powered by Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced in Singapore, recorded through the just-launched SAF Registry that enables SAF book & claim.

The shipment followed IATA’s CEIV Fresh standards—ensuring temperature-controlled handling that reduced waste and spoilage. It travelled in reusable and recyclable packaging and was handled by dnata ground crews using efficient, low-emissions enhanced GSEs.

For the shipper, this wasn’t just seafood—it was a promise to deliver quality produce with minimal cost to the environment.

And this goal is shared across the air cargo industry.

The air cargo industry is embracing sustainability principles, in-flight and on the ground. Waste reduction and the implementation of circularity strategies have become part of the standard way in which we conduct our operations.

Airlines and handlers are focusing on alternatives to plastic, focusing on reduction, reuse and recycling. As an example, Atlas Air, now reuses shredded cardboard as packaging material, significantly reducing plastic waste.

IATA has issued guidance to eliminate single-use plastics across aviation and the cargo supply chain and included these principles into handling standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

We're also taking action to address our biggest environmental cost: carbon emissions. Momentum around Sustainable Aviation Fuel is growing fast, with players across the value chain stepping up.

DHL and IAG Cargo renewed their SAF agreement—60 million liters, avoiding 165,000 tonnes of CO2.

Kintetsu World Express and IAG signed for 640,000 liters.

Korean Air and CEVA Logistics expanded their SAF partnership.

Lufthansa Cargo and Maersk committed to 400 tonnes by year-end.

At least seven shipper-forwarder SAF deals were signed in the past year—including Formula 1’s investment deals with Qatar Airways and DHL.

And soon, IATA’s CO2 Connect for Cargo will help calculate shipment emissions more accurately—factoring in SAF, aligned with our reporting methodology.

Without belittling these efforts, they are, frankly, nowhere near the volumes that we need to be speaking about.

We don’t have enough SAF. And the cost of what is available needs to come down.

We remain committed to our 2050 goal. But the ramp-up to that has been disappointing to say the least. Governments have not provided the policy support needed, even though they have a playbook at hand with how the wind and solar energy industries expanded.

In fact, they continue to send completely mixed signals by subsidizing fossil fuel extraction. And the major fuel producers have been slow-walking—or sidelining—planned investments in SAF. Additionally, aircraft manufacturers have backed off their commitments for medium-term delivery of CO2 saving products such as hydrogen powered aircraft.

Airlines are committed and determined. But this is not our show alone. We need much more action behind the words of regulators, fuel suppliers and manufacturers.

Conclusion — Our Story Is Still Being Written

So here we are. In a world that is anything but predictable, air cargo continues to deliver. Each and every day we deliver so reliably that much of what we do to power the global economy and drive prosperity is taken for granted. And through every shock, that value is illuminated for all to see.

From a faulty lithium battery intercepted, to a cancer medicine rerouted, to a scallop carefully delivered—these are not just anecdotes. They are proof that we make good on our aspirations even whether we are in the spotlight or not.

Let us continue to tell these stories. Let us continue to write this next chapter—together.

In partnership with daa International and Arabian Petroleum Supply, RSG recently introduced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at the Red Sea International Airport, marking a first for Saudi Arabia. How do you see this initiative shaping the future of sustainable travel in the country?

This year we announced a deal to bring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to the Kingdom for the first time. Our SAF supply is blended at 35 percent SAF and 65 percent standard Jet A1, which reduces the produced carbon emissions resulting directly from each aircraft that uses this fuel by up to 35 percent.

Airlines operating at RSI now have the option of refueling using SAF. RSG’s subsidiary air operator, Fly Red Sea, which provides seaplane transfer, charter and scenic tour services across our destinations, will refuel its fleet exclusively with fuels that ensure aviation is more sustainable such as SAF.

By bringing SAF into the kingdom, we are dramatically reducing our guests’ personal carbon footprint from the moment they arrive to after they leave. Beyond this, we’re supporting the wider aviation sector to start making choices that are better for the environment.

With Saudi Arabia positioning itself as a global tourism leader under Vision 2030, how does Red Sea Global contribute to this vision, and what developments can tourists expect this 2025?

RSG has established itself as a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s economic diversification under Vision 2030. Our flagship destinations are already making significant contributions to the kingdom’s tourism sector by creating employment opportunities, attracting global travelers, and fostering partnerships with local businesses.

As RSG expands its portfolio, we continue to solidify our position as a catalyst for transformative economic development and a global benchmark for regenerative tourism. This year is set to be a defining chapter for RSG, with our 25 in 25 plan — that is 25 world-class resorts across our flagship destinations by the end of 2025. At the forefront of this expansion is the opening of Shura Island at The Red Sea, featuring 11 exceptional resorts, each offering unique luxury experiences, designed to harmonize with the region’s breathtaking natural landscapes. Meanwhile, AMAALA will debut its first collection of resorts at Triple Bay, with eight groundbreaking properties that redefine wellness, luxury, and innovation.

These additions join the five resorts already operational at The Red Sea and the ultra-exclusive Thuwal Private Retreat, completing the journey to 25 extraordinary destinations. This milestone not only represents the ambitious physical expansion of RSG’s destinations but also reinforces its commitment to creating diverse, sustainable, and interconnected developments that set a new global standard in luxury and regenerative tourism.

Added to this, we recently revealed the first properties in our residential proposition, including Four Seasons Private Residences, Ennismore’s SLS Residences, and soon, Shura Marina Residences. With more residential communities to be revealed throughout this year, we are offering a rare opportunity to own part of our luxury destinations along the Red Sea coast.

As Red Sea Global continues to grow, what strategies are in place to attract international visitors? Are there specific regions or traveler demographics you’re targeting, and how do you plan to position the Red Sea as a must-visit destination on the global tourism map?

In the early days, marketing The Red Sea and AMAALA was about introducing the world to a region that had never been explored for tourism at any scale. But now, as visitors begin to arrive, the focus shifts from vision to real-life experience.

We’re leaning into the Saudi tradition of Hafawah – genuine, caring hospitality from the heart – because what stays with people isn’t just the landscapes – it’s the individuals they meet, the stories they hear – and it’s this that they will share with their friends and family back home.

For The Red Sea, these stories are already unfolding. Award-winning underwater photographer Tobias Friedrich has captured never-before-seen images of the region’s marine biodiversity, showcasing its thriving coral reefs and wildlife. Travel journalists have started to explore uninhabited islands, ancient volcanic landscapes, and waters that had remained closed to the world for centuries. Red Sea Fashion Week was another milestone — an event where designers drew inspiration from the destination itself, with many more exciting moments still to come.

The key to promoting destinations like Shebara is ensuring each location’s unique identity is brought to life. The resort’s distinctive stainless-steel overwater villas, set against a backdrop of pristine natural beauty are already iconic, grabbing international attention and becoming emblematic of our commitment to harmonizing sustainability with luxury.

Desert Rock is equally alluring, carved into the mountainside so that guests can be truly at one with nature. Six Senses Southern Dunes, The Red Sea, which blends seamlessly with the desertscape. And of course, The St. Regis Red Sea Resort and Nujuma, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, which are both creating waves on social media due to their distinctive designs and especially the overwater villas, showing the world the turquoise waters of Saudi’s Red Sea coast.

Luxury and sustainability are sometimes seen as opposing forces. How does RSG balance high-end, world-class hospitality with environmental responsibility, and do you think this balance is shaping the future of global tourism?

For us, luxury and sustainability go hand in hand. Today’s luxury traveler wants to be as close to nature as they can be, a trend called barefoot luxury. At the same time, they want to know that when they travel, they are doing no harm. As highlighted in Booking.com’s 2024 Sustainable Travel Report, 83 percent of travelers say that sustainable travel is important.

We are celebrating this redefinition of luxury tourism and have placed sustainability at the core of our developments. From integrating LEED-certified infrastructure, targeting WELL certification for our offices and residences, and using renewable energy systems to employing design principles that minimize environmental impact, we ensure our destinations seamlessly harmonize with their natural surroundings. Conservation-led initiatives, such as the restoration of mangroves, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs, go beyond sustainability to have a regenerative impact.

Added to this, visitor numbers are carefully managed to align with the ecological carrying capacity of each destination, ensuring that exclusive guest experiences coexist with the preservation and enhancement of the environment. This deliberate approach not only reduces environmental impact but deepens guests’ connection to the region’s stunning natural landscapes and rich cultural heritage.

By striking this delicate balance, RSG demonstrates that luxury and sustainability are not only compatible but can thrive together. This pioneering model sets new benchmarks for global tourism, offering a harmonious blend of opulence and environmental stewardship that redefines what it means to travel responsibly.",https://economymiddleeast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/John-Pagano-Group-CEO-at-Red-Sea-Global.webp,N,,2025-04-15 06:57:00.813365

IMO GHG pricing not yet Paris deal-aligned: EU

Brussels, 14 April (Argus) — The International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism ""does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals"", the European Commission has said. ""Does it have everything for everybody? For sure, it doesn't,"" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the commission's climate and energy spokesperson said. ""This is often the case as an outcome from international negotiations, that not everybody gets the most optimal outcome."" The IMO agreement reached last week will need to be confirmed by the organisation in October, the EU noted, even if it is a ""strong foundation"" and ""meaningful step"" towards net zero GHG emissions in global shipping by 2050. The commission will have 18 months following the IMO mechanism's formal approval to review the directive governing the bloc's emissions trading system (ETS), which currently includes maritime emissions for intra-EU voyages and those entering or leaving the bloc. By EU law, the commission will also have to report on possible ""articulation or alignment"" of the bloc's FuelEU Maritime regulation with the IMO, including the need to ""avoid duplicating regulation of GHG emissions from maritime transport"" at EU and international levels. That report should be presented, ""without delay"", following formal adoption of an IMO global GHG fuel standard or global GHG intensity limit. Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, told Argus that the EU's consideration of whether the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough won't be until ""well after October"". Commenting on the IMO agreement, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) pointed to the ""neutral"" approach to feedstocks, including first generation biofuels. ""The EBB welcomes this agreement, where all feedstocks and pathways have a role to play,"" EBB secretary general Xavier Noyon said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-governmental organisation Transport and Environment, called for better incentives for green hydrogen. ""The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels. But unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,"" he said.

German Green party warns on climate policy for heating

Berlin, 14 April (Argus) — Germany's soon-to-be opposition Green party today warned against the prospective new government's plans for the heating sector, which the Greens say will lead to Germany incurring high fines under the EU's effort-sharing regulation (ESR), particularly as the coalition also seeks to ""deliberately delay"" the EU's buildings directive. The expected new government coalition parties CDU/CSU and SPD pledged in their coalition treaty more openness and the use of ""scope for implementation"" to achieve energy efficiency, while emphasising their commitment to reaching climate neutrality by 2045. The coalition also agreed to end the outgoing government's building energy act, with its focus on mandatory renewable energies shares, and instead focus on ""achievable CO2 avoidance"" as a key performance indicator in the heating sector. In ""deliberately"" delaying ""urgently needed"" action, Germany could incur high EU fines while still making heating more expensive for users, the Greens warned, as people are driven into ""fossil fuel dependencies"" and ""cost traps"". And the lax implementation of the EU's energy performance of buildings directive (EPBD) threatens to delay refurbishment and energy efficiency, the party said. German energy efficiency association Deneff similarly warned against a delayed implementation of the EPBD and the ""vague"" role accorded to the carbon price in the building sector. But Deneff commended the coalition's backing of existing energy efficiency support programmes, despite the envisaged end to the buildings energy act. The act was the brainchild of the Green-led outgoing economy ministry, fiercely criticised by the then-opposition CDU/CSU and only half-heartedly supported by outgoing chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD party. A recent study found that prices under the upcoming EU emissions trading system covering buildings and road transport (EU ETS 2) could turn out much higher than anticipated by the European Commission. Cologne University-based research institute EWI in a recent paper warned that carbon prices under the ETS 2 could climb from about €120/t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) in 2027 to more than €200/t CO2e by 2035, significantly higher than the current price of €55/t CO2e under Germany's domestic carbon pricing scheme for the sectors. This is because of the sectors' high short-term marginal abatement costs, with necessary investments such as heat pumps and building renovations being cost-intensive and progressing slowly. The Greens on 11 April slammed the coalition treaty for advocating the use of ""dubious foreign emissions reductions "", its ""excessive"" focus on carbon capture and storage technology and touting an ""overcapacity"" of new gas-fired plants that could lead to a ""fossil lock-in"". The lower house of parliament the Bundestag on 6 May will elect CDU leader Friedrich Merz as Germany's chancellor, assuming the CDU and SPD parties give the coalition the green light as the CSU did last week.

Participants mostly support IMO GHG pricing mechanism

London, 11 April (Argus) — International shipping organisations and market participants mostly support the global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism approved today at the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) 83rd Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) meeting, but some raised concerns. The structure approved by the IMO establishes that ships must reduce their fuel intensity by a ""base target"" of 4pc in 2028 against 93.3 gCO2e/MJ, the latter representing the average GHG fuel intensity value of international shipping in 2008. Emissions above this target will be charged at $380/tCO2e. The levels defined by the approved regulation are achievable, according to a market participant, who said the gradually increasing targets may allow the market to properly adapt to the transition. The International Chamber of Shipping (ICS) secretary general Guy Platten said the sector is already investing billions of dollars in 'green' technology, so the agreement gives certainty that sustainable marine fuels producers need. ""The world's governments have now come forward with a comprehensive agreement which, although not perfect in every respect, we very much hope will be formally adopted later this year,"" he said. The European Shipowners (ECSA) secretary general Sotiris Raptis agreed the draft ""is not perfect"", but he celebrated progress towards a net zero emissions target, saying ""it is a good starting point for further work"" and pointing out that it may ensure the necessary investment in production of clean fuels. During a press briefing, IMO secretary general Arsenio Dominguez said ships operating in international waters will be obliged to comply with the regulations after adoption, despite the US' refusal to engage with the discussions . Adoption of the pricing mechanism will be discussed and voted on in October. Offering a counterview, the Global Maritime Forum said the agreed measures may not be strong enough to reach IMO targets. ""The GHG intensity targets create uncertainty as to whether the strategy's emissions reduction checkpoints for 2030 and 2040 will be met,"" it said. ""As currently designed, measures are unlikely to be sufficient to incentivise the rapid development of e-fuels such as e-ammonia or e-methanol , which will be needed in the long run due to their scalability and emission reduction potential."" It said that failure to invest in these fuels would put at risk the target of at least 5pc zero- and near-zero emission fuel use by 2030 and the industry's entire 2050 net-zero goal. The World Shipping Council's vice president Bryan Wood-Thomas praised the agreement and said one benefit of it is the pricing system that is ""more aggressive"" if a vessel fails to meet the GHG intensity standard. ""But you also have a fee system that gives investors more confidence in actual revenue [from using cleaner fuels],"" he said. The Brazilian representative told Argus the fact that some countries thought the agreement was too ambitious while others indicated it was not ambitious enough show the group may have reached a balance that can be possible to comply. About the Brazilian position, the representative said the country ""was never against an agreement"". ""We were only against some aspects of the agreement, and we think that the membership has heard our concerns, and that's why we ended up pretty happy with the results"", he said. Brazil voted in favour of the agreement today. By Hussein Al-Khalisy, Madeleine Jenkins, Natália Coelho, and Gabriel Tassi Lara.

What is your initial reaction to the text? We are happy and satisfied about the content of the agreed text, so far. But we need to be careful. This week, all member states were able to vote. But in October, when adaption will take place, only those states which are parties to Marpol Annex VI will be able to vote if indeed a vote is called for, and that changes the situation a little bit. Here when we were voting, a minority was enough — 40 votes. But if or when we vote in October, then we need two thirds of those party to Marpol Annex VI to be in favour of the text. Will enthusiasm for the decision today remain by October? I'm pretty sure it will. But you never know what will happen between now and and the next six months. What is the effect of the decision on FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS? Both FuelEU Maritime and the EU ETS have a review clause. This review clause states that if we are ambitious enough at the IMO, then the EU can review or amend the regulation. So of course, it is very important that we first consider if the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough to meet EU standards. Only after that evaluation, which won't be until well after October, can we consider these possible changes. Do you think the EU will be able to adopt these the text as it stands today? My personal view is that we can perhaps incorporate this text under FuelEU Maritime, but it may be more challenging for the EU ETS, where shipping is now included. What was the impact of US President Donald Trump's letter on the proceedings? EU states were not impacted, but it's difficult to say what the impact was on other states.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources. Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions.","Scientists and aviation leaders including Airbus are studying how to reduce aircraft non-CO2 emissions. Options include operational contrail avoidance, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and in the longer term, hydrogen propulsion. What are the most promising projects?

Non-CO2 warming effects could be as significant as CO2 in aviation’s total climate impact. However, non-CO2 emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions.

Discussions are heating up over whether and how to regulate non-CO2 emissions. It is a major aviation policy debate that affects airlines, governments and climate targets, as well as air traffic management due to scheduling and capacity constraints.

What are contrails and other non-CO2 emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO2) and non-CO2 emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO2 emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO2 emissions is complex and hard to measure. Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO2 emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO2 emissions. They are using different fuel types (SAF, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation. The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

Airbus is working with scientists, policymakers and the wider aviation industry on some 20 projects linked to these mitigation concepts. Some are funded externally while others are funded internally or with specific partners willing to share the cost of the project with Airbus.

The projects fall into three broad categories:

Studying contrails and testing fuel alternatives, including sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen. Projects include PACIFIC and CRYSTAL, which were announced at the Airbus Summit 2025. Both continue Airbus’ research into fuel compositions using A350 and A220 aircraft.

Operational avoidance: Exploring optimisation of flight paths to minimise persistent contrails. Live projects include CICONIA, which focuses on forecasting contrail-prone weather, climate impact modelling, and on defining the best concept of operations. CICONIA's early results indicate that, assuming appropriate procedures are put in place, operational mitigation could be applied to many flights, thus effectively reducing their contrails impact, and without significant air traffic disturbance.

New technologies: Investing in hydrogen-powered flight and innovative propulsion systems. Live projects include Blue Condor, whose flight test results are due in late 2025. Blue Condor is a joint project between Airbus and the German Aerospace Centre DLR. Of the seven test flights, four resulted in the formation of contrails from the hydrogen engine. The aim of the investigations was to compare their microphysical properties with those of conventional contrails.

Promising technologies including humidity sensors could help aircraft to avoid weather conditions favourable to contrail formation. Humidity sensors feed weather forecasting models, so flights can benefit from improved forecasts of conditions favourable to contrail formation. Yet like climate impact models, they are in their infancy.

Nonetheless, the projects and collaborations led by Airbus and its partners are helping to accelerate the development of mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and subsequent integration into flight operations.",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/88979/95880_O.jpg,N,,2025-04-15 06:57:44.658281

Q&A: Australia’s Corporate Carbon expands ACCU trading

Sydney, 11 April (Argus) — Australian carbon project developer Corporate Carbon has been expanding its trading capabilities around Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) on the back of growing supply and wider market maturity. Head of carbon trading Angus Robertson spoke with Argus about the latest developments in the market. Corporate Carbon is one of the biggest suppliers of ACCUs. Is it correct that the company has been issued around 15mn ACCUs, counting both fully-owned projects and partnerships, which would be around 10pc of all ACCU issuances since the scheme started in 2011? Yes, that's the approximate number. We've got around 100 projects. In terms of issuance from a mix of owned projects and offtake agreements with other developers and partners in the industry, the approximate forecast is around 3mn ACCUs/yr. We trade around that and then also have capacity to trade outside of our own projects and within the portfolio, plus operating as a trading entity in the secondary market. The company has been one of the main suppliers to private buyers, and to the federal government through carbon abatement contracts (CACs). But you are also buyers. How does that work? The increased capability of our business to both buy and sell is a reflection of the broader Australian carbon market maturing over the last few years. The beginning of the business was very much built off the back of those CACs. As that policy changed over time, allowing for the partial exiting of those CACs , obviously there's been a lot more focus on the secondary market now. We've seen a lot of trading houses, banks and other financial institutions coming into the market, and with that you get a more mature financial market. So in response to that, we've been building out our trading capacity as well as our broader commercial team over the past few years. We take a portfolio approach and we have a large inventory flow to assist with that growing demand, but there are times when we go out to the secondary market and source units on behalf of clients. You recently partnered with trading and risk management firm Ion Commodities to implement their Carbon Zero tool. How does that translate into your trading capabilities? We see Ion's solution as a really effective trading tool and portfolio management system. It reflects our readiness to operate at a larger scale. By providing those tools, it allows us to focus on the strategic goals of the business, especially from a commercial perspective. It is very much a tool for reporting purposes and the automation capabilities of the system assist with that, but it does have a bit of a flow-on effect in terms of efficiency across the business as well. Going to the market, in the short term, it seems to be all about the upcoming federal elections. Do you expect to see much price volatility within the next few weeks? Yes. As we approach the Australian federal election, we would expect there to be a degree of uncertainty, considering the difference in the two major party outcomes in terms of their take on the carbon market. We would see it as positive in either instance, but I think there is still a degree of uncertainty that should lead to perhaps a degree of illiquidity in the market. The market has been also weighed down by a strong issuance of safeguard mechanism credits (SMCs). Were you surprised with that high volume when it was first disclosed by the Climate Change Authority late last year? I think it was the general market consensus that the number was higher than initially forecast, and [ACCU] market prices definitely reflected that in the following weeks and months after those numbers were disclosed. Once the final numbers were released, I think the market had generally already priced that in by that point. Has that changed your internal outlook for when the ACCU market might see an expected shift from oversupply to undersupply? I wouldn't say our internal view has changed all that much. If the majority of that volume is now weighted towards the early years of the safeguard mechanism, policies might reflect that going forward. Now we would probably see ACCU supply as a potential restriction on the market in the short to medium term. Obviously, there's speculation around certain methods in the ACCU market, where higher forecasts were expected over the following next few years and that's now no longer the case. So probably more around supply than demand in terms of our shifted internal views, and this is more from a trading and market perspective as opposed to our actual projects being affected. So it's more on the supply side than demand, even with the high SMC issuances? Well, obviously the market has reacted to those media releases by the regulator around SMCs. So you know that's already happened — you can't really argue that now. Will there be further policy changes around the safeguard mechanism to account for that? That's a bit of an unknown, but it's definitely potential in the following years. And when you talk about supply constraints, is it mostly the delays with the development of the integrated farm and land management methodology , and potentially lower issuances from a reformed landfill gas method? Those are good examples of general delays in certain methods and the creation of new methods. So yes, our expectation is that this could be a big driver on ACCU prices in the next few years.

New tariffs could upend US tallow imports: Correction

Corrects description of options for avoiding feedstock tariffs in 12th paragraph. Story originally published 3 April. New York, 10 April (Argus) — New US tariffs on nearly all foreign products could deter further imports of beef tallow, a fast-rising biofuel feedstock and food ingredient that had until now largely evaded President Donald Trump's efforts to reshape global trade. Tallow was the most used feedstock for US biomass-based diesel production in January for the first month ever, with consumption by pound rising month to month despite sharp declines in actual biorefining and in use of competing feedstocks. The beef byproduct benefits from US policies, including a new federal tax credit known as ""45Z"", that offer greater subsidies to fuel derived from waste than fuel derived from first-generation crops. Much of that tallow is sourced domestically, but the US also imported more than 880,000t of tallow last year, up 29pc from just two years earlier. The majority of those imports last year came from Brazil, which until now has faced a small 0.43¢/kg (19.5¢/lb) tariff, and from Australia, which was exempt from any tallow-specific tariffs under a free trade agreement with US. But starting on 5 April, both countries will be subject to at least the new 10pc charge on foreign imports. There are some carveouts from tariffs for certain energy products, but animal fats are not included. Some other major suppliers — like Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand — will soon have new tariffs in place too, although tallow from Canada is for now unaffected because it is covered by the US-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement. Brazil tallow shipments to the US totaled around 300,000t in 2024, marking an all-time high, but tallow shipments during the fourth quarter of 2024 fell under the 2023 levels as uncertainty about future tax policy slowed buying interest. Feedstock demand in general in the US has remained muted to start this year because of poor biofuel production margins, and that has extended to global tallow flows. Tallow suppliers in Brazil for instance were already experiencing decreased interest from US producers before tariffs. Brazil tallow prices for export last closed at $1,080/t on 28 March, rising about 4pc year-to-date amid support from the 45Z guidance and aid from Brazil's growing biodiesel industry, which is paying a hefty premium for tallow compared to exports. While the large majority of Brazilian tallow exports end up in the US, Australian suppliers have more flexibility and could send more volume to Singapore instead if tariffs deter US buyers. Export prices out of Australia peaked this year at $1,185/t on 4 March but have since trended lower to last close at $1,050/t on 1 April. In general, market participants say international tallow suppliers would have to drop offers to keep trade flows intact. Other policy shifts affect flows Even as US farm groups clamored for more muscular foreign feedstock limits over much of the last year, tallow had until now largely dodged any significant restrictions. Recent US guidance around 45Z treats all tallow, whether produced in the US or shipped long distances to reach the US, the same. Other foreign feedstocks were treated more harshly, with the same guidance providing no pathway at all for road fuels from foreign used cooking oil and also pinning the carbon intensity of canola oil — largely from Canada — as generally too high to claim any subsidy. But tariffs on major suppliers of tallow to the US, and the threat of additional charges if countries retaliate, could give refiners pause. Demand could rise for domestic animal fats or alternatively for domestic vegetable oils that can also be refined into fuel, especially if retaliatory tariffs cut off global markets for US farm products like soybean oil. There is also risk if Republicans in the Trump administration or Congress reshape rules around 45Z to penalize foreign feedstocks. At the same time, a minimum 10pc charge for tallow outside North America is a more manageable price to pay compared to other feedstocks — including a far-greater collection of charges on Chinese used cooking oil. And if the US sets biofuel blend mandates as high as some oil and farm groups are pushing , strong demand could leave producers with little choice but to continue importing at least some feedstock from abroad to continue making fuel. Not all US renewable diesel producers will be equally impacted by tariffs either. Some tariffs are eligible for drawbacks, meaning that producers could potentially recover tariffs they paid on feedstocks for fuel that is ultimately exported. And multiple biofuel producers are located in foreign-trade zones, a US program that works similarly to the duty drawbacks, and have applied for permission to avoid some tariffs on imported feedstocks for fuel eventually shipped abroad. Jurisdictions like the EU and UK, where sustainable aviation fuel mandates took effect this year, are attractive destinations. And there is still strong demand from the US food sector, with edible tallow prices in Chicago up 18pc so far this year. Trump allies, including his top health official, have pushed tallow as an alternative to seed oils.

The plan should incorporate an all-of-the-above energy strategy, including renewables, nuclear, and natural gas, to keep energy affordable.

Balancing environmental progress with economic realities is crucial, especially given the recent 20% rate hike on utility customers.

Natural gas should remain part of the energy mix, as renewables alone cannot meet current demands, and an all-of-the-above approach supports union jobs.

The state can lead in clean energy while ensuring affordability and reliability by responsibly using natural gas and investing in technologies like carbon capture and hydrogen.

Last month, there was an updated draft of the Energy Master Plan — a blueprint that aims to make New Jersey a national leader in clean energy, cutting emissions, and building a more sustainable economy. I believe wholeheartedly in the vision of a greener future. But, as policymakers, we must also be honest: the path to that future must be grounded in practicality, affordability, and fairness.

The current plan’s shortcoming is that it’s not a true all-of-the-above energy strategy. If we want to provide every New Jersey resident with affordable energy, the grid should be technology neutral, including renewables, nuclear and a continued, responsible role for natural gas. If we want to lower energy prices, we cannot afford to take energy options off the table.

The revised Energy Master Plan sets ambitious and admirable goals. But as we decarbonize and electrify, we cannot lose sight of the reality that working families, seniors, small businesses and manufacturers across New Jersey are already struggling with some of the highest energy costs in the country. If we are serious about achieving these goals without pushing costs onto those who can least afford it, we need an energy strategy that balances environmental progress with economic reality.

These concerns aren’t hypothetical. Just this year, the Board of Public Utilities approved a nearly 20% rate hike on utility customers — an increase that has sparked strong opposition from the public, business owners and many of my colleagues in the Legislature. Working families across New Jersey are already stretched thin, and they’re rightfully questioning why their energy bills keep climbing while their paychecks don’t. Part of the reason is that our energy supply has not kept pace with growing demand and limiting fuel options only makes that worse.

While renewables like wind and solar will play a growing role in our energy portfolio — and we will continue to support those investments — they are not yet able to meet New Jersey’s full energy demands on their own. Today, about 75% of our electricity and home heating come from natural gas. That’s why natural gas must remain part of the mix. An all-of-the-above approach that includes our conventional fuels will keep the lights on, keeps prices stable, and ensures the grid remains reliable when demand spikes — whether during a cold snap, heatwave or economic expansion.

Moreover, investing in every energy solution is an investment in middle-class, union careers. The transition to clean energy should not mean the loss of family-sustaining, skilled trades jobs. In fact, it should expand economic opportunities in middle-class, union careers. Building and modernizing New Jersey’s energy infrastructure has always been done safely, locally and by trained union labor. Implementing low-carbon technologies at these facilities will create even greater need in these fields. These projects mean real careers with benefits, pensions and apprenticeship opportunities — lifting communities, especially in urban and working-class areas, while ensuring the energy system we all depend on is maintained by the safest, most qualified workforce in the country.

Some critics will argue that we can simply “leap” to a carbon-free future. But what they’re ignoring is that there are all kinds of proven opportunities to reduce emissions from traditional energy sources, whether through carbon capture, hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, biofuels, and other technologies. We should not let ideology override common sense and leave solutions off the table.

We can remain an environmental leader without sacrificing affordability, reliability or working-class livelihoods. An all-of-the-above energy policy is not a retreat from clean energy — it is an acknowledgment that building a sustainable future requires careful planning, flexible thinking and respect for the people who will actually build it.

This is not an either/or choice. We can fight climate change and ensure that union workers are part of the solution. We can reduce emissions and make sure our seniors can afford to heat their homes. We can lead the nation in wind and solar energy and use natural gas responsibly to maintain a stable, affordable energy grid and power our home appliances.

That’s the future New Jersey deserves — and that’s the future I’ll keep fighting for.

I’ve been rebalancing my portfolio lately. It’s something I do every couple of years—trim what’s run ahead, add where conviction has deepened, and adjust based on what I now believe to be real, durable value. I’m not a trader. I buy and hold for years, sometimes decades, and while my portfolio leans heavily toward the digital and electrification of everything, hence my recent battery EFT assessment, I keep an eye on the corners of the energy transition where electrons alone won’t cut it. That brings me, inevitably, to biofuels. And to be clear, this is not investment advice. I’m sharing my reasoning, not offering you a target allocation or price point. Do your own diligence, or ignore the sector entirely. That said, here’s what I found worth considering and why.

As I noted in the battery assessment, I was finally shoved out of my procrastination by Pearl Jam. Well, at least by Stone Gossard, the guitarist for the grunge band. A mutual contact connected us as the band puts a carbon price of $200 per ton on its concerts and invests the resulting pool of cash in fixing the climate. Now they realize, like a lot of other people, that doing good and making money are synonymous. We talked climate investing a couple of weeks ago, and that triggered me to finally put my own pool of cash—smaller—into action again.

Biofuels have never been the center of the energy transition, and they never will be. That role belongs to renewably-generated electricity and the batteries and grids that move it. But liquid fuels will persist—particularly in the parts of transport and industry that resist electrification. Long-haul aviation is the most obvious example. You’re not going to fly a narrow-body across the Pacific on battery power, not this decade and not the next. Likewise, in maritime shipping, even with battery-electric coastal operations gaining ground, ocean-crossing vessels will still need dense, combustible energy carriers. Hydrogen and e-fuels continue to attract headlines, but their economics and thermodynamics remain unfavorable for most use cases. Biofuels—when derived from waste biomass and deployed in sectors that truly need them—offer a more grounded, scalable solution.

Still, as an investor, this is a hard space. A lot of early biofuel bets imploded: poor margins, poor feedstock strategies, poor timing. Some leaned too heavily on food crops, drawing justified criticism and volatility when commodity prices spiked. Others burned through cash chasing futuristic pathways that were years too early. The question, for someone building a portfolio for the long haul, is not which firm has the most exciting press release. It’s who is already operating at scale, with real customers, real revenue, and a defensible moat. And among the pure-play firms with little to no fossil fuel exposure, four companies emerged as worth my time: Neste, Darling Ingredients, UPM Kymmene, and Aemetis.

Let’s start where the conversation always should—with feedstock. Biofuels don’t begin in the lab or at the pump. They begin at the fryer, the field, the forest floor. And whoever controls or integrates feedstock supply is already playing a different game than those reliant on spot markets. Neste, the Finnish leader in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), operates a global supply chain that spans three continents. It sources used cooking oil, animal fats, and other residues, pre-treats them at scale, and converts them into high-quality drop-in fuels using proprietary hydroprocessing tech. It’s the biggest producer of SAF in the world today. What it lacks in fossil scale, it more than makes up for in logistics, policy fluency, and execution.

Darling Ingredients, a less famous name, is arguably even more secure on feedstock. It collects and renders about 10% of the world’s inedible animal by-products—literally the fat and bone left after livestock are processed—and turns a significant portion into low-carbon fuels via its 50-50 joint venture with Valero, Diamond Green Diesel. That JV is now the second-largest renewable diesel producer on the planet, with capacity nearing 1.2 billion gallons per year. The synergy is textbook: Darling supplies the feedstock, Valero supplies the refining and distribution infrastructure, and the fuel flows into markets like California, where LCFS credits stack on top of federal subsidies. The cash flow from the JV shows up consistently in Darling’s books, offsetting volatility elsewhere in its animal feed and fertilizer business.

UPM Kymmene, a Finnish forest products firm, has a very different profile—more industrial conglomerate than energy company. But it’s been quietly converting tall oil, a by-product of its pulp mills, into renewable diesel at its Lappeenranta biorefinery for nearly a decade. This isn’t speculative. It’s operational, integrated, and compliant with Europe’s most stringent advanced biofuel criteria. The volume is small—about 100,000 tonnes per year—but the margins are healthy, and the feedstock is fully captive. UPM is currently deciding whether to build a new 500,000-tonne biorefinery that would include SAF, and if it does, it’ll bring the same integration logic with it: using its own forestry residue streams, located adjacent to its existing industrial clusters, to create fuels where there’s already logistics and energy available. It’s moving slowly, but with capital discipline and a clear view of the regulatory landscape.

Aemetis rounds out the list as the highest-risk, highest-potential candidate. Based in California, it operates an ethanol plant today and is building out both a renewable diesel and SAF refinery as well as a dairy manure biogas network. The assets are real, the offtake agreements are impressive—Delta, Japan Airlines, and ten others have signed multi-year SAF supply contracts—and the LCFS and federal incentive stack in California makes the revenue projections look attractive. But this is not yet a consistently profitable business. It’s a capital-intensive transition play that depends on execution. If they build their projects on time and on budget, they could become a major SAF player. If not, it could be a cautionary tale. For now, I treat it as a speculative growth position—a small piece of the portfolio with a long time horizon.

From a pure investment ranking perspective, Neste is in a league of its own. It combines scale, diversification, and policy fluency with a high-integrity ESG story and continued margin strength, even in a turbulent year. Its downside for me is that it’s still running a legacy oil and gas refinery, but like Orsted, it’s exiting the fossil fuel industry rapidly and I believe its commitment. Darling is close behind, thanks to its unparalleled feedstock integration and the reliable cash flow from Diamond Green Diesel. UPM is the low-beta, high-discipline pick—less upside, but strong integration and balance sheet. As I’m bullish on engineered mass timber and hydroelectric, that it has plywood and hydro in its assets is something I’m comfortable with. Aemetis is the call option on SAF growth—too early to tell, but too well-positioned to ignore.

All of them are well off the 2021 clean investment bubble prices, so they are value priced now. And Trump’s tariffs have depressed all stocks. I exited the last of my Tesla—bought for an average of $19 at the current split level and long before the current craze for “I bought this car before Elon went crazy” bumper stickers—after the election and have been sitting on a pot of cash since, waiting until I figured out what I was going to do with it and what the right timing is. Well, biofuels and batteries for the what, and now for the when. Somebody online was stunned that I had divested TSLA and was considering biofuels, but I think it’s the right call. And my batteries ETFs include BYD among a lot of other Chinese battery and EV firms.

This portfolio shift doesn’t replace my investments in wind, solar, or grid infrastructure EFTs, my China digital economy investments or the Apple stock I bought at some much lower price lost to the mists of history. It complements them. Biofuels aren’t going to replace electrons, and they’re not the universal answer to decarbonization. But for the segments of global energy where combustion isn’t optional, and where electrification will be slow or partial, these firms offer a viable path to sustainable energy. They’re not making hydrogen hype. They’re not pretending every flight can run on batteries. They’re grinding biomass into something useful and low-carbon, with customers who need it and policies that support it.

With the International Maritime Organization’s recent passing of hard net zero requirements for 2050 with up to $380 per ton fines for missing reduction targets, biofuels are going to be getting hotter again.

I won’t buy all five. I might not even be able to buy the three I want due to arcane rules about Canadian RSPs, although I have other cash on hand outside of that part of my portfolio, so may invest regardless. But I came away from the analysis with a clearer view of who’s likely to be producing real molecules for hard-to-abate sectors five years from now. If the world still needs liquid fuels—and it will—I want to hold shares in the companies making the cleanest, cheapest, and most scalable ones. That’s what this sector offers: not fantasy, but functional climate solutions. And in a portfolio designed for the long transition, that’s worth owning.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-14-2025-06_59_32-PM-1-800x441.png,N,,2025-04-15 06:58:16.198553

SAF that is sourced by Air France-KLM must meet strict sustainability criteria, ensuring it does not compete with food production or use palm oil, and that it is certified by RSB or ISCC.

The group has set a target to reduce CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometre by 30% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. To help meet this goal, it said it aims to use 10% SAF by 2030. This is well above the EU’s mandated 6% minimum for European departures.

“Our partnership with Virgin Australia is vital for meeting environmental obligations and advancing SAF development,” the spokesperson said.","Virgin Australia, Qatar Airways, and Renewable Developments Australia (RDA) have joined forces to develop a homegrown sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility in the Charters Towers Region of North Queensland. The project will establish an integrated Ethanol to Jet (EtJ) facility, converting bioethanol from locally grown sugarcane into 100% SAF. The facility will also generate all of its energy from renewable sources, making it energy self-sufficient, which distinguishes it from other SAF projects globally.

This facility is expected to produce up to 96 million liters of SAF annually, supplying nearby airports. Initial projections suggest a potential reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by 70% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The collaboration is aligned with the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways in October 2024. The MoU emphasized their joint commitment to sustainability initiatives, including reducing carbon emissions in air travel and increasing the use of SAF and Low Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) in Australia.

Boeing has also expressed support for the project, committing to assist in areas such as policy advocacy and technical expertise.

Currently in the pre-final investment decision stage, the project aims to begin SAF production in early 2029.

Tony D’Alessandro, Managing Director of Renewable Developments Australia, highlighted the significance of the partnership. “We are proud to work with globally recognized airlines that share our vision for a domestic supply of SAF. This project will contribute to long-term emission reductions and regional economic growth.”

Virgin Australia's Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, Christian Bennett, emphasized the importance of collaboration to meet the aviation industry's net-zero emissions target by 2050. “Establishing a domestic SAF industry will be crucial for achieving emissions goals, enhancing fuel security, and creating jobs in regional Australia,” he said.

A Qatar Airways spokesperson added that the development of SAF infrastructure is key to the long-term sustainability of the aviation industry, both in Australia and worldwide. “Our partnership with Virgin Australia is vital for meeting environmental obligations and advancing SAF development,” the spokesperson said.

David Janetzki, Treasurer and Minister for Energy of Queensland, welcomed the project, stating, “This announcement positions Queensland as a global leader in sustainable aviation fuel, creating new opportunities and jobs in regional Queensland.”",,N,,2025-04-15 03:56:26.335475
