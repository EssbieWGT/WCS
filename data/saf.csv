The EU's Sustainable Transport Investment Plan has launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project, aiming to mobilise at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects. This ambition has been overfulfilled! On 4 December, alongside the announcement of the third auction of the European Hydrogen Bank, the EU successfully united eight Member States - Austria, Finland, France, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain - to accelerate the production and uptake of synthetic aviation fuels (eSAF). The funds will be used to finance H2Global-style double-sided auctions in 2026, designed to provide producers with stable long-term revenue and buyers with competitive short-term contracts. This initiative aims to give the sector the necessary boost to bring eSAF projects to Final Investment Decision (FID) and address calls to weaken or abandon the eSAF sub-quota. When designing the auction tender, it should be open for Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) proposals. MtJ is expected to earn its ASTM approval in mid-2026. This versatile eSAF production process combines cost-effective sourcing of green methanol in countries with optimal production conditions and synthesizes jet fuel at an industrial scale plant in Europe. Hence MtJ sits between two positions: ""Europe-only to strengthen our technological base"" and ""imports only to get the cheapest price.""

Analysts have trimmed their average price target on Honeywell International by about $2, to roughly $239. This reflects modestly higher revenue growth assumptions but slightly lower fair value and profit margin expectations following recent model updates around the Solstice spin and Q3 results.

Analyst Commentary

Street research remains broadly constructive on Honeywell, with most recent notes highlighting upside from portfolio moves and execution improvements, even as some estimates and price targets are nudged lower to reflect the Solstice separation and updated Q3 assumptions.

Bullish Takeaways

Bullish analysts see the company entering a breakup catalyst rich phase. The Solstice spin and portfolio simplification are viewed as creating a clearer roadmap to value unlock and supporting sum of the parts upside.

Several notes point to solid Q3 performance and growing momentum across core segments. This supports confidence in management execution and underpins higher price targets in the mid 250s range.

The recent Quantinuum fundraise at a higher valuation reinforces the perceived hidden value of Honeywell's strategic stakes and adds roughly mid single digit dollars per share to some sum of the parts frameworks.

Stripping out Solstice is viewed as enhancing the quality and stability of the remaining industrial and automation earnings base. This could justify a premium multiple if execution stays on track.

Bearish Takeaways

Bearish analysts are trimming price targets in the low to mid 240s range as they reset models for the loss of Solstice earnings. This modestly reduces near term EPS power and fair value estimates.

Some caution that the timing and magnitude of value realization from Quantinuum is uncertain, with a potential IPO now seen slipping toward 2026. This delays monetization and may cap near term rerating.

There is concern that guidance updates to account for fewer months of Solstice contribution and balance sheet payment transfers could create short term noise around reported growth and margins.

A subset of more cautious views emphasizes that, despite portfolio catalysts, execution still needs to remain consistently strong across all segments to justify current premium valuation levels.

3. India: User Development Fee (UDF) Increases to Fund Airport Expansion

When: Phased increases through 2026

Where: Mumbai (CSMIA), Bengaluru (BLR), Hyderabad (RGI)

India is introducing phased increases in the User Development Fee (UDF) at major airports. These changes, aimed at supporting capital expenditure programs like terminal redevelopment, will impact both domestic and international outbound passengers. Key airports like Mumbai and Bengaluru have already implemented these increases, which are set to continue through 2026.

Why it matters:

The UDF hike will raise ticket prices for both domestic and international flights.

Funds will be directed toward expanding and upgrading airport infrastructure to accommodate growing passenger numbers.

4. Malaysia: Passenger Service Charge (PSC) Raised for All Flights

When: Increase effective from June 2024

Where: Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA)

Malaysia has already increased its Passenger Service Charge (PSC) for both domestic and international flights. This change affects passengers departing from Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) and other major airports. The increase is part of a broader push to fund airport upgrades and improve the country’s air travel infrastructure.

Why it matters:

The increased PSC adds to the cost of flying from Malaysia, particularly affecting budget travelers and families.

This fee contributes to Malaysia’s goal of modernizing its airports.

5. Singapore: Introducing Green Fuel Levy in 2026

When: Starting 2026

Where: Changi Airport (SIN)

The goal is to fund the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a key initiative to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation.

Why it matters:

The green fuel levy adds an environmental twist to the typical passenger charges.

This new tax reflects Singapore’s commitment to sustainable aviation and the global push for eco-friendly travel.

What Does This Mean for Travelers?

As airport taxes continue to rise across the globe, passengers can expect higher costs when booking their flights. Here are some key takeaways from these airport tax increases:

Higher ticket prices: The added airport charges will be incorporated into ticket prices, raising costs for all passengers.

Impact on long-haul travel: Travelers flying long distances or in premium classes will bear the brunt of the increases, especially in the UK and Thailand.

Sustainability initiatives: The introduction of eco-friendly levies like Singapore’s green fuel levy reflects the growing trend of sustainable aviation in response to climate concerns.

How Can Travelers Prepare for These Changes?

Opt for Direct Flights: Direct flights might be a more cost-effective option when accounting for the rising taxes on layovers.

Plan Ahead: Be mindful of the increased taxes when budgeting for your next trip.

Check for Updates: Stay informed about specific charges at your departure airport and look for any discounted routes that might offset the added costs.

When Will the Increase Take Effect?

The Thailand airport tax increase will be implemented in early 2026 and will apply to all outbound international flights from the country. Passengers planning to travel from major Thai airports, such as Suvarnabhumi and Don Mueang, will need to account for the increased charges when purchasing their tickets. The increase in taxes is expected to be reflected in ticket prices as airlines adjust their fare structures. Similarly, the UK APD, India UDF, Malaysia PSC, and Singapore Green Fuel Levy will also take effect in 2026, further raising the cost of international travel for passengers flying from these countries.

Why Are Airport Taxes Increasing?

The main reason behind these increases is the need to fund the improvement of airport infrastructure across the globe. Many airports, including those in Thailand, the UK, India, Malaysia, and Singapore, are undergoing major upgrades and expansions to accommodate rising passenger numbers and the demands of modern air travel. The increased fees will also help address the negative environmental impacts of overtourism and promote sustainable travel practices.

Tourism levies and airport taxes are increasingly being used to balance the growth of international travel with the need to manage resources effectively. Airports are using the additional funds to upgrade runways, terminals, and air traffic management systems, as well as to incorporate green technologies like SAF to reduce the carbon footprint of aviation.

How Will This Affect Travelers?

Travelers can expect to see higher ticket prices as airlines pass on the increased airport taxes and charges to passengers. The rise in travel-related costs is a growing trend in the aviation sector, and it may discourage some travelers from taking long-haul flights or flying during peak seasons. However, the increased fees are necessary to ensure that airports remain operational and capable of handling the increasing demands of international travel.

Travelers should also be aware that many of these fees will be rolled into their ticket prices, so it is essential to factor in the cost increases when planning future trips. As airlines and airports adjust to these new charges, passengers will need to navigate higher ticket costs and potential service fees.

Conclusion

The increase in airport taxes across Thailand, the UK, India, Malaysia, and Singapore is part of a broader global trend that will shape the travel industry in 2026. While these increases will affect the cost of international travel, they are necessary to support the growing demands of the aviation sector and promote sustainable travel practices. Travelers planning to fly internationally should be prepared for higher ticket prices and factor in these increases when booking flights.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/uk-with-people.jpg,N,,2025-12-07 03:56:13.192757

With the balance sheet de-risking complete and a multiyear SAF ramp on deck, does a modest discount to analyst targets hint at underappreciated upside, or is the market already baking in Calumet’s next leg of growth?

Most Popular Narrative Narrative: 9.8% Undervalued

With Calumet last closing at $19.34 versus a narrative fair value of about $21.45, the prevailing storyline leans toward modest upside from here.

The MaxSAF 150 project is on track to start up in the first half of 2026, enabling Calumet to produce 120-150 million annual gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at relatively low capital costs, capturing premiums of $1-$2/gallon over renewable diesel and tapping into surging mandated and voluntary SAF demand globally. This is likely to drive a material step-up in revenues and EBITDA margin expansion once operational.

Want to see how one ambitious SAF ramp, steady top line growth, and a richer future earnings multiple all combine to justify that premium fair value? Read on.

Result: Fair Value of $21.45 (UNDERVALUED)

However, the story could shift if policy support for renewables weakens or if high leverage constrains Calumet’s ability to fund MaxSAF and other growth projects.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected.","Aviation connects the world, driving economic growth and cultural exchange. Yet, it also comes with a heavy environmental cost. The industry is responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions a figure expected to rise as air travel grows. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as a critical solution for reducing aviation’s climate impact.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are alternatives to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. They are made from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal waste, or even advanced processes like capturing carbon directly from the air. Unlike conventional fuel, SAF can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production method.

What makes SAF particularly appealing is its compatibility. It can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without the need for modifications. This makes SAF a practical, immediate pathway for decarbonizing aviation while longer-term solutions, such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, are still being developed.

The Industry Shift Toward SAF

Major airlines and aviation hubs around the world are increasingly committing to SAF adoption. Carriers such as United Airlines, Lufthansa, and KLM have already begun incorporating SAF into their operations. Airports in Europe and the U.S. are setting up dedicated supply chains, while governments are introducing incentives and mandates to accelerate production.

For many stakeholders, SAF is not only an environmental necessity but also a business opportunity. Investments in SAF production facilities are growing, driven by the rising demand for low-carbon air travel from both passengers and regulators.

Benefits Beyond Carbon Reduction

While emissions reduction is the most widely recognized advantage, SAF offers other benefits too. Using waste and residues as feedstock reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps build a circular economy. SAF production also opens doors for regional job creation, particularly in areas with strong agricultural or bio-based industries.

Additionally, SAF supports airlines in meeting global climate targets, such as the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Challenges on the Horizon

Despite its promise, SAF is not without hurdles. Production costs remain higher than conventional jet fuel, and current supply is limited. Scaling SAF requires significant investment in infrastructure, technology, and policy support. Ensuring that feedstock sourcing is sustainable, without competing with food supply or causing deforestation, is another critical factor.

Yet, the momentum is undeniable. With technological advancements, supportive regulations, and collaborative industry efforts, SAF production is expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades.

Looking Ahead

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are not just an alternative fuel they represent a shift in how the aviation industry approaches its future. By combining innovation with environmental responsibility, SAF provides a bridge between today’s reliance on fossil fuels and tomorrow’s cleaner aviation solutions.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected. Their success depends on collaboration across industry, government, and communities to ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for flight.

,,2025-12-07 00:44:20+00:00,www.hansardsociety.org.uk,Parliament Matters Bulletin: What's coming up in Parliament this week? 8-12 December 2025,Not Available,,,,,https://www.hansardsociety.org.uk/news/parliament-matters-bulletin-8-december-2025,"On unfair dismissal, the Government has tabled a motion stating that the Commons insists on its disagreement with the Lords amendments but proposes six ‘amendments in lieu’ to replace the Lords amendments.
Similarly to the original Lords amendment, the Government’s amendments would reduce the qualifying period for unfair dismissal to six months.
The Government previously sought to remove this Lords amendment, but it has since conceded.
The Commons must decide how to respond to the new Lords amendments.
Immigration Skills Charge (Amendment) Regulations 2025: Peers will be asked to approve these draft Regulations which were debated in Grand Committee on 4 December.","Unless the Government is now willing to accept the Lords’ position, Ministers will need to propose alternative amendments in relation to guaranteed hours and seasonal work to avoid “double insistence”. This arises when one House agrees an amendment, the other rejects it, the first House insists on its original amendment, and the second House insists on its rejection, and neither House proposes an alternative. Conventionally this parliamentary deadlock results in the loss of the Bill.

On unfair dismissal, the Government has tabled a motion stating that the Commons insists on its disagreement with the Lords amendments but proposes six ‘amendments in lieu’ to replace the Lords amendments. Similarly to the original Lords amendment, the Government’s amendments would reduce the qualifying period for unfair dismissal to six months. In contrast, Labour backbenchers opposed to the concession have tabled their own motion: they also ask the House to insist on its disagreement with the Lords amendments, but they propose no amendments in lieu – effectively urging the House to hold its ground without offering a compromise.

In accordance with the programme order agreed by the House on 15 September, the debate will conclude no later than one hour after it begins. Standing Order No 83G stipulates that if a debate on a Lords Message is brought to a conclusion in accordance with a programme order – that is, if the debate lasts the full one hour – then the only motions that can be put to the House are those moved by a Minister. Unless the debate finishes early, those MPs opposed to the Government’s concession on unfair dismissal may therefore not be able to move their own motion.

There is just one outstanding issue to be resolved in relation to the local planning process and it is one that the Hansard Society highlighted as an issue of concern when the Bill was first published earlier this year. Whereas each council can currently determine what kinds of planning decisions are taken by council committees and what kinds are taken by council officers, the Bill would allow the Government to make regulations to provide for a national scheme of delegation that would apply to all councils. The Bill initially provided that these regulations would be subject to the negative scrutiny procedure, under which Ministers could sign the regulations into law prior to laying them before Parliament and would remain in law unless either House actively voted to reject them within 40 days.

The House of Lords amendment proposes instead to apply the affirmative procedure but only to the first set of regulations enacting a national scheme of delegation. This would ensure the regulations must be actively debated and approved by both Houses before they can be signed by the Minister and become law. The Government previously sought to remove this Lords amendment, but it has since conceded. Today’s sitting is necessary for the Commons to formally agree to re-insert the Lords proposal, subject to a minor drafting change.

In accordance with the programme order agreed by the House on 13 November, the debate will conclude no later than one hour after it begins, after which the questions on Lords amendments will be put to the House. However, since the Government has conceded on the amendment and will only put forward a drafting change, no divisions are expected.

Mental Health Bill (Consideration of Lords Message): Again, there is just one outstanding area of disagreement between the two Houses in relation to parental responsibility for children. As outlined in more detail in a previous edition of the Bulletin, the Lords originally made an amendment to the Bill to allow someone other than a person with parental responsibility – such as a guardian or person with a childcare court order – to represent children detained under the 1983 Mental Health Act, which was then removed by the Commons.

At its sitting on 24 November, the Lords proposed some alternative amendments, which would still allow a guardian or person with a childcare court order to be appointed, but would leave the decision to the relevant mental health professional. The Commons must decide how to respond to the new Lords amendments. It can either insist on its position, accept the Lords position, or propose an alternative of its own.

Select Committees motion: The House of Lords typically appoints four ‘special inquiry committees’ each session or calendar year (depending on the sessional timetable) devoted to a single subject. Normally at least one of the four committees is a post-legislative scrutiny committee, to review the operation of an Act of Parliament to assess whether it has achieved the intended policy objective(s), to identify any problems in implementation and to recommend how these might be addressed.

An investigation by the Commissioner for Standards found that Lord Dannatt breached the Code of Conduct by contacting Ministers and officials about three companies in which he held a financial interest, and by suggesting to undercover reporters that he could introduce them to people within Government. The Commissioner recommended a four-month suspension from the House of Lords. Lord Dannatt did not appeal the findings or the recommended sanction.

An investigation by the Commissioner for Standards found that Lord Evans of Watford breached the Code of Conduct by sponsoring events in Parliament for a company owned by his son, in which he held a one-third stake. He was also found to have told undercover journalists that he could introduce them to MPs. The Commissioner recommended a five-month suspension from the House. Lord Evans did not appeal the findings or the recommended sanction.

Sustainable Aviation Bill (Order of Commitment): After the Bill’s Second Reading, the House agreed that the Bill’s Committee Stage would be in Grand Committee – which takes place in a large Committee room known as the Moses Room – rather than a Committee of the Whole House in the Lords Chamber. The Government now intends to move that this order of commitment be set aside, so the Bill can instead begin its Committee Stage in a Committee of the Whole House on Wednesday 10 December. Any additional Committee Stage required after that first day would then take place in Grand Committee.

English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill (Second Reading): Peers will debate the Government’s legislation to reform the structure of local government in England, which has already passed through the House of Commons. The Bill’s central provisions were outlined in an earlier edition of the Bulletin. Significant new amendments that the Government put forward in the Commons were also discussed in an earlier edition. (House of Lords Library briefing)

At Second Reading, Peers will debate the general principles underlying the Bill. No amendments to the text can be made at this stage. The House of Lords rarely votes against Government Bills at Second Reading, and they usually proceed without a division. Once the Bill has received its Second Reading, it will be committed for detailed clause-by-clause scrutiny in Grand Committee.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Liberal Democrat MP Dr Al Pinkerton will seek to introduce the UK–EU Customs Union (Duty to Negotiate) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the Government to enter into negotiations with the EU to agree a customs union. See our Hansard Society guide for more information about the parliamentary procedure for Ten Minute Rule Bills.

Ten Minute Rule Motion: Conservative MP Katie Lam will seek to introduce the Data Publication and Quality (Immigration, Nationality and Country of Birth) Bill under the Ten Minute Rule which allows MPs to give a ten-minute speech in favour of a Bill before seeking the House’s permission to introduce it. The Bill would require the collection of data on the immigration status, nationality and country of birth of users of public services, claimants of certain benefits, the prison population, and arrests, and to require that such data is published at least once a year.

Opposition Day (Conservatives): This is the 14th of 20 Opposition Days scheduled this Session – days when Government business does not have priority and precedence is instead given to motions tabled by opposition parties. As this is a Conservative Opposition Day, the subject will be chosen by the Leader of the Opposition, Kemi Badenoch. However, Opposition Day topics are typically not announced in advance, so the motion may not be known until Wednesday’s Order Paper is published.

Planning and Infrastructure Bill (Consideration of Commons Amendments): Assuming the House of Commons agrees the Government’s drafting amendment relating to a national scheme of planning delegation on Monday, it will then need to be agreed by the House of Lords. This is unlikely to require a division, since it relates to a limited drafting change to a Government concession.

Employment Rights Bill (Consideration of Commons Amendments and Reasons): The Government has tabled a series of alternative amendments on the five issues of disagreement outlined above in relation to Monday’s business. For each issue, Peers will need to decide whether to insist on their earlier position, accept the Commons’ position, or propose an alternative of their own.

General debate on St. Andrew’s Day and Scottish affairs: This debate was proposed by Graeme Downie, the Labour MP for Dunfermline and Dollar. In his application to the Backbench Business Committee, he argued that it would be “an opportunity for all political parties to come together and share the excellent things that Scotland has done in the past and could continue to do in the future.”

Select Committees can ask the Backbench Business Committee for time to make a statement announcing the launch of an inquiry or the publication of a report. These statements are usually delivered in the Chamber during backbench business time on Thursdays. The statement, presented by the relevant Committee chair or another designated member of the Committee, consists of a 10-minute speech during which interventions are not permitted, followed by 10 minutes of questions from MPs, to which the Select Committee member responds.

General debate on the impact of foreign interference on security, trade and democracy: Liberal Democrat MP James MacCleary proposed this debate to discuss the “changing and sophisticated threats from hostile foreign actors” and “the deliberate targeting of democratic institutions, the spread of disinformation to sow division, and cyber-attacks designed to weaken and undermine Governments around the world”. In his application to the Backbench Business Committee, he said the broad-ranging debate would “offer Parliament an opportunity to send a clear and united message to the rest of the world, and to people across this country, that foreign attempts to erode our sovereignty will not be tolerated”. It would also be an opportunity for “a lot of Back Benchers who do not necessarily get a lot of time to speak on foreign affairs, to express individual views”.

Oral questions: At 11:00, Peers will begin the day by questioning Ministers for 40 minutes, on powers and fiscal instruments to business improvement districts to accelerate town-centre renewal and local growth; intelligence sharing with the United States of America; and the role social media platforms play in enabling scam adverts and fraudulent content. The topic of a fourth question will be decided by a ballot drawn at lunchtime on Tuesday 9 December.

Immigration Skills Charge (Amendment) Regulations 2025: Peers will be asked to approve these draft Regulations which were debated in Grand Committee on 4 December. The Immigration Skills Charge (ISC) is a mandatory fee that must be paid when a UK employer sponsors a foreign worker for a visa. These regulations will increase ISC rates by 32%. This step-change is because the rates have not been reviewed since the ISC was introduced in 2017. The regulations have been drawn to the attention of the House by the Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee. It asked the Government why the ISC rates had not been increased since 2018 and what plans were being put in place to ensure that the rates were reviewed and updated more regularly in future. It described the Minister’s response as “unhelpfully vague” and called on the Home Office to “to keep the ISC under regular review so that it retains its real terms value and to avoid large step-changes in the amounts payable in the future”.

Question for Short Debate (QSD): Labour Peer Lord Hunt of Kings Heath will ask about the Government’s plans to publish a strategy for ensuring high-quality and equitable wheelchair and community equipment provision by NHS and social care services. QSDs are drawn from a ballot every five sitting weeks. The first four entries drawn from the ballot are debated in Grand Committee on a Thursday, with the other entries appearing on a supplementary list in the order they were drawn. Questions on the supplementary list can be taken in the Chamber as short debates between items of business, either in the lunch break, dinner break, or as the last business of the day. (House of Lords Library briefing)

10:00: Public Accounts Committee – Whole of Government Accounts 2023-24: James Bowler, the Permanent Secretary at HM Treasury, will give evidence alongside other senior officials from the Treasury and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. The Whole of Government Accounts (WGA) are the consolidated accounts of thousands of national, regional and local public organisations. In 2022-23, the National Audit Office (NAO) was unable to sign off the WGA because only 10% of local councils submitted reliable audit data. The NAO report on the WGA for 2023-24 was published in June and the Comptroller and Auditor General was again unable to provide assurance to Parliament about the accounts due to the “severe backlogs in English local authority accounts and audits”.

At the time of writing, 1,110 amendments have been tabled, and Peers may continue tabling amendments right up to the final sitting. As we outlined in our recent blog, this is an unprecedented volume of amendments for any Bill in the past 20 years.

At Committee Stage, amendments can be grouped and debated together to keep the discussion focussed and coherent and to avoid unnecessary repetition. To date, the Government Whips have organised the 1,110 amendments into 84 groups. Across the three sittings so far, the House has debated:

In total, this means the House has debated just six of the 84 groups, covering 80 (7%) of the amendments tabled, leaving over 1,000 amendments still to be considered. Ten additional days have been scheduled in the New Year. It is not yet clear how these days will be allocated between Committee Stage, Report Stage and any subsequent stages. However, even if all ten days were devoted exclusively to Committee Stage, the current pace – advancing by only two or three groups per sitting – would far fall short of what is needed to complete the remaining groups in time.

Lord Falconer has set a target of debating ten groups at each sitting, but each time the House has fallen significantly short. At the end of the last sitting (Friday 5 December), the Government Chief Whip, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, said that three groups was “less than I had hoped for” and urged that “all noble Lords need to reflect on that before we resume our consideration of this Bill next Friday”.",,N,,2025-12-06 21:56:13.930461

$300 million planned investment will double XCF’s total SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually, positioning New Rise Reno as a major U.S. SAF production center.

Global demand accelerates as mandates tighten, creating one of the strongest growth opportunities in renewable fuels – one that XCF’s modular SAF platform is positioned to capture.

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today announced new development milestones at its New Rise Reno 2 site, the Company’s second SAF production facility and the next deployment of its scalable, modular production platform.

XCF has completed initial site work at New Rise Reno 2, including grading of the 10-acre parcel and construction of new access roads. Engineering, design, and project planning are underway, positioning construction to begin in 2026.

Located adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new site will benefit from integration with common facilities such as gas, water, rail, and personnel offices as well as existing pre-treatment, hydrogen production, and broader logistics infrastructure – reducing capital costs, lowering execution risk, and accelerating time to production.

Since inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF’s flagship New Rise Reno facility. New Rise Reno 2 represents the next phase of this growth strategy, with an expected $300 million investment enabling XCF to double SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, commented:

“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy. By adding a second, fully integrated facility, we’re turning New Rise Reno intoa major U.S. SAF production center and positioning XCF for sustained, long-term growth. This expansion exemplifies how XCF grows: intentionally, efficiently, and with a platform built to meet surging global demand.”

Expanding Global Reach

The development of New Rise Reno 2 strengthens XCF’s ability to meet rising SAF demand across the world’s most important aviation markets. In November, XCF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) with BGN INT US LLC (“BGN”), a global energy and commodities group, to jointly develop global distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic markets.

The partnership would connect XCF’s expanding production capacity with BGN’s global logistics and trading network, creating an integrated supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

This strategic alignment comes as demand accelerates across major aviation markets.

U.S. SAF Grand Challenge: Federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050; however, current U.S. production remains below 1% of jet fuel demand.

ReFuelEU Aviation Mandates: Airlines will be required to blend 2% SAF in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035, ultimately rising to 70% by 2050. With regional supply unable to meet these mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face structural shortages and persistently elevated SAF pricing.

Together, the U.S. and Europe represent one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in the clean-energy transition, with the U.S. SAF market projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030 and global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF’s scalable, modular SAF platform is built to scale directly into this opportunity.

XCF will continue to provide updates as development progresses.

Boeing is playing its part in this, with the US manufacturer recently filing a patent for an emissions reduction system. While it may not be as attention-grabbing as electric or hydrogen aircraft, this could have a real impact on commercial aviation.

Boeing's emissions reduction system combines software, data analysis, and sustainability planning to help airlines, regulators, and stakeholders understand and manage emissions. It shows that reducing carbon is not just about new fuel types or aircraft designs; it is also about tracking and planning smarter. In this article, we will take a closer look at the patent filed by Boeing and the impact it may have on the commercial aviation industry going forward.

The Patent Filed By Boeing

In 2023, Boeing was granted a patent for a “System and Method for Dynamic Display of Aircraft Emissions Data,” which, put simply, is a software tool that collects emissions data from flights and presents it in a clear, interactive display. Airlines can use the system to test different strategies, such as increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or upgrading older aircraft to newer models like the Boeing 737 MAX, 777X, or Airbus A350.

For example, an airline could use the system to see how emissions would change if 50% of its short-haul flights currently operated by Boeing 737‑800s switched to 737 MAXs, which are roughly 14% more fuel-efficient. For long-haul operations, an airline could evaluate how replacing older Boeing 777‑200ERs with 777X aircraft or optimizing 787‑9 flight paths would affect emissions. The system allows users to adjust these variables dynamically, providing a realistic view of potential outcomes, while also enabling scenario comparisons, like combining SAF use with fleet upgrades, giving airlines a comprehensive view of how multiple strategies interact.

This tool could become particularly valuable for carriers with mixed fleets. For instance, American Airlines operates a large number of both Boeing 737‑800s and 737 MAXs for domestic routes, alongside 787‑8s and 787‑9s for long-haul operations. Using the tool, the oneworld carrier can see how incremental fleet upgrades or SAF adoption on certain routes impact overall emissions. The latest data from ch-aviation shows that American Airlines currently operates a total of 1,005 aircraft, with a further 298 on order, as outlined in the table below:

Similarly, Delta Air Lines could model the benefits of efficiency improvements on its Boeing 777‑200ERs or Airbus A330-300s, helping the carrier make informed decisions about where to invest in fleet modernization, SAF production, or operational adjustments. Compared to American Airlines, Delta Air Lines operates a slightly smaller fleet, made up of 986 aircraft, with 261 on order:

Simple Flying has reached out to Boeing for comment on the patent for its emissions reduction system.

Aligning With Boeing's Broader Sustainability Goals

The patent for Boeing's emissions reduction system is part of the manufacturer's broader push to reduce emissions across its operations. Boeing has also launched the Cascade Climate Impact Model - a platform designed to help airlines, policymakers, and manufacturers explore different ways to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 by looking at emissions from fuel production, aircraft operations, and even recycling and end-of-life disposal, allowing a full lifecycle view of the environmental impact.

The new emissions reduction system can be seen as a hands-on, practical version of the Cascade Climate Impact Model, as airlines can use it to model realistic outcomes rather than relying on theoretical projections, turning abstract climate goals into measurable, actionable decisions, and helping airlines set realistic targets and track progress.

Boeing’s approach reflects the complexity of sustainability in aviation. Reducing emissions is not just about adopting a single solution; it involves multiple elements, from fuel and fleet management to operations and even route planning. By providing a tool that can integrate these factors, Boeing enables airlines to see how incremental changes can add up to meaningful reductions, even before radical technologies like electric or hydrogen planes become commercially viable.

Increased Transparency & Accountability

Major airlines operate thousands of flights every day, often with different aircraft types and fuel mixes. Tracking emissions across all these variables is complex, and so decisions about fleet upgrades, SAF adoption, or operational improvements are often made with incomplete information. Boeing’s emissions reduction system addresses this challenge by allowing airlines to model different strategies and see their projected impact, and by providing a clear visual representation of outcomes, the system helps airlines make informed, data-driven decisions.

Transparency is another key benefit of Boeing's emissions reduction system. Regulators, investors, and the public increasingly expect airlines to report their emissions accurately and demonstrate progress toward sustainability goals. Having a standardized tool to model and display emissions can help carriers to provide credible data, and it also encourages accountability, with airlines able to test strategies, measure their effectiveness, and adjust plans if they are not achieving the desired reductions.

The Limits Of Boeing's Patent

It is important to note that Boeing's emissions reduction system is a tool, not a solution on its own, and it does not reduce emissions directly. Real reductions depend on airlines taking action, such as replacing older Boeing 737‑700 or 737‑800 aircraft with 737 MAX models, upgrading long-haul fleets with 787‑10s or 777Xs, investing in SAF, or improving operational efficiency. The upcoming Boeing 777X is currently undergoing testing before its planned entry into commercial service in 2027.

The emissions reduction system’s accuracy relies on correct data and realistic assumptions, and overestimating fuel availability, fleet renewal rates, or efficiency gains could lead to misleading projections. The tool also focuses primarily on carbon dioxide emissions and does not address other environmental concerns, such as nitrogen oxide emissions, contrails, or noise pollution. Additionally, adoption is not guaranteed, and airlines must integrate it into planning processes, train staff to use it effectively, and ensure it complements any other sustainability strategies. Nevertheless, Boeing's emissions reduction system represents a significant step forward and a practical, actionable step that complements other initiatives.

What Could This Mean For The Commercial Aviation Industry?

If widely adopted, Boeing’s emissions reduction system could become an industry standard for planning and tracking emissions, and airlines could use it to decide which aircraft to retire, how much SAF to buy, or which operational improvements to implement. For example, American Airlines is already investing in SAF and modernizing its fleet with 737 MAXs and 787‑9s. Delta Air Lines is focusing on fleet efficiency with its Airbus A330-900 and A350-900 aircraft, while United Airlines is replacing its older aircraft and increasing SAF use to meet its net-zero targets. With this tool, airlines can model these strategies and see their combined effect on emissions, rather than relying on rough estimates.

The system could also influence future aircraft design and operations. By quantifying the emissions impact of fleet renewal and next-generation aircraft, airlines can make stronger business cases for cleaner, more efficient aircraft. Over time, tools like this can help the industry grow without proportionally increasing carbon emissions, making it easier to meet climate goals while maintaining air travel demand.

In practical terms, this means that even small decisions, such as which Boeing 737s to deploy on short routes or how to optimize long-haul flights, can be evaluated and optimized. Over years of operations, these incremental changes add up, potentially saving millions of gallons of fuel and millions of lbs of carbon dioxide, while keeping airlines competitive and compliant with increasingly strict environmental regulations.

A Significant Development For The Future Of Aviation

Some critics say that aviation focuses too much on futuristic solutions like hydrogen or electric aircraft while ignoring practical steps that matter today. Boeing’s patent proves that both approaches are needed, and the emissions reduction system will help airlines across the world to manage current emissions and plan realistic ways to reduce them, while still investing in new technologies for the future.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/emissions.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-06 17:56:09.324319

Transportation is a key sector that contributes significantly to global greenhouse gas emissions. The fuel used is a key determinant. This explains why electric cars are expanding. Air transport has come under considerable pressure to increase the use of SAF, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel. So is marine transport, where new maritime rulings insist on greater use of renewable and low-emission fuel. The other solution is the deployment of mass transport. To move people and goods, the train has come out on top as the most efficient mass transport instrument. Global investments on rail networks are seen rising worldwide for that reason. As Malaysia steams ahead with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), there’s no shortage of opinions about whether it’s a wise national investment or a costly gamble. Like many ambitious infrastructure projects, the ECRL sits at the crossroads of hope and caution, promise and peril. The stakes are high not only in ringgit terms but in what it means for Malaysia’s future economic geography, regional equity, and geopolitical positioning.

At its heart, the ECRL is about connectivity. For decades, development in Malaysia has been disproportionately clustered along the west coast, from Penang to Johor. The east coast, rich in culture, natural resources, and tourism potential, has struggled to keep pace. The ECRL promises to narrow this divide, stitching together Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu, and Kota Bharu with the economic heartbeat of the Klang Valley. On paper, the benefits are compelling; faster travel times, enhanced trade routes, better labor mobility, and the rise of new growth nodes along the corridor. The Kuantan Port, for instance, could emerge as a strategic logistics hub linking the South China Sea to Peninsular Malaysia’s hinterland. Tourism circuits, long hampered by poor accessibility, might finally come into their own. Kelantan which has been wallowing at the bottom of the country’s economic ladder may suddenly wake up from its slumber.

Yet, infrastructure alone does not guarantee prosperity. History is littered with examples of underutilised mega-projects that failed to deliver promised economic returns because complementary policies, industries, and ecosystems were missing. The question Malaysia must grapple with is whether the ECRL will be just a railway or the backbone of a broader, integrated development strategy. There are financial realities to confront, too. Even after renegotiations, the ECRL remains one of Malaysia’s most expensive infrastructure projects. Its success depends on achieving cargo and passenger volumes that may prove optimistic in the short to medium term, especially if road transport remains dominant and east coast population densities remain modest. Without careful demand management and aggressive industrial development along its route, the line risks becoming an underutilized asset.

Then there’s the geopolitical dimension. As part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ECRL embeds Malaysia deeper into regional supply chains, an opportunity, but also a strategic risk. Dependence on external financing, construction expertise, and operational know-how must be balanced with local capacity building, technology transfer, and safeguards for national interests. Ultimately, the ECRL will be judged not by its length or cost, but by its legacy. Will it reduce regional inequality, catalyze new industries, and create sustainable livelihoods? Or will it become another symbol of misplaced priorities and economic overreach? The project’s wisdom lies not merely in laying down steel tracks but in what Malaysia chooses to build around them. Ports, industrial zones, tourism clusters, and vocational training centers must all align with this infrastructure to create a viable economic ecosystem. Only then will the ECRL transform from a bold bet into a wise investment.

As the trains begin to roll in the coming years, so too must our determination to ensure that this project delivers more than promises, but real, lasting progress for all Malaysians. The ECRL connects underdeveloped states (Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang) to the Klang Valley, reducing regional inequality. Faster cargo transport could cut shipping times between Port Klang and Kuantan Port, enhancing Malaysia’s trade competitiveness. It strengthens ties with China, Malaysia’s largest trading partner, potentially attracting more BRI-linked investments. Aligns with ASEAN’s Master Plan on Connectivity, positioning Malaysia as a regional logistics hub. There are long-term infrastructure gains. Shifting freight from road to rail would reduce highway congestion and carbon emissions. Must not forget the tourism potential with improved access to east coast tour destinations.

The UAE’s Tawazun Council disclosed 20 major defence contracts valued at AED 18.016 billion, supporting technology transfer, localisation, and industrial development.

21 November — Innovation and industry consolidation

The closing day emphasised cultural and technological engagement. The “Airshow After Dark” drone display showcased future mobility concepts, including hydrogen aircraft, rockets, and space vehicles, reflecting Dubai’s experiential approach to industry interaction.

Technology, sustainability, and space

Airbus strengthened research partnerships with the Technology Innovation Institute (TII) and Aspire, while renewing collaborations with Strata and Mubadala, reinforcing the UAE’s role in global aerospace supply chains.

Sustainability featured prominently, with exhibition halls powered entirely by renewable energy. Participating aircraft utilised sustainable aviation fuel, and Jetex deployed electrically and propane-powered ground support equipment, highlighting the sector’s shift towards lower-emission operations.

The largest Space Pavilion in Airshow history, organised with the UAE Space Agency, convened over 50 experts and astronauts to discuss commercialisation, regulatory frameworks, and space-economy infrastructure, underscoring Dubai’s growing influence in space technology.

Air cargo: Strategic focus

While passenger aircraft dominated headlines, the cargo sector also drew attention through freighter conversions, digital tracking systems, and autonomous logistics solutions. Etihad’s A350F order and investments in A330-900 capacity reflect fleet modernisation aimed at enhancing belly-hold and dedicated freighter operations.

Middle Eastern carriers, already commanding a significant share of global cargo, are strengthening aircraft and digital capabilities to maintain competitiveness amid structurally higher post-pandemic volumes.

Conclusion: A defining edition for global aerospace

With historic aircraft orders, expanded defence capabilities, technology partnerships, and sustainability initiatives, Dubai Airshow 2025 reinforced its role as a bellwether for global aviation.

The event demonstrated that the Middle East, supported by ambitious national strategies and substantial investment, is reshaping fleet priorities and accelerating next-generation aerospace development. As the industry prepares for its next cycle of innovation, the 2025 Airshow will be remembered as a pivotal moment in commercial aviation, defence aerospace, and space technology.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/R6026497-1-1080x659.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:57:37.002846

Segundo a presidente da Petrobras, Magda Chambriard, o combustível produzido por coprocessamento nas refinarias da companhia é competitivo, atende a padrões internacionais e permitirá ao mercado brasileiro antecipar o cumprimento do CORSIA, programa global da ICAO (Organização da Aviação Civil Internacional, em português) para reduzir emissões em voos internacionais.

A Petrobras afirma que o avanço consolida o Brasil como ator relevante no mercado de combustíveis sustentáveis e reforça a intenção da companhia de liderar a transição energética no país.

As primeiras unidades foram produzidas na Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), autorizada pela ANP (agência Nacional de Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis) a incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável. Outras refinarias avançam na preparação para ampliar a oferta: a Revap (SP) já realizou testes, enquanto a Replan (SP) e a Regap (MG) devem iniciar produção e comercialização até 2026.

O SAF da Petrobras tem certificação ISCC-CORSIA, que valida critérios de sustentabilidade.

Europe has seen a litany of nations turning to the sector in order to meet clean energy and emission reduction mandates implemented by the EU Commission. Finland is the latest European nation to turn to the often-overlooked clean energy-generating potential of hydrogen, with Hy2Gen selecting Oulu as the site for a 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility.

Hy2Gen has acquired the land needed for a new hydrogen-based e-fuel facility

The European sentiment towards the hydrogen sector has reached a new tipping point recently, as Finland has been selected as the preferred site for a new 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility being developed by none other than Hy2Gen. The firm has secured the required rights to purchase land in Oulu for the new facility, but has not revealed the costs it incurred.

The Germany-based energy firm has stated that a more detailed plan will be presented at an event on 12 February 2026, so until then, speculation over the volumes of green hydrogen produced can become a regular occurrence. Notably, the project comes as the European continent is spurring investment in the hydrogen sector following recent commitments to clean energy that were reaffirmed at the G20 Summit in South Africa.

Hydrogen-based energy production has grown beyond previous expectations in recent years

Developing new and pioneering forms of hydrogen-based energy has become the latest trend to sweep across the international energy market, blasting past previous expectations for the sector. Finland is not known for its energy production, and has been embroiled in the danger of Russia entering its borders due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine.

Hy2Gen is positioning Finland to become a regional leader in the e-fuel sector

The firm has noted that the development plans for its 200 MW hydrogen-based e-fuel production facility in Oulu could potentially transform the nation into a regional hub for clean energy production. The plan will enable Oulu to become the largest hub for e-fuel production in the Baltic Sea region based on the number of power-to-X projects being developed by a litany of energy companies in the area.

For instance, Verso Energy’s €1.4bn sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility has been receiving remarkable praise from energy experts as it aims to develop hydrogen-based synthetic fuels. Several European nations are turning to the hydrogen sector to develop alternative power generation sources in the near future, such as the Netherlands’ deal with Plug Power.

Janne Hietaniemi, Key Account Director of BusinessOulu, has noted the substantial benefits of the project being planned, such as strong R&D expertise at the University of Oulu, the overwhelming potential that the region has to support hydrogen-based fuel production, and strategic connectivity through the EU’s TEN-T transport network.

“Furthermore, Gasgrid Finland is planning to establish a hydrogen transport infrastructure to link Oulu’s production capacity with other regions in Finland and across Europe.” – Janne Hietaniemi, Key Account Director of BusinessOulu

Europe’s proclivity for the renewable energy market is set to propel hydrogen production to new heights

Regardless of the sentiment shared by several nations over the potential fallout of the inevitable phasing out of coal and oil production. A litany of European nations is turning to the hydrogen sector to develop new plans for a brand new era of clean energy production. Germany has opened what will be its largest commercial green hydrogen facility in Baden-Württemberg, exemplifying the nation’s plans to increase green hydrogen production across its energy network over the coming years.

They eliminated water from coach over the summer but were forced to bring it back. Last year they served breakfasts in the afternoon in business class because it’s cheaper than other meals. They’re devaluing their miles again.

The airline is now surveying customers to learn what passengers are willing to do to save the carrier money next:

“Opting out of receiving an in-flight meal ahead of flying” British Airways partner Japan Airlines has called skipping meals the ‘ethical choice’ for the environment, suggesting it’s unethical to eat on board. JAL, though, offered customers a reward of an amenity kit for opting out of the meal, so they probably aren’t even reducing waste.

Delta – which owns an oil refinery – suggested that customers opt out of meals for the environment as well.

United offers the meal opt-out and offers it as two different choices in their pre-order meal selection flow.

“Travelling with fewer items of luggage” Less weight saves fuel, and potentially they could save on baggage handlers and equipment as well.

“Bringing a reusable water bottle or travel mug to refill at the airport or onboard my flight” They’re back with another run at cutting down on the expense of bottled water in the cabin.

“Opting out of receiving sleepwear ahead of flying” on routes that feature pajamas BA might save a few pair for future flights.

“Packing less than the maximum luggage allowance weight” Another way of asking the baggage question to save fuel.

“Opting out of receiving amenity kits ahead of flying” just like pajamas.

“Selecting my meal preference ahead of flying” British Airways actually offered this option prior to the pandemic, but it never returned. Today they only offer pre-order of special (e.g. religious, diabetic, etc.) meals.

Here’s the actual survey question:

This selection does not appear to include anything that British Airways would add for customers, and or seem to suggest British Airways would offer customers anything in exchange (although it might be smart for them to do so). It’s likely instead that the narrative would be passengers are benefiting the environment by reducing food waste and disposal of single use items.

It reflects a mindset reminiscent of the 2017 move under CEO Alex Cruz to only offer cold airplane tank water for free on intra-Europe flights – even hot water for customers to make their own tea was charged. In 2018 they began testing offering water as a free perk to elite frequent flyers.

If you don’t like it when cuts are implemented? Flight attendants have been instructed not to apologize.

Another historic British Airways slogan was “To fly, to serve.” They’re reinventing it, it seems, as “To fly, to serve as little as possible.”

PCI’s total energy trade volume reached 530 million metric tons in 2024, covering crude oil, refined fuels, natural gas, chemicals and green commodities.
“The publication of our first ESG report reflects our understanding of global trends, our long-term strategy for sustainable growth and our response to economic and social expectations,” Luo said.
Wen Yamei, a senior CNPC expert, said PCI’s ESG practices combine the responsibilities of a state-owned enterprise with the demands of global energy trading.
She said the report serves as a practical model for multinational energy companies pursuing similar sustainability pathways.","PetroChina International Co. Ltd. (PCI), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), released its first Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Report on December 4 in Beijing, marking a major step in the company’s path toward becoming a world-class energy trader by 2025, reports China.org.cn.

The report outlines PCI’s sustainability principles, actions and performance. Executive Director Wu Junli said the company is building a “diversified and synergistic energy trade ecosystem” to navigate an increasingly complex global energy environment shaped by geopolitical tensions, supply-security challenges and the accelerating shift toward low-carbon energy.

PCI’s total energy trade volume reached 530 million metric tons in 2024, covering crude oil, refined fuels, natural gas, chemicals and green commodities. The company expects this figure to rise above 540 million metric tons in 2025, keeping it among the world’s leading energy traders. It has also expanded its role in major benchmark markets, becoming a key Brent market participant, an active trader in the Platts window and a fast-growing player in global gas and power trading.

Wu said the company is strengthening its low-carbon services, with annual carbon-trading volume exceeding 16 million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent and electricity-trading volume surpassing 18 million MWh. PCI has advanced low-carbon projects in Australia, Central Asia and other regions, and completed the world’s first physical sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) transaction through the Argus platform.

“These milestones show our accelerating shift toward green and low-carbon development as we work to build a sustainable future energy system,” he said.

The report said PCI has reinforced its ESG-driven risk-governance framework by integrating compliance, internal controls and auditing. In 2024, it achieved full due-diligence coverage across counterparties, banks, insurers and shipping partners, along with 100% compliance-training coverage for employees.

On human-capital development, PCI expanded its global job-grading system, mobility pathways and employee well-being programmes. In 2024, 84% of staff in international operations were local hires, with a growing share of foreign executives. The company also broadened community programmes and support for vulnerable groups, aligning business development with environmental and social goals.

At the release ceremony, PCI general manager Luo Yizhou called the report’s publication a “milestone moment” in strengthening the company’s competitiveness. He said that as China advances high-quality development driven by ecological protection and low-carbon growth, companies are expected not only to create economic value but also to contribute to environmental protection, social progress and improved governance.

“The publication of our first ESG report reflects our understanding of global trends, our long-term strategy for sustainable growth and our response to economic and social expectations,” Luo said. He added that PCI will continue embedding sustainability across its operations while working with partners to build a more stable and inclusive community of shared future.

Lu Ruquan, president of the CNPC Economics & Technology Research Institute, which helped compile the report, said global ESG frameworks are entering a period of restructuring as countries balance climate targets, energy security and competitiveness. Energy-trading companies, he said, are now “critical hubs for green transition, energy security, market resilience and technological innovation.”

Highlighting green shipping, Lu noted PCI’s involvement in building six large LNG carriers with advanced technologies. These vessels offer lower energy consumption, high operational reliability and strong fire-safety performance, meeting top international standards. “This investment shows PCI’s commitment to low-carbon operations and strengthens industry momentum toward a greener future,” he said.

Wen Yamei, a senior CNPC expert, said PCI’s ESG practices combine the responsibilities of a state-owned enterprise with the demands of global energy trading. She said the report serves as a practical model for multinational energy companies pursuing similar sustainability pathways.

“Its significance extends beyond PCI’s own disclosures,” Wen said. “It provides a reference for companies advancing comparable sustainability strategies.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-9.png,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:07.883353

The deal follows a series of strategic meetings and collaborations held during ADIPEC 2025, reports Zawya.

The partnership highlights the growing momentum from ADIPEC 2025 and marks another step in MENA Biofuels’ plan to build a fully integrated SAF value chain — covering feedstock sourcing, production, testing, certification and offtake.

The new laboratory will be located in the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone and operate under internationally recognised standards. It will provide independent verification and certification to ensure that SAF produced in the UAE meets global aviation-fuel requirements for both domestic use and export.

Mohamed Saeed Al Raqbani, chairman of MENA Biofuels, said the partnership strengthens the company’s commitment to creating a transparent and globally trusted SAF ecosystem. “Establishing this laboratory in Fujairah ensures that every litre of SAF produced in the UAE is tested, verified and certified to the highest international standards,” he said.

Gati Al Jebouri, CEO of MENA Biofuels, called the collaboration a clear sign of progress since ADIPEC 2025, bringing together technology, expertise and shared purpose to help the UAE’s SAF meet global quality and sustainability benchmarks.

Saybolt president Peter Boks said the partnership marks an important step toward establishing a strong analytical framework for SAF in the region. He said the Fujairah lab will feature advanced instruments and internationally recognised procedures to precisely assess SAF properties, trace feedstock origins and verify lifecycle emissions.

By providing independent certification and quality assurance, Saybolt aims to support regulatory compliance, promote global trade and strengthen the UAE’s SAF value chain, he added.

The agreement follows other major partnerships revealed by MENA Biofuels during ADIPEC 2025 and the Dubai Airshow, including offtake MoUs with Emarat, ENOC, ADNOC and Evertree. Together, these initiatives form a comprehensive framework covering feedstock, production, certification and distribution, further solidifying the UAE’s leadership in sustainable fuel innovation and aviation decarbonisation.

The new laboratory also supports MENA Biofuels’ mission to launch the UAE’s first commercial SAF production facility in Fujairah, positioning the emirate as a regional centre for clean-fuel innovation, certification excellence and export-grade quality assurance.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-2.png,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:16.053615

Now, I don’t have an inside track to what really conspired at IndiGo leading up to this moment.
Things happen, but at this scale, it has been a long, long while.
It’s like they like to take credit for things done right, but when something goes wrong, it is “Team IndiGo”.
And I’m sure there are a ton of things I’ve missed, but one thing is clear.","When an airline that controls 2/3 of India’s aviation capacity falters, things go massively wrong. All this week, we have seen the viral images of a system that broke down and was not fixed until it was too late. Eventually, aviation is a complex chain of events, and these things happen. Eventually, aviation ticks on 100s of systems working together. Sometimes a passenger service system goes down when the cloud goes down. Sometimes, the luggage belt gives up. Sometimes, there is a Cyber Attack. Sometimes there is a grounding. Sometimes there is a software issue.

When IndiGo left the people to fight for themselves

I’m sure we’ve all seen images all week of bags, people, and circumstances that were not arriving at their destinations because IndiGo did not deliver on its “on time promise”. It is usually a slick operation, and I’ve had deep respect for that ship. But sometimes there is plain stupidity, and that is what we’ve witnessed all week. Or it was an act of connivance, as many conspiracy theorists are saying. What we know is that IndiGo did not have adequate pilots to operate its flights under the new FDTL, and they managed to turn a ton of plans to dust. Weddings, Funerals, Honeymoons, Exams. Without Exception. And it left nonchalance in its wake.

What I’ve been telling people all week long has been, “They could be Stupid, but they couldn’t be Wicked”. Now, I don’t have an inside track to what really conspired at IndiGo leading up to this moment. I wouldn’t know. I will leave it to the government committee that is investigating this to pronounce upon. But I did see how heartless they were. And it was an act equivalent to that of a headless chicken crossing the road.

The usually cheeky airline just shut down and refused to communicate, even with their own people. As a consequence, those on the frontline did not have information to offer customers. And it leads to scenes like these across the airports.

There was a total social media blackout, with the airline not announcing an issue until December 4, 2025, for the first time. Till then, they were quiet and celebrating something on their X Feed.

And this is their website this morning—no mention of any issues on hand, just the usual cheer.

The airline was not communicating AT ALL. This is not how you handle a crisis, by living in Denial for three days.

What the airline could have done, but did not.

The most ridiculous thing IndiGo did was not to handle the whole mess professionally. For instance, for the first three days (December 2-3-4), there was no resolution in sight. IndiGo knew there was a problem, but insisted that people stay inside the airport through repeated postponements, rather than offer a cancellation and send people home. It was in a state of readiness to depart (subject to getting a pilot) rather than in a state of “we cannot handle this, let’s at least release the passengers who are our prisoners right now”. There is a concept in the aviation industry of distress fares. But it costs money when one airline has to endorse its customers to another airline, especially on IndiGo’s scale. Also, IndiGo cannot access those fares because it does not have any arrangement with other airlines, such as Akasa, Air India, or SpiceJet, to have their passengers fly out on another carrier. Those serpentine queues could have been a little smaller, and the noise at the airport would have been less. But oh, the Hubris.

Second, IndiGo could have cancelled flights more proactively, which would have helped them recover faster. Yes, they’d still be unpopular, but the recovery would have been faster. As someone outside the system, I find it so predictable to reset, but IndiGo took until day 4 to reach this conclusion and had to cancel 1000s of flights to get things back on track. Common sense is uncommon these days.

Third, it takes time to organise hotel rooms in an international territory without ground handling. That is what happens with Air India when a plane lands in a Russian Village or in Myanmar. It shouldn’t happen in India, to India’s largest airline, which clearly did not have a contingency plan to round up as many hotel rooms as possible.

Even providing meals or lounge access was a problem for IndiGo because there was either no authorisation to spend money to cover all the food available at the airport, or no intent. Hey, this is a part of the DGCA and the Ministry mandate to provide basics.

IndiGo, it was just being miserly

All of the above problems boil down to two issues. No empowerment of the people down the chain to endorse people to other airlines, no power to book hotels or provide refunds and so on. In my years working in the corporate arena, the one thing I’ve always been taught to think of is Reputation Risk. Here, IndiGo was okay with letting go of its 19 years of Brand Equity to save some bucks.

I’ve always believed in the mantra of “Do Unto Others as you’d want to be done to you.” This week was the antithesis of that adage. The last time I’ve seen this chaos play out was on Air Deccan in the early 2000s, with Indian Airlines in a December Fog cancellation in the 2000s, and then SpiceJet in 2013. Things happen, but at this scale, it has been a long, long while.

The Standard of Care that was never offered.

The airline should have had a simple playbook. Cancel now, grant a refund now, and handle the consequences later. It took IndiGo 4 days to conclude. Only on November 5, after my tweet (which I am sure some competent person at IndiGo had also thought about, not just me), did IndiGo put out a policy of offering full refunds for flights through December 15. What’s mortifying is that these full refunds are only in effect between December 5 and 15, 2025. What about the days of incompetence before? December 1 – 4, 2025, wasn’t a cake walk either, IndiGo.

And even when it came, IndiGo’s language was lame, and it was a non-apology. It was as if they went, Let’s get this out of the way.

Notice that IndiGo is not putting the name of anyone senior on this non-apology. It’s like they like to take credit for things done right, but when something goes wrong, it is “Team IndiGo”. Rahul Bhatia is a rare occurrence, but they could have at least put out the CXOs on the ground to pacify passengers? Even when the DGCA or the MoCA called them in for a dressing-down on December 4, none of them went over.

Please keep in mind that IndiGo promises to refund to your account, but they are unable to process it online, so people are not receiving their full refund right now.

Since Indians love to compare ourselves with the Americans a lot, a carrier had a meltdown earlier this year, I cannot remember the name for the life of me. At the time, rooms were provided, or people were told to get their own rooms and meals, and they’d be refunded. And of course, anything they paid for due to the distress caused by the airline was refunded. From a toothbrush to a shirt to god knows what not. And other things were done for them. Out here, there is no compassion, no duty of care. Not even compliance with the DGCA’s Passenger Charter. It is just apparent defiance.

And I’m sure there are a ton of things I’ve missed, but one thing is clear. The lakhs of IndiGo customers found their trust broken this week; they are all pissed, and they will obviously keep this experience in mind the next time they book flights.

Bottomline

IndiGo let the nation down and made ambassadors miss out on travel, people miss out on meetings, weddings, funerals, exams, and all sorts of situations you can imagine. And they did not bother to treat them with respect either. They just stretched it far enough to make it a progressively worse situation, and did not offer any help to the customers stuck there due to IndiGo. All, because there was no empowerment on the ground and no empathy at the top, but rather the purse strings were kept tight. Or perhaps it was all unintentional, and they did not use common sense. We’ll never know. And since we will never learn from our mistakes, we will see this happen again.

Above him, the roar of a jet engine tore through the tropical air as a Fiji Airways plane descended toward Nadi.
Yet without these planes, Fiji's modern economy would collapse.
A carbon warrior comes to the South Pacific Scurrah is not a recent convert to the cause of environmentalism.
Before Fiji, he ran Pacific National, Australia’s largest private rail freight operator, and served as CEO of Virgin Australia.","On the talcum-fine sands of Fiji's Wailoaloa Beach, Paul Scurrah stood knee-deep in the reality of his job last week. The newly appointed CEO of Fiji Airways was planting a mangrove seedling in the wet earth. Above him, the roar of a jet engine tore through the tropical air as a Fiji Airways plane descended toward Nadi.

""You could see the intersection between what we do for Fiji in terms of connecting the world, and what we have to do for the environment,"" Scurrah says. ""It was quite a powerful image.""

Powerful, but also controversial. The airline chief was planting a tree to protect the coastline from the climate change his industry creates.

For Scurrah, that morning on the beach represented a show-and-tell of the airline's survival strategy as it tries to connect Fiji's 333 islands—where global warming, as he puts it, is ""very obvious and in your face.""

Fiji's island paradox

Scurrah, who is also the airline's managing director, oversees a flag carrier trapped in a dilemma. Aviation is a worrisome source of carbon emissions. Yet without these planes, Fiji's modern economy would collapse.

Tourism accounts for about 40 percent of the nation's GDP. The jets bring the visitors who sustain the archipelago, but their emissions also threaten the coral reefs and coastlines the tourists come to see.

""We would not be able to do what we do without aviation,"" says Scurrah. ""But we emit carbon, and that's contributing to the problem. We are not on our own.""

To navigate this, Scurrah relies on a concept called Maroroya, a Fijian philosophy meaning ""to care, protect, and preserve."" It drives a triple bottom line strategy: balancing financial outcomes, social obligation, and environmental responsibility.

But to understand how a CEO sits in a tropical office talking about saving reefs while burning jet fuel, you have to take a look at his résumé.

A carbon warrior comes to the South Pacific

Scurrah is not a recent convert to the cause of environmentalism. He's a veteran of the carbon wars. Before Fiji, he ran Pacific National, Australia’s largest private rail freight operator, and served as CEO of Virgin Australia.

His career has been defined by machines built to last—locomotives or jetliners that you can’t just swap for a Prius. Economists call them long-dated assets; you need to get a return on investment over 25 years.

Scurrah has the battle scars to prove it. He recalls a conference during his tenure at Virgin Australia, back when the ""plane shaming"" movement—led by environmentalists like Greta Thunberg—was reaching a fever pitch. The industry was in the crosshairs, accused of destroying the planet for the sake of a vacation.

Scurrah, never one to shy away from a fight, took the stage and went off-script, pointing out that commercial aviation accounts for roughly 2 percent of global emissions, while the beef industry churns out 14 percent.

""I don't see people burger-shaming McDonald's,"" he joked with the crowd.

The headline that day was, ""People should be burger-shaming McDonald's."" It was a deflection, perhaps, but it revealed Scurrah’s worldview: He refuses to be the scapegoat for our carbon addiction. His point was statistical, but the backlash was visceral.

""I got all this hate mail from hamburger lovers,"" he laughs.

Now, in Fiji, that defiance has matured into a complex pragmatism. He is no longer just defending an industry, but a nation’s economic lifeline.

He says it's important to ground the lofty talk of sustainability in the hard earth of the bottom line.

""We can't be sustainable unless we're profitable,"" he says.

Flying new planes on smarter routes

The airline’s first line of defense is its planes. By aggressively swapping out older 747s and 737s for modern Airbus A350s and Boeing 737 MAXs, Fiji Airways has cut fuel burn by 25 percent compared to previous models, according to Scurrah.

""That's a pretty big leap,"" he says.

But hardware is only half the battle. The rest lies in human behavior and data. Inside the cockpit, pilots use SkyBreathe Analytics software that helps pilots make real-time decisions to adjust routes and flight profiles to burn less fuel. From 2019 to 2023, this data-driven flying has prevented an estimated 20 million tons of carbon from being released into the atmosphere.

Sugar cane and drone taxis

Scurrah knows the industry's holy grail is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The airline proved its readiness by flying a recent Airbus A350 delivery leg from Singapore using a 40 percent SAF blend. The problem, Scurrah admits, is the real difficulty of supply and the prohibitive cost.

""We don't need to invent everything here,"" he said, noting that Fiji will lean on its Oneworld Alliance partners for global innovation. However, the airline is looking inward as well, investigating the feasibility of producing fuel locally using biomass from Fiji’s domestic sugar cane industry.

Perhaps most futuristically, the airline has invested in electric vertical takeoff and landing technology. Scurrah envisions battery-operated drone-type taxis whisking passengers from the main airport to remote islands with zero emissions—a sci-fi solution to the ""last mile"" problem of island travel.

The world's happiest airline?

Ultimately, Scurrah is banking on a blend of high-tech ambition and traditional values. He recently made a promise to his staff that it would aspire to be the world's happiest airline, leveraging the natural hospitality of the Fijian people.

But that happiness depends on a future where the planes keep flying and the islands stay above water. Back on the beach, with the mangroves in the sand and the jets in the air, the stakes of that gamble are clear. The airline has already planted over 96,000 seedlings, but for Scurrah, the work is just beginning.

""We have to protect the beauty that is a big part of Fiji's heritage and economy,"" he says.

It's a job that requires keeping one eye on the bottom line, and the other on the rising tide.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6932112c4a0c9f04293bcc51/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:20.572003

The company has finished initial preparation at the 10-acre New Rise Reno 2 site, including land grading and construction of new access roads.
“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global.
“By adding a second fully integrated facility, we’re transforming New Rise Reno into a major U.S. SAF production hub and positioning XCF for sustained long-term growth.
The U.S. SAF sector is projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030, with global demand exceeding $25 billion.","XCF Global, Inc., a leading force in aviation decarbonization through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), announced new development milestones at its New Rise Reno 2 site, the company’s second SAF production facility and the next implementation of its modular, scalable production platform.

The company has finished initial preparation at the 10-acre New Rise Reno 2 site, including land grading and construction of new access roads. Engineering, design, and project planning are now in progress, with full construction expected to begin in 2026.

Situated next to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new plant will leverage shared infrastructure—including gas, water, rail access, personnel offices, pre-treatment systems, hydrogen production, and logistics assets—to cut capital expenditures, reduce development risk, and speed up the path to production.

XCF has invested about $350 million in its flagship New Rise Reno facility since launch. New Rise Reno 2 marks the next stage of that expansion plan, with an anticipated $300 million investment that will allow the company to double its annual SAF output to roughly 80 million gallons.

“New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy,” said Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global. “By adding a second fully integrated facility, we’re transforming New Rise Reno into a major U.S. SAF production hub and positioning XCF for sustained long-term growth. This expansion reflects how we build—intentionally, efficiently, and with a platform designed to meet soaring global demand.”

Expanding Global Reach

The addition of New Rise Reno 2 further strengthens XCF’s ability to serve rising SAF demand across key international aviation markets. In November, the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BGN INT US LLC (BGN), a global energy and commodities group, to jointly develop distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic regions.

The collaboration aims to link XCF’s growing production volumes with BGN’s global logistics and trading network, establishing an integrated supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

This alignment comes as demand climbs in major aviation centers.

U.S. SAF Grand Challenge: Federal goals call for producing 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050—enough to meet all domestic jet fuel demand. Yet current U.S. SAF production is still below 1% of total jet fuel use.

ReFuelEU Aviation Mandates: European airlines must blend 2% SAF beginning in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050. With regional capacity falling short of mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face persistent supply deficits and higher SAF prices.

Together, the U.S. and Europe form one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in the clean-energy transition. The U.S. SAF sector is projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030, with global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF’s modular, scalable production platform is designed to expand alongside this opportunity.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/XCF-global-image-logo-updated.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 10:57:28.405509

As primeiras entregas de combustível sustentável de aviação (SAF) foram anunciadas pela Petrobras, na sexta-feira (5), no Rio de Janeiro. A empresa é a primeira a produzir, integralmente no Brasil, o combustível que recebe a certificação de sustentabilidade de acordo com as regras da ICAO (sigla em inglês de Organização Internacional de Aviação Civil). O volume de 3 mil m³ foi comercializado com distribuidoras de combustíveis de aviação que operam no Aeroporto Internacional Tom Jobim (Galeão), no Rio de Janeiro. Esse volume corresponde a cerca de um dia de consumo nos aeroportos do estado.

O combustível sustentável de aviação, também conhecido como SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), pode substituir o querosene de aviação convencional sem necessidade de modificações nas aeronaves ou na infraestrutura de abastecimento. Isso o torna uma solução prática e rápida para reduzir as emissões do setor aéreo.

“O SAF, produzido por coprocessamento no parque de refino da Petrobras, é uma solução que contribui para o cumprimento das metas de descarbonização do setor aéreo. É um produto competitivo, que atende a rigorosos padrões internacionais da aviação. Estamos oferecendo ao mercado nacional a possibilidade de atender às demandas globais, antecipando o cumprimento do CORSIA, que é um programa internacional para a redução das emissões provenientes dos voos internacionais”, afirma a presidente da Petrobras, Magda Chambriard.

A antecipação da produção de SAF em relação à legislação vigente é fundamental para o mercado de aviação, considerando as futuras exigências do setor. A partir de 2027, as companhias aéreas no Brasil deverão começar a usar esse tipo de combustível em voos internacionais, seguindo as regras do programa CORSIA (sigla em inglês de Esquema de Compensação e Redução de Carbono para a Aviação Internacional) da ICAO; e em voos domésticos, com base na Lei do Combustível do Futuro.

Nova geração

O SAF Petrobras tem certificado de sustentabilidade ISCC-CORSIA (siglas em inglês de Certificação Internacional de Sustentabilidade e Carbono – Esquema de Compensação e Redução de Carbono para a Aviação Internacional). É um combustível com menor intensidade de carbono porque utiliza um percentual de matéria-prima de origem vegetal, que é processada junto com o querosene de aviação mineral.

No momento, a Petrobras está certificada para o uso de óleo técnico de milho (TCO), uma matéria-prima residual, ou óleo de soja, com uma redução prevista nas emissões líquidas de CO2 de até 87% na parcela renovável. O produto obtido é quimicamente idêntico ao combustível mineral, mas com uma parcela derivada de matéria-prima sustentável.

O combustível das primeiras entregas foi produzido na Refinaria Duque de Caxias (Reduc), no Rio de Janeiro, certificada para produzir e comercializar SAF. A Reduc possui autorização da Agência Nacional do Petróleo, Gás Natural e Biocombustíveis (ANP) para incorporar até 1,2% de matéria-prima renovável na produção de SAF por essa rota.

A Refinaria Henrique Lage (Revap), em São José dos Campos (SP), já realizou testes para a produção de SAF pela rota de coprocessamento de óleo vegetal com correntes tradicionais de petróleo. A previsão é que, ainda em 2026, a Refinaria de Paulínia (Replan), no estado de São Paulo, e a Refinaria Gabriel Passos (Regap), em Minas Gerais, também passem a produzir e comercializar o combustível.",https://portalbenews.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Reduc_SAF_Home_Credito_Francisco-de-Souza-e1765025168616.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 11:57:47.729296

Fusion mit Subsea 7 unter Beschuss

Die geplante Fusion mit dem Konkurrenten Subsea 7 stößt bei wichtigen Kunden in Brasilien auf massiven Widerstand. Ölkonzerne wie Petrobras, ExxonMobil und TotalEnergies haben formelle Bedenken bei der brasilianischen Wettbewerbsbehörde Cade eingereicht. Sie fürchten, dass der Zusammenschluss den Wettbewerb im Tiefsee-Markt erheblich einschränken könnte.

Das fusionierte Unternehmen ""Saipem7"" würde über einen Auftragsbestand von rund 43 Milliarden Euro und einen Jahresumsatz von etwa 21 Milliarden Euro verfügen. Die schärfsten Einwände betreffen das Geschäft mit Unterwasserleitungen (SURF), wo nur wenige globale Anbieter tätig sind. TotalEnergies bezweifelt in einer Stellungnahme, dass Auflagen die wettbewerblichen Risiken vollständig beseitigen könnten. Cade hat um zusätzliche Daten gebeten; ihre Entscheidung wird für den weiteren Verlauf der Fusion entscheidend sein.

Die starke operative Performance und der wachsende Auftragsbestand bilden ein solides Fundament für Saipem. Die finale Entscheidung der brasilianischen Behörde zur Fusion mit Subsea 7 im kommenden Quartal wird jedoch die strategische Weichenstellung für die kommenden Jahre bestimmen.

Die geplante Fusion mit dem Konkurrenten Subsea 7 stößt bei wichtigen Kunden in Brasilien auf massiven Widerstand. Ölkonzerne wie Petrobras, ExxonMobil und TotalEnergies haben formelle Bedenken bei der brasilianischen Wettbewerbsbehörde Cade eingereicht. Sie fürchten, dass der Zusammenschluss den Wettbewerb im Tiefsee-Markt erheblich einschränken könnte.

Das fusionierte Unternehmen ""Saipem7"" würde über einen Auftragsbestand von rund 43 Milliarden Euro und einen Jahresumsatz von etwa 21 Milliarden Euro verfügen. Die schärfsten Einwände betreffen das Geschäft mit Unterwasserleitungen (SURF), wo nur wenige globale Anbieter tätig sind. TotalEnergies bezweifelt in einer Stellungnahme, dass Auflagen die wettbewerblichen Risiken vollständig beseitigen könnten. Cade hat um zusätzliche Daten gebeten; ihre Entscheidung wird für den weiteren Verlauf der Fusion entscheidend sein.

Die starke operative Performance und der wachsende Auftragsbestand bilden ein solides Fundament für Saipem. Die finale Entscheidung der brasilianischen Behörde zur Fusion mit Subsea 7 im kommenden Quartal wird jedoch die strategische Weichenstellung für die kommenden Jahre bestimmen.

No obstante, existen sectores, como el aéreo, en el que esta transición se torna más compleja debido a la escasez de alternativas sostenibles.

El queroseno de aviación, también conocido como Jet A o Jet A-1, continúa siendo el combustible más utilizado para los aviones de reacción comerciales, mientras que para los aviones con motor de pistón, como las avionetas, se utiliza gasolina de aviación (Avgas).

Como el resto de empresas, las aeronáuticas también tienen la intención de conseguir esa ansiada descarbonización en los próximos años, pero cuentan con la barrera de que la producción de fuel sostenible no cubre el total de la demanda. Hablamos del llamado SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), consolidado en los últimos años como la alternativa más viable para descarbonizar el sector aéreo a corto y medio plazo, ya que además es válido para los aviones que se encuentran actualmente en el mercado.

A diferencia del queroseno convencional derivado del petróleo, el SAF se produce a partir de materias primas sostenibles como residuos orgánicos, aceites usados de cocina, biomasa, desechos agrícolas, residuos forestales e incluso mediante procesos avanzados que capturan dióxido de carbono y generan combustibles sintéticos. Su principal ventaja es que permite reducir las emisiones netas de CO₂ hasta un 80 % a lo largo de su ciclo de vida, dependiendo de la tecnología de producción.

Como decimos, uno de los mayores beneficios de este tipo de fuel es que se puede utilizar en los aviones que actualmente circulan por el mundo e incluso se puede mezclar con el queroseno tradicional sin la necesidad de modificar los motores o las infraestructuras aeroportuarias. En la actualidad, las normativas internacionales permiten mezclas de hasta el 50 %, aunque se están realizando estudios y vuelos de prueba para certificar su uso al 100 % en el futuro.

Muchos países han adoptado objetivos obligatorios de uso de SAF en los próximos años con el objetivo de disminuir el porcentaje de emisiones de efecto invernadero por parte de la aviación, que en la actualidad se sitúa en torno al 2-3 %. Por su parte, aerolíneas como Iberia, Lufthansa, Air France-KLM o United ya han firmado acuerdos con productores para asegurar su suministro.

Cómo se produce

Existen diversos métodos para producir SAF, cada uno con niveles distintos de madurez tecnológica. El más extendido actualmente es el proceso HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), que emplea aceites vegetales usados y grasas animales para obtener un combustible compatible con los motores aeronáuticos.

A este se suman otras vías en desarrollo, como el Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), que transforma alcoholes –por ejemplo, etanol– en queroseno sostenible, o el Gas-to-Liquid (GTL), que convierte gas en combustibles líquidos. Uno de los procesos más prometedores es el Power-to-Liquid (PtL), basado en electricidad renovable, agua y CO₂ capturado para producir combustibles sintéticos con una huella de carbono muy reducida. Aunque hoy estos métodos siguen siendo más caros que los combustibles fósiles tradicionales, se prevé que los avances tecnológicos y la ampliación de la capacidad industrial contribuyan a abaratar sus costes a lo largo de la próxima década.

El principal obstáculo para la expansión del SAF es, sin embargo, su volumen de producción. En la actualidad, representa menos del 0,1 % del combustible utilizado por la aviación en todo el mundo, una cifra insuficiente para provocar cambios significativos en las emisiones del sector. Para alcanzar los objetivos climáticos y responder a la creciente demanda, será necesario multiplicar de forma masiva la fabricación de estos combustibles, reforzar las inversiones en nuevas plantas y asegurar un abastecimiento sostenible de materias primas y recursos energéticos.",https://www.eldebate.com/files/article_social/uploads/2025/11/29/692aedeab2030.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 12:57:15.431233

“But it’s our town – it’s up to us as business leaders and residents to eat, shop, drink and buy here.
“And the fact that Brookfield, our current owners since 2009, have wanted to keep an investment in the business – they’ve retained a majority stake.
“Global economic shifts can lead to some difficulties and that’s why it’s so uncertain to predict.","Key business figures expressed confidence in Teesside for 2026 – but hoped national and international events don’t stall progress.

Members of a four-strong panel at the latest Tees Business LIVE event were asked what gave them confidence for Teesside in 2026 – and what were the biggest threats.

And while all were upbeat about the area’s prospects, they also pointed out national and global events could play a potentially negative part.

Speaking to a 100-strong audience at Bloom in Middlesbrough, the panel comprised PD Ports chief operating officer Paul Foreman, Education Training Collective CEO Grant Glendinning, Tracerco director of compliance and risk Richel Burke – the reigning Tees Businesswoman of the Year – and AV Dawson’s head of sustainability, Jon Booth.

Rachel was encouraged by the amount of recent local investment, citing schemes such as co-working space Flok and the impressive Boho X home of games developer Double Eleven, but felt the biggest threat was a lack of local belief in our own towns.

She said: “I hear a lot of negativity, specifically about Middlesbrough and Stockton.

“But it’s our town – it’s up to us as business leaders and residents to eat, shop, drink and buy here.

“It worries me that people are disconnected from their town. That’s what we’ve got to really focus on. It’s our town, we’ve got to make it work.”

Paul Foreman was encouraged that after a major divestment process that saw Pontagadea Inversiones acquire a 49% stake in the firm from Brookfield Asset Management, PD Ports – owners and operators of Teesport – had emerged in good shape.

He said: “We’ve had investors, banks, accountants, lawyers, all sorts of people crawling all over our business for the last nine months or so.

“That was thankfully completed in the summer and I think from a positivity point of view, we got a huge amount of interest in that process, in the business and the people in the local area.

“So that, to me, gives a massive boost of confidence in that somebody’s willing to pay a significant amount of money to buy half the business.

“And the fact that Brookfield, our current owners since 2009, have wanted to keep an investment in the business – they’ve retained a majority stake.

“They’ve stuck around one of the biggest infrastructure businesses in the world so that gives a lot of confidence that they believe in the business, the area and the UK as a national economy.”

But he felt that for many local firms, the “flip-flop potential of government policy around the clean energy revolution” could pose a problem.

He said: “We’ve seen the implications in America where Mr Trump has come in and changed policies.

“If government policy shifts and those markets diminish over time, that’s going to have a significant impact.”

Grant Glendinning – featured on the front cover of the latest issue of Tees Business – cited such developments as Net Zero Teesside and local production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) as two reasons for positivity, saying: “We’re being viewed as a core production site for SAF nationally, which is really exciting from a skills and investment point of view.

“But risk-wise, these are frontier industries and very dependent on technology – some of which isn’t proven, so there’s obvious risks there. And they’re very capital intensive, so they have a long payback.

“Global economic shifts can lead to some difficulties and that’s why it’s so uncertain to predict.

“But I do think there are some really great, short and long-term things to be excited about on Teesside.”

Jon Booth said it was good to see new industries and investment coming to the “Teesside ecosystem”, adding: “The opportunity on Teesside is absolutely huge.”

But he also felt external factors could affect progress, saying: “It could partly come down to policy from the government, and certainty around policy and the IMO (International Maritime Organisation) – legislation, for example, and giving port and vessel operators the confidence to invest.

“It’s quite hard to convince the board and support a business case for that kind of thing without a little bit of certainty and something that galvanises demand from the vessel operators, so that’s probably where I see the biggest challenge for us.”

To round off the debate, when asked if the panel could guarantee one “win” for Teesside in 2026, answers ranged from Boro getting promoted and investing in young people through schemes like the Power of Women to apprenticeships for all school leavers who wanted one.

And to applause, Rachel added: “Could someone put another road into Teesside Park please?”

The event – the final Tees Business LIVE of the year – also heard a keynote address from Tees Valley mayor Ben Houchen and details of how the world-famous Turner Prize is coming to Middlesbrough in 2026.

The east coast, rich in culture, natural resources, and tourism potential, has struggled to keep pace.
We must not forget the tourism potential with improved access to east coast tour destinations.","DECEMBER 6 — Transport is one key sector contributing to global greenhouse gas emissions.

The fuel used is a key determinant. This explains why electric cars are expanding.

Air transport has come under a lot of pressure to increase the use of SAF, sustainable aviation fuel. So is marine transport, where new maritime rulings insist on greater use of renewable and low-emission fuel.

The other solution is the deployment of mass transport. To move people and goods, the train has emerged as the most efficient mass transport instrument.

Global investments in rail networks are seen rising worldwide for that reason.

As Malaysia steams ahead with the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), there’s no shortage of opinions about whether it’s a wise national investment or a costly gamble.

Like many ambitious infrastructure projects, the ECRL sits at the crossroads of hope and caution, promise and peril.

The stakes are high not only in ringgit terms but in what it means for Malaysia’s future economic geography, regional equity, and geopolitical positioning.

At its heart, the ECRL is about connectivity. For decades, development in Malaysia has been disproportionately clustered along the west coast, from Penang to Johor.

The east coast, rich in culture, natural resources, and tourism potential, has struggled to keep pace.

The ECRL promises to narrow this divide, stitching together Kuantan, Kuala Terengganu, and Kota Bharu with the economic heartbeat of the Klang Valley.

On paper, the benefits are compelling: faster travel times, enhanced trade routes, better labour mobility, and the rise of new growth nodes along the corridor.

The Kuantan Port, for instance, could emerge as a strategic logistics hub linking the South China Sea to Peninsular Malaysia’s hinterland.

Tourism circuits, long hampered by poor accessibility, might finally come into their own. Kelantan, which has been wallowing at the bottom of the country’s economic ladder, may suddenly wake up from its slumber.

Yet, infrastructure alone does not guarantee prosperity. History is littered with examples of underutilised mega-projects that failed to deliver promised economic returns because complementary policies, industries, and ecosystems were missing.

The question Malaysia must grapple with is whether the ECRL will be just a railway or the backbone of a broader, integrated development strategy.

There are financial realities to confront too. Even after renegotiations, the ECRL remains one of Malaysia’s most expensive infrastructure projects.

Its success depends on achieving cargo and passenger volumes that may prove optimistic in the short to medium term, especially if road transport remains dominant and east coast population densities remain modest.

Without careful demand management and aggressive industrial development along its route, the line risks becoming an underutilised asset.

Then there’s the geopolitical dimension. As part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ECRL embeds Malaysia deeper into regional supply chains, an opportunity, but also a strategic risk.

Dependence on external financing, construction expertise, and operational know-how must be balanced with local capacity building, technology transfer, and safeguards for national interests.

Ultimately, the ECRL will be judged not by its length or cost, but by its legacy. Will it reduce regional inequality, catalyse new industries, and create sustainable livelihoods? Or will it become another symbol of misplaced priorities and economic overreach?

The project’s wisdom lies not merely in laying down steel tracks but in what Malaysia chooses to build around them. Ports, industrial zones, tourism clusters, and vocational training centres must all align with this infrastructure to create a viable economic ecosystem.

Only then will the ECRL transform from a bold bet into a wise investment.

As the trains begin to roll in the coming years, so too must our determination to ensure that this project delivers more than promises, but real, lasting progress for all Malaysians.

The ECRL connects underdeveloped states (Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang) to the Klang Valley, reducing regional inequality.

Faster cargo transport could cut shipping times between Port Klang and Kuantan Port, enhancing Malaysia’s trade competitiveness.

It strengthens ties with China, Malaysia’s largest trading partner, potentially attracting more BRI-linked investments and aligns with Asean’s Master Plan on Connectivity, positioning Malaysia as a regional logistics hub.

There are long-term infrastructure gains. Shifting freight from road to rail would reduce highway congestion and carbon emissions. We must not forget the tourism potential with improved access to east coast tour destinations.

The global aircraft manufacturer Airbus forecasts Asia-Pacific as one of the fastest-growing regions for new jet deliveries over the next 20 years.
Next year, revenue passenger kilometres will continue to be significantly led by intra-Asia travel, accounting for more than 65%, he said.
Airbus projects over the next two decades, passenger traffic in the region will grow by 4.4% annually, exceeding the global average of 3.6%.

The global aircraft manufacturer Airbus forecasts Asia-Pacific as one of the fastest-growing regions for new jet deliveries over the next 20 years.

Subhas Menon, director-general of AAPA, said air travel and cargo in the region remains buoyant, as it is not only the largest, but also the fastest-growing market.

Despite geopolitical challenges and trade tensions, international passenger traffic for Asia-Pacific carriers in the first nine months of 2025 rose by 10%, while cargo demand increased 7%, based on data from 36 carriers.

Mr Menon said China and India will continue to fuel the growth in regional travel thanks to their large populations, high GDP growth, and loosened visa regulations in Southeast Asia.

Those two countries recently resumed direct flights after a five-year hiatus, marking a positive growth development.

Next year, revenue passenger kilometres will continue to be significantly led by intra-Asia travel, accounting for more than 65%, he said.

During the first nine months this year, the load factor for passenger flights tallied 82%, while that of cargo flights exceeded 60%, better than pre-pandemic levels, said Mr Menon.

These high rates indicate supply capacity has not yet caught up with demand. Airlines have ageing fleets and are spending more on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), he said.

AAPA represents 18 airlines and is urging governments in the region to step up their policies to improve industry performance, such as luring more investment in MRO with a localised after-market for parts and components as there is inadequate capacity in the region.

Authorities should avoid imposing taxes or fees that are not directly tied to actual costs, as such measures could hinder airline operations, said Mr Menon.

As part of a drive to reach net zero, association members agreed to a 5% blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2030, and they urged suppliers to produce sufficient SAF at a cost-efficient scale.

Earlier this month, the AAPA 69th Assembly gathered in Bangkok, hosted by Bangkok Airways.

ASIA-PACIFIC RISING

Anand Stanley, president of Airbus Asia-Pacific, said the region will remain the fastest-growing aviation market over the next 20 years, driven by a rising middle class, demand from trade and tourism for longer-range and high-capacity planes, and expansion of new airports.

He said low-cost carriers support expansion by encouraging more first-time air passengers in the region.

Airbus projects over the next two decades, passenger traffic in the region will grow by 4.4% annually, exceeding the global average of 3.6%.

Of the 19,560 new planes required in 20 years, roughly 3,480 would be wide-body and 16,080 narrow-body, not only for replacement, but also for business expansion, noted the manufacturer.

Dave Schulte, managing director of APAC marketing at Boeing, said Southeast Asia will be the fastest-growing region with a 7% annual growth rate for passenger air traffic due to its rising middle class.

The regional market is projected to require 4,885 new aircraft by 2044 -- 80% of them narrow-body -- rising from the 1,240 planes in operation in 2024.

Arjan Meijer, president and chief executive of Embraer Commercial Aviation, said the company forecasts delivery of 10,500 jets in the segment of 150 seats or less, including turboprops, and Embraer's E1 and E2 families.

For the global forecast, the biggest contribution is expected to come from China and other Asia-Pacific markets, with 3,390 new planes or 32% of the global share.

Embraer said its E2 model can complement airlines with large narrow-body jets by Airbus and Boeing.

This model can serve destinations with smaller markets and airports with shorter runways, he said, adding it has a cost reduction of 25% per trip and similar cost per seats to Airbus and Boeing's new generation of narrow-body planes.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/20251206/c1_3151169_251206052052_700.jpg,N,,2025-12-06 02:56:24.571232

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has entered into force, legally mandating that all jet fuel supplied at EU airports must contain a minimum percentage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This policy action immediately forces a structural shift in the aviation fuel supply chain, which relies on high-energy-density liquid fuels. Fuel suppliers and airlines must now rapidly invest in new infrastructure and secure long-term offtake agreements to meet the initial obligation. The most important data point is the 2% SAF blend requirement for all jet fuel from 2025 onward, creating a new, non-negotiable market.

Context

The informed professional was wondering if policy makers would create a firm, long-term demand signal strong enough to justify the massive capital expenditure required for new SAF production facilities. The core question was: “Will the cost premium of SAF be absorbed by a mandate, or will it remain a voluntary, niche market?”

Analysis

This mandate was caused by the convergence of ambitious EU climate policy and the technological reality that aviation has no viable, near-term alternative to liquid fuel. The policy mechanism → a blending mandate → is designed to de-risk the supply side by guaranteeing demand, thereby attracting the necessary private capital for new refineries and e-fuel plants. Manufacturers are expected to react by prioritizing investment in established pathways like HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) for the near term, while simultaneously securing sites and permits for synthetic e-fuel (Power-to-Liquid) plants to meet the more stringent 2030 and 2035 synthetic fuel sub-mandates. Think of the mandate as a long-term, guaranteed purchase order for a product that is currently three to ten times more expensive than its fossil equivalent.

Outlook

This development implies a rapid, policy-driven acceleration of the SAF market, shifting it from a niche product to a core commodity. The single most important thing to watch next is the Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) on large-scale synthetic e-fuel (Power-to-Liquid) plants. These FIDs will confirm that the long-term synthetic fuel sub-mandate is successfully de-risking the most capital-intensive, high-potential decarbonization pathway.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Circular-Economy-Principles-in-Industrial-Symbiosis-Integrating-Metal-Hardware-and-Natural-Organic-Materials-for-Sustainable-Resource-Efficiency.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 09:56:10.447047

Eurowings bot seinen Kundinnen und Kunden im letzten Buchungsschritt auf seiner Website an, CO2-Emissionen durch eine Zusatzleistung von neun Euro auszugleichen: ""Zusammen machen wir Fliegen nachhaltiger.

Im Vergleich zu fossilen Kraftstoffen reduziert SAF die CO2-Emissionen um mindestens 80%. […]"".

CO2-neutral = klimaneutral?

Der Bundesverband der Verbraucherzentralen (vzbv) verklagte Eurowings daraufhin vor dem LG Düsseldorf und forderte, diese Werbung zu unterlassen. Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher würden die angebotene CO2-Kompensation dahingehend verstehen, dass der Flug insgesamt klimaneutral sei. Es sei nicht allgemein bekannt – und werde von Eurowings auch nicht erklärt –, dass ein Flugzeug neben CO2 auch weitere klimaschädliche Gase in erheblichem Umfang ausstoße. Darüber hinaus sei der Begriff ""nachhaltig"" im Zusammenhang mit ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"" in Bezug auf das Klima als ""emissionsfrei"" zu verstehen und damit ebenfalls irreführend.

Eurowings hingegen war der Meinung, aus der Formulierung werde ausreichend deutlich, dass lediglich der CO2-Ausstoß kompensiert werde und der Flug dadurch nicht völlig klimaneutral sei.

Das LG Düsseldorf fand das zunächst überzeugend und wies die Klage ab: Eurowings werbe nicht mit einer ""Klimaneutralität"" und beziehe keine anderen Treibhausgase als CO2 in die Kompensationsmöglichkeit ein.

Entscheidend ist, was die Verbraucher verstehen

Das OLG Düsseldorf gab der Berufung des vzbv jedoch nun statt. Zur Begründung führt der Senat aus, die Angaben von Eurowings seien zwar objektiv richtig, führten aber bei einem erheblichen Teil der Verbraucherinnen und Verbraucher zu der Fehlvorstellung, klimaneutral zu reisen. Die Existenz von weiteren klimaschädlichen Emissionen, die in erheblichem Umfange anfielen, sei nicht allgemein bekannt. Vielmehr würden die Begriffe ""CO2-neutral"" und ""klimaneutral"" im allgemeinen Sprachgebrauch synonym verwendet. Eurowings sei ein ausdrücklicher Hinweis zumutbar, dass nur ein Teil der klimaschädlichen Emissionen kompensiert werde.

Nicht irreführend sei hingegen – entsprechend der Auffassung des LG Düsseldorf – die angegriffene Werbung mit ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"". Eurowings konkretisiere hinreichend eindeutig, dass der CO2-Ausstoss durch ""Sustainable Aviation Fuel"" im Vergleich zu fossilen Kraftstoffen um mindestens 80 Prozent reduziert werde, der Treibstoff damit aber gerade nicht vollständig emissionsfrei sei. Darüber hinaus beinhalte der von Eurowings verwendete Begriff ""nachhaltig"" eher ein Werturteil als eine tatsächliche Beschaffenheitsangabe und sei in diesem Fall nicht mit ""klimaneutral"" gleichzusetzen.

Der Senat hat die Revision nicht zugelassen, weil die angegriffene Werbung infolge zukünftiger Rechtsänderungen ab September 2026 in jedem Falle unzulässig ist.

Battery storage alone surpassed its previous Q3 record with 4.7 GW installed. This strong year was expected given the strong momentum and policy tailwinds supporting the industry over the last several years. Despite strong near-term numbers, the report highlights how lingering policy and regulatory uncertainty put the pace of future growth at risk.

“The third quarter’s record results mask an unstable policy environment that is threatening our ability to meet our future energy needs,” said ACP CEO Jason Grumet. “The policy chaos at the federal level has seeped into every part of project timelines, stalling growth precisely when we need to meet demand and keep energy prices affordable for American families and businesses.”

Decline in Power Purchase Agreements: Something to Watch

While Q3 posted record installations, the forward-looking indicators tell a more concerning story. Power purchase agreements (PPAs) fell 31% year-over-year, pushing the year-to-date total for all offtake types 38% below the same point last year.

Despite robust demand for power, buyers largely sat on the sidelines in the third quarter, waiting for a clearer policy environment to emerge and the rules around tax credit eligibility for developing future projects to be set. Treasury’s long-awaited guidance on transferable tax credits and foreign-entity-of-concern rules only landed halfway through Q3, this complicated financing conversations and resulted in virtually no net pipeline growth (

“Demand from AI, data centers, and onshoring manufacturing is set to push U.S. electricity needs to all-time highs next year,” added Grumet. “With swift policy action, this demand can be met with domestic clean energy, supporting U.S. competitiveness in the race for these new technologies.”

Q3 2025 Key Highlights:

Total Clean Power Capacity Installed: Strongest Q3 on record. Total clean power capacity installed in Q3 2025 at 11,695 MW represents a 14% increase YOY. Of that capacity, land-based wind increased 131% over Q3 2024.

Pipeline Hits All-time High but Growth Stalls: The clean power pipeline reached a new high of 186,185 MW by the end of September, growing 9% YOY. However, the pipeline expanded a mere 1% from the first quarter of 2025.

2025 On Pace for a Strong Year: Year to date, 30.9 GW of clean energy power generation has been connected to the grid, up 1 GW from the current top year (2024) for clean energy installation.

Offtake Agreements in Decline: Clean energy offtake announcements during the first three quarters of 2025 were down 38%, compared to the same period in 2024.

How Modern Aerospace Materials Are Used in the Industry

For nearly a century, aluminum was the dominant material in aerospace manufacturing, chosen for its light weight, strength and relatively low cost. It defined the first generation of all-metal aircraft and continued to serve as the backbone of aerospace engineering for decades. Today, however, the material mix looks very different.

Modern jets contain significantly less pure aluminum, with many noncritical structures, such as paneling and interior components, replaced by advanced composites like carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRPs) and honeycomb materials.

At the same time, critical components such as engine parts demand metals that can balance lighter weight with the ability to withstand extreme heat and stress. This has led to wider adoption of titanium alloys, high-performance superalloys, and other advanced materials that were once considered too costly or difficult to machine.

For manufacturers and machine shops, these changes bring both challenges and opportunities. Toolmakers and equipment providers must keep pace with evolving material requirements, developing solutions that can handle tougher machining conditions, extend tool life and support efficiency goals across the aerospace supply chain.

The proposal creates a market-based instrument aimed at decarbonizing the civil aviation sector and establishes a new environmental asset: the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Sustainability Certificate (CS-SAF). The mechanism follows a structure similar to the Decarbonization Certificate under the RenovaBio program and the Biomethane Guarantee of Origin Certificate for the biomethane market.

Under ProBioQAV, greenhouse gas emission-reduction targets will be imposed on airline operators for domestic flights, to be met through the acquisition and retirement of CS-SAFs generated by producers, importers, and blending agents. In summary:

All sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced or traded in Brazil must be accompanied by a CS-SAF.

CS-SAFs may be sold separately from the physical SAF under a book-and-claim model, in which case the delivered fuel will not carry the environmental attribute to avoid double counting.

The system will allow CS-SAF transactions in the voluntary market, enabling any economic agent to acquire the certificates and incorporate their environmental attribute into products, processes, or emissions inventories.

The National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels will define the criteria, methodologies, and procedures for SAF sustainability eligibility and certification, which may follow guidelines from the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation or updated parameters under RenovaBio.

The National Civil Aviation Agency will oversee compliance with individual targets applicable to airline operators.

30 Under 30 in Manufacturing & Industry","Forbes' annual “30 Under 30” for North America feature for 2026 celebrates eight Stanford University affiliates working in sustainability: five alumni and three students. Seven are in the “Energy & Green Tech” category, with one in “Manufacturing & Industry.” Seven have cleantech startups. Women outweigh men this year five to three.

Four alumni recognized in the Energy & Green Tech category are: Gabriella Dweck, MS ’23, (names link to Forbes pages); Alex Fuster, BS/MS ’20; Ali Sarilgan, BS/MS ’19; and Meghan Wood, MS ’23. In the same category, Forbes also honored PhD students Rebecca Grekin and Jade Marcus, and master’s degree student Laurence Allen. The Manufacturing & Industry Category applauds the progress alumna Fern Morrison, MS ’24, has made with her research-backed venture.

Over the past eight years, the magazine has recognized the contributions of 68 Stanford alumni, students, and scholars working in sustainability. For the 2026 cohort, as in previous years, most of the Stanford honorees received critical assistance from the many cleantech entrepreneurship courses and programs at Stanford and, more broadly, in the Bay Area. Three won Innovation Transfer Program grants from the TomKat Center for Sustainable Energy. Two took the Precourt Institute for Energy’s course Stanford Climate Ventures. Both the Precourt Institute and the TomKat Center are part of the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. The Ecopreneurship program, a partnership of the Doerr School of Sustainability and Stanford’s Graduate School of Business, helped train three of the honorees. Crucial entities that train and invest in cleantech entrepreneurs in the Bay Area include the U.S. Department of Energy’s Activate program, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy, and the YCombinator accelerator.

30 Under 30 in Energy & Green Tech

Gabriella Dweck, (names link to LinkedIn profiles), is co-founder and co-CEO of Oleo with classmate Kelly Redmond, MS ’23, (who was not eligible for direct recognition based on age). The duo, who met in the School of Engineering's Design Impact program, transform biomass waste into low-carbon feedstocks for ethanol, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel. Use of their technology has the very important side benefit of reducing deforestation. They got their start in 2022 with an Innovation Transfer grant. Oleo is advancing their technology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory thanks to an Activate fellowship. The pre-pilot plant they are building in California uses primarily almond and soy hulls, but they say their technology can work with some 30 different biowaste sources. Oleo has raised more $1.6 million from venture capital and grants, according to Forbes. A recent TomKat Center profile describes Oleo’s journey.

Alex Fuster is co-founder of Astro Energy, which uses artificial intelligence to identify and acquire land for renewable energy projects where grid connection costs are minimal. This, the company says, helps eliminate the surprise costs that kill 80-90% of renewable projects. The team, who have significant experience in wholesale energy markets, secures grid interconnection agreements, then sells these de-risked, shovel-ready opportunities to larger energy companies. At Stanford, Fuster earned a bachelor’s degree in physics and a master’s degree in computer science. He then traded electricity at Citadel for four years before cofounding Astro Energy.

Ali Sarilgan cofounded another AI-based startup, TrueMeter, which reduces corporate electricity bills by up to 15%. Its software does this in part by finding the cheapest power providers available to each client, and auditing and correcting bills. With the aim of lowering U.S. carbon emissions, the venture can also help companies use energy more efficiently and transition to getting more electricity from renewable sources. Sarilgan, who grew up in Turkey, installed solar panels to power his family farm. Both of his Stanford degrees are in management science and engineering. Sarilgan also studied entrepreneurship and leadership in the School of Engineering’s Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Sarilgan began working on TrueMeter at Stanford’s StartX philanthropic accelerator. The startup has raised $5.5 million, according to Forbes.

Meghan Wood earned her master’s degrees in sustainable energy systems in the Doerr School and an MBA at the GSB. Wood and classmate Nicole Gonzalez, MS ’22, co-founded Raya Power to deliver permit-free solar power to apartment renters as well as home owners. Their system requires low or no upfront costs and pays for itself in just a few years through lower utility bills, they say. “Our goal is to make residential solar accessible and affordable for everyone by turning what was once a construction job into a project as simple as assembling an Ikea bookshelf,” Wood said in a recent GSB profile. The duo’s startup first emerged from the Stanford Climate Ventures course. Before that, Wood was selected for an Stanford Impact Founder Fellow in Stanford’s Ecopreneurship program. Wood also credits the mentorship of Jane Woodward, MS ’82/MBA ’87, an adjunct professor in energy and environment and a cleantech investor, with contributing to Raya’s development. Gonzalez earned her degree in design from Stanford’s School of Engineering.

Rebecca Grekin, PhD candidate with Prof. Sally Benson in the Department of Energy Resources Engineering in the Doerr School, researches tools that use real-world data to quantify and mitigate carbon dioxide emissions from the food industry. Grekin studied the Stanford’s dining hall purchases and built software to help trace the emissions impact of more than 150,000 items and ingredients. Today, more than 50 universities and other institutions serving 3.5 billion meals per year have used her tool, TASTE Food, to track Scope 3 emissions. Scope 3 covers indirect upstream and downstream supply chain emissions not directly controlled by the central entity. Despite the great difficulty in counting such emissions accurately, Grekin has helped universities do so, and they have made many data-driven changes in their food purchases.

A chemical-engineering PhD candidate working in chemistry professor Matthew Kanan’s lab, Jade Marcus developed a fertilizer that removes up to one ton of CO₂ per ton of fertilizer used, as demonstrated in her greenhouse trials. It also does the normal fertilizer thing of boosting crop yields, demonstrated at up to 50%, which is on par with commercially available fertilizers. A dozen field studies aim to corroborate those outcomes. The fertilizer is also cheaper and much faster acting than any carbon removal solution on the market, according to the startup she founded, Mafix. The venture, which can now produce a ton of product annually, got its first boost from the Innovation Transfer Program. Mafix has raised $1.3 million from philanthropic sources. Marcus, who worked for McKinsey & Co. for three years on green business building and climate investing, hopes to raise $5 million in seed funding in 2026.

Laurence Allen’ s robots inject wood chips underground to raise low-lying land facing flood danger by several feet per year inexpensively and quickly, even with buildings and roads on the land. His startup, Terranova, uses wood slurries as the feedstock, so each project also sequesters a lot of CO2. The company can also restore wetlands – Earth’s largest natural CO2 sink – generating carbon sequestration credits in the process. Allen, a Stanford management science student, will take a leave of absence from his master’s program after the current quarter to scale Terranova full-time. He said he received strong support from STVP on patent strategy. In September, Terranova raised $7 million in seed funding with participation from two Stanford-affiliated funds: GoAhead Ventures and Ponderosa, the early-stage climate fund of Galvanize, which was started by Tom Steyer, MBA ’83. The company will use this capital to build 10 more of its robots and is hiring to do so.

2025 award winners

For 2025, Qatar Airways takes the Matador Network Award for Best Airline on the strength of a global network that keeps expanding in smart ways, a business-class product that still sets the bar, and a clear push into next-gen aircraft and inflight tech.

We’re far from alone in recognizing Qatar Airways. The airline was named World’s Best Airline by Skytrax again in 2025 — its ninth time taking the title. And it keeps getting better with deep connectivity through Doha, consistently polished service across cabins, and investments that keep the airline relevant for the next decade of flying.

Qatar Airways positions Doha as a one-stop gateway between Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. In 2025, that map stretched even farther. The flagship development is a new route linking Doha with Bogotá and Caracas. The twice-weekly service makes Qatar the first and only airline to fly non-stop from the Middle East to Colombia.

For the winter schedule, the airline boosted frequencies to more than 15 major destinations, including Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, Shanghai, Singapore, Cape Town, Dublin, London, Phuket, and Toronto, adding thousands of extra flights to its schedule.

Qsuite, Qsuite Next Gen, and why business class still matters

Qsuite has been Qatar’s calling card for years. The business-class seat helped erase the line between business and first. In 2025, it evolved again with Qsuite Next Gen, a refreshed version that debuts on new Boeing 777-9s and future retrofits, with upgraded privacy doors, more storage, and flexible “quad” layouts for families or groups traveling together.

On more and more long-haul routes, booking Qatar business class means a high probability of getting an enclosed suite with a lie-flat bed, dine-on-demand, and thoughtful design details that still feel ahead of much of the industry.

Importantly, Qatar’s appeal doesn’t stop at the pointy end of the plane. Economy and non-suite business cabins on its A350s and 787s offer relatively generous seat width, large HD screens, and a considered service style.

Like other serious long-haul airlines, Qatar is betting big on the Airbus A350. The -900 and -1000 variants already anchor many flagship routes, but in 2025, onboard tech started to meaningfully differentiate the experience. After completing Starlink installs on 54 Boeing 777s, Qatar is now rolling the high-speed satellite Wi-Fi out across its A350 fleet. For travelers, that means near-ground-level connectivity on more long sectors: streaming, video calls, real-time work, and live sports are feasible

Combine that with the A350’s naturally quieter cabins, better humidity and pressurization, and lower fuel burn per passenger, and you get exactly what you want on a 14- or 15-hour leg between continents.

A growing United States presence and sustainability commitment

On the ground, Qatar’s big North America story is about New York. In 2026, the airline will move to JFK’s new Terminal One and open a 15,000-square-foot flagship lounge — its first dedicated US lounge and a clear signal that it sees transatlantic and transpacific flows via the US as central to its future.

The carrier has signed up to the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition, committed to scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and launched programs with partners like Formula 1 to buy and use more SAF on specific routes. Pair that with a modern, fuel-efficient long-haul fleet dominated by A350s and 787s, and you get a carrier that’s structurally better positioned than many legacy rivals as aviation tries to decarbonize.",https://cdn1.matadornetwork.com/blogs/1/2025/12/qatar-plane-social.jpeg,N,,2025-12-06 10:58:07.645198

Industry executives are concerned that this consolidation could hinder China's efforts to decarbonize air travel by limiting competition in the emerging sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) sector [para. 1].

Currently, China National Aviation Fuel Group Ltd. (CNAF) operates as the near-monopoly distributor of jet fuel for civil aviation. According to sources, CNAF is in the process of being acquired by Sinopec, a move that would vertically integrate refining, logistics, and airport fueling within one state entity. This transaction is still awaiting regulatory approval [para. 2]. While no official announcement has been made, CNAF’s Singapore-listed arm revealed on October 30 that a major restructuring involving another company was underway. Industry insiders confirmed that Sinopec, China’s largest refining company, is set to take over CNAF’s assets and operations [para. 3].

This merger is occurring at a time when demand for gasoline and diesel in China is plateauing due to the rise of electric vehicles, while aviation fuel remains a strong segment of the oil market. The transition comes as China is trying to ramp up the production of SAF, which is viewed by policymakers as crucial for reducing aviation emissions and fostering a new growth industry [para. 4].

However, industry experts warn that concentrating control of the fuel supply in a single company could undermine competition and innovation, especially in the nascent SAF market, where private sector involvement and technological advancement are most robust. The fear is that a state-run giant could introduce hurdles that would marginalize smaller SAF producers and slow sectoral development [para. 5][para. 6]. ""Regardless of the system, maintaining a diverse supplier base – including for SAF – and satisfying aviation needs safely and cost-effectively should be central to competition,"" said an industry expert [para. 7].

SAF is made from waste oils, biomass, and other non-fossil feedstocks and is considered a practical solution for cutting aviation emissions. Aviation accounted for about 3% of global CO2 emissions from energy in 2024, a share that's rising as air traffic grows. SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, and global demand could reach 360 million tons by 2050. For instance, the EU has mandated that SAF comprise 2% of jet fuel consumption by 2025 and 70% by 2050 [para. 8][para. 9][para. 10][para. 11].

China's SAF sector is still in its infancy, with two pilot programs launched in the past two years and production dominated by private companies. Five producers have received certification, exceeding a combined capacity of 1 million tons per year. Sinopec began producing SAF in 2012 and built the country’s first large-scale SAF facility with a 100,000-ton annual capacity in 2020, and it is planning further expansion [para. 12][para. 13][para. 14][para. 15][para. 16]. CNAF, too, has invested in SAF production and related facilities [para. 17].

CNAF controls delivery, storage, and refueling at more than 95% of China’s airports, making it a key intermediary between refiners and airlines through regulated pricing [para. 18][para. 19]. Consolidation under Sinopec would change this dynamic, giving it a significant advantage in controlling market access and pricing for both conventional and alternative aviation fuels [para. 20][para. 21]. Critics argue that this move risks creating a monopoly, reducing competition, and stifling the sector’s modernization and decarbonization efforts.

Women accounted for 47.4% of direct Travel & Tourism jobs, closely aligned with the Americas regional average of 47.9%.","The World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC) today released new data showing that the U.S. Travel & Tourism sector continued to grow in 2024 while reducing greenhouse (GHG) emissions. This performance reflects encouraging progress as the sector works towards long-term sustainable growth.

According to WTTC’s latest Environmental & Social Research (ESR), the sector’s GDP increased by 1.8% per year, between 2019 and 2024, even as emissions declined by 1.7%, a development that demonstrates early decoupling between economic growth and environmental impact.

Stronger Economic Performance Supported by Lower Emissions

According to the global body, the analysis shows a steady decline in emissions intensity, from 0.38kg of CO2e per USD of GDP in 2019, to 0.32 in 2024.

The share of low-carbon energy in the U.S. sector’s energy mix also improved last year, rising to 5.2% of total energy consumption from 5.1% in 2023, and above the 4.1% share recorded in 2019.

These results show that the U.S. Travel & Tourism sector is creating more economic value, with a nearly 2% annual growth in GDP, while progressively reducing its environmental footprint.

This is a very positive sign, and clear proof that U.S. Travel & Tourism can decouple growth from environmental impact. This positive trajectory matters both nationally and globally. As the world’s largest Travel & Tourism market, the U.S. has a unique opportunity to lead the global transition to a cleaner, more competitive future. Gloria Guevara, WTTC Interim President & CEO

The report also offers insights into the composition of emissions within the U.S. Travel & Tourism sector. Total transportation, reflecting all travel modes linked to tourism, accounted for 54% of total emissions, compared to 40% at the global level, with utilities contributing a further 14%.

These figures emphasise the importance of continued investment in cleaner energy and sustainable fuels to support the sector’s long-term transition.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is receiving growing attention from major U.S. airlines which are making significant investments and long-term commitments to help expand future supply. While current volumes are limited and scaling SAF remains challenging, these efforts demonstrate leadership and ambition in moving the aviation sector toward a lower-carbon future.

A Positive Social Impact with Record Numbers

The research also highlights Travel & Tourism’s growing role in boosting social inclusion and creating jobs in the U.S., with record numbers of women and youth joining the workforce.

In 2024, the sector supported 9.5MN female workers, an increase of 170,000 workers (or 1.8%) from the previous year. Women accounted for 47.4% of direct Travel & Tourism jobs, closely aligned with the Americas regional average of 47.9%.

Youth employment (ages 15-24) also increased, rising from 3.5MN in 2023 to 3.54MN in 2024, a 1.1% year-over-year gain. Young workers made up 23.7% of direct Travel & Tourism employment in the U.S. last year, outpacing the regional average of 19.6%, and significantly higher youth share than the overall U.S. average of 13.1%.

The continued expansion of opportunities for women and young people reflects the sector’s broadening social impact and its contribution to inclusive economic growth.

$300 million planned investment will double XCF's total SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually, positioning New Rise Reno as a major U.S. SAF production center.

Global demand accelerates as mandates tighten, creating one of the strongest growth opportunities in renewable fuels - one that XCF's modular SAF platform is positioned to capture.

HOUSTON, TX / ACCESS Newswire / December 5, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), today announced new development milestones at its New Rise Reno 2 site, the Company's second SAF production facility and the next deployment of its scalable, modular production platform.

XCF has completed initial site work at New Rise Reno 2, including grading of the 10-acre parcel and construction of new access roads. Engineering, design, and project planning are underway, positioning construction to begin in 2026.

Located adjacent to the existing New Rise Reno facility in Nevada, the new site will benefit from integration with common facilities such as gas, water, rail, and personnel offices as well as existing pre-treatment, hydrogen production, and broader logistics infrastructure - reducing capital costs, lowering execution risk, and accelerating time to production.

Since inception, approximately $350 million has been invested in XCF's flagship New Rise Reno facility. New Rise Reno 2 represents the next phase of this growth strategy, with an expected $300 million investment enabling XCF to double SAF production capacity to ~80 million gallons annually.

Chris Cooper, CEO of XCF Global, commented:

""New Rise Reno 2 is the next leap forward in our growth strategy. By adding a second, fully integrated facility, we're turning New Rise Reno intoa major U.S. SAF production center and positioning XCF for sustained, long-term growth. This expansion exemplifies how XCF grows: intentionally, efficiently, and with a platform built to meet surging global demand.""

Expanding Global Reach

The development of New Rise Reno 2 strengthens XCF's ability to meet rising SAF demand across the world's most important aviation markets. In November, XCF signed a Memorandum of Understanding (""MOU"") with BGN INT US LLC (""BGN""), a global energy and commodities group, to jointly develop global distribution, marketing, and offtake frameworks across Europe, the Middle East, and other strategic markets.

The partnership would connect XCF's expanding production capacity with BGN's global logistics and trading network, creating an integrated supply chain from feedstock to finished fuel.

This strategic alignment comes as demand accelerates across major aviation markets.

U.S. SAF Grand Challenge: Federal targets call for 3 billion gallons of SAF per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050; however, current U.S. production remains below 1% of jet fuel demand.

ReFuelEU Aviation Mandates: Airlines will be required to blend 2% SAF in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030, and 20% by 2035, ultimately rising to 70% by 2050. With regional supply unable to meet these mandated volumes, Europe is expected to face structural shortages and persistently elevated SAF pricing.

Together, the U.S. and Europe represent one of the largest and fastest-growing opportunities in the clean-energy transition, with the U.S. SAF market projected to reach nearly $7 billion by 2030 and global demand exceeding $25 billion. XCF's scalable, modular SAF platform is built to scale directly into this opportunity.

XCF will continue to provide updates as development progresses.

“My MBA gave me more than just business knowledge, it sharpened how I think and make decisions.","As Technical Adviser to the CEO of XEJet Limited, MBA Alumna Tariye Orianzi plays a pivotal role at the heart of one of Africa’s emerging aviation companies. Her remit is broad and strategically significant: she has guided the airline through a major restructuring, overseen jet acquisitions, and contributed to defining the organisation’s commercial strategy. Her work also spans performance optimisation, pilot management, and financial alnalysis, all with a clear focus on strengthening customer satisfaction and loyalty.

This year, Tariye’s impact was recognised nationally as she was named a winner in the UK’s prestigious 40 Under 40 awards. The honour, she explains, is both deeply meaningful and motivating.

“Being named in the UK’s 40 Under 40 list is an incredible honour and a deeply humbling experience.” she reflects. “Personally, it’s a moment of reflection throughout my career journey. The recognition of the long hours, resilience, and passion that have fuelled my journey. It validates the sacrifices made along the way and reminds me of the importance of staying true to my purpose. Professionally, that’s a strong milestone; it reinforces the impact of the work I’ve done and serves as motivation to keep pushing boundaries.”

The transformative experience of completing her Durham MBA has been a key part of her journey. While the programme strengthened her technical and analytical skills, she says its true value went far beyond academic learning.

“My MBA gave me more than just business knowledge, it sharpened how I think and make decisions. It challenged me to step outside of my comfort zone, think more strategically, and see the bigger picture in every situation. What really set it apart was the mix of diverse perspectives I was exposed to. Collaborating with people from different industries and cultures pushed me to become a more adaptable and empathetic.”

For those contemplating an MBA themselves, Tariye has this advice.

“Be really clear on your “why.” An MBA is a big investment of time, energy, and money, so go into it with purpose. If you’re looking to change career paths and expand your network, it can be a powerful accelerator. But it’s not a magic shortcut; you’ll get out of it what you put in.

Also, don’t underestimate the value of the people around you. Some of the most important lessons come from conversations with classmates, not just case studies. Be open, be curious, and don’t just chase grades - chase growth. If it aligns with your goals, an MBA can genuinely shift the way you think, lead, and approach challenges.”

Looking ahead, Tariye is focusing her energy on driving innovation and sustainable progress within aviation and the wider space sector.

“Next, I’m focused on driving meaningful growth in the aviation and space sector.

Luxury FBO, Million Air Austin, and leading fuel supplier, Avfuel Corporation, have introduced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Austin Bergstrom International Airport.

The SAF, which went into service on 20 November 2025, provides a meaningful solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations.

This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering a consistent supply of SAF specifically for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink.

“Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals.

“At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

The SAF, originating in Texas, has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel.

For every 8,000-gallon truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

This is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of US forests per year.

In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

“The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s Vice President of Sales.

“We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”",https://evaint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/12/Photo-to-Accompany-Million-Air-and-Avfuel-Bring-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-to-Austin-1024x696.png,N,,2025-12-05 15:57:21.179056

Aoife O’Sullivan, chair of BBGA, presented the award at The Little Ship Club in London on 3 December in front of more than 140 industry attendees.

Cremer is head of aviation delivery for Gama Aviation Group, a position he has held within a company he joined in 1997. He began his career in the early 1980s at Fairoaks Airport in Surrey as ground crew before progressing to air traffic roles, becoming senior aerodrome flight information service officer. He held a similar position at Blackbushe Airport before joining Gama Aviation as operations manager.

His career has encompassed air traffic, operations, aircraft management, air ambulance, ground operations, continuing airworthiness management organisation work, charter sales, maintenance control centre coordination, aviation software and contract management.

In 2023 Cremer became chair of BBGA’s Operations Working Group, succeeding Wally Epton. He expanded the group’s reach by introducing regional meetings alongside London gatherings and securing regular attendance from the Department for Transport, UK Border Force and UK Civil Aviation Authority.

“Paul is a passionate advocate for the sector and tenacious champion of the industry, with an energy and enthusiasm that are truly remarkable,” said Marwan Khalek, group chief executive of Gama Aviation. “Over the years he has become a trusted advisor for operators and industry partners seeking thoughtful counsel and seasoned experience.”

Khalek and Steve Wright knew Cremer from the early days at Fairoaks when Gama Aviation was established in 1983.

Mathea Head, sales manager at myairops, credited Cremer with helping her understand the aviation industry when she joined Gama Aviation. “Paul is a brilliant mentor – patient, dedicated, and passionately committed to helping others progress,” she said.

Luxaviation sponsored the award.

BBGA represents nearly 200 companies across the business aviation sector, including airports, FBOs, corporate flight departments, operators, aviation services organisations and aircraft and powerplant manufacturers.

The primary farm policy development in 2025 was the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July.
The bill also included language on tax policy, energy and climate policy that will affect agricultural producers.
No farm bill While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act settled several farm bill issues, the rest of the farm bill remains a question.
Beyond the two-step farm bill shuffle, the rest of the policy outlook brings more questions than answers.","As farmers and ranchers consider production and management decisions for the year ahead, they can bank on some help from farm legislation passed in 2025. However, there are many policy issues that remain, and there is a great deal of uncertainty for producers to manage in 2026.

The primary farm policy development in 2025 was the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July. The bill included increased support for commodity programs and crop insurance programs, providing increased farm income safety net protection through the 2031 crop year.

The bill also included language to extend funding support for conservation and made reforms and cuts to food assistance programs. Commodity programs, crop insurance, conservation and food assistance are the four largest components of traditional farm programs, and getting something passed in 2025 was a major accomplishment after a lack of progress on a farm bill in 2023 and 2024.

The bill also included language on tax policy, energy and climate policy that will affect agricultural producers. Several tax provisions from 2017 that were set to expire at the end of 2025 were reformed or extended, providing continuing tax relief for individuals, ag producers, business owners and estates.

Several climate and energy provisions were rolled back, as well, although a reduced renewable energy tax credit remains to provide some potential support for the bioenergy sector.

No farm bill

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act settled several farm bill issues, the rest of the farm bill remains a question. After no progress to reauthorize the rest of the bill (aka the “skinny farm bill”) in 2025, Congress included a one-year extension of remaining legislation through September 2026 in the continuing resolution passed in November.

That extended authority for programs such as the Conservation Reserve Program and the broad portfolio of discretionary programs from research to rural development, specialty crops and other titles, but only for another year.

Come September, everyone will be looking to see if Congress can actually pass comprehensive farm bill legislation, or if they are pushed again to continue a pattern of extending programs indefinitely — one year at a time.

Beyond the two-step farm bill shuffle, the rest of the policy outlook brings more questions than answers.

Trade policy has been chaotic throughout 2025, with tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and reciprocal tariffs all making headlines and creating conflicts that substantially harmed U.S. ag export opportunities and, in turn, market prices.

There were also numerous announcements of trade deals, promising substantial relief from the ongoing conflict. The deals do not promise a complete repeal of tariffs enacted in 2025, nor a clear mechanism for actually enforcing commitments made in the deals, but they are a positive development to build on for 2026.

In the meantime, trade assistance from USDA may provide some financial relief for ag producers impacted by trade losses, although the issues of if, when and how much remained a question as of late November.

Biofuels are another policy area of uncertainty for the year ahead. Corn and ethanol producers have been working tirelessly to push for year-round E15 legislation to remove seasonal restrictions that limit its marketability absent repeated waivers from EPA.

California’s decision to become the 50th state to approve E15 usage, in general, also expands the nationwide marketability, although new opposition from the petroleum industry and the lack of momentum on major legislation like a farm bill limits the opportunity to get E15 legislation across the finish line.

Soybean and other oilseed producers are also banking on the potential demand growth from increased biodiesel or renewable diesel production. Beyond the federal renewable fuels standard mandates, renewable or low-carbon fuel mandates in various states or even foreign markets like Canada could drive growth.

Corn and soybean growers and processors alike are watching closely as EPA enacts regulations and settles issues with the renewable fuels standard, renewable volume obligations, and lawsuits over small refinery exemptions and reallocation of usage mandates.

Producers and processors are also looking fondly toward potential markets for sustainable aviation fuel and maritime fuel. A lot of questions remain, but some combination of usage or regulatory requirements, tax incentives and corporate stewardship campaigns could drive growth in a fuel market that could provide substantial demand growth for agricultural production.

Regulations and uncertainty

The rest of the regulatory agenda is also busy, but perhaps even less certain.

In late 2025, the Trump administration announced a new proposed definition for Waters of the United States to guide federal regulation of water and water quality. This is the latest volley in the decades-long dispute.

In the past 10 years alone, the Obama administration published a rule to define WOTUS following Supreme Court cases in the preceding decade. The first Trump administration repealed the Obama rule to write one of its own, only to have the Biden administration pull the Trump rule for its own.

With numerous court challenges and stays of regulations along the way, the Trump administration is again formalizing a rule, likely to be challenged in court again.

Late in 2025, another court ruling dictated that USDA would also need to rewrite its rules on labeling for disclosure of biotech ingredients in food products. The ongoing debate over biotechnology and the question of biotech in food products ultimately culminated in federal legislation requiring disclosure on food product labels.

That legislation and the original USDA rule were published during the first Trump administration, but now, many years later, courts have ruled that the disclosure rule needs to be rewritten to include more disclosure for minor ingredients, even when their presence is undetectable. While not likely to reshuffle the market for biotech vs. non-biotech ag commodities, it is just one more regulatory issue that never seems to be fully resolved.

That may also be an apt description of immigration and labor policies, which have been a political football for decades. Agriculture and food production are primary employers of immigrant labor. The issues of documented vs. undocumented laborers and work visa rules, as well as immigration and border security issues in general, make for a difficult challenge to address, let alone resolve.

Numerous other issues exist too, from pesticide regulations to animal welfare and food production and marketing standards to many others. Some of those issues could get resolved through policymaking across the legislative, executive or judicial branches of the federal government. However, many of them are also likely to play out in state legislatures or courts, or in corporate boardrooms and with consumer demand.

Whatever the topic, a great deal of policy uncertainty remains for agriculture headed into the new year. Ag producers and stakeholders will need to be managed for the uncertainty and engage in the policy process itself, ensuring that policymakers understand the issues and the potential impacts of the complex issues and policy choices ahead.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blta6ba1ee9ecae20f6/692f274145c2c4827e791950/1201F2-1570A-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-05 16:57:02.369216

The SAF went into service on November 20, 2025, and provides a practical solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. It marks the first SAF location in Texas for both Million Air and Avfuel, with a consistent supply dedicated to the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a thriving, business-centric city that also deeply values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, CEO of Million Air Interlink. “Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers meaningful options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals. At Million Air, we believe sophistication and responsibility go hand-in-hand, and this step in our Beyond Green initiative reflects our commitment to making choices that support both our customers and our planet.”

“The Million Air team has been an exceptional partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, Avfuel’s vice president of sales. “We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first consistent SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The SAF, produced in Texas, is delivered as a 30/70 blend of neat SAF and conventional jet fuel. Each 8,000-gallon truckload is expected to deliver a 19-metric-ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel - roughly equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres of U.S. forests in one year. In its neat (pre-blended) form, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

This initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program, a company-wide commitment to more responsible aviation practices. Beyond Green focuses on integrating sustainable solutions across Million Air’s network, from renewable energy investments and facility efficiencies to lower-carbon fuel options such as SAF. Million Air Austin becomes the company’s second SAF location, joining Million Air Albany (KALB), which partnered with Avfuel to bring SAF online earlier this year.

WSF and GFI launch accelerator to unlock UK SAF projects

Willis Sustainable Fuels UK (WSF), a subsidiary of Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC), and the Green Finance Institute (GFI), an independent adviser to governments and investors, have launched a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project accelerator. The initiative is designed to progress WSF’s pioneering SAF project at Wilton International in Teesside to ‘Final Investment Decision’ and to create a repeatable model for financing new domestically produced transition projects.

Since the start of 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate has required increasing levels of SAF in the national jet fuel supply, reaching 10 per cent in 2030 and 22 per cent in 2040. Under this mandate, the economic, energy-security and innovation benefits of expanding domestic SAF production are compelling. While the policy provides long-term demand certainty to accelerate SAF growth, the challenge remains in achieving bankability.

WSF’s Teesside project is one of the UK’s most advanced second-generation SAF developments, using existing, proven technology to produce SAF from waste. Targeting 14,000 tonnes of production per year, the project is expected to support national energy security by reducing reliance on imported fuels and to create new green-industry jobs in the Northeast, converting mainly UK biomethane into next-generation jet fuel. It has been awarded £7.6 million through two rounds of the UK Government’s Advanced Fuels Fund.

Before committing capital in this emerging sector, financiers must address risks relating to technology performance, feedstock, and price or revenue certainty. Although the UK mandate offers strong long-term demand certainty, developers still need to bring together a complex mix of public and private de-risking tools to meet financing requirements.

With a track record of mobilising £77 billion in committed capital to drive the transition and as a key adviser in shaping the UK’s SAF mandate, GFI’s SAF programme will focus on helping leading projects reach Final Investment Decision in 2026. The accelerator platform is designed to remove financing barriers and develop solutions that attract private-sector investment into pioneering projects.

The initiative will prioritise developing innovative financing and de-risking strategies for SAF infrastructure, identifying regulatory and financial gaps that need to be addressed to enable advanced projects to reach Final Investment Decision and deliver volumes aligned with the UK mandate, and convening public- and private-sector market participants to create solutions that tackle bankability challenges. It will also work to establish a replicable model for turning policy ambition into built, investable clean-energy infrastructure as further UK projects aim to reach Final Investment Decision in the coming year.

Dr Amy Ruddock, Director of Willis Sustainable Fuels, said the partnership with GFI represented a vital step in demonstrating the commercial viability of SAF projects in the UK, adding that together they aim to create a blueprint for financing solutions that will accelerate the transition to low-carbon aviation.

In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand.
Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption.
“As SAF adoption transitions from pilot programs to long-term supply, reliability and verifiability become the new currency of trust,” Dange added.
“XCF is building the backbone of that transition by advancing the infrastructure and partnerships needed to make SAF the new standard across global aviation.","XCF Global, Inc., a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), today shared its perspective on the rapidly evolving global policy landscape shaping the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel.

The scale of the challenge – and opportunity – is immense. According to the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”), airlines will need approximately 165 billion gallons of SAF annually by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions. In 2024, global SAF production totalled only ~330 million gallons – about 0.3% of total jet-fuel demand. Meeting 2050 decarbonization targets will require an estimated 27% compound annual growth rate in production capacity and the construction of 5,000 – 7,000 new facilities worldwide. This gap represents one of the most compelling growth opportunities in the global energy transition, with analysts projecting the SAF market could exceed ~$25 billion by 2030 and reach ~$270 billion by 2050.

Governments are responding. Across major markets, policymakers are using mandates and incentive schemes to accelerate SAF adoption. Today, more than 2 billion people globally live in countries with SAF blending mandates or strong incentives, such as tax credits – by 2030, this number is expected to grow to more than 4 billion people.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge aims to expand domestic consumption of SAF to 3 billion gallons per year by 2030 and 35 billion gallons per year by 2050.

In Europe, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation mandates that SAF make up 2% of all jet fuel by 2025, rising to 6% in 2030, 20% by 2035, and 70% by 2050, creating one of the largest mandated clean-fuel markets globally.

The UK has coupled mandates starting from 2% in 2025 and increasing to 10% in 2030 and 22% in 2040 with revenue-certainty mechanisms that help cover the price premium between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Across Asia-Pacific, countries including Australia, China, India, Japan, Korea, and Singapore are developing frameworks that combine blending targets, tax incentives, and infrastructure funding to stimulate both production and demand.

“Global demand for SAF is shifting from ‘if’ to ‘how fast,’” said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF. “Mandates, incentives, and procurement are converging to drive volume. These dynamics underscore the value of XCF’s early-mover advantage and modular design, which we’re now extending globally through partnerships such as with New Rise Australia, a venture that is expected to develop three SAF sites across the continent to meet Australia’s growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.”

XCF highlighted three dynamics that will shape the next phase of growth:

Diverse toolkits, common direction. Regions may use different policy levers – mandates, subsidies, tax credits, or procurement – but they all point toward accelerating adoption.

Technology mix evolution. HEFA remains the dominant pathway in the near-term, while policy frameworks are creating headroom for emerging pathways to scale toward 2050 targets.

System reliability. Airlines and fuel suppliers need dependable volumes, transparent carbon accounting, and logistics that work across borders. Producers with operational capacity and credible expansion plans will lead.

In June 2023, the European Consumer Organisation alerted the European Commission to multiple airlines’ “green” claims and statements, asserted to contravene Directive 2005/29/EC (the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive), which prohibits unfair commercial practices and misleading actions and omissions.

On 6 November 2025 the European Commission announced that the Airlines had committed to change their practices. The focus is to end flight‑specific “CO₂‑neutral” or “offset” claims via add‑ons or alternative fuels, tighten the use of terms such as “sustainable aviation fuel” (SAF) with appropriate context, and raise transparency and evidential standards for environmental claims.

Airlines’ commitments include:

Ceasing to suggest that a specific flight can be made “CO₂ neutral” or emissions can be “offset” by paying an add‑on, such as funding tree planting or purchasing credits at checkout.

Avoiding vague “green” wording, icons or labels that could mislead customers.

Using terms like SAF only with clear explanations of what they mean, including current availability, typical blend percentages and known limitations.

Providing timelines and concrete actions when referring to future goals such as net zero, explaining which emissions are covered, and avoiding absolute claims without context.

Avoiding unqualified “sustainable” slogans and messaging based on optional customer contributions, which are now considered high risk.

National Consumer authorities will monitor implementation and enforce the above commitments where necessary.

Comment

For the Airlines, this signals another challenge to ESG messaging under consumer protection legislation, following the UK’s Advertising Standards Agency’s decision in 2024 in relation to Virgin Atlantic’s Flight100.

The core message is that environmental claims should be specific, substantiated and transparent; grounded in real‑world operations and evidence. It should not be suggested that a single flight is “carbon neutral” merely because of an optional add‑on.

Airlines are at the sharp end. They bear the responsibility to comply with ESG regulations, which are complex, nuanced and replete with calculations, qualifications and assumptions. ICAO’s SAF guide alone runs to nearly 70 pages. Its bibliography contains 101 separate references.

Airlines need to convey ESG issues to the travelling public, but must do so in a concise, accessible and understandable way. Customer buy-in is key; both literally and metaphorically.

The fuel went into service on November 20, 2025, providing a solution for operators seeking to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from flight operations. This marks the first SAF location in Texas for both companies, offering supply of sustainable aviation fuel for the airport’s business and general aviation traffic.

“Austin is a business-centric city that also values environmental responsibility,” said Roger Woolsey, chief executive at Million Air Interlink. “Bringing SAF to Million Air Austin is about giving our customers options that align with both their travel needs and their sustainability goals.”

The fuel has a targeted blend percentage of 30% neat SAF to 70% traditional jet fuel. For every 8,000-gallon (30,283-liter) truckload of fuel, the SAF provides a 19 metric ton reduction in carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to petroleum-based jet fuel.

“The Million Air team has been a partner to work with in expanding sustainable fuel solutions,” said Mark Haynes, vice president of sales at Avfuel. “We’re proud to collaborate with them to establish our first SAF-supplied location in Texas and help further their corporate initiatives on sustainability.”

The reduction is equivalent to the amount of carbon sequestered by 19.1 acres (7.7 hectares) of US forests per year. In its neat form, SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The initiative is part of Million Air’s Beyond Green sustainability program. Million Air Austin joins Million Air Albany, which partnered with Avfuel to add SAF this summer.

The Freedom Pines facility converts ethanol into synthetic kerosene using Alcohol-to-Jet technology and is designed to produce around nine million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel annually.

Sustainable aviation fuels are now recognised as the only scalable way to cut emissions from long-haul flying in the next two decades. Yet production remains minute.

IATA estimates SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel use in 2024. Output is forecast to reach about two million tonnes this year, still well below 1%.

Europe positions itself as a global frontrunner in aviation decarbonisation. Yet the reality is stark, in 2024, just 0.6 % of the fuel delivered at EU airports was sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

At the same time regulators have set ambitious targets, a minimum SAF share of 2 % in 2025 rising to 6 % by 2030, and ultimately 70 % by 2050. Exactly how Europe intends to reach those targets is far from clear.

From cornfields to contrails

The Alcohol-to-Jet route upgrades ethanol through dehydration and catalytic conversion, producing hydrocarbon molecules chemically similar to conventional Jet A, meaning airlines can use them in existing aircraft and fuelling systems.

There is momentum beyond the US. Dutch SAF specialist SkyNRG is developing what it says will be Europe’s first commercial ATJ plant, using waste-based ethanol to produce more than 30,000 tonnes of aviation fuel annually.

Global ethanol production runs into the tens of billions of litres each year, far more abundant than used-cooking-oil feedstocks currently dominating SAF. Such scale is why ATJ deserves industry attention.

What the engines say

In Slovakia, engineers have run small turbojet engines on ethanol-Jet A mixtures and found they remain stable at around 20 to 30% ethanol, but power and exhaust temperature begin to fall away beyond that point.

Romanian researchers have pushed a micro-turbojet through a range of alcohol blends from methanol to octanol, showing similar behaviour, cleaner combustion at lower percentages yet noticeable rpm instability and thrust drop-off when the alcohol share gets too high.

Thus the alcohol must first be upgraded into jet fuel through an Alcohol-to-Jet process before it is ready for commercial flying.

By turning ethanol into fully fledged jet fuel molecules, the process sidesteps the corrosion and moisture issues that plague alcohol blends. The result is a fuel that performs in the aircraft system exactly as kerosene would.

Cleaner combustion with a catch

On environmental performance, the data is persuasive. Adding ethanol to Jet A-1 in laboratory trials has reduced carbon monoxide emissions by around 5% and unburned hydrocarbons by about 37% thanks to more complete combustion.

Biodiesel-blend tests have shown similar reductions, and sulphur dioxide emissions drop sharply given biodiesel’s negligible sulphur content.

NASA research meanwhile reports 50 to 70% cuts in particle emissions using bio-sourced jet fuels, a win for air quality and contrail reduction.

But hotter, cleaner flames also create more nitrogen oxides. In the same trials that cut CO and hydrocarbons, NOx rose by roughly 27% because oxygen-rich combustion drives higher temperatures.

That puts airports and climate regulators under pressure, since nitrogen oxides contribute to local air pollution on the ground and warming effects higher up in the atmosphere.

The economic drag

SAF still costs three to ten times more than fossil jet fuel in Europe, and ATJ sits firmly at the high end of that range.

In Spain, airlines expect to pay about €2,768 per tonne for SAF under their new 2% mandate, compared with €816 for kerosene.

Even with rapid growth SAF production could still fall 30 to 45% short of what airlines must obtain to meet EU 2030 climate goals.

At the same time carriers are typically putting only 1 to 3% of revenues into fuel-transition spending, far below what is required to scale ATJ.

The numbers explain why Europe’s airlines are already urging Brussels to slow its timetable. IATA has lined up behind those calls, arguing the 2030 mandate will be economically unrealistic without major state support.

An interim measure in a long transition

Alcohol-to-Jet fuel takes a commodity the world already produces in vast quantities and turns it into something airlines can use.

It bypasses the corrosion and moisture issues of blending raw alcohol with kerosene, and because the resulting fuel behaves just like Jet A in tanks and pipelines, it can be used in today’s aircraft without waiting for new engines or infrastructure.

In an industry where hardware change takes decades, that drop-in compatibility is its biggest selling point. Ethanol is already produced and traded at scale, giving ATJ an advantage over other SAF pathways that depend on scarce waste oils or bespoke feedstocks.

But its strengths also expose its limits. Converting alcohol into synthetic kerosene remains expensive, and sustainable ethanol supply must grow without fuelling deforestation or competing with food.

Even the most advanced ATJ plants starting to come online this will contribute tiny volumes in a market that consumes hundreds of billions of litres of jet fuel every year.

ATJ is not the technology that delivers net-zero flight. It is however a technology that may buy time while the harder work happens, scaling new feedstocks, redesigning combustion systems to cut nitrogen oxides, building the electricity system needed for e-fuels, and eventually introducing hydrogen or radically different aircraft.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/12/05/Untitled-design-2025-12-05T151636.303.png,N,,2025-12-05 10:58:21.883804

A group of European countries has come together to accelerate the use of synthetic aviation fuels. Austria Finland France Germany Luxembourg Netherlands Portugal and Spain have joined a new coalition designed to strengthen the transition toward cleaner flight operations. This announcement was made during the Transport Council in Brussels.

Why Synthetic Aviation Fuels Matter

This initiative builds on the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan and highlights the rising importance of synthetic aviation fuels in lowering emissions from aviation. Current regulations expect these fuels to supply 1.2 percent of aviation fuel by 2030 and reach 35 percent by 2050. Across Europe more than forty projects are already awaiting major investment decisions. The momentum indicates that strong financial support will be essential to scale production and position Europe as a leader in this technology.

Support from EU Leadership

According to the Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism this coalition signals a clear commitment to reducing aviation emissions. Member States plan to mobilise significant funding with a goal of reaching at least 500 million euros for large scale projects. This is expected to encourage private investment and speed up the deployment of synthetic fuels at airports.

How the Coalition Will Work

Participating countries will provide financial backing for double sided auctions designed for synthetic fuel producers. These auctions will help secure long term revenue for producers while giving buyers access to competitive contracts. The first auction is expected in 2026 and the coalition will begin coordinating efforts immediately. It also remains open for additional countries that want to join.

Conclusion

The creation of this coalition marks a meaningful step toward cleaner aviation in Europe. It reflects a growing confidence in synthetic fuels and shows how coordinated action can guide the market toward real progress. Such developments also encourage expert partners across the sustainability space to prepare for new opportunities in aviation transformation.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-41.svg,N,,2025-12-05 08:56:25.226350

The Airbus A220 replaces its older Airbus A318 and A319.","Aircraft manufacturer Airbus describes the A220 as purpose-built for efficiency. It is a small, single-aisle aircraft that seats between 100-160 passengers in a bright and comfortable cabin. The seats are wider and offer more personal space, so it is also popular with passengers. Why does the Airbus A220 have such a loyal pilot following? Let's find out in this guide.

The Airbus A220 has new-generation engines that offer superior efficiency, with 25% lower fuel burn, CO2 emissions, and noise. It uses advanced materials, the latest technology, and state-of-the-art aerodynamics. There are two variants of the Airbus A220 — the A220-100 and the A220-300. The aircraft is a fusion of performance and technology that reduces its environmental footprint.

In The Airspace Cabin

The cabin is large and airy compared to a similar-sized aircraft, and the configuration is either 3-2 or 2-2 premium seating. The seats are ergonomic, slim-lined, and wider than the comparable Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 seats, with more legroom. The overhead lockers are 60% larger than usual, and this speeds up boarding and turnaround times and allows passengers to have their baggage close by during the flight.

The new Airbus Airspace cabin is used on both types and offers superior passenger comfort. The Airspace cabin was designed to enhance the passenger experience in its modern aircraft family and prioritizes comfort and design. The sidewalls were redesigned to make it more spacious. Airbus's Airspace cabin is a concept designed to improve passenger comfort, space, and brand consistency across its modern aircraft family, including the A350, A320neo, A330neo, and A220.

There are integrated state-of-the-art inflight entertainment systems and high-speed connectivity. Air quality has improved, and the cabin is quieter and has better pressurization. Panoramic windows flood the cabin with light, and there is customizable LED mood lighting for ambiance and to reduce jet lag. The lavatories have also been upgraded to be touchless and with antimicrobial surfaces.

A Little Background

Before it was launched as the Airbus A220, it was the Bombardier CSeries jetliner that was launched in 2008. Bombardier had success with its previous Canadair Regional Jet (CRJ) but wanted to develop the CSeries further. The original aim of the aircraft was to fill the 100–150-seat market and be a quiet, fuel-efficient regional jet. They also had success with their Learjet, Challenger, and Global business jets. They hoped that this new aircraft would replace the Boeing 717, the Boeing 737NG, the Airbus A320, and the Embraer E190.

The project, along with delays on train orders and design issues with their business jet program, left Bombardier with financial and commercial difficulties. Sales of the CSeries were slow, so Airbus, which already held a stake in the company, acquired the CSeries program and the Bombardier facility at Mirabel, Quebec. Bombardier exited the commercial aviation industry and the trains to further concentrate on business jets. They had also had a dispute with Boeing in the process.

The CSeries was rebranded in 2018 by Airbus with the official A220 name and became part of the Airbus family. At this time, Airbus had a 50.01% stake in the company and took full control in 2020. The Airbus A220-100 (formerly the CS100) first entered service in July 2016, with Swiss International Airlines, while the A220-300 (formerly the CS300) entered service with airBaltic in December of the same year.

Why Airlines Like The Airbus A220

The Airbus A220-100 has a range of 3,600 nautical miles and can seat 135 passengers. The slightly larger A220-300 has a 3,400 nautical mile range and has a slightly longer fuselage that can seat up to 160 passengers. It can be used for regional flights or on short to medium-haul routes, and it can be used on short runways and regional airports with ease. It can fly a variety of missions, including challenging airports like London City Airport. Furthermore, it is the only aircraft in production in its class that can perform steep approaches and long-haul routes.

Airlines can offer a wide range of routes using this aircraft, as it has the same range as larger single-aisle aircraft. Airlines can more easily change their schedules to meet demand and operate new routes without the risks normally involved. They can also operate the aircraft when fuel prices are volatile, which improves things economically. The Airbus A220 has 25% lower operating costs per seat than previous-generation aircraft.

The aircraft is more fuel-efficient, further reducing operating costs. It is a versatile and profitable aircraft for the airlines. It maximizes profitability, is lean, economical, and efficient with significant savings for operators. There is also 99% commonality on the Airbus A220 type. Therefore, less training is needed and there are fewer maintenance costs when operating this variant. However, it is not compatible with the Airbus A320, for example, and needs a different type rating.

The Technical Bit

The Airbus A220 is built using lightweight materials, which also make it more fuel-efficient. The wings are made of a carbon composite material, and the fuselage is made of aluminum-lithium. These materials also allow for a longer service life. The aircraft has Pratt and Whitney PW1500G geared turbofan engines that produce 23,300 pounds of thrust. The benefit is 16% better fuel efficiency and 50% less noise, as well as optimized performance and enhanced reliability.

The A220 is fitted with the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion avionics suite. It has five 15.1-inch touchscreen displays and an advanced Flight Management System (FMS). There is a Synthetic Vision System (SVS) with an optional Head Up Display (HUD). It uses fly-by-wire technology with side stick controls and, overall, reduces pilot workload. The cockpit has Airbus A350-style displays and electronic checklists that simplify procedures. Hand flying is smooth and precise. The aircraft’s fly-by-wire, control laws, human factor-centered design, and ergonomics have contributed to making the Airbus A220 a game changer.

Data from Airbus

A larger Airbus A220-500 was rumored, but Airbus has not put the aircraft into production yet. It would be a stretched version of the A220-100 and would accommodate up to 180 passengers. It would fill the gap between the A220-300 and the A320neo. The aircraft would run on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), reducing its carbon footprint, and could be a future key player in sustainable aviation. Instead, Airbus is scaling up production of the existing A220s.

Which Airlines Utilize The Airbus A220?

There are currently 455 Airbus A220s in operation, with 21 commercial airlines. They have flown over one billion kilometers, carrying over 90 million passengers on over 1,100 routes, according to Airbus. Over 70% of the Airbus A220s will fly alongside the Airbus A320 at airlines such as Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, Air France, and Air Canada, as well as SWISS and Qantas.

Delta Air Lines is the largest operator of the Airbus A220 in North America, according to data from ch-aviation. The airline uses both variants on domestic and transcontinental routes with two classes of seating. The airline has another 65 A220-300s on order and uses the aircraft to feed its hubs. Air Canada currently has 39 A220-300s and JetBlue has 55 of the aircraft. Breeze Airways has 46 of the larger variant and uses the aircraft for point-to-point flights.

In the top five are airBaltic with 50 Airbus A220 operating regional routes within Europe. Air France has 48 A220s in operation on short and medium-haul routes and has more of the aircraft on order. The Airbus A220 replaces its older Airbus A318 and A319. The launch customer, SWISS, has 30 of the aircraft. EgyptAir scrapped one of its fleet in 2025 and sold the rest in 2024, citing that they were difficult and costly to maintain.

What The Airlines Say

Here is what some of the airlines have said about the Airbus A220 as per this Airbus case study:

""The Airbus A220-300 provides both greater capacity and longer range. Notably, the longer range of the aircraft has enabled airBaltic to launch direct flights to destinations such as Abu Dhabi, Almaty, Malaga and Lisbon."" - Andris Vaivods, airBaltic SVP Technical Operations

""With this aircraft, we’re able to operate on longer routes, such as Moscow, Cairo or Hurghada, as well as at operationally challenging airports with short and narrow runways and complex approaches, such as London City and Florence. At the same time, the A220 is an all-rounder that can be used for all our other short and medium-haul destinations."" - Peter Koch, SWISS A220 Fleet Chief

""In the current reduced demand environment, it’s important to leverage the most efficient aircraft in the fleet. The A220 helped us fill a gap in terms of capacity between regional aircrafts and larger narrow-body aircraft, for which, the break-even threshold is too high in the current context."" - Mark Garlardo, SVP Network Planning and Revenue Management at Air Canada",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/why-the-airbus-a220-has-such-a-loyal-pilot-following.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-12-05 01:56:57.313145

UCAA Deputy Director General, Olive Birungi Lumonya, noted that the study confirms Uganda’s strong potential to produce SAF domestically.
Uganda’s abundant biomass resources, such as agricultural residues, forestry by-products, and organic waste, position the country to becoming a future producer of sustainable jet fuel.
“Uganda recognises that achieving ICAO’s long-term climate goals requires advancements across the entire sector, from aircraft technology and air navigation operations to the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

The report marked a milestone in Uganda’s efforts to build a low-carbon and climate-resilient aviation sector.

UCAA Deputy Director General, Olive Birungi Lumonya, noted that the study confirms Uganda’s strong potential to produce SAF domestically. Uganda’s abundant biomass resources, such as agricultural residues, forestry by-products, and organic waste, position the country to becoming a future producer of sustainable jet fuel.

Lumonya emphasised Uganda’s alignment with ICAO’s global aspiration to reduce aviation CO₂ emissions by 5% by 2030 using SAF, Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF), and other cleaner energy sources.

She noted that Uganda has already demonstrated commitment to green aviation, becoming one of the first African countries to voluntarily join ICAO’s CORSIA scheme in 2019.

“Uganda recognises that achieving ICAO’s long-term climate goals requires advancements across the entire sector, from aircraft technology and air navigation operations to the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels,” she said.

She added that SAF is expected to make the largest contribution towards reducing emissions by 2050.

UCAA Acting Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, Irene Atto, reiterated Uganda’s leadership role in continental climate-action efforts, stating that the study provides an evidence-based roadmap for SAF deployment.

“The SAF programme now moves into its next phase—developing a national Business Case Study that will guide implementation in collaboration with key ministries, UNOC, and aviation stakeholders,” she said.

Addressing participants, Barongo Ronny, Director of Safety, Security and Economic Regulation, hailed the feasibility study as “timely and transformative.” He noted that the report provides a comprehensive assessment of Uganda’s technical, economic and environmental readiness to produce SAF, including opportunities for new investments, jobs, and improved energy security.

He added that UCAA has prioritised environmental protection and sustainable aviation in its strategic planning, pointing to Uganda’s strong commitment to CORSIA and the broader global movement toward lower-carbon fuels.

According to ICAO experts, the global shift toward SAF is accelerating, with fuel-blend mandates already required in Europe. Uganda Airlines is among the carriers affected and must uplift SAF-blended fuel on return flights from London, an added cost that could be reduced if Uganda establishes its own SAF production capacity.

Officials noted that SAF production worldwide is currently concentrated in a few technologically advanced countries.

The new feasibility study, however, demonstrates a clear pathway for Uganda to participate across the entire value chain from feedstock production to refining and distribution.",https://softpower.ug/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/spweb.png,N,,2025-12-04 16:56:43.039971

The president of ABIOVE says that the industry has been committed to the pact for almost 20 years.
In the case of soybeans, used mainly in biodiesel production in Brazil, the report describes the pressure on the Cerrado.
In the Acará Valley in northeastern Pará, the production of palm oil for biodiesel illustrates the clash between the Belém 4X plan and the reality of the territories.","FROM BELÉM, Pará – André Nassar is the executive president of the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (ABIOVE), an organization representing the country’s largest grain processors. He says that companies do not want to “break with the soy moratorium,” but he advocates “some kind of improvement” in the agreement that bans sourcing from areas deforested after July 2008 in the Amazon.

The statement was given to Repórter Brasil after he participated in a panel on Saturday (15) during COP30, in Belém, Pará. The event discussed biofuel production in Brazil. Today, seven out of ten liters of diesel manufactured from agricultural raw materials come from soybeans.

Environmental organizations claim that changes to the agreement could weaken the fight against deforestation and advocate keeping the current rules. To date, no concrete proposal has been presented to change them.

Signed by private companies, NGOs, and public authorities, the moratorium is considered one of the main instruments for preserving the Amazon biome, having contributed to a 69% reduction in clearing of native forests by 2022, according to estimates by the Soy Working Group (GTS), which includes environmental organizations, the federal government, businesses, and associations such as ABIOVE itself.

Rural producers critical of the agreement want to plant soy in areas deforested after 2008, which cannot supply signatory companies, according to the rules of the agreement.

Currently, the business pact is under evaluation by Brazil’s Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE) and the Supreme Federal Court (STF).

Supreme Court Justice Flávio Dino ordered the suspension of all legal and administrative actions that discuss the validity of the moratorium and its compatibility with competition rules. The injunction seeks to avoid conflicting decisions and establish a “safe legal framework” for agribusinesses in a scenario of billion-dollar disputes.

The president of ABIOVE says that the industry has been committed to the pact for almost 20 years. According to Nassar, rural producer associations have been pressuring companies to be paid compensation for areas that have ceased to be cultivated due to the moratorium, which he sees as “absurd.”

Asked if increasing soybean production to meet the higher demand for biofuels could increase pressure on the forests, he disagreed. “I don’t agree with the argument that more biodiesel results in more soybean-planted area. Expansion of plantations is driven much more by exports of soybeans as grains. It’s the demand for food, not the demand for energy,” he argued.

Biofuel offensive involves “producing” science, executive says

In his presentation at the COP30 panel, Nassar stated that the soybean oil industry needs to “produce science to work on all the communication aspects.” Addressed to an audience dominated by industry representatives, the sentence was used to advocate agricultural biofuels at a time when the sector is under criticism.

Nassar stated that, after the UN climate conference, “the whole world will zoom in on Brazil” to discuss agricultural biofuels and question two points: competition with food production and deforestation associated with supply chains. “We are ready for that,” he said.

The optimistic statements contrast with the scenario that social organizations and researchers have been documenting on the ground. Far from the controlled environment of the COP30 negotiation zone, the supply chains that underpin ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) have been associated with territorial conflicts, deforestation, and labor violations.

The debate on biofuels at the climate summit is taking place at a time when the Brazilian government is trying to make the country a global leader on the agenda. In Brasília, President Lula presented the Belém 4X Commitment – an international declaration sponsored by Brazil, Italy, and Japan that proposes quadrupling the global use of sustainable fuels by 2035 over 2024.

The document includes biofuels, biogas, hydrogen, and e-fuels, and speaks of energy transition, carbon neutrality, and fast expansion of these sources in sectors such as transportation, aviation, and industry.

The debate over the land use for food or biofuel has not been overcome

According to ABIOVE’s president, two-thirds of Brazilian soybean production is exported as grains, and only one-third is processed. The goal is to increase industrialization – converting soybeans into biofuel is a core part of this process. He says that industrialization would increase the value paid to producers by 50% and add four times more value to the soybean supply chain.

Despite the enthusiasm for the COP showcase, he acknowledged that the “food vs. fuel” debate – the dispute between food and fuel production regarding land use – has not been overcome yet, especially in Europe. He said that there are several documents and studies that, in the industry’s view, show the absence of relevant adverse effects, but that “the other parties cling to the food vs. fuel argument based on premises rather than evidence.”

In his opinion, the main obstacle is improving communication. He pointed out the need to “disseminate positive data and information” about biofuels to influence decision-making forums and public opinion.

He recalled that COP30 has “several panels on the subject” and that it is necessary to “keep the subject alive so as not to create resistance.” Asked about the legacy of the conference, he replied that it is “the recognition of biofuels as decarbonization-based energy transition” and declared that he was “super happy about that.”

Nassar was comfortable speaking among industry and agribusiness peers. The panel, promoted by Brazil’s National Association of Automotive Vehicle Manufacturers (ANFAVEA), was moderated by Davi Bontempo, superintendent of Environment and Sustainability at the National Confederation of Industry (CNI). It included the participation of Congressman Arnaldo Jardim (Cidadania-SP), João Irineu Medeiros, vice president of Regulatory Affairs at Stellantis in South America, and former Minister of Agriculture Roberto Rodrigues, a special agribusiness envoy at COP30.

Rodrigues said that he is at the conference to defend agriculture. He sustained that there cannot be peace where there is “hunger, lack of energy and unemployment,” and pointed to interests of the oil industry trying to hinder the promotion of agricultural fuels.

The sugarcane industry sees a new boom in cases of slave labor

While the government offers the agenda as a climate showcase, Repórter Brasil’s report “The Biofuels Bill” shows that the ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF (Sugarcane Agroforestry Systems) supply chains are associated with deforestation, land conflicts, and slave labor.

The study details how production of sugarcane, soybeans, palm oil, and beef tallow, pointed out as the basis of the “clean” transition, repeats old practices of exploitation of land and people.

In the case of soybeans, used mainly in biodiesel production in Brazil, the report describes the pressure on the Cerrado. The biome is known as the country’s “water reservoir” and has already lost almost half of its native vegetation, with 74% of that loss caused by agriculture and livestock.

The expansion of soy to meet the demand for biofuels, coupled with grain exports, is pushing the agricultural frontier over native vegetation areas. International studies cited in the report indicate that, when considering Indirect Land Use Change (ILUC) emissions, global biofuels emit, on average, more CO2 than the fossil fuels they are intended to replace.

In sugarcane – the basis of ethanol – there is a “new boom” in cases of slavery-like work. In 2023, 258 workers were rescued from sugarcane fields on farms supplying large mills. Several of them did not have minimum health and safety conditions: lack of drinking water, absence of toilets, and exhausting working hours. Even so, mills connected to these scandals are still certified by national and international “sustainability” programs.

In the Acará Valley in northeastern Pará, the production of palm oil for biodiesel illustrates the clash between the Belém 4X plan and the reality of the territories. Tembé Indigenous people, quilombola communities, and riverside dwellers claim that areas linked to BBF (Brasil BioFuels), a company that produces biofuels from palm oil, are associated with crop destruction, enclosures, and episodes of violence against local communities.

In addition to producing biodiesel to supply thermoelectric plants, BBF had plans to make jet fuel and supply the main Brazilian airlines. The company has recently had its request for judicial reorganization accepted by a court in Pará.

When questioned about the conflict with traditional peoples for a Repórter Brasil article in August 2022, BBF stated that it exercised possession of the disputed area in a “peaceful” and “fair” way. They also denied that there had been episodes of beatings, threats, or burning of houses by security agents. The company also said that there is a “reversal of the narrative that seeks to make the company the great villain.”

In a statement to Repórter Brasil during COP30, Chief Yuna Miriam Tembé from the I’xing territory in Tomé-Açu, Pará, summarizes the contradiction in the message she would like to deliver to President Lula if she could meet him personally: “Before quadrupling biofuel production, demarcate our territories.” For her, that production is not clean. It may even be “bio,” but it is “bio because it has indigenous blood, black blood, and the blood of riverside dwellers, extractive communities, and family farmers.”

While leaders like Yuna Miriam circulate through Belém without accreditation to access the area of ​​official negotiations, the biofuel business front has seats at blue zone tables.",https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/card-twitter-especial-cop30-21.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 16:56:56.952037

For G2L™, this deployment represents not just validation in a research environment but a steppingstone towards widespread commercialization of PtL production.","E-fuels such as power-to-liquid (PtL) sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) are attracting significant attention. The production technology exists, but barriers remain for large-scale deployment. Central to overcoming these issues is the choice of production pathway. One of the most promising is the G2L™ process, which integrates Sasol’s Fischer-Tropsch synthesis with Topsoe’s electrified reverse water-gas shift (eREACT™), including light hydrocarbon recycle and product upgrade section. It is so promising, in fact, that it was recently chosen for Europe’s largest e-fuels research and demonstration plant, the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

The efficiency challenge

Producing liquid hydrocarbons from electricity and carbon dioxide is inherently energy intensive. Hydrogen production via electrolysis accounts for more than half of the total e-SAF cost, which makes energy efficiency the defining metric for economic viability. Every megawatt of electricity and kilogram of hydrogen must be translated into the highest possible yield of certified kerosene.

G2L™ addresses these issues through the use of eREACT, where electrically heated reactors replace combustion to supply the energy needed for syngas generation. By eliminating hydrogen combustion, the process improves both hydrogen and electricity efficiency. On a once-through basis, G2L™ performs comparably to other SAF pathways like the methanol-to-jet process.

But when recycling integration is introduced, its advantages become clear – G2L™ emerges as the most efficient option, achieving the highest energy and hydrogen efficiency, and enabling the lowest cost of SAF (LCO SAF) without producing low-value heavy products like the methanol-to-jet process.

Efficiencies and savings can be manyfold

One of the defining features of G2L™ is the easy implementation of the recycling of light hydrocarbons such as naphtha back into the process. In a standard once-through system, these co-products are separated and sold, reducing kerosene yield and complicating offtake agreements for multiple products. With G2L™, light ends are reintegrated alongside fresh CO2 and hydrogen, converting them into additional jet fuel.

This recycling loop increases kerosene yield to 100% of product output while maintaining more than 95% carbon efficiency. It also cuts hydrogen and electricity demand, with naphtha recycling alone reducing electricity consumption by around 15% compared to once-through operation. In a sector where electrolyser costs and power prices dominate economics, these savings are significant.

RNG as a SAF feedstock when using Topsoe`s syngas technologies

RNG (or biomethane) is a purified form of biogas derived from organic waste sources such as agricultural residue, food waste, or wastewater treatment. Upgraded to meet the quality standards of fossil natural gas, RNG is pipeline-compatible and can be used as a direct substitute for traditional natural gas. This means RNG has great potential to serve as a renewable feedstock for producing SAF due to its renewable origin and compatibility with existing infrastructure.

RNG can either be used locally on-site, primarily as a fuel or for power generation, or injected into natural gas distribution pipelines for broader regional export. For SAF production, pipeline distribution is a more practical option.

Integration with electrolysis

The G2L™ concept further improves efficiency through integration with high-temperature electrolysis. Fischer-Tropsch synthesis is highly exothermic, producing steam at temperatures suited to Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOECs). By feeding this waste heat into electrolysers, the system reduces the external electricity required for hydrogen production.

When SOEC integration is combined with naphtha recycling, electricity demand can fall by up to one third compared with conventional alkaline electrolysis.

This integration is a practical method of aligning thermodynamics with cost reduction, turning unavoidable process heat into a valuable resource. Efficiency gains in G2L™ technology strengthen project economics by maximizing kerosene yield and reducing hydrogen and electricity consumption.

G2L™ selected for the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP)

The potential of G2L™ as a next-generation e-fuels pathway is underlined by its selection for DLRs Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) in Leuna. Funded with EUR 130 million from the German Federal Ministry of Transport, the TPP will be Europe’s largest PtL demonstration and research facility.

The TPP maps the entire value chain, from RED II-H2 and -CO2 to certified e-SAF, with a capacity of 2,500 t/a PtL. The e-fuels will be comprised mainly of kerosene, using renewable feedstocks such as biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen.

The core aims of the TPP are de-risking the PtL route, supporting industrial scaling, gathering PtL application experience, as well as optimizing the PtL process and the fuel (Fuel Design), e.g. reducing non-CO2- effects.

For G2L™, this deployment represents not just validation in a research environment but a steppingstone towards widespread commercialization of PtL production. The demonstration plant is currently under construction starting operation in Q4 2027.

Powering forward

In 2025, Sasol and Topsoe signed a cooperation agreement with DLR and Griesemann (acting as EPC-contractor) to enable the construction, operation and R&D activities of DLR’s e-SAF research and demonstration plant at the Leuna Chemical Complex.

This step forward follows Topsoe and Sasol’s selection in 2024 to deliver G2L™ e-fuels technology for the TPP, integrated with Topsoe’s innovative eREACT™ technology and hydroprocessing technologies as well as with Sasol’s LTFT™ (low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch) technology.

Expanding SAF production is also crucially important as it is creating entirely new economic opportunities, particularly in regions where investment and innovation can have the greatest impact.

Policy momentum is already evident across continents. The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, adopted in October 2023, sets clear targets for SAF integration, while the African Union adopted its Continental Strategy for SAF in February 2025, reflecting the continent’s commitment to sustainable aviation growth. These regional policies contribute to the implementation of the ICAO-adopted Global Framework for SAF and cleaner energy sources, which provides a shared reference point for governments, industry, and financial partners.

Africa’s potential as a producer and user of SAF is attracting increasing attention. Current global production of SAF is concentrated in a few regions, but Africa’s diverse feedstock resources and growing aviation sector position it as a future leader in this space. The EU Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), launched in November 2025, further emphasizes the value of partnerships between Africa and Europe in meeting shared sustainability goals.

Recent investment commitments from the European Investment Bank (EIB), the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African Development Bank (AfDB) are reshaping the landscape for SAF and cleaner energy production in Africa. These developments reflect a broad, collaborative approach to advancing sustainable aviation both within Africa and globally.

EIB Global, the EIB Group’s international arm, has set a €100 billion investment target by 2027 to support sustainable infrastructure and energy projects worldwide. The STIP, adopted on 4 November 2025, recognizes international partnerships as essential for expanding access to renewable and low-carbon fuels, facilitating technology exchange, and supporting regulatory harmonization.

Since 2022, the ICAO ACT-SAF programme has been supporting countries as they develop and deploy SAF, providing technical assistance, capacity-building, and a platform for sharing best practices and online training series, as well as SAF feasibility and business implementation studies.

Developed in partnership with World Energy and shaped by a broad, global consultation, this new framework recognises long-term environmental attribute certificate (EAC) offtake agreements and provides a credible demand signal to support financing for SAF production

Geneva, Switzerland 4December 2025 – The Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) has launched the Market Acceleration Indicator (MAI) Methodology and Module for pilot testing. This new framework is designed to support the scale-up of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by providing credible recognition of long-term EAC offtake agreements. These agreements will be verified and reflected in the RSB Book & Claim System, allowing SAF buyers and producers to demonstrate robust demand signals that support investment and financial decision-making.

The MAI was developed in close collaboration with World Energy and refined through stakeholder consultations. It responds directly to one of the SAF market’s most persistent challenges: the lack of visible and credible demand that can be used to secure project financing. By turning long-term offtake commitments into clear, verifiable indicators, the MAI gives producers and buyers a powerful tool to strengthen financing negotiations, unlock additional capital for facility expansions, and attract new investors to emerging SAF projects.

The framework is now available for pilot testing. Offtake contracts that meet the MAI criteria can be registered in RSB’s system, with a Market Acceleration Indicator included in the book and claim retirement statement. This creates a clear and auditable claim of long-term commitment that can support financing, insetting, and additionality claims.

.

Credibility supported by a diverse stakeholder group

.

The MAI was shaped through expert input from across the aviation, energy, technology, finance, consulting and sustainability sectors. Stakeholder participants included:

Airbus, Airlines for America, AIT Worldwide Logistics, Arcadia eFuels, Center for Green Market Activation, Charm Industrial, Deloitte US, EC-Impact, Evident, EY, Future Energy Global Ltd, GE Aerospace, Gevo Inc., Green Finance Institute,, Iberia Express, International Air Transport Association (IATA), Jet Zero, Microsoft, MotionECO, MUFG, Nova Pangaea Technologies, RMI, S&P Global Commodity Insights and Twelve,

“Scaling sustainable aviation fuel is critical to meeting our climate goals and driving progress across the industry. The Market Acceleration Indicator provides a clear, credible signal of long-term demand, giving both seasoned and new buyers—along with producers and investors—the confidence to move faster and unlock the next wave of SAF growth.” – Lauren Kickham, Microsoft, Director, Markets and Investments.

.

From pilot concept to system integration

The MAI builds on the concept of translating long-term offtake agreements into transparent and verifiable claims. Similar to Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) used in renewable energy markets, EAC offtake agreements help to define commercial additionality. The MAI formalises what constitutes a strong, bankable and additional demand signal.

Once the MAI has been piloted and consulted with RSB’s multi-stakeholder membership, it will form an integral part of the RSB Book & Claim Manual and the RSB Book & Claim Registry. It introduces the system’s first impact claim beyond carbon emissions, focusing on the role of demand in enabling new supply and supporting additionality in the SAF market.

.

A tool for greater confidence and impact

The MAI provides:

A clear and standardised structure for qualifying long-term SAF offtake agreements

Registry-based recognition of these agreements at the point of retirement

Support for investors evaluating demand certainty during financial due diligence

Additional transparency for buyers pursuing credible insetting strategies

“RSB’s new Market Acceleration Indicator provides a solution to the persistent challenge for renewable fuel developers to achieve bankability. Thanks to RSB, with sponsorship from World Energy and Microsoft, we have a contract framework and an emerging system to certify projects. This will be a game changer to answer the question of what is “bankable” and to accelerate lower cost capital for harder-to-abate climate solutions.” said Adam Klauber, Chief Sustainability Officer at World Energy.

“This tool gives SAF market actors a credible way to prove commitment and unlock finance,” said Julia Fidler, Executive Director of RSB. “It brings visibility to contracts that can drive the crucial next generation of SAF investment, including from emerging producers who will be essential to meeting growing SAF demand.”

.

Next steps

The Market Acceleration Indicator is now available for pilot use. Interested SAF producers, buyers and financiers are encouraged to engage with the RSB team to explore how the framework can support project development, investment readiness and credible demand recognition.

This means even dust particles in the cleanroom or vibrations during wafer transport can become large disruptions that cause lower yields. Factories are also looking to reduce total power consumption. Daifuku works in close consultation with semiconductor manufacturers to overcome these challenges.

In China, some products have emerged that appear to emulate our cleanroom transport systems. But while they may seem similar in terms of appearance, the differences are clear: we have fine tuned our know-how for precision cart control and minimizing vibration.

Daifuku was founded as a manufacturer that produces forging and rolling machinery for steelworks. From the very beginning, we understood that control systems are equally as important as the machinery itself. That is why we focused on controllers and even went so far as to develop our own microcomputers.

Developing and manufacturing a wide range of products in-house means that it has always been essential that we accumulate deep practical and technological expertise in a given area. Expanding into diverse fields - manufacturing, logistics, airports, and more - has also been a catalyst for spurring new ideas. I believe that by refining and broadening our approach to “moving, sorting, and storing objects,” there is now nothing that we cannot handle.

Leading up to 2030, as laid out in our long-term vision, we aim to address challenges facing society in areas new to our business, including food and the environment. During agricultural work, it is not uncommon for temperatures out in the fields across Japan to exceed 40 degrees Celsius, and at the same time the population and workforce are aging. With the aim of automating indoor cultivation, our core production base Shiga Works has started cultivating strawberries. Meanwhile, in Omihachiman City, Shiga Prefecture, we are surveying and removing debris from waterways, including plastic waste. We are also testing robots to help with this cleaning up.",https://project.nikkeibp.co.jp/ESG/atcl/eng/sdgf/93/og.jpg,N,,2025-12-04 13:57:06.439784
