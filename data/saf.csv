“That would be the right point to announce that there will be a SAF mandate” to support demand, Mr Forshaw said.
“Singapore will derive that economic benefit, not Australia,” Mr Forshaw warned, noting that Singapore already has a massive SAF refining capability.
This year the UK introduced a two per cent SAF mandate.
This masthead put the aviation heavyweights’ concerns to the office of Mr Bowen, who is the climate change and energy minister.","In as little as six months Australia will be at risk of losing the chance to create a $13 billion-a-year industry – unless the Albanese government signals that planes will have to use biofuel, Airbus has warned.

The jet-building giant’s local chief executive Stephen Forshaw told this masthead that without a commitment from Canberra, local crops capable of feeding a new refining sector would instead be “hoovered up” by the likes of Singapore.

In September, Jim Chalmers and Chris Bowen announced $1.1bn of support to grow more feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

At the time, the government said it would consult on the production incentive structure until mid-2026.

“That would be the right point to announce that there will be a SAF mandate” to support demand, Mr Forshaw said.

He suggested beginning with a requirement of just one to two per cent of total consumption, rising to 10 per cent over time.

“We’ve got in the range of another six to 12 months before the window will really start to close on us,” he said, because the feedstock would begin to be “hoovered up”.

“Singapore will derive that economic benefit, not Australia,” Mr Forshaw warned, noting that Singapore already has a massive SAF refining capability.

Right now, no SAF is made in Australia.

Airbus is pushing for a SAF mandate because its business is doomed in the long-term unless its airline customers are able to reduce their carbon footprint. SAF offers the best opportunity.

Research commissioned by Airbus and Qantas has found domestic SAF production has the potential to contribute $13bn in GDP annually by 2040, supporting 13,000 jobs in the feedstock supply chain and another 5000 to construct and run the refining facilities.

Qantas chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent shared Mr Forshaw’s concerns about the need for action, otherwise “a lot of the feedstock could be exported and tied up overseas rather than realising the economic gains here.”

SAF can be made from sugarcane, which Australia has in abundance. It can also be derived from canola. Already, more than 70 per cent of Australia’s canola is exported to Europe to be turned into SAF.

That biofuel can end up in the wing of a Qantas-branded Airbus departing London Heathrow. This year the UK introduced a two per cent SAF mandate. It will rise to 10 per cent by 2030, which is the same as Qantas’ self-imposed target.

In May, Qantas, Sydney Airport and Ampol combined forces to import nearly two million litres of SAF. It was made using waste cooking oil from restaurants in China.

Ms Messent said a domestic SAF sector was an ideal fit with the Albanese government’s Future Made in Australia agenda.

“It had such a clear economic benefit,” she said.

This masthead put the aviation heavyweights’ concerns to the office of Mr Bowen, who is the climate change and energy minister.

In response a spokeswoman said: “The government will continue engaging with industry on how to make sure Australian liquid fuel users have a fair chance to capture the emissions reduction potential unlocked by low-emission Australian fuels.”",https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/90406a3f83feb05d19d90c5c879aefb9,N,,2025-11-08 14:16:33.922514

Mr Di Bella produces about 13,000 tonnes of cane annually outside Ingham, between Townsville and Cairns.

The qualified agronomist said the industry was currently too reliant on crystal sugar, the price of which had fallen to be barely above the cost of production.

Whenever it sinks below the cost of production, the industry has to wind back operations and go into “survival mode,” he said.

“If we stay with sugar alone we are not going to grow the pie,” Mr Di Bella said.

“Developing a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is going to allow us to grow that pie,” not just for farmers, but for harvesters and millers,” he added.

Mr Di Bella, 55, said two of his children – Hayden, 25, and Gemma, 17 – want to be part of the future of farming in the region.

SAF would all but cement that future.

Mr Di Bella lamented that people had been talking about the potential of biofuel in Australia for 20 years.

“In Australia we do all the talk and no action,” he said. “It’s time for action now.

“We’ve let everything go offshore. It’s time to do stuff at home.”

Mr Di Bella said he had seen SAF industries first-hand in Brazil and the US, which had been supported by governments through legislation and incentives.

The region’s mayor Ramon Jayo, who is also a cane farmer, said: “The economic reality is that we do need to diversify in the sugar industry. You simply can’t have all your eggs in one basket.”

SAF would be a complementary income stream.

“We can enjoy the benefits of having a multifaceted product,” Mr Jayo said.

As well as cutting carbon emissions, the move would reduce reliance on global supply chains that are increasingly susceptible to disruptions, with a recent strategy paper citing rising “tension in the Indo-Pacific” as one of many potential threats.

That paper also warned that Australia is one of the only nations in the developed world with no minimum reserves of liquid fuels for an emergency and that the country has “struggled” to meet its International Energy Agency 90-day stockpiling commitment.

Struggled is a euphemism – Australia consistently ranks last out of the more than 30 IEA member countries for oil holdings.

However, Defence has identified an opportunity arising from Australia’s incapability to provide a reliable flow of petroleum-based fuel in the event of supply chain breakdowns.

That opportunity is for Defence to use its sizeable fuel needs to influence the development of a local SAF industry.

Earlier this year, Defence began a trial of SAF at its RAAF base at East Sale, south east of Melbourne.

That SAF was imported. In the future, Defence wants the SAF it buys to be made here.

“We are seeking to source domestically … because that is getting after fuel security,” Director General Fuel Capability Brigadier Mark Baldock told this masthead.

The blend being used in the trial is five per cent SAF. Only the relative high price of SAF is stopping Defence from going higher.

“We have to increase the demand signal to drive the cost down,” Brigadier Baldock said.

At the moment, no SAF is made in Australia. But building work recently began on the first SAF refinery, at Townsville, Queensland.

This glaring omission exposes the Entertainment Society of Goa’s (ESG) continuing failure to nurture and promote local filmmakers, a tragic irony in the very land that hosts one of the world’s oldest and most celebrated film festivals, stated former Member of Governing Body of ESG Vishal Pai Cacode.

While crores are being splurged on red carpets, events, and cosmetic spectacles, Goan cinema continues to be starved of even the most basic support.

Many Goan filmmakers have been struggling for years to access financial assistance trapped in endless paperwork, opaque criteria, and official apathy, said Vishal Pai Cacode.

Equally alarming is ESG’s failure to create even minimal film-making infrastructure in the state. Despite two decades of IFFI in Goa, there is still no proper editing studio, equipment bank, crane facility, or professional light and sound setup available for local use. The absence of such essential resources forces young filmmakers to rely on private vendors from outside Goa, drastically inflating production costs and discouraging local talent, he said.

Instead of investing in sustainable creative infrastructure and supporting Goan stories, ESG’s focus appears to have shifted entirely toward event management and commission-driven contracts.

A photo of the shiny red 2025 Chevrolet Equinox EV RS shows the driver's stylish transition away from combustion-engine vehicles.

""Beautiful color. Enjoy your new vehicle,"" praised one commenter, while another said, ""The red looks so good! Congrats. Got my first one in July and love it!""

So far, the new EV driver's only minor complaint concerns a potential upgrade for charging their phone inside this model. They prefer ""a modified pad for the Qi charging pad"" for their phone, since the rubber insert on the current model is a hindrance. However, they added, ""Works great when I remove the rubber insert.""

Despite the phone-charging dilemma, the EV owner's transition away from internal combustion engine cars is a healthy choice. Vehicle pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, ultrafine particles (UFPs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) linger in the air through tailpipe exhaust. This increases cancer risk along with respiratory and heart issues, according to the California Air Resources Board.

With zero tailpipe pollution, per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and lithium batteries that can be recycled, EV usage can help clear and cool down the air on an overheating planet. Depending on your driving needs, you can even fill up at home and avoid vandalism at charging stations.

Plus, there's the impressive savings. According to a 2024 Atlas Public Policy study, EV owners generally save 40-65% on annual fuel costs versus gas-powered vehicle drivers. Thanks to fewer mechanical components, these green cars also help drivers save 4% on repair and maintenance costs.

Making your next car an EV is just one way to reduce your carbon footprint and work toward a cleaner, cooler future. Continue your energy-efficient conversion with induction stoves, heat pumps, and solar panel installation. Going solar can reduce your energy bill to as little as $0.

A home charging station powered by solar further reduces your EV charging costs, and EnergySage — a TCD-vetted source — can easily provide quotes from local installers and help you save up to $10,000 on solar installation.

Due to the upfront investment, buying a home solar system may not be possible for everyone, but leasing solar panels is an alternative for those looking to avoid high, fluctuating energy prices while also helping the planet.

He emphasized the importance of translating the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan into concrete measures that will help bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and traditional fossil fuels.
Without such measures, the uptake of sustainable fuels may stall, undermining the significant investments already made in the shipping sector.","The European Commission has announced a significant €2.9 billion investment plan aimed at boosting sustainable fuel production for aviation and maritime transport by 2027. This initiative comes as the EU grapples with the challenge of decarbonizing heavy transport, which currently accounts for approximately 26.4% of emissions in the transport sector. With a binding climate goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, the urgency to transition to greener alternatives has never been more pressing.

Investment Goals and Challenges Ahead

The European Commission’s new plan is designed to accelerate the development of renewable and low-carbon fuels, which are essential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from commercial aviation and shipping. Despite existing EU legislation aimed at promoting climate neutrality in these sectors, both remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The Commission emphasizes that achieving the EU’s climate goals will require a substantial increase in the availability of sustainable fuels, estimating a need for around 20 million tonnes by 2035. This ambitious target is projected to necessitate an investment of approximately €100 billion.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, stated, “The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future.” The funding will be drawn from the EU’s multiannual budget, which runs until 2027, and aims to support innovative technologies in renewable fuel production. Under current EU regulations, the maritime sector is required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2% starting in 2025, with a target of an 80% reduction in GHG intensity by 2050. Similarly, the aviation sector is expected to source 20% of its fuel from sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) by 2035, with a specific mandate for synthetic fuels known as e-SAF.

Industry Reactions and Future Prospects

While the Commission’s plan has been welcomed by various stakeholders, challenges remain in scaling up the production of sustainable fuels. Currently, over 40 e-fuel production projects are in the planning stages within the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision. Issues such as the availability and cost of renewable energy, carbon capture technologies, and the energy intensity required for producing green hydrogen are significant hurdles that need to be addressed.

Feedstock availability and aviation demand challenge biofuel adoption in shipping

Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), highlighted the importance of reducing costs associated with sustainable aviation fuel to ensure air travel remains accessible. Meanwhile, Antony Froggatt from the campaign group Transport & Environment (T&E) expressed optimism about the Commission’s commitment to e-fuels but cautioned against the potential drawbacks of relying on biofuels. He stressed the need for a clear focus on e-fuels to ensure the success of the upcoming European Hydrogen Bank auction, which will allocate €300 million for aviation and maritime projects.

Jim Corbett, environmental director at the World Shipping Council, described the Commission’s initiative as a promising first step towards accelerating the energy transition in shipping. He emphasized the importance of translating the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan into concrete measures that will help bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and traditional fossil fuels.

ChemAnalyst spoke with Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan, CEO of Elessent Clean Technologies, about the strategic acquisition of Sulphurnet and how its advanced filtration technologies strengthen Elessent’s portfolio, enhance process reliability, and support the company’s mission to deliver cleaner, more efficient, and sustainable industrial solutions worldwide.

Complete Interview with Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan

Q: Please provide an overview of your professional journey and leadership experience in the chemicals, sulfur processing, and clean technologies sectors. How have these experiences shaped your strategic vision at Elessent Clean Technologies in driving innovation and sustainability across industrial processes?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: I’ve had the privilege of wearing many hats throughout my career, working across a wide range of industries, including refining, chemicals, polymers, biotechnology, and engineering. Each experience has shaped how I view industrial transformation and sustainability.

My passion for clean technologies really took root during my time with Genencor and later DuPont, which acquired Genencor in 2012. At Genencor, I saw how biotechnology could be leveraged to create sustainable alternatives to traditional chemical and polymerization processes. That realization fundamentally changed how I think about innovation and its role in enabling a cleaner industrial future.

When I transitioned from the biotechnology side of DuPont to the engineering side with DuPont Clean Technologies (DCT), now Elessent Clean Technologies, it gave me a new perspective. I learned how traditional industrial processes can be made cleaner and more energy-efficient without adding prohibitive costs. That bridge between biotechnology and engineering helped shape my belief that sustainability and performance are not mutually exclusive — they can, and should, advance together.

At Elessent, I’ve worked closely with our team to continue expanding our emission reduction and energy-efficiency initiatives. Some of the technologies I’m particularly proud of include our next-generation regenerative sulfuric acid systems that virtually eliminate emissions; mist elimination technology that supports green hydrogen production; value-engineered heat recovery systems that make energy efficiency viable in developing regions; scrubbing solutions adapted for carbon capture; and novel hydroprocessing technologies that enable the production of sustainable aviation fuel.

These experiences have reinforced my core belief: industrial progress and environmental responsibility can, and must, go hand in hand. At Elessent, that’s the vision guiding everything we do as we help industries around the world transition to a cleaner, more sustainable future.

Q: What strategic factors led Elessent to acquire Sulphurnet, and how does this acquisition align with your long-term growth and technology expansion plans?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet is a specialist in advanced industrial filtration and sulfur processing: it offers tailored systems (pressure-leaf filters, self-cleaning candle filters, modular sulfur-melting & purification plants) designed for demanding process environments. Elessent’s core portfolio already includes process technologies for sulfuric acid production, alkylation, wet scrubbing, hydroprocessing, and other downstream chemical/metal/oil refining sectors.

By acquiring Sulphurnet, Elessent is able to integrate a highly specialized filtration and purification capability that complements and deepens its existing technology stack. This portfolio extension helps Elessent address a wider set of process needs from filtering sulfur feed streams to fully purifying and modularizing plant solutions.

The acquisition expands Elessent’s addressable market. Filtration and purification are relevant across sulfuric acid, chemical plants, chlorine, hydrogen, fertilizer, mining/metal processing and beyond. Sulphurnet already serves multiple industries (e.g., metal/mineral, edible oil, amine filtration) in addition to its sulfur business. Elessent can cross-sell its existing technologies into the customer base that Sulphurnet brings, and vice versa, unlocking growth opportunities.

Q: Sulphurnet specializes in advanced filtration and sulfur impurity removal technologies. Could you elaborate on how these capabilities complement Elessent’s existing portfolio across sulfuric acid, chemical, chlorine, and green hydrogen sectors?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet’s advanced filtration and impurity-removal capabilities fill a critical upstream gap in Elessent’s portfolio. It means Elessent can offer not just the process technology (e.g., sulfuric acid, chlor-alkali, hydrogen) but also the essential feed/purification modules that ensure that the plant runs reliably, efficiently, and with less risk. For customers, that translates into higher uptime, better product quality, lower maintenance cost, and stronger environmental performance, all of which reinforce Elessent’s value proposition in its target markets.

Q: How does integrating Sulphurnet’s technologies enhance operational efficiency, reliability, and sustainability for Elessent’s customers in critical industrial processes?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Sulphurnet’s filters remove impurities like ash and fine solids from molten sulfur, so downstream units like sulfuric acid converters and boilers run much smoother. That means less fouling, reduced pressure drop, and better overall performance. With built-in monitoring tools like turbidity analyzers and flowmeters, operators can make real-time adjustments and avoid unplanned shutdowns.

By keeping the feed clean, we reduce catalyst fouling and blockages, which extends run lengths and cuts maintenance costs. Sulphurnet’s modular and automated filter systems are also built to handle tough environments, adding a layer of protection that keeps the rest of the process running reliably.

Q: In what ways does the acquisition strengthen Elessent’s competitive position globally, and how will it influence your market expansion strategy in Europe and other key regions?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: The Sulphurnet acquisition strengthens Elessent’s global position by adding to our portfolio of solutions for our customers. We recognize that customers can have problems in their acid plants due to upstream impurities, and we want to provide that solution as part of our suite of reliability and performance enhancers for new plans and throughout the life of the plant.

Q: Filtration and impurity removal are critical for optimizing sulfur processing. How does Elessent plan to leverage Sulphurnet’s technology to drive innovation and address emerging environmental and regulatory challenges in the chemical industry?

Mr. Eli Ben-Shoshan: Elessent is leveraging Sulphurnet’s advanced filtration technology to enhance efficiency, safety, and sustainability in sulfur processing operations.

His timing could not have been better.

Sustainability was the hot concept across the corporate world as consumers became increasingly aware of climate change.

Aviation insiders worried that headlines about the public’s concerns about the climate impacts of flying — which contributes to about 2.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emission each year — would soon hurt airlines’ profits.

The industry looked to sustainable aviation fuel, a type of jet fuel made from organic materials such as greases, food scraps and yard waste.

In Smoot’s case, the fuel would be made from the wood byproducts of the timber and mill industries. He even had a planned partnership in 2019 to provide the fuel to Delta, which Delta recently confirmed is active.

While he has locked his sights on the Port of Longview’s Barlow Point, Smoot’s project still must secure tens of millions in development capital investment to determine if the site will work — and he has to do it before the political winds change.

Clean energy future

“Out of 100 projects, a very tiny percentage come to fruition,” said Neil Maunu, who runs the powerful, Vancouver-based Pacific Northwest Waterways Association trade group comprised of ports, businesses and public agencies looking to stimulate economic development on the region’s waterways.

It’s still unclear if Northwest Advanced Bio-Fuels’ sustainable aviation fuel effort will be the project to break through. And current events don’t offer much clarity.

An August investigation by Reuters found airlines have announced 165 sustainable aviation fuel projects in the past dozen years, but only 36 have materialized.

“Reuters found that the airline industry’s plans to go green before regulators start penalizing them are little more than a pipe dream,” it concluded.

Clean energy projects also have been killed en masse during the second Trump administration.

President Donald Trump has successfully pushed many of the country’s larger companies to abandon their climate goals, including some airlines.

And Delta’s CEO has signaled his support for the Trump administration.

Yet both Delta and Trump’s actions defy simple explanations.

Delta has criticized some administration policies, and a company spokesperson confirmed to The Daily News that it is maintaining its climate goals.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has extended Biden-era tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel production and supported at least one Northwest project.

And Washington has its own incentives, creating a particularly favorable environment for these kinds of energy projects.

Ultimately, demand for the fuel and the economic forces driving it may be the deciding factor in the commodity’s future.

Airlines already have started to face fines in Europe for not meeting ecological goals.

Production goals

Locally, Sea-Tac airport officials say they will power every flight fueled there with at least a 10 percent locally produced sustainable aviation fuel by 2028. A spokesperson for the airport said almost none of the 600 million gallons of jet fuel used at the facility each year is from sustainable sourcing right now.

But the goal stands, Perry Cooper, media relations manager for the airport, said by email.

“We’ve done the studies on how to get (the fuel) here but, no, there is not a supplier here yet,” he wrote.

Sea-Tac is a regional hub for Delta and one of the airports Smoot said would use his fuel.

BY Erin Krueger

The U.S. EPA on Nov. 7 issued decisions on 16 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions filed by eight small refineries. The agency granted full exemptions to two petitions, partial (50%) exemptions to 12 petitions, and denied two petitions.

The SRE program allows eligible small refiners, defined as those that process no more than 75,000 barrels per day of crude oil, to petition the EPA seeking exemptions of their Renewable Fuel Standard renewable volume requirements (RVOs) for a given RFS compliance year.

For an SRE petition to be approved, the refiner must demonstrate “disproportionate economic hardship” in satisfying its RVO requirements. As part of the SRE application process, the U.S. Department of Energy is tasked with analyzing and scoring SRE petitions. The EPA, however, makes the final determination to approve or deny each petition.

According to information released by the EPA, the agency has fully approved one SRE petition for RFS compliance year 2023 and one for RFS compliance year 2024. The 50% partial approvals include four for compliance year 2021, two for compliance year 2022, four for compliance year 2023, and two for compliance year 2024. The two denials include one each for compliance year 2023 and 2024.

On a combined basis, the approvals have reduced the total RVO for all four years by 740 million renewable identification numbers (RINs). This includes 150 million RINs for 2021, 70 million RINs for 2022, 250 million RINs for 2023 and 260 million RINs for 2024.

The EPA also updated its online SRE data dashboard, showing one new SRE petition has been filed since mid-October. That petition, filed by Kern Oil & Refining Co., seeks a waiver of the 2025 RVOs for its facility in Bakersfield, California.

There are now 15 SRE petitions pending, including two filed for RFS compliance year 2023, one for RFS compliance year 2024 and 12 for RFS compliance year 2025.

The Nov. 7 action on 16 SRE petitions follows the EPA’s Aug. 22 decisions on 175 SRE petitions filed by 38 small refineries for compliance years 2016-2024. In that action, the EPA granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, granted partial (50%) exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined 7 petitions to be ineligible.

In documentation released Nov. 7, the EPA issued a correction to its Aug. 22 action, noting it “erroneously provided a partial exemption for the 2020 compliance year to a small refinery that should have been provided a full exemption.” The agency attributed the mistake to a clerical error made by DOE in transcribing the metric from the scoring rationale to the DOE matrix. To correct the error, the EPA has changed the partial approval for that SRE application to a full approval.

As part of its Nov. 7 announcement, the EPA said it is reaffirming the agency’s policy of returning RINs previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. While no actual RINs will be returned today, EPA said will follow standard agency policy and instruct those impacted to contact the EPA Fuels Program Helpdesk to initiate the RINs return process.

Moving forward, the EPA said it is committed to ruling on SRE applications within the statutory 90-day review period.

The agency also briefly addressed the supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking (SNPRM) it issued in September that addresses how the agency plans to reallocate waived SRE volumes moving forward. The comment period on that SNRPM closed Oct. 31. In its Nov. 7 announcement, the EPA said it “is reviewing comments on the supplemental proposed rule as the agency continues to work on final regulations for the “Set 2” rule. As stated in the SNPRM, EPA intends to update the agency’s projections of exempted gasoline and diesel volumes in the final rule based on any additional SREs issued after the proposal, including the petition decisions in this action.”

The Renewable Fuels Association criticized the EPA’s new SRE approvals. “Today, EPA created even more uncertainty and confusion in the renewable fuel and agriculture markets, which are already under immense pressure from record corn and soybean harvests this fall,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “EPA added another 14 small refinery exemptions to the already-massive pile today, based on the agency’s questionable new approach to determining whether those refiners experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship.’ We continue to dispute the notion that SREs are warranted at all, as EPA’s own analysis shows that all refiners—large and small—face a proportional RFS compliance obligation and pass their RIN costs through to buyers of their refined products. The silver lining here is that EPA is returning expired RINs to the six refineries who were granted exemptions from their 2021 and 2022 RFS obligations. However, more than 500 million valid RINs will be issued to eight refineries who were gifted exemptions from their 2023 and 2024 obligations, meaning there are now more than 2.5 billion RINs associated with 2023-2025 SREs that are likely to be dropped back onto the market in the months ahead. If EPA fails to reallocate those volumes when it finalizes the 2026 and 2027 RVOs, the impact on biofuel and agriculture markets will be devastating. Today’s decision further underscores the crucial need for EPA to finalize 2026-2027 RVOs that fully reallocate any and all SREs granted, or expected to be granted, for the 2023-2027 compliance years.”

The EPA in late 2022 began publishing basic data on the each SRE petition filed with the agency, including company name, location and compliance year. A full copy of that data is available below.

Вице-министр энергетики Кайырхан Туткышбаев и директор Европейского и Североатлантического регионального бюро международной организации гражданской авиации (ИКАО) Николя Ралло обсудили вопросы внедрения и производства устойчивого авиационного топлива SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) в Казахстане.

Что говорят в Минэнерго

В министерстве энергетики сообщили о заинтересованности в реализации проекта по производству устойчивого авиационного топлива совместно с американской компанией LanzaJet.

Кайырхан Туткышбаев отметил, что отечественные нефтеперерабатывающие заводы готовы в кратчайшие сроки перейти на производство авиатоплива марки Jet A-1.

В минэнерго также рассказали о планах увеличить с 2026 по 2032 год производство авиатоплива на казахстанских заводах до 1,7 млн тонн.

Для чего переход на Jet A-1

Jet A-1 ‒ это традиционное ископаемое реактивное топливо, а Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ‒ это альтернативное топливо из возобновляемых источников. SAF разработан для замены Jet A-1, чтобы сделать перелёты более экологичными.

Почему это важно для экологии

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ‒ это альтернативное экологически чистое авиационное топливо, производимое из возобновляемых источников, а не из нефти.

Оно значительно снижает выбросы парниковых газов по сравнению с традиционным авиакеросином и может смешиваться с ним для использования в существующих самолетах без модификации двигателей.

SAF производится из различного сырья, такого как отработанные масла, сельскохозяйственные отходы, растительные и животные жиры, а также из спиртов и синтетических процессов.

Таким образом, Казахстан намерен сократить выбросы парниковых газов в отечественном авиационном секторе.

Что еще

Владелец международного аэропорта ""Сары-Арка"" в Караганде Ерлан Оспанов в интервью BES.media ранее отмечал, что решающее влияние на цену билетов вносят расходы на топливо, обслуживание самолётов и дефицит воздушных судов.

По данным International Council on Clean Transportation, устойчивое авиационное топливо (SAF) сейчас в 2-5 раз дороже обычного авиакеросина.

Кроме того, технологии производства биотоплива могут быть более сложными и дорогими. Поэтому все эти факторы могут повлиять на цену авиабилетов в сторону повышения.",https://img.bes.media/besmedia-photobank/media/2025-11-08/04be2312-e54e-480c-8f77-60dd655ce8ba.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 12:56:54.032011

This move comes as the European Union intensifies efforts to ensure passengers receive accurate information about airline sustainability, where the Consumer Protection Cooperation Network in the EU has launched a framework requiring airlines to clarify environmental claims.

21 European Airlines Commitments

It has been reported that many carriers across Europe have historically marketed “green fares” or sustainable aviation fuel in ways passengers often misinterpreted as offsetting flight emissions directly.

Therefore, twenty-one airlines have been asked to enhance transparency and avoid vague green terminology that could mislead customers.

Marketing language suggesting that purchasing a “green fare” directly neutralizes carbon emissions will no longer be permitted. The commitment is intended to prevent passengers from overestimating the environmental impact of individual flights.

Lufthansa and KLM, Air France, Finnair, and EasyJet have committed to clear communication about sustainability. Other signatories include Ryanair, Norwegian, TAP, SAS, SWISS, Brussels Airlines, Volotea, Vueling, Luxair, Eurowings, Air Dolomiti, Transavia, and Air Baltic.

Europe’s Greenwashing Concerns

For years, airlines have faced criticism for overstating their environmental efforts. Claims of sustainable fuel usage and carbon-neutral flights often lacked transparency and verifiable evidence.

Consumers have increasingly questioned the legitimacy of such statements, prompting regulatory oversight, with Paddle Your Own Kanoo reporting:

Airlines will now clearly differentiate between general sustainability initiatives and direct carbon offset programs. This distinction ensures that passengers understand that buying a ticket labeled “green” does not equate to a net reduction of emissions for their specific journey.

Closer to the Implementation Measures

Airlines will now conduct internal audits of all marketing material, including websites, booking platforms, and advertising campaigns, to ensure sustainability claims are fully accurate.

Compliance teams will verify that terms like “carbon-neutral flight” or “green fare” are only used when emissions offsets are fully traceable and verified.

Carrier websites and apps will include transparent sustainability reporting, showing data such as fleet fuel efficiency improvements, adoption rates of sustainable aviation fuels, and corporate carbon-reduction achievements.

Passengers will be able to see exactly what portion of emissions is offset and which initiatives contribute to the overall environmental impact.

Regulatory oversight will also require airlines to submit annual progress reports to the EU Consumer Protection Cooperation Network.

These reports must document how marketing language has been corrected, how passenger communications have improved, and what measurable reductions in carbon emissions the airline has achieved.

This ensures accountability and ongoing adherence to the greenwashing prevention framework.

Bottom Line

European airlines, including Lufthansa Group and KLM, are committing to transparent environmental claims just as the aviation sector accounts for roughly 2.5 % of global CO₂ emissions.

With mandates such as the ReFuelEU Aviation targeting up to 70 % usage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by 2050, the industry is finally aligning its marketing with measurable decarbonisation goals.

As a result, passengers can trust clearer, verifiable information on sustainable travel—and the carriers willing to lead are setting a bold new standard for the aviation industry’s integrity and future.

The plan to step up financing for sustainable fuels in shipping and aviation by 2027 comes as the bloc is falling short of decarbonizing heavy transport by 2050.

The European Commission announced a €2.9 billion plan to scale up investments in green fuels by 2027 to curb carbon dioxide emissions from aviation and maritime transport, which together account for roughly 26.4% of EU transport-sector emissions.

With the EU’s binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonize, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

“The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,” said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU’s multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

“Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

“Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,” A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission’s plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,” Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only “detract from” commitments to e-fuels.

“It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production”, T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission’s plan was a “promising first step” to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.

“WSC is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers. Without this, production and uptake will stall despite significant fleet investments already made by the liner shipping sector,” read the statement.

Announced in Brussels in early November 2025, the plan represents one of the largest coordinated investment frameworks ever assembled for clean transport, with €2.9 billion already earmarked through 2027 to attract private co-investment.

The goal is to deliver roughly 20 million tones of sustainable fuels by 2035, about 13.2 million tones of biofuels and 6.8 million tones of synthetic e-fuels, aligning Europe’s aviation and maritime sectors with its 2050 net-zero ambitions and signaling a turning point in the global race to decarbonize heavy transport.

At its core, the STIP is an industrial strategy as much as it is a climate plan. It seeks to stabilise investor confidence by offering long-term regulatory clarity and mechanisms that reduce financial risk for early movers in the clean fuels market. This approach blends policy certainty with targeted financing through the Innovation Fund, Horizon Europe, InvestEU, and the European Hydrogen Bank.

Already, €300 million has been allocated to fast-track hydrogen-based aviation and maritime fuels, while additional funding is being channeled into synthetic fuel innovation and maritime decarbonization projects. By creating a single, unified framework for investment, the European Commission hopes to overcome the fragmented funding landscape that has slowed the scaling of clean fuels in the past decade.

For Europe, the economic rationale is straightforward: its aviation and shipping sectors are among the most carbon-intensive, together accounting for around 8 percent of the bloc’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Decarbonizing these sectors is crucial not only for climate targets but also for maintaining industrial competitiveness.

The STIP’s design reflects that duality, it anchors environmental goals in a wider strategy of energy sovereignty, job creation, and technological leadership. Yet, the ripples of this plan extend far beyond Europe’s borders. For Africa, it represents both an opportunity and a challenge that will shape the continent’s emerging sustainability agenda.

Europe’s pursuit of 20 million tones of sustainable fuels by 2035 will create vast demand for feedstocks, from agricultural residues to energy crops and green hydrogen. Africa, with its abundant land, solar potential, and proximity to European markets, is naturally positioned to become a supplier in this new value chain. However, the question is not simply whether Africa can supply Europe’s clean fuel needs, but whether it can do so in a way that drives its own industrial transformation rather than perpetuating raw material dependence.

Current production levels tell a sobering story. Global sustainable aviation fuel output stood at about 1 million tones in 2024, expected to double to 2 million tones in 2025. To meet its target, Europe will need a tenfold increase in production capacity within a decade, a scale-up that will almost certainly reach into Africa’s bioeconomy.

Countries like Kenya, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and South Africa already feature in feasibility studies for feedstock cultivation and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production. The World Bank and regional energy agencies have identified technical potential for domestic production, but commercial viability remains constrained by high capital costs, infrastructure gaps, and uncertain policy environments.

To understand the stakes, consider that a medium-scale SAF plant requires hundreds of millions of dollars in upfront investment, along with long-term purchase guarantees to remain financially viable. Without such mechanisms, Africa risks remaining an exporter of crude bio-feedstocks, oilseeds, molasses, waste oils, instead of refining these materials into high-value fuels domestically. The result would replicate the extractive dynamics seen in past commodity cycles: exporting raw materials while importing finished products at a premium.

The economics are equally pressing for African airlines. Fuel accounts for more than 30 percent of operational costs across the continent, a figure far above the global average. Locally produced sustainable fuels could, over time, offer a pathway to cost stability and emissions compliance, especially as international regulations tighten. Yet, at present, SAF costs several times more than conventional jet fuel, and without subsidy or policy support, few African carriers can afford the transition. The danger is that Europe’s subsidies and policy certainty will accelerate its own clean-fuel markets while leaving Africa outside the value chain.

There are, however, signs of strategic alignment. Morocco and Namibia are already positioning themselves as green hydrogen exporters, leveraging abundant renewable energy to serve both European and regional demand. South Africa’s green fuels roadmap also envisions producing synthetic jet fuels for export and domestic use. These early moves suggest that Africa can do more than supply feedstocks, it can manufacture, refine, and export clean fuels, provided that investment, infrastructure, and governance frameworks evolve in step.

The implications of Europe’s STIP are profound; It challenges policymakers to act deliberately, to create regulatory clarity, land safeguards, and industrial incentives that ensure green fuel production contributes to domestic growth and job creation. It also underscores the importance of strategic partnership: Europe’s demand for low-carbon fuels could finance Africa’s renewable infrastructure if structured equitably.

The EU’s plan ultimately underscores a shared global truth: the transition to clean energy is no longer about isolated climate action; it is about industrial positioning in a changing global economy. For Africa, the window to define its role in that transition is open but narrowing. Whether the continent becomes a participant in the new clean-fuel economy or remains a supplier of raw inputs will depend on how quickly it mobilizes policy, finance, and technology to align sustainability with competitiveness.",https://africasustainabilitymatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel.webp,N,,2025-11-08 04:16:31.490321

Airline performance

Emirates Airline delivered a record half-year profit before tax of AED 11.4 billion (USD 3.1 billion), up 17 per cent year-on-year, with revenues increasing to AED 65.6 billion (USD 17.9 billion). This growth was driven by sustained travel appetite across regions and strong demand for premium cabins.

Between April and September 2025, Emirates launched new services to Danang, Siem Reap, Shenzhen, and Hangzhou, expanding its network to 153 airports across 81 countries. The carrier also added 28 new weekly flights to key destinations, strengthening global connectivity.

Fleet expansion continued with the delivery of five new A350 aircraft and the completion of 23 aircraft retrofits under its USD 5 billion programme. Emirates Premium Economy — now available on routes to 61 cities — remained a key growth driver.

On the ground, the airline introduced ‘Emirates First’, an exclusive check-in experience for First Class passengers and Platinum Skywards members at Dubai Airport. The brand also unveiled new retail concept stores in Accra, Bangkok, Geneva, Jakarta, Mauritius, Osaka, Seoul, and Singapore, reinforcing its customer engagement strategy.

Sustainability remained a focus, with Emirates uplifting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) at 37 airports and joining the Aviation Circularity Consortium to promote circular economy initiatives within aviation.

In brand visibility, Emirates signed multi-year partnerships with FC Bayern Munich, Real Madrid Basketball, and European Professional Club Rugby, while extending sponsorships with the ATP Tour and Olympique Lyonnais through 2030.

Passenger traffic increased by 4 per cent to 27.8 million, while Emirates SkyCargo transported 1.25 million tonnes of freight, up 4 per cent from last year. Though cargo yields softened by 6 per cent , demand for specialised logistics remained steady. Emirates also launched Courier Express, a door-to-door express shipping service for global businesses.

dnata performance

dnata reported its highest-ever half-year revenue of AED 11.7 billion (USD 3.2 billion), marking a 13 per cent increase year-on-year. Profit before tax rose 17 per cent to AED 843 million (USD 230 million), while profit after tax reached AED 697 million (USD 190 million).

The company’s airport operations division contributed AED 5.5 billion (USD 1.5 billion), a 15 per cent increase, supported by expanded services in Italy, Australia, the UK, and the UAE. The total number of aircraft turns handled rose 15 per cent to 450,903, while cargo volumes climbed 3 per cent to 1.59 million tonnes.

dnata’s catering and retail division generated AED 4.1 billion (USD 1.1 billion) in revenue, up 11 per cent , as demand strengthened in Australia and the UK. Its travel division contributed AED 2 billion (USD 538 million), with total transaction value up 9 per cent to AED 5 billion (USD 1.4 billion).

In the first half, dnata invested USD 110 million to deploy 800 new ground support equipment units across its global network and launched its marhaba airport hospitality brand in the UK. The company also took a minority stake in WonderMiles, an NDC-enabled booking platform, and entered its first major sports sponsorship with Dubai Basketball.

But the same AI systems can accelerate materials innovation, energy efficiency, and carbon removal.","Microsoft’s Climate Innovation Fund (CIF) just passed its first five-year milestone, and its impact is starting to reshape how corporate climate finance scales emerging technologies. What began in 2020 as a US$1 billion commitment to back solutions that didn’t yet exist at commercial scale has now mobilized roughly US$12 billion in broader climate tech financing.

The company has deployed over US$800 million so far across 67 startups and projects focused on carbon removal, low-carbon building materials, green steel, and AI-driven energy efficiency.

Microsoft’s Chief Sustainability Officer Melanie Nakagawa says the results show how corporate capital can move markets. “Big goals need bold bets,” she explains. “We needed to invest in technologies that were not yet at commercial scale—or, in some cases, didn’t yet exist.”

Today, those early bets are maturing into real projects, commercial plants, and large-scale carbon removal contracts. And while the tech giant still faces rising emissions linked to rapid growth in AI and data centers, CIF is now shaping supply chains that could determine how green the digital economy can be.

Pushing the Frontier: Turning Climate Concepts into Scaled Solutions

When CIF launched, Microsoft (MSFT stock) had announced its plan to become carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030. But the technologies needed to meet those goals were nowhere near ready. The fund was designed not to chase short-term returns, but to bring solutions to market that could eventually work at a global scale.

This approach meant:

Backing early-stage innovators before mainstream capital steps in

Acting as a first commercial buyer to prove demand

Pairing investment with procurement commitments to create real offtake pipelines

This strategy is what underpins CIF’s multiplier effect. For every dollar Microsoft has invested, approximately fifteen additional dollars have followed from other investors and institutions. That shift—moving innovations from pilot stage to bankable scale—has helped de-risk markets such as carbon removal, low-carbon cement, and sustainable aviation fuel.

Nakagawa puts it simply: “We’re helping move bold ideas off the sidelines and into real-world systems.”

Targeting High-Emissions Supply Chains: Steel, Cement, and Infrastructure Materials

One of CIF’s most direct priorities is reducing emissions tied to Microsoft’s own fast-growing infrastructure footprint. The company plans to spend about US$80 billion on data centers in fiscal 2025.

Data center construction is steel- and cement-heavy, and the energy use associated with CPUs and GPUs makes operations carbon-intensive. Recent examples show this strategy in motion:

Green Steel for Data Centers: Microsoft signed a deal with Stegra, producing steel with up to 95% fewer emissions. This steel will be used directly in data center equipment and building structures.

Low-Carbon Cement: The company has backed Fortera to build a 400,000-ton-per-year commercial facility producing a cement alternative that cuts emissions by about 70% compared to the standard Portland cement process.

These are not pilot projects—they are commercial facilities aimed at reshaping global heavy industry. The real signal is scale.

Leading the Corporate Carbon Removal Market

Microsoft has also become the world’s largest corporate buyer of carbon removal. The company has secured more than 30 million tonnes of removal commitments—spanning direct air capture, enhanced weathering, biomass burial, and engineered mineralization.

The deals include:

Vaulted Deep → Up to 4.9 million tonnes of permanent CO₂ removal by 2038

UNDO → 28,900 tonnes via enhanced rock weathering

Multiple multi-year agreements with DAC and ocean alkalinity innovators

These agreements are crucial because the voluntary carbon market remains uneven in quality. By enforcing rigorous verification standards and long-term contracts, Microsoft is shaping the market’s baseline expectations for durability and transparency.

Yet, the company’s own emissions are still rising. Scope 3 emissions have increased by 26% from their 2020 baseline. It’s largely due to the energy and materials required to build and power AI data centers. The question now is whether procurement-backed project financing can scale fast enough to help reverse that trend.

AI as an Accelerator: Climate Intelligence at Industrial Scale

CIF’s portfolio is increasingly leaning into AI-driven solutions. The logic is simple: decarbonization requires massive system optimization—across supply chains, grids, industrial processes, and land systems. AI is one of the few tools that can do that at speed.

Microsoft has invested in companies that use AI to:

Model and predict wildfire and forest restoration needs

Improve grid efficiency and transmission line monitoring

Analyze soil carbon and regenerative farming impact

Optimize renewable power dispatch and microgrid performance

The company now argues that AI is not just powering emissions—it’s critical to reducing them. But the energy footprint of AI remains a pressing challenge, which is why Microsoft is also advancing partnerships that combine AI deployment with co-development of clean energy.

RELATED: Microsoft’s $6.2 Billion AI Bet in Norway for 100% Renewable Energy Powered Computing

AI Partnerships with ADNOC, Masdar, and XRG to Transform Industrial Energy Systems

A new collaboration between Microsoft, ADNOC, Masdar, and XRG shows how AI can help decarbonize the energy sector. Under the agreement, Microsoft and ADNOC will co-develop AI agents to support more autonomous and efficient industrial operations, building on ADNOC’s existing AI deployment.

Microsoft will provide advanced AI tools and upskilling programs, while all partners will help create an innovation ecosystem focused on cleaner energy production, efficient data centers, and large-scale clean power development.

This partnership signals a crucial shift: AI is not just improving digital systems—it is starting to reshape physical industrial infrastructure. By aligning software innovation with clean energy development, the collaboration aims to reduce operational emissions and support the sustainable expansion of the global AI and data center economy.

Brad Smith, Microsoft’s Vice Chair, said it clearly:

“No single company or industry can meet this moment alone. Accelerating the transition to a more sustainable, secure, and inclusive energy future requires deep collaboration between governments, energy providers, technology companies, and innovators everywhere.”

The Path Forward

Microsoft’s climate investments are reshaping key segments of the decarbonization landscape. Yet the company is also confronting the reality that the AI boom is increasing its emissions faster than its solutions are reducing them.

This is the dual challenge now facing almost every technology leader:

AI is driving explosive demand for compute, energy, and infrastructure.

But the same AI systems can accelerate materials innovation, energy efficiency, and carbon removal.

The question is not whether AI will shape climate action. It already is. The real question is whether companies move quickly enough to align AI growth with a net-zero transition.

As CIF’s first five years show, early capital and clear purchasing signals can move entire markets. The next five years will determine whether those markets grow fast enough.

This is a moment for leadership. Bold bets made now will define the climate technologies the world relies on tomorrow.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2493256911.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 05:16:30.115945

The European Union has announced a €3 billion investment package to accelerate the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), signaling a decisive shift from pilot projects to commercial industrial scale. This development immediately de-risks the capital investment required for new SAF manufacturing plants by creating a stable, integrated market and guaranteeing long-term buyers. The funding is a direct response to the mandatory blending targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which requires a minimum of 2% SAF by 2025. The most important data point demonstrating the scale of this commitment is the €3 billion allocated to build new SAF plants and attract necessary private investment.

Context

The core question for the aviation sector has been whether SAF production could ever reach commercial viability at scale, given the high price premium. SAF was, on average, €2,085 per tonne in 2024, compared to €734 per tonne for conventional jet fuel, making it two to three times more expensive. This cost gap and the associated investment risk have historically slowed the capital commitments necessary to achieve the economies of scale that would lower prices.

Analysis

This industrial acceleration is caused by a policy-driven mandate meeting a new financial mechanism. The ReFuelEU regulation created mandatory demand, but the high capital cost of new plants stalled supply. The EU’s solution is a “pooled double auction” mechanism, which will match fuel producers with guaranteed buyers at pre-agreed prices. This mechanism provides the long-term revenue certainty that investors require to finance multi-billion-euro industrial facilities.

Manufacturers are expected to react by moving final investment decisions forward on new plants, particularly those focused on synthetic aviation fuels, which were absent from the fuel mix in 2024. Think of the pooled auction like a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) for fuel: it stabilizes the revenue stream and unlocks private capital.

Outlook

This development implies that the aviation sector’s decarbonization pathway is now structurally supported by industrial policy, moving the risk from the producer to the collective market. The simple thing to watch next is the success of the first “pooled double auction” in early 2026. A successful auction will immediately trigger final investment decisions for the next wave of commercial-scale SAF plants, particularly those using synthetic pathways, and will be the clearest signal that the EU’s integrated market strategy is working.",https://news.sustainability-directory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Bioregional-Design-Principles-Integrating-Cultural-Heritage-and-Circular-Economy-Innovations-for-Anthropocene-Resilience.jpeg,N,,2025-11-08 11:00:12.765881

“All these airlines have committed to stop claiming that the CO2 emissions of a specific flight could be neutralised, offset, or directly reduced by consumer financial contributions to climate protection projects or for the use of alternative aviation fuels,” the commission stated.

In addition, the term “sustainable aviation fuel” should only be used with appropriate clarification and vague “green language” should be avoided under the agreement.

Flights have a major impact on the environment due to greenhouse gases and other emissions. Many airlines offer compensation at the time of booking - often financial support for a climate protection project such as reforestation.

However, this system, which critics refer to as “indulgence trading”, is not considered to be accurate, as it does not offset a passenger’s own specific CO2 emissions but contributes to climate protection in general. This gives air travellers the impression that they are flying climate neutrally.

Four points of criticism at Luxair

At Luxair, the four points of criticism - that have since been resolved - were the claim that the emissions of a particular flight could be offset by contributions to climate projects, the use of unclear or unfounded “green” terms or images or implicit environmental statements, the use of statements about future environmental targets such as “net zero” without appropriate justification and an unclear and non-transparent use of CO2 emissions calculators.

Lhyfe has signed an offtake agreement with a service-station operator in Germany. “Under this new contract, Lhyfe will supply around 90 tons of RFNBO-certified hydrogen over a 15-month period to a service-station operator based in Germany. These service stations will fuel a fleet of several dozen buses,” the French company said.

Everfuel has inaugurated the HySynergy plant in Fredericia, Denmark, together with Crossbridge Energy Fredericia, before sending the first filled hydrogen trailer to Germany. “This is the first time that RFNBO-certified green hydrogen produced in Denmark is being exported abroad, where market conditions for green hydrogen are more favorable,” the Danish company said, adding that the plant is among Europe’s first large-scale electrolysis facilities for certified green hydrogen. Everfuel aims to establish over 2 GW of electrolysis capacity in Denmark by 2035.

Topsoe has inaugurated what it calls Europe’s largest Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) stack manufacturing facility in Denmark and will deliver its dynamic ammonia loop technology for Synergen Green Energy’s ammonia project in the United States. “The dynamic ammonia process plant will enable the ramping up or down of ammonia production at a rate of at least 3% per minute in response to the fluctuating supply of hydrogen to the ammonia plant,” the Danish company said, adding that the technology should significantly reduce capital and operational expenditure by substantially reducing or eliminating the need for hydrogen storage systems.",https://www.pv-magazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Hydrogen_7-1200x788-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 02:16:29.838036

IDB Debuts “Amazonia Bond” to Fund High-Impact ESG Initiatives

The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has raised $100 million from its first Amazonia Bond. This funding will support important environmental and social projects throughout the Amazon region.

This first bond comes after the Amazonia Bond platform was launched in July 2025 by the IDB and the World Bank. The platform aims to attract private investment for sustainable development in the Amazon. The IDB hopes to raise up to $1 billion with more bonds in the future.

The program will use the funds for projects that fight deforestation, land damage, and illegal mining. It will also support good governance, climate resilience, and social inclusion. Projects must meet three main goals: reduce poverty, protect natural resources, and encourage inclusive, sustainable growth.

After this bond was issued, Brazil’s National Treasury showed interest in possibly issuing its own sovereign bonds under the Amazon Bonds Guidelines.

Corporations that are focused on meeting emissions targets can seek guidance from ESG tools.

Over 20 Airlines Agree to Revise Environmental Claims After Greenwashing Probe

The European Commission has made a deal with over 20 airlines, such as Air France, Lufthansa, and KLM, to change or remove misleading environmental claims. Some airlines had suggested that paying extra fees or using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could completely cancel out flight emissions.

This decision came after the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) filed a complaint in 2023. The group said airlines misled passengers with false “green” marketing and called for refunds of deceptive environmental surcharges.

After the complaint, the EU Commission and Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) found several examples of greenwashing. These included using unclear terms like “sustainable” or “responsible” and making net-zero promises without proof. Airlines have now agreed to make sure all environmental statements are accurate, clear, and backed by evidence.

Companies committed to clean energy and corporate transparency should use ESG solutions.

Senate Republicans Oppose Resolution Aimed at Prohibiting Military Intervention in Venezuela

Senate Republicans voted 51 to 49 on Thursday to block a measure that would have stopped the Trump administration from taking military action in Venezuela without approval from Congress. Most Republicans opposed the measure, but Rand Paul and Lisa Murkowski joined Democrats in supporting it.

Senator Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia and co-sponsor of the resolution, said it was meant to prevent a possible land invasion of Venezuela. He stressed that the resolution addressed more than just recent U.S. strikes on suspected drug boats in Latin America.

Those against the measure argued that the president has full authority as commander in chief. Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, described Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro as an “existential threat” and defended the administration’s right to take military action.

The vote came after reports of at least 15 U.S. military strikes in the region since September, which have led to more than 60 deaths.

Lufthansa, for example, has expanded its ‘Green Fares’ which promise more sustainable air travel that can “reduce 20% of individual flight-related CO₂ emissions.”

The airline’s current marketing does not explicitly point out that these fares do not apply to specific individual flights, and only recently rolled out the scheme across its worldwide route network.

Sold as completely seperate fares, consumers are told that when they buy a Business Green fare, they will be making a more sustainable choice “by using sustainable aviation fuels.”

The plan addresses several long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s aviation decarbonisation strategy, but more action is still needed, IATA said.
The Association said: “Aircraft operators require a predictable SAF market with clear price transparency to plan the integration of SAF into their daily operations effectively.
“Under the current regulatory framework, aircraft operators are exposed to unjustifiably higher prices for jet fuel and SAF.
A robust UDB is also critical to this effort, and hence, IATA urges the Commission to expedite its enhancement work.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has welcomed the European Commission’s release of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) as a significant step in recognising the urgent need to accelerate air transport’s decarbonisation, but stressed more needs to be done.

The plan addresses several long-standing weaknesses in the EU’s aviation decarbonisation strategy, but more action is still needed, IATA said.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh said: “We welcome the Commission’s recognition of market challenges that derive from SAF mandates that were flawed from the outset, particularly the price gap between sustainable and conventional fuels, and the need for robust investment support.

“Extending SAF support under the EU ETS, exploring tradable SAF and book-and-claim mechanisms, simplifying operator reporting, improving access to sustainability certificates via the Union Database (UDB), and advancing dual conformance of SAF under EU RED and CORSIA to promote global harmonisation are positive steps but we need to see how words turn into reality. Particularly, we are concerned that the STIP falls short of critical industry expectations.

“We hope this is just the start of a continued review of EU aviation sustainability initiatives which will ultimately lead to a more efficient and successful programme of decarbonisation for aviation.”

IATA said it noted the Commission’s recognition of the potential of mechanisms that enable tradable SAF certification, including book-and-claim options, to address the SAF supply barrier across European airports.

It said it is also worth noting that such a system will serve as a key enabler for investments in SAF production facilities, in addition to promoting regional cohesion and connectivity by ensuring a level playing field for aircraft operators from different geographical regions in Europe.

IATA said: “This system is urgently required in Europe, and due to the misalignment between the flexibility mechanism under ReFuelEU Aviation, and the rules to claim SAF under EU ETS, necessary amendments to the EU ETS Directive should be implemented during its upcoming review to allow for EU-wide purchase-based claiming of SAF. It also must be noted that book-and-claim is paramount to the success of the proposed “intermediary mechanism”. Enhancement of the UDB is also critical and should be expedited to enable this.”

Acknowledging the role of aircraft operators as end-users and giving their issues due consideration should be a priority in STIP’s materialisation, IATA added.

The Association said: “Aircraft operators require a predictable SAF market with clear price transparency to plan the integration of SAF into their daily operations effectively.

“Under the current regulatory framework, aircraft operators are exposed to unjustifiably higher prices for jet fuel and SAF. While it is necessary to focus on ways to increase investment in SAF production facilities, STIP should prioritize equally the creation of a transparent and open SAF market that encourages both more supply and demand. A robust UDB is also critical to this effort, and hence, IATA urges the Commission to expedite its enhancement work. IATA and its members stand ready to contribute any necessary input to this work, to ensure the best outcome for all parties involved.”

IATA added: “While the STIP acknowledges the role of biofuels, it continues to prioritise e-SAF, citing feedstock constraints. IATA’s recent report on feedstock availability demonstrates that Europe possesses significant untapped potential for sustainable feedstocks, including advanced residues and waste streams. A technology-neutral approach—supporting both biofuels and e-SAF—is essential to maximize the potential of all SAFs, all of which will be necessary to reach the targeted 500 Mt in 2050. Limiting support to e-SAF alone risks undermining the scalability and cost-effectiveness of SAF deployment across the continent, with commensurate delays in achieving reductions in CO2 emissions.”",https://ittn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Willie-Walsh-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-08 10:16:35.509946

Domestic players will actively secure feedstock to meet the 350,000 tons capacity of the EcoCeres production facility, forcing them to offer competitive pricing to divert used cooking oil away from profitable international export routes, Chan Foong Hin said.

The EcoCeres facility became operational in October and will provide Malaysia’s first major source of ISCC CORSIA and ISCC EU-certified SAF, Chan said.

Exports surge; Singapore is the largest market. According to the Malaysia Palm Oil Board, used cooking oil exports reached 465,257 tons in 2024, up from 310,368 tons in 2023. Singapore was the largest importer, accounting for 284,116 tons, followed by the United States and the European Union with 158,231 tons and 19,819 tons, respectively.

""To manage domestic feedstock supply and secure competitiveness for the SAF industry, the ministry together with the MPOB (palm oil board), is currently reviewing and engaging with stakeholders regarding the potential implementation of a policy intervention to ensure a steady, sustainable supply of UCO for domestic industrial needs,"" Chan said, using an abbreviation for used cooking oil.

Chan also expects market demand to nearly triple with the commissioning of the Petronas, Enilive and Euglena biorefinery in Pengerang, targeted for completion in the third quarter of 2028.

Growing feedstock demand. ""This plant commands a significant feedstock capacity of 650,000 tons. Collectively, these two facilities will create an annual feedstock demand of up to 1 million tons, establishing direct competition with international buyers for the global UCO supply,"" he said, adding that the challenge in the supply chain will be feedstock collection.

As such, to meet domestic demand, Chan said Malaysia must scale up its domestic used cooking oil collection infrastructure from households and businesses, without undermining supply to other biodiesel sectors or resorting to uncertified imports.

On biodiesel, Chan said production is expected to remain stable next year and expects a moderate increase in domestic consumption as more companies implement higher biodiesel blending pilot programs to achieve their ESG targets.

Malaysia currently imposes a 10% biodiesel mandate nationwide, though a 20% biodiesel mandate is implemented in the federal territory of Labuan and Langkawi district as well as the state of Sarawak, with the exception of the Bintulu district.

Under a non-binding agreement, they will conduct field trials in select coconut plantations, design trial methodologies and analyze soils and leaves before and after fertilizer application.

The PCA said in a statement organic fertilizers will first be applied to coconut plantations and before expanding it to other crops.

The agency also noted that the technologies that will be used in this initiative are protected under a patent of Swung’s partner company, Kira Shoten Co. Ltd., for Bokashi fertilizer and solution.

“The PCA will continue to pursue modern technologies that can uplift the livelihood of coconut famers, as long as they undergo thorough evaluation and comply with standards,” PCA Administrator Dexter Buted said.

This follows previous talks between the PCA and Swung, where they tackled initial tests on organic fertilizers made from materials such as coconut residues, sugarcane waste and beer byproducts. The PCA is considering the next steps for the wider adoption of the technology.

Aviation fuel, too

Also, the PCA earlier said Swung was exploring venturing into coconut-based fertilizer and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative fuel produced from non-petroleum feedstocks.

Calumet turned in an impressive third quarter, with net income shooting up to $313.4 million thanks to strong cost cuts, higher specialty product sales, and a big bet on renewable fuels.

What does this mean?

These results show Calumet is gaining ground in several key areas. Adjusted EBITDA hit $69.6 million, boosted by $61 million in yearly cost savings and record production from its Specialty Products & Solutions division. The company also restated some financials due to a cash flow reporting hiccup, but that didn’t dent overall confidence. The spotlight now falls on Montana Renewables, Calumet’s subsidiary targeting as much as 150 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by the second quarter of 2026. With two-thirds of that already committed or in active talks, the project is moving quicker than expected, underscoring the solid demand for renewables in the US. Analysts have taken note – even with shares trading well above Wall Street’s median target, there are still no 'sell' ratings.

Why should I care?

A team of scientists from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has created a breakthrough method to turn everyday food scraps into eco-friendly jet fuel.

This sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) checks all the boxes for U.S. safety and performance standards—and it doesn't need any mix-ins from traditional fossil fuels.

The technique uses a high-tech process called hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL). It copies the intense heat and pressure that nature applies to form oil deep underground.

Food leftovers from factories or kitchens get zapped under extreme conditions to create a raw ""biocrude"" oil.

Then, through a cleanup step known as catalytic hydrotreating, they strip out unwanted stuff like oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur.

What's left? Pure hydrocarbons that match the makeup of regular plane fuel exactly.

The real game-changer? The researchers found that cobalt-molybdenum catalysts worked best.

In lab tests, the resulting fuel passed every safety and quality check with no extras needed. It worked perfectly in engine tests for big commercial jets.

That’s a big deal for green fuels, which often need blending to meet standards.

Of course, going big won’t happen overnight. Shifting from small lab batches to airport-scale production means setting up steady food waste collection, building HTL plants near cities, and getting airlines on board—many are already testing SAF.

The good news: the science is solved. Now it’s about funding, logistics, and final approvals.

This process turns that waste into a valuable resource and helps aviation reach its goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Lead scientist Yuanhui Zhang calls it the “missing link” in a circular economy—where trash becomes fuel for the future.

Held October 28 – 30 in San Jose, California, Trellis Impact 2025 brought together three of Trellis’ core convenings, GreenFin, VERGE, and Bloom. Across the board, RMIers identified three connective threads among speakers and participants: finance, data, and transportation.

Finance

Leaders from RMI’s finance team joined peers from across different industries to discuss how the investment landscape is evolving. They found that m, corporate leaders and investors are increasingly focused on proven technologies, transparent data, and credible risk-sharing frameworks. Rather than emphasizing public campaigns and commitments, many are shifting toward delivery-focused projects and practical tools that make clean energy solutions affordable, resilient, and scalable.

RMI’s Nabil Bennouna spoke on a panel focused on exploring finance as a catalyst for corporate climate action, emphasizing that “it’s time to shift the focus from subsidies to risk management.”

“By finding creative ways to pool balance sheets and share risks, we can unlock bold investments that make entering new markets far less daunting,” Bennouna said.

RMI is putting this principle into practice in our climate finance work by building tools, guiding strategies, and connecting capital to real projects around the world.

Datacenters & AI

Discussions around AI and data centers also took center stage at Trellis Impact 2025, appearing in nearly every break-out discussion. The explosion of AI-driven tools is reshaping how companies plan, report, and execute sustainability strategies, and the opportunity is immense.

According to RMI’s John McGrath, “It was heartening to see AI conversations move beyond hype and become more pragmatic. Common themes were the need for quality data; the promises and pitfalls of technology that’s both powerful and opaque; and to what degree AI and data centers will drive load growth as improvements in AI efficiency compete with exploding usage.”

RMI is exploring AI’s role in the clean energy transition through research on data center power and energy solutions (read our most recent article ) and by building data-driven tools to advance sustainable solutions.

Transportation

Transportation solutions and innovations featured prominently in the Trellis Impact 2025 program as well.

Andrew Chen, a Principal on RMI’s Climate-Aligned Industries team, outlined how leading corporations are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) certificates, and discussed how next-generation aircraft technologies and contrail management can help cut aviation’s full climate impact.

Chen also highlighted how the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance — spearheaded by RMI, Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), and Neoteric Energy and Climate — is building momentum for aviation climate solutions by launching a ready-to-go offering to help all attendees of COP30 address their aviation emissions.

“Purchasing SAF certificates is a tangible way to back low-carbon innovation in aviation and showcase meaningful climate leadership,” said Chen. “Forums like Trellis Impact are powerful platforms to raise visibility for these market-based tools, and we are really excited to have a growing portfolio of procurement options for corporations to play their part in aviation’s net-zero future.”

Across private conversations, keynotes, and breakout sessions, corporate leaders showed strong interest and momentum around overcoming barriers to drive progress. By the week’s end, one theme stood out from the rest: companies are deploying capital, technology, and data-driven tools morecreatively — and more cautiously —, to advance sustainable solutions while still seeking positive investment returns in parallel. Many are now focused on turning sustainability ambitions into execution, building market-based, data-backed, and technology-driven strategies that align climate goals with business performance.

,,2025-11-08 00:28:16+00:00,World Resources Institute,STATEMENT: Brazil Announces Pledge to Quadruple 'Sustainable Fuels',Not Available,,,,,https://www.wri.org/news/statement-brazil-announces-pledge-quadruple-sustainable-fuels,"Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025) — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil announced the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, a commitment to quadruple production and use of ‘sustainable fuels’ by 2035, along with Japan, Italy, India and others.
The pledge cites a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.

Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature.","Belém, Brazil (November 7, 2025) — At the COP30 Leaders’ Summit, Brazil announced the Belém 4X Pledge on Sustainable Fuels, a commitment to quadruple production and use of ‘sustainable fuels’ by 2035, along with Japan, Italy, India and others. The fuels mentioned in the pledge include hydrogen, biogases, biofuels, and e-fuels.

The pledge cites a new report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) that envisions a quadrupling of these fuels by 2035, including a doubling of biofuel production.

Following is a statement from Janet Ranganathan, Managing Director of Strategy, Learning and Results, World Resources Institute:

“While countries are right to transition away from fossil fuels, they also need to ensure their plans don’t trigger unintended consequences, such as more deforestation either at home or abroad. Doubling biofuel production would have significant implications for the world’s land, especially without guardrails to prevent large-scale expansion of land dedicated to biofuels, which drives ecosystem loss.

“Already today, at least 40 million hectares of cropland are used globally to grow biofuel feedstocks, an area the size of Paraguay. And the world’s land is under pressure to provide more food and wood products for a population that will grow toward 10 billion by 2050. At present rates of cropland expansion, an area nearly the size of India would be converted from nature to food production between 2020 and 2050. Increasing biofuel mandates would create significant extra pressure for land conversion.

“WRI’s global research shows that expansion of land dedicated to biofuel production is likely to have serious negative impacts on food security, nature, and climate because it competes with food production or natural ecosystems. Biofuel production on agricultural land implies trade-offs with both food production and restoring land to nature. Agricultural products are commodities in global markets, and policies that increase demand for these products will raise prices and likely lead to expansion of new cropland. Both responses are likely to have negative impacts on climate, food security, and nature. Furthermore, many models and carbon accounting frameworks undercount biofuels’ land carbon cost or miss it entirely.

“That’s why both the land and the types of biomass used for fuels matter. The pledge says that efforts to scale up fuel use must be environmentally and socially responsible. But it does not include critical caveats from the IEA report: that biofuel expansion should not further increase cropland use, and that waste and residue-based biomass potentially offer a more sustainable pathway than feedstocks grown on dedicated land—although the amounts are limited, making scalability challenging. National policies should account for these important nuances.

“All countries should develop a strategy for how best to use their limited land to advance prosperity and meet people’s growing needs for food, while achieving climate and nature goals. These strategies should align with national pledges to halt deforestation and preserve existing ecosystems. Any mandates that intensify pressure on land risk undermining those commitments.

“More locally grounded research is needed to inform these strategies. For instance, how can Brazil best use its 40 to 100 million hectares of degraded land to meet its needs for food, wood products, jobs, revenue and energy, while protecting and restoring nature and meeting climate goals? As the demands on our land grow, while the planet’s land area stays the same, evidence-based land-use planning will be essential to balance competing priorities.”",https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 21:03:00.028286

The initiatives focus on accelerating the roll-out of high-speed rail across the continent and scaling up investment in renewable and low-carbon fuels, particularly for aviation and shipping. This strategy aims to create an EU transport system that is more efficient, interconnected, accessible, clean, and resilient.

The cornerstone of the package is the new High-Speed Rail Action Plan, which sets a vision for a faster, more interoperable, and better-connected European rail network by 2040.

The plan, which builds on the existing Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T), foresees connecting major nodes at speeds of 200 km/h and above. Illustrative examples of the ambitious time savings include cutting travel from Berlin to Copenhagen from seven hours to four, and from Sofia to Athens from over 13 hours to just six. New cross-border links, such as Paris–Lisbon via Madrid, are also planned to simplify long-distance journeys.

To achieve this vision, the Commission proposes four key strands of action:

• Removing cross-border bottlenecks by setting binding timelines by 2027 and identifying options for speeds well above $250 km/h where economically viable.

• Developing a coordinated financing strategy, including a ""High-Speed Rail Deal"" through a strategic dialogue with industry and financiers to mobilise the necessary investment.

• Improving the conditions for the rail industry by enhancing cross-border ticketing, supporting a second-hand market for rolling stock, and accelerating the deployment of EU digital management systems.

• Strengthening EU-level governance to improve coordination among infrastructure managers for cross-border services and facilitate standardisation.

The second major initiative is the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which outlines a common approach to boost investment in renewable and low-carbon fuels for the aviation and waterborne sectors. To meet the binding RefuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime targets, the EU will require approximately 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels (biofuels and e-fuels) by 2035, necessitating an estimated €100 billion in total investment.

The plan details key investment measures designed to mobilise at least €2.9 billion through EU instruments by 2027, including:

• At least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels under InvestEU.

• €300 million through the European Hydrogen Bank for hydrogen-based fuels.

• €446 million from the Innovation Fund for synthetic aviation and maritime fuel projects.

• €133.5 million for fuels-related research under Horizon Europe.

Furthermore, the Commission plans to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project by the end of 2025 to mobilise at least €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 21:03:04.414541

“How do we work in a fuel that today is anywhere from three to eight times more expensive than current fuel?” At present, Sustainable Aviation Fuel makes up less than two percent of global jet fuel consumption.","On Power Struggle, Stewart Muir sat down with Geoffrey Tauvette, an engineer with more than 25 years in commercial aviation and now Executive Director of the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (C-SAF). His mission is nothing short of a revolution: to make flying sustainable without grounding an industry that supports more than 810,000 Canadian jobs.

“I’ve been in aviation for over 25 years, always in the fuel environment,” Tauvette said. “What I’m doing now is really trying to change the industry.”

The fuel that changed flight—now changing again

Conventional jet fuel, Tauvette explained, “sits a little below diesel fuel” in the refining process—roughly 10 percent of a barrel of crude. But a new generation of fuels is emerging. “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a jet fuel replacement,” he said. “It’s made from renewable materials and produces, on a lifecycle basis, way less emissions compared to a normal barrel of jet fuel.”

SAF, he says, is “the biggest solution for the industry in terms of reducing its emissions.”

The global aviation sector was one of the first to adopt decarbonization targets. Airlines have shaved weight, improved aerodynamics, and rolled out aircraft that are 10–15 percent more fuel efficient than the previous generation. But all the efficiency in the world won’t matter without a cleaner fuel source.

The cost turbulence

The catch? Price.

“Jet fuel usually represents about 25 percent of an airline’s costs,” Tauvette said. “How do we work in a fuel that today is anywhere from three to eight times more expensive than current fuel?”

At present, Sustainable Aviation Fuel makes up less than two percent of global jet fuel consumption. Yet demand is poised to soar as countries, corporations, and consumers seek low-carbon travel.

The Canadian advantage—still untapped

Tauvette argues that Canada has “all the right ingredients” to lead the SAF revolution: sustainable feedstocks, advanced refining capacity, and a market of willing airlines. “We refine hard-to-refine stuff, and this is what this is,” he said. “If we make it affordable enough, all the international airlines flying into Canada will pick it up as well.”

C-SAF outlines the immediate opportunity: fuels made from wastes like used cooking oil, as well as forest and agricultural residues that can be converted into low-carbon “biocrudes.” Down the road, carbon captured from the air or industrial processes could also be combined with renewable hydrogen to produce jet fuel with near-zero net emissions.

The problem isn’t imagination—it’s investment. “Unfortunately, we need support from the government,” Tauvette said. “Support through some form of incentive-type mechanism to help create the environment to make those investments to put the manufacturing in place.”

The runway to the future

Without clear policy, price parity, and production incentives, Canada risks being left on the tarmac while others soar ahead. As Tauvette puts it, this is the moment to act. “We have everything we need,” he said. “Now we just need the will to build it.”

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity.
While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable.
92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks.
This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.","Scientists and civil society groups are warning COP delegations and attendees about the risks posed by a rapid expansion of global biofuel demand. While often promoted as a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, biofuels, particularly those made from food and feed crops, may carry serious environmental and social consequences if their production grows unchecked.

Current demand from the road transport sector is set to rise further due to ambitious targets in aviation and shipping, including EU and national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates and the International Maritime Organization’s Net-Zero framework.

However, researchers caution that scaling up biofuel production without strict safeguards could undermine climate progress, displace communities, degrade ecosystems, and worsen food insecurity. Projections indicate that by 2030, the global cropland required for biofuels in the transport sector, excluding crop co-products, could reach 52 million hectares, a 63% increase from 2023 levels, which is roughly the size of France.

Experts note that this represents a highly inefficient use of land and agricultural resources. By comparison, only 3% of the current biofuels area would be needed to generate the same amount of energy from solar panels, which underscores the relative inefficiency of producing energy by burning crops.

While some nations may achieve marginal emissions reductions through advanced biofuels or waste-based pathways, the global trend in biofuels consumption remains deeply unsustainable. 92% of projected 2030 biofuel demand is still expected to be met by food-type feedstocks. Meanwhile, even optimistic estimates of biofuel life-cycle savings are often dwarfed by the carbon opportunity costs of not restoring land to forests or other natural systems.

The expansion of crop biofuels is not a climate solution. It is a costly detour.

… the experts highlight.

As COP30 approaches—an opportune moment of global reckoning and responsibility, the signatories call on world leaders to:

Prevent an uninhibited expansion of first-generation biofuels under international climate mechanisms or national plans;

Phase out subsidies and mandates for biofuels from food and feed crops, and redirect support to more sustainable energy solutions;

Prioritise investments in electrification and energy efficiency and sufficiency as primary strategies for decarbonizing road transport;

Prioritise land restoration and biodiversity protection over land conversion for fuel production;

Establish robust global sustainability criteria, verification procedures, and sufficient enforcement frameworks that justifiably account for indirect emissions, carbon opportunity costs, and social impacts. This is highly relevant for exploring sustainable fuel alternatives within international aviation and shipping decarbonization frameworks, such as CORSIA and IMO.

Finally, the scientists note that truly sustainable biofuels can play a limited role in decarbonising a narrow set of hard-to-electrify sectors, such as aviation, but this must not justify a blind embrace of policies that repeat past mistakes of relentless crop biofuels expansion.

The science is clear: we cannot burn our way to net zero, especially not at the expense of forests, food, and future generations. We urge you to reflect on this science in the decisions made at COP30.

“To avoid misleading consumers, airlines must refrain from using vague environmental language and ensure that any claims about future environmental performance are substantiated,” the commission said in a statement.
The announcement made in the run-up to next week’s COP30 UN climate summit in Brazil stems from a consultation between airlines, the EU executive and consumer protection groups.
The carriers concerned are Air Baltic, Air Dolomiti, Air France, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, EasyJet, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian, Ryanair, SAS, SWISS, TAP, Transavia France, Transavia CV, Volotea, Vueling and Wizz Air.
Air France no longer offers carbon offsets for flights.","BRUSSELS (AFP) — European airlines including Lufthansa, Air France and KLM have agreed to stop making misleading environmental claims about offsetting the carbon emissions from air travel, the European Commission said Friday.

The pledge from 21 carriers will oblige them to clarify that the emissions of a specific flight cannot be “neutralised, offset, or directly reduced” by contributing to climate protection projects or alternative fuels — claims the EU says amount to greenwashing.

“To avoid misleading consumers, airlines must refrain from using vague environmental language and ensure that any claims about future environmental performance are substantiated,” the commission said in a statement.

The announcement made in the run-up to next week’s COP30 UN climate summit in Brazil stems from a consultation between airlines, the EU executive and consumer protection groups.

Airlines also pledged to present carbon emission calculations in a clear and transparent manner and provide robust scientific evidence when claiming environmental improvements.

The carriers concerned are Air Baltic, Air Dolomiti, Air France, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, EasyJet, Finnair, KLM, Lufthansa, Luxair, Norwegian, Ryanair, SAS, SWISS, TAP, Transavia France, Transavia CV, Volotea, Vueling and Wizz Air.

The commitments follow a formal complaint lodged with the European Commission in June 2023 by consumer groups, which accused the aviation sector of misleading advertising practices.

The industry has begun to shift its messaging after a series of legal setbacks.

In March 2024, a Dutch court ruled against KLM in a greenwashing case, saying the airline misled consumers with vague claims about the sustainability of its flights.

A year later, a German court barred Lufthansa from advertising carbon offsetting in a way deemed deceptive.

Air France no longer offers carbon offsets for flights. Instead, it suggests passengers contribute to the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel.

“There is room to change” in the way airlines communicate, said Diane Vitry, who heads up the aviation section of the NGO Transport & Environment.

She said the ideal would be for flight ads to mention their climate impact, similar to the health warnings included on tobacco and alcohol labels.

Aviation accounts for around 3% of global carbon emissions, but its overall contribution to climate change is higher because of the release of other greenhouse gases and condensation trails at high altitudes.","https://imagedelivery.net/wKQ19LTSBT0ARz08tkssqQ/www.courthousenews.com/2025/10/klm-plane-at-amsterdam-schipol-airport.jpg/w=1300,h=731,fit=crop",N,,2025-11-07 15:16:31.122143

Shaivee Malik, Co-Founder and COO of Yotuh Energy, shared her views on the financing aspects and said, “When we are making some solutions that are battery-based, they do come with an initial higher cost. Even though the unit economics makes sense, the high capex becomes a barrier. When we are trying to reach it out to more customers, having much more ease on financing will make it more adaptable.”

Harish Pazhani, Senior Program Research Specialist, WRI India, said India has surpassed 500 GW of total installed power capacity and the key notable point here is that close to 51% of it comes from non-fossil fuel sources which include hydro and nuclear.

Fluor Investment Narrative Recap

For investors considering Fluor, belief in the company’s ability to rebound from substantial third quarter losses and legal challenges is crucial. The recent net loss of US$697 million and the class action lawsuit alleging misleading financial statements intensify scrutiny of management’s execution and risk controls, which could limit confidence in short-term catalysts like new project awards, while legal uncertainties present the biggest current risk. Whether these issues materially delay the company’s shift towards earnings growth and cash generation depends on the speed and clarity of their resolution.

Among recent developments, Fluor’s contract to engineer LanzaJet’s sustainable aviation fuel project in the UK stands out. This project reinforces Fluor's ongoing involvement in growth-oriented, low-carbon infrastructure markets and supports the narrative that a robust backlog and new awards could aid future revenue and earnings, provided the legal and financial headwinds are managed effectively.

However, with the legal uncertainties mounting around project costs and financial disclosures, it’s equally important for investors to be aware that...

The HydroFlex™ technology is a proven solution for converting a wide array of renewable feedstocks—such as fats, oils, and greases—into high-quality ""drop-in"" renewable diesel and jet fuel that is chemically identical to their petroleum-based counterparts.

Crucially, the facility will employ Topsoe's H2bridge™ solution, which is designed to recycle biogenic propane and off-gas from the HydroFlex™ process. This waste stream is converted into low-carbon hydrogen, which is then fed back into the process. This circular approach replaces the need for external, fossil-derived feedstocks for hydrogen production, leading to a substantial reduction in the overall carbon intensity of the final renewable fuels.

Christopher Efird, CEO & Chairperson of NXTClean Fuels, highlighted this competitive advantage, stating that the technologies and catalysts ""dramatically reduce the carbon intensity of our fuels, making our products among the cleanest SAF and renewable diesel supplies in the world.""

The project comes at a time of explosive growth in the sustainable fuel market. Henrik Rasmussen, Managing Director of Topsoe Americas, noted that the facility will ""significantly increase the production of SAF in the U.S."" and supports Topsoe’s role in reducing emissions within American aviation.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), SAF production is projected to more than double in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters).",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-07 12:20:54.573905

The European Commission has launched a bold new initiative to reshape the continent’s transport network, focusing on expanding high-speed rail and investing in sustainable aviation fuels. These measures are part of a larger effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve connectivity, and accelerate Europe’s transition to greener, more efficient travel. By introducing faster rail links and increasing the availability of alternative fuels, the Commission aims to enhance both cross-border rail services and aviation sustainability, ultimately driving Europe towards its long-term environmental and mobility goals.

The European Commission has taken significant steps to make travel across the continent more efficient and sustainable, unveiling new plans aimed at reducing carbon emissions while improving infrastructure. Announced on November 5, these initiatives, which include the High-Speed Rail Action Plan and the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), form part of a larger “comprehensive transport package.” These actions are designed to accelerate Europe’s high-speed rail network and foster the growth of renewable and low-carbon fuels for aviation.

The High-Speed Rail Action Plan is set to revolutionize rail travel across Europe, focusing on enhancing cross-border connections and reducing travel times on the Trans-European Transport Network by 2040. This ambitious plan aims to ensure that key destinations in the network can be reached at speeds of over 200 km/h, significantly cutting journey durations. For example, travel between Berlin and Copenhagen will be reduced to four hours, down from the current seven, while trips from Sofia to Athens will drop from 13 hours and 40 minutes to just six hours. Additionally, new high-speed rail links will connect Paris to Lisbon via Madrid and Warsaw to Tallinn.

One of the main goals of the High-Speed Rail Action Plan is to make ticketing and booking systems more seamless across borders. This includes eliminating bottlenecks, enhancing cross-border governance, and improving long-distance rail services within the EU. To fund this transformation, the European Commission has committed to developing a “coordinated financing strategy” in collaboration with member states, the rail industry, and financial backers. This effort will help mobilize the necessary investments for these ambitious upgrades.

Meanwhile, the STIP is designed to bolster Europe’s commitment to cleaner fuels. The plan focuses on increasing investment in the development of alternative aviation fuels and boosting domestic production to meet ambitious targets set under the RefuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime programs. This initiative outlines a series of measures to raise a minimum of €2.9 billion by 2027. Among the key funding allocations, €2 billion will be directed towards alternative fuels through the EU’s ‘InvestEU’ program. Additionally, the European Hydrogen Bank will contribute €300 million to support hydrogen-based fuels for aviation and shipping. There is also a provision of €446 million from the EU’s Innovation Fund for synthetic aviation and maritime fuel projects, as well as €133.5 million to fund research and innovation in fuel technologies.

An exciting development tied to the STIP is the creation of the ‘eSAF Early Movers Coalition,’ which aims to raise €500 million by the end of 2025. This pilot project will help support synthetic aviation fuel production, furthering Europe’s push to decarbonize its aviation sector.

The response from industry groups has been largely positive, with the Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) expressing support for the initiatives. During a meeting in Brussels, the GBTA’s European advisory board chairperson met with EU policymakers and welcomed the adoption of the STIP. However, the association also emphasized the importance of fast-tracking the “CountEmissionsEU” initiative, which aims to provide accurate, transparent, and comparable emissions data across all modes of transport. The GBTA believes this will play a crucial role in helping the industry measure its progress toward sustainability goals.

While the aviation sector also welcomed the STIP’s announcement, there were concerns raised about the funding allocations. Industry groups such as Airlines for Europe, ACI Europe, the European Regions Airline Association (ERA), and the Civil Air Navigation Services Organisation (CANSO) pointed out that the proposed funding seemed insufficient given the scale of investment required to accelerate the decarbonization of the aviation industry. According to these organizations, reaching the EU’s net-zero aviation target will require an investment of approximately €100 billion by 2035.

In addition, the aviation groups called for more clarity on the implementation of a ‘Book & Claim’ system, which would ensure that alternative aviation fuels are accessible at all EU airports. This mechanism would provide the flexibility needed to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel is available to airlines regardless of their operating base.

The European Commission’s ambitious initiatives mark a significant step toward transforming Europe’s transport landscape, focusing not only on expanding rail connectivity but also on ensuring a cleaner, greener future for aviation. However, the road ahead may require further investment and collaboration between policymakers and industry players to meet the continent’s long-term sustainability goals. The success of these plans will largely depend on how effectively they are implemented and whether the proposed funding levels are sufficient to drive the necessary changes across both sectors.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/freepik__create-an-ultrarealisti-10-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:56:24.231851

In 2024, following the BEUC complaint, the EU Commission and the Network of Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Authorities said that they had identified several types of potentially misleading practices by the airlines, including creating the incorrect impression that additional fees to finance climate projects or the use of alternative fuels can reduce or fully counterbalance CO2 emissions, using the term “sustainable aviation fuel” without clearly justifying the fuels’ environmental impact, using terms such as “green”, “sustainable” or “responsible” in an absolute way, and claiming that the airline is moving toward environmental performance such as net zero emissions without clear and verifiable commitments, targets and an independent monitoring system.

Additional practices identified included presenting a “calculator” of a flight’s emissions without providing scientific proof on the reliability of the calculation, and presenting consumers with a comparison of the CO2 emissions of flights without providing sufficient information on the elements behind the comparisons.

The Commission and CPC network launched a dialogue with the airlines, asking them to outline proposals to bring their practices in line with EU consumer law, and warned that they may face enforcement actions by the CPC authorities if they fail to take steps to solve the concerns, including sanctions.

Under the new agreement, each of the airlines have committed to stop claiming that the CO2 emissions of a specific flight could be neutralized, offset, or directly reduced by consumer financial contributions to climate protection projects or alternative aviation fuels.

Additional commitments discussed with the airlines included using the term “sustainable aviation fuels” only if substantiated with appropriate clarifications, refraining from the use of vague green language or terminology, providing more information on claims about future environmental performance – such as achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions – with clear timelines, achievable steps, and the types of emissions concerned, ensuring that CO2 emissions calculations are displayed in a clear and transparent way, and providing sufficient scientific evidence and information to support claims of improved environmental impact.

The Commission said that the national consumer protection authorities will monitor the airlines’ implementation of the commitments along the timeline communicated by each airline, adding that they may may also proceed with enforcement measures against airlines that have not provided sufficient commitments or fail to correctly implement the commitments.

Aviation remains one of the most challenging sectors to decarbonise, and the UK’s pathway to net zero will depend on scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. The SAF mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) are the key policy instruments which form the backbone of this effort. These instruments have been areas of policy consistency across the previous Conservative and current Labour governments.

The SAF mandate

The SAF mandate is a policy mechanism designed to secure demand for SAF by:

Obliging fuel suppliers in the UK to supply an increasing proportion of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix

Incentivising SAF supply through the award of tradeable certificates with a cash value – the number of certificates will be issued in proportion to the level of GHG emission reductions achieved by the fuel delivered.

To qualify under the SAF mandate, fuels must achieve a minimum of 40% reduction in GHG emissions, measured on a lifecycle basis.

The SAF mandate consists of two obligations: the main obligation and the power-to-liquid obligation. The main obligation begins at 2% of the total fossil jet fuel supplied in 2025 and will increase annually to 10% in 2030, and then to 22% in 2040. The power-to-liquid obligation takes effect in 2028 at 0.2% of total jet fuel demand and will increase to 3.5% of total jet fuel demand in 2040. Both obligations include a buy-out mechanism that facilitates compliance when suppliers are unable to secure a supply of SAF.

To provide policy support for SAF technologies that do not rely on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and to mitigate the risk that the aviation sector crowds out other sources of demand for first-generation biofuels, the SAF Mandate caps the contribution of HEFA to the main obligation at 100% of SAF demand in 2025-26, tapering to 71% in 2030 and 35% in 2040.

The UK government has indicated that the 2040 SAF targets will remain at the same level beyond 2040, but will be kept under review and updated to reflect how the market evolves. Early reports for 2025 suggest that the uptake of SAF has fallen below targets, and airlines are voicing concerns about limited supply, potential buy-out liabilities, and competitive disadvantages compared to carriers whose route networks leave them less exposed to the UK and EU SAF mandates.

The UK government estimates that the SAF mandate could deliver up to 6.3 megatonnes of carbon savings annually by 2040.

The Revenue Certainty Mechanism

While the SAF mandate is expected to secure demand for SAF, it does not guarantee SAF producers a fixed price for their product – a key requirement both for scaling up production beyond the inherent limits determined by the availability of qualifying HEFA and for bridging the cost gap between production and sale. The RCM is intended to address these issues for producers of 2nd and 3rd generation SAF (which exclude HEFA).

The RCM is expected to be based on the contract for differences scheme familiar to the financing markets from its use in low-carbon electricity generation. It would guarantee SAF producers a fixed price over a defined period, funded by the fuel suppliers who are subject to the SAF mandate. The legislation for the RCM is progressing through Parliament. However, much of the important detail remains unresolved (notably, how the reference price will be calculated in the absence of a liquid SAF market).

The RCM will be key to the investability of 2nd and 3rd generation SAF projects, but experience from the UK’s clean hydrogen and CCS markets shows that a revenue mechanism alone does not ensure rapid deployment. Developers in those sectors have reported frustration over the slow rollout of funding, uncertainty regarding project timelines, permitting delays, and infrastructure gaps (to name a few).

The SAF market in the UK is at a critical early growth phase, full of potential but facing structural and logistical challenges. By applying insights from early clean hydrogen and CCS projects, we think the UK government can establish a clear flightpath for sustainable aviation.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/iStock-1354153431.jpg,N,,2025-11-07 11:56:47.488992

By the Federal Aviation Administration’s unprecedented order to scale back flights nationwide because of the record-long government shutdown took effect Friday morning, with some passengers trying to figure out backup travel plans.

Airlines scrambled to adjust their schedules and began canceling flights Thursday in anticipation of the FAA’s official order, while travelers with plans for the weekend and beyond waited nervously to learn if their flights would take off as scheduled.

Airlines also planned cancellations into the weekend, directing passengers to check apps to learn their flight status.The 40 airports selected by the FAA span more than two dozen states. The FAA said the reductions would start at 4% and ramp up to 10% by Nov. 14. They are to be in effect between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. and impact all commercial airlines.

The agency said the cutbacks are necessary to relieve pressure on air traffic controllers who’ve been working without pay for more than a month. Many are pulling six-day work weeks with mandatory overtime, and increasing numbers of them have begun calling out as the financial strain and exhaustion mount.

Airlines said they would try to minimize impact on customers. Some planned to focus on slashing routes to and from small and medium-size cities. Carriers are required to refund customers whose flights are cancelled but not to cover secondary costs such as food and hotel accommodations unless a delay or cancellation results from a contributing factor that is within the control of the airlines, according to the Department of Transportation.

Industry analyst Henry Harteveldt warned that the reductions will “have a noticeable impact across the U.S. air transportation system.” More than 815 flights have been called off nationwide, according to FlightAwareDelta Air Lines said it would scratch roughly 170 flights Friday, and American Airlines planned to cut 220 a day through Monday.

With the country expected to move from the world’s fifth-largest aviation market to the third by 2030, the study outlines a clear pathway for India to take a central role in global SAF supply.

The report highlights India’s substantial availability of feedstock, including more than 680 million metric tonnes of agricultural residue, 3.4 million metric tonnes of used cooking oil, and over 1,800 crore litres of ethanol production capacity. This combination, it said, places India in an advantageous position to scale up SAF production while supporting rural economies and reducing dependence on imported fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel can lower lifecycle emissions by as much as 80 percent, making it one of the most impactful near-term tools available to decarbonise aviation. The report points to the government’s phased blending targets 1 percent by 2027, 2 percent by 2028 and 5 percent by 2030 as key drivers that will accelerate industry-wide adoption.

Beyond its environmental benefits, the report emphasises the economic upside. Increased SAF production could save billions in fuel imports, generate large-scale green jobs, and raise earnings for farming communities through the sale of waste and agricultural by-products. India is also well placed to export SAF to high-value markets such as the European Union, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East.

The study stresses the need for coordinated action across government agencies, investors, technology providers, oil marketing companies, and airlines. Experts involved in the report noted that India’s progress will depend on building efficient supply chains, ensuring long-term purchase agreements, and aligning policy incentives with industry needs. They said India’s wide range of biomass and waste-derived feedstock provides a strong foundation for scaling production, provided the right frameworks are put in place.

Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu, Minister of Civil Aviation, Govt of India said that the global aviation industry stands at crossroads between rapid growth along with the climate concerns. The sector continues to expand faster than the overall economy and most other transport segments, driven by globalization and growing passenger demand. With an annual growth rate of 6.7%, nearly 10 million passenger trips are expected in 2025. “Aviation has truly become the growth engine for mobility and businesses worldwide,” he added.

Addressing the ‘India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit’, organized by FICCI, jointly with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, the minister said that the growing energy needs of the aviation sector demand greater clarity, commitment and collaboration from all stakeholders. “Our ATF consumption is projected to reach 15-16 million ton by 2030 and 30-31 million ton by 2040. The solution here for all of us is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). With the potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuels, SAF offers a direct way for all of us to reduce carbon footprint in aviation sector,” he stated.

Speaking on the potential of SAF, the Minister further stated that the government is in the process of drafting a ‘Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy’. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed-up the SAF movement and we are committed to soon releasing the SAF policy,” he emphasized.

Mr Kinjarapu also stated that as agricultural powerhouse with over 750 million ton of biomass, India has the capacity to become the global leader in SAF production. SAF will not only help in addressing the challenge of growth versus sustainability but will also benefit with its huge scale impact by reducing crude oil import bill by $ 5-7 billion every year along with creating 1 million green jobs across SAF value chain.

The Minister said that in the last 9 years, India has added 90 airports, addition of 400 aircrafts in the fleet along with increasing the scheduled flight movements by 78 per cent. “We plan to expand our airport network by 50 in the next 5 years and 200 in next 20-25 years along with a growth projection of 500 million annual passengers with growth rate of 10-12 per cent in coming 10 years,” he noted. With this growth, India’s aviation share in transport emissions is projected to rise from 5 per cent to 8-10 per cent by 2030, added Kinjarapu.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, DG, DGCA said that decarbonization of the aviation sector is a global endeavor. It requires shared responsibility, mutual respect and a spirit of solidarity and India is committed to being a constructive, proactive and principal partner in this journey. “Our ambition is to achieve 5 per cent SAF blending target 2030 which is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he added.

Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia said SAF is also a transformative opportunity for India. “For India, the relevance of SAF extends far beyond just environmental targets- it can be a powerful economic enabler. By developing a domestic SAF industry, India can immediately and effectively enhance its energy security and sovereignty over its fuel supply chain,” he added.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee & Vice President and Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney said that India’s aviation journey is unstoppable. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. SAF alone could be responsible for reducing emissions by up to two-thirds, making it uniquely positioned not only to help India cut down emissions but also to take a leading role globally and become an export hub, he added.

During the event, FICCI-KPMG Thought Leadership Report was released.

Air India Crash: Supreme Court on Friday said the preliminary report on Air India fatal crash that killed hundreds does not blame the pilot. The top court said it will hear the plea by pilot's father, who is asking for an independent probe, on November 10.

The Supreme Court on Friday said no one blamed the chief pilot of the Air India Dreamliner for the June 12 crash, which claimed 260 lives, and asked his 91-year-old father not to carry any emotional burden.

""There is no insinuation against him even in the preliminary report,"" a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi said, emphasising that if necessary, the court will clarify that the pilot is not to be blamed for the ""unfortunate"" plane crash.

The top court issued notice to the Centre and the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on a plea of Pushkaraj Sabharwal, the father of deceased pilot Captain Sumeet Sabharwal.

Pushkaraj Sabharwal and the Federation of Indian Pilots have moved the Supreme Court for a court-monitored inquiry headed by a former apex court judge into the crash of Air India flight AI171 in Ahmedabad.

""First of all, it was an unfortunate plane crash and secondly, you should not carry a burden on yourself that your son is being blamed. The pilot is not to be blamed for the plane crash. It was an accident,"" the bench told senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayanan, appearing for Pushkaraj Sabharwal.

Live Events

""No one in the county believes that it was the fault of the pilot,"" it said.

Sankaranarayanan said it all started after US publication Wall Street Journal put out a news report pointing to errors on the part of the pilot that led to the plane crash and citing unnamed government sources.

The bench said, ""It was a nasty reporting only to blame India. We are not bothered by foreign media reports. No one in the country believes that it was the fault of the pilot.""

Sankaranarayanan said, ""I am aggrieved because my son was attacked.""

Justice Bagchi said if the petitioner is aggrieved by the foreign media reports, then, with respect, his remedy lies in American court, where he can file a suit.

""Your angst is understandable but there is clear incongruity between public perception and the factual position,"" Justice Bagchi added.

The judges read out a paragraph from the preliminary report of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Board (AAIB) issued on July 12 and said nowhere does it state that the pilot is to be blamed and it only refers to the conversation between him and his co-pilot.

""There is just a mention of the cockpit recorder where one pilot asked whether the fuel was cut off by the other and the other pilot said no. There's no suggestion of any fault in that report. There is no question of apportioning blame on them,"" Justice Bagchi said.

Sankaranarayanan pointed out that there were persistent safety issues involving Boeing aircraft globally and the Ahmedabad crash must be viewed in that larger context.

""The scope of the AAIB investigation is not to blame but to suggest preventive measures. If necessary, we will clarify that the pilot cannot be blamed,"" the bench said.

""We are a country of around 142 crore people and none of them believes the blame has to go to the pilot. Whatever could be the reason for the tragedy, it is not the pilots,"" it added.

Sankaranarayanan said that they want an independent probe into the matter and the preliminary report prepared after the tragedy was not based on an independent investigation.

Justice Bagchi said the investigation into the accident was conducted according to the process.

""If you challenge the investigation, you have to challenge the statutory provisions of the (Aircraft) Act itself,"" the judge said.

Sankaranarayanan said, ""These pilots are offering their services to the nation. Such kind of insinuations... that's very sad.""

The bench listed the matter for further hearing on November 10, along with other pending petitions on the crash.

Pushkaraj Sabharwal has sought a ""fair, transparent and technically robust"" investigation into the tragic incident.

He said his son had an ""unblemished career spanning over 30 years, with 15,638 hours of incident-free flying, including 8,596 hours on Boeing 787-8 aircraft, without a single reported lapse or incident causing fatalities or otherwise"".

The petition, filed through AP&J Chambers on October 10, made Union Ministry of Civil Aviation, DGCA and AAIB respondents.

The plea seeks directions for the constitution of an independent committee, also comprising aviation and technical experts, to probe the crash.

The approach of the investigation has resulted in a failure to adequately examine, or rule out, other more plausible technical and procedural factors relating to Boeing that could have contributed to the tragic incident, the plea said.

""An incomplete and prejudiced inquiry, without identification of the exact cause of the accident, endangers the lives of future passengers and undermines aviation safety at large, causing a violation of Article 21 of the Constitution,"" it said.

The probe team is dominated by officers from DGCA and the state aviation authorities whose procedures, oversight and possible lapses are directly implicated in the investigation, it added.

The ill-fated aircraft took off from Ahmedabad for London Gatwick but crashed within minutes, impacting the BJ Medical College hostel located less than a nautical mile from the end of the runway.

The Emergency Locator Transmitter failed to activate, and both the pilot-in-command Captain Sumeet Sabharwal and co-pilot Captain Clive Kunder lost their lives in the crash, the plea said.

Union Minister for Civil Aviation recently said that India will soon release a national policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), aligns with India targets Net Zero by 2070.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – Refers to aviation fuel derived from non-fossil sources, such as agricultural residue, municipal solid waste, used cooking oil, etc.

It offers a life-cycle carbon emission reduction of up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Global Targets – 5% CO₂ emissions reduction by 2030 and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

India’s target – Blending targets of 1% by 2027, 2% by 2028 and 5% by 2030 for international flights under International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO)’s Carbon Offsetting & Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) programme.

India’s Biomass Capacity – 750 million tonnes of total biomass availability, in that 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

SAF requirement – 1% blending by 2027 - 30 million litres, 2% target for 2028 - 62 million litres.

Current domestic production capacity – Domestic oil manufacturing companies collectively have 70 million litres/year production capacity.

Public-Private Collaboration – Airbus–Gati Shakti Vishwavidyalaya (GSV) signed a Joint Study Agreement (JSA), focused on converting municipal solid waste into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Quick Fact

The European Commission has unveiled the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, a strategic roadmap designed to mobilise at least 2.9 billion euro by 2027 for renewable and low carbon fuels in aviation and maritime transport. The package signals unwavering policy stability, a factor research shows is more valuable to investors than generous subsidies. By confirming long term fuel blending mandates up to 2050, the Commission turns regulatory pressure into a clear commercial opportunity.

How the money will flow

· InvestEU will underwrite two billion euros in loan guarantees, lowering borrowing costs for first-of-a-kind refineries.

· The European Hydrogen Bank is reserving three hundred million euro to reward producers that transform green hydrogen into aviation fuel.

· The Innovation Fund and Horizon Europe add nearly six hundred million euro for large demonstration plants and science based breakthroughs.

A useful detail is that every programme now shares a single application template, saving developers months of duplicated paperwork.

Making projects bankable

Beyond grants, the Plan introduces a double sided auction platform that matches fuel makers and airlines or ship operators under fifteen year contracts. The mechanism converts volatile feedstock prices into predictable cash flow, improving debt service coverage ratios that lenders scrutinise. This financial engineering, borrowed from offshore wind auctions, could cut the weighted cost of capital by up to two percentage points.

A non-obvious advantage

Synthetic fuel facilities will be located close to existing pipeline corridors so that captured carbon dioxide can be reused and transported cheaply. This co siting approach quietly converts a potential waste stream into a revenue stream and shortens permitting timelines.

Conclusion

With a blended approach of grants, guarantees, and market design, Europe is turning climate ambition into investable reality. The Plan fast tracks technology deployment, strengthens energy autonomy, and keeps European innovators at the forefront of global green transport.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-7.svg,N,,2025-11-07 10:56:35.856335

New SAF, ethanol, and waste-to-fuel plants need major investment

Ethiopia’s Ministry of Water and Energy (MoWE) has set mandatory biofuel blending targets for road fuels, ethanol-gasoline and biodiesel-diesel, and for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2035.

The measure, reported by the press on Nov. 3, 2025, stems from a revised national biofuels strategy developed in June 2025 with support from the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB). The strategy seeks to cut the country’s reliance on imported hydrocarbons, develop a local production industry, and set separate targets for ethanol, biodiesel, and SAF.

Implementing the plan will require raising hundreds of millions of dollars to build local industrial capacity. According to the World Bank’s June 2025 report Fueling Africa’s Flight, the strategy requires new industrial plants capable of converting molasses and other agricultural residues into liquid fuels.

For aviation, an Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) plant with a capacity of 2,000 barrels per day would require about $376 million in investment and could meet around 6% of national kerosene demand. The report also highlights the potential to convert municipal solid waste into liquid fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process (MSW-FT), which would cost roughly $547 million for a comparable capacity.

At the same time, the ministry plans to rehabilitate ethanol distilleries linked to public sugar factories and build new ones to boost domestic ethanol production, allowing blends of 10% to 20% in road fuel.

These investments aim to ease a major financial burden: Ethiopia’s fuel import bill rose by 14.6% to $4 billion in the 2022/2023 fiscal year, accounting for 23.1% of total merchandise imports, according to the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE). This foreign currency spending puts pressure on the balance of payments.

He confirmed that the Ministry is finalising the SAF Policy to accelerate adoption. “The Ministry has been taking robust steps to speed up the SAF movement, and we are committed to releasing the SAF policy soon,” he stated.

Highlighting India’s potential, Kinjarapu said that as an agricultural powerhouse generating over 750 million tonnes of biomass, the country can become a global leader in SAF production. This transition, he said, could reduce India’s crude oil import bill by USD 5–7 billion annually and generate around one million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

Over the past nine years, India has added 90 airports and 400 aircraft, while scheduled flight movements have risen by 78 per cent . The government plans to add 50 airports in the next five years and 200 more over the next two decades, with passenger traffic projected to reach 500 million annually.

Faiz Ahmed Kidwai, Director General of Civil Aviation, noted that decarbonising aviation is a shared global responsibility. “Our ambition to achieve a 5 per cent SAF blending target by 2030 is not just a goal but a declaration of intent to lead by example,” he said.

Adding an industry perspective, Jurgen Westermeier, Chairman, FICCI National Civil Aviation Committee and President & MD, Airbus India & South Asia, called SAF a transformative opportunity. “For India, SAF goes beyond environmental targets—it can enhance energy security and sovereignty,” he said.

Ashish Saraf, Co-Chairman, FICCI Civil Aviation Committee and Vice President & Country Head India, Pratt & Whitney, added, “Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the cornerstone of India’s Net Zero aviation story. It can reduce emissions by up to two-thirds, positioning India as a global SAF hub.”

Neste's investment in the Singapore refinery marked a pivotal milestone as the company’s first major renewable products focused investment in Asia and outside of Finland. In 2010, Neste’s refinery in Singapore commenced operations as the world's largest renewable diesel refinery.

A subsequent expansion in 2023 integrated sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production capabilities into the refinery operations, elevating the total production capacity of renewable products to 2.6 million tons annually, encompassing renewable diesel, SAF, and renewable raw materials for polymers and chemicals.

“The Singapore refinery's 15th anniversary is a testament to Neste’s refining expertise and the dedication of our talented employees in Singapore. Their commitment to pioneering renewable solutions and our strategic growth in the region make this refinery a cornerstone of our global operations, giving us an advantage in global competition and enabling us to continue helping our customers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions,” said Jukka Kanerva, senior vice-president, refining, renewable products at Neste.

Neste’s Porvoo oil refinery in Finland began operations in 1965 with the purpose to secure Finland’s oil supply. After its expansion, it became the largest oil refinery in the Nordics already in the 1970s.

The basis for Neste’s fuel innovations was built at the Porvoo refinery. Lead-free and sulphur-free fuels were Neste’s first steps towards improving products' environmental performance, and in the 1990s, Neste’s NEXBTL technology for renewables production was developed and NEXBTL refining units started-up in 2007 and 2009 at the Porvoo refinery.

“The Porvoo refinery is one of the most complex refineries in Europe. It was built that way to ensure flexibility in producing more than 100 products from a variety of raw materials, including different crude oil qualities.

SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that meets sustainability criteria.

The minister urged private players to participate in SAF production alongside oil companies. Globally, the demand for SAF is projected at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

The minister stressed that all industry players will have a say before the policy is officially finalized.

India aims to achieve 1% SAF blending in jet fuel by 2027, 2% by 2028, and 5% by 2030. The fuel can be used as a drop-in substitute in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

India’s aviation market, currently the fifth-largest globally, is projected to become the third-largest by 2030, positioning the country as a potential global leader in SAF production. Domestic carriers have already placed orders for over 1,700 aircraft, reflecting rapid market growth.

Highlighting India’s potential, Naidu noted that the country has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

He added that SAF production could increase farmers’ incomes by 10–15 %, reduce crude oil import bills by $5–7 billion annually, and generate over 1 million green jobs across the SAF value chain.

A report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and KPMG released on Thursday stated that India has the raw materials to scale SAF production, including over 680 million tonnes of agricultural residue, 3.4 million tonnes of used cooking oil, and ethanol capacity exceeding 1,800 crore litres.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, making it the most immediate and scalable lever for decarbonizing aviation.

To further promote sustainability, Airbus India chief Jurgen Westermeier suggested integrating corporate spending on airlines’ voluntary SAF programs under the government’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) framework.

Under the Companies Act, certain profitable entities must allocate at least 2% of their annual profit to CSR activities.

Fluor Corporation has been awarded the contract to conduct the front-end engineering and design of a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industrial project in northern England. The initiative, named Project Speedbird, is led by LanzaJet in partnership with British Airways. The contract value has not been disclosed and will be recognised in the third quarter.

A technology based on second-generation ethanol

The facility will be located in Teesside, selected for its industrial infrastructure and access to a skilled workforce. The project will deploy LanzaJet’s proprietary Alcohol-to-Jet technology, converting ethanol from agricultural residues and woody biomass into SAF. Annual output will exceed 90,000 tonnes, including SAF and renewable diesel.

British Airways plans to use the fuel to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions by around 230,000 tonnes per year, equivalent to the emissions from 26,000 domestic flights. The site development marks a step forward in the industrial scale-up of SAF solutions in the United Kingdom.

A strategic partnership for commercial-scale deployment

Fluor Corporation will serve as engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) provider. The group will contribute its expertise in the design and delivery of complex industrial projects. LanzaJet views the collaboration as a demonstration of its commitment to scaling renewable fuels technologies.

Project Speedbird joins a growing portfolio of commercial-scale developments led by LanzaJet in the alternative fuels sector. The company is currently developing several similar facilities to meet the growing demand for low-carbon aviation fuel.

However, costs of feedstocks and new infrastructure to produce sustainable aviation fuel makes it currently two to three times more expensive to produce than fossil jet fuel.

SAF certificates are a way for companies to support sustainable aviation fuel even if they don’t physically use the fuel itself.","Aviation connects people and goods across the globe, driving more than US $4.1 trillion in annual turnover – around 3.9% of global GDP. Yet these personal and economic benefits come with a cost. Aviation accounts for over 2% of global emissions and as demand for aviation grows, it’s more important than ever to look for solutions.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) – a biofuel made from renewable feedstocks like agricultural waste fats, oils, greases and certain cover crops – offers the fastest path to decabonising flight, with the potential to cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle.

To scale this solution, innovation must extend beyond the fuel itself. New market tools and financial mechanisms are helping bridge the gap between limited supply and growing demand. SAF certificates and Book and Claim systems are redefining how companies can invest in cleaner flight – unlocking capital, building market confidence and accelerating aviation’s journey to net zero.

The solution and challenge of sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel is a drop-in fuel solution, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without any modifications, and it has already safely powered over 900,000 flights, according to the Aviation Transport Action Group.

However, costs of feedstocks and new infrastructure to produce sustainable aviation fuel makes it currently two to three times more expensive to produce than fossil jet fuel. And, since airlines operate on thin margins, it’s difficult for them to pay for a premium product like SAF. These challenges have slowed the capital investments necessary to achieve economies of scale and bring down prices. In 2024, sustainable aviation fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of all aviation fuel and was available at only a fraction of the world’s airports.

But airlines aren’t the only players that matter here. Some of the biggest sustainable aviation fuel customers in recent years have been corporations looking to address the emissions from flying their people and goods around the world. Their involvement has led to game changing decarbonisation mechanisms in use today.

New market tools and financial mechanisms to grow SAF demand

Two tools in particular have become vital to expanding sustainable aviation fuel demand and scaling the industry: SAF certificates (SAFc) and Book and Claim. SAF certificates are a way for companies to support sustainable aviation fuel even if they don’t physically use the fuel itself. For example, while SAF might not yet be readily available at all airports, SAF certificates allow companies to nonetheless purchase and claim the emissions reduction value of SAF against its own aviation emissions, while the actual fuel might be used elsewhere. SAFc are also known as ‘insets’ because the emissions and mitigation occur within the same sector. This model helps to scale the demand and investment in sustainable aviation fuel, even before wide physical distribution is readily available.

Book and Claim makes it possible to track both the physical fuel and its environmental attributes, just like a bank digitally tracks currency transactions. The fuel and the environmental attributes are tracked on a transparent SAFc registry from the time they are created until they are claimed, or retired, by the purchaser. With this model, multiple customers can share the cost premium, further expanding the market and lowering the price for everyone.

These tools were originally conceived and developed by the World Economic Forum and Rocky Mountain Institute, two organisations focused on market-based ways to mitigate climate change. The theory holds that corporations with strong balance sheets and the ability to commit to longer-term contracts will demonstrate durable demand, which in turn gives investors the confidence to finance new projects, ultimately growing supply.

Leading the commercialisation and partnering on SAF contracts

Verified emission reduction tools like SAFc bring the right customers, who want to cut emissions, to the table. World Energy recognises the potential of these measures and took steps to commercialise these tools in 2023 by partnering with first movers such as Microsoft, DHL and Boston Consulting Group on long-term SAFc contracts. These collaborations focused on ensuring the integrity of the SAF emissions reductions with a trustworthy ecosystem of standard setters, auditors and digital registries.

To date, World Energy SAFc contracts alone, including those which run years into the future, add up to about 2.9 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) reduced. That’s equal to flying more than 9.7 million economy class passengers from Heathrow, London, to JFK, New York, without CO2 emissions.

Others have followed suit. The Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA) achieved a milestone in 2024 by aggregating decarbonisation demand from nearly 20 companies to abate about 500,000 MTCO2e, bringing a historic total of US $200 million into the current SAF industry. Much more work is needed, but the growth of SAFc registries reflects the increasing recognition that these tools can accelerate decarbonising the aviation industry.

Opportunity for action across industries

The system to use insets and Book and Claim to power corporate investment in high value climate solutions is most mature in the aviation sector, but it’s taking root in other hard-to-abate sectors like cement, steel, maritime shipping and rail cargo. We like to say that this approach will eventually decarbonise everything from cars to coffee cups.

There are still gaps to fill. Reliable public policies, uniform standards for sustainability and formal acceptance of these tools by carbon accounting leaders are essential to ensuring robust, effective action. But when it comes to the trillions of investment dollars needed to scale new infrastructure, bringing corporate customers for Scope 3 decarbonisation into the market is one of the surest ways to demonstrate bankable demand for large investors. First movers have shown how to put the SAF approach to use. The door is wide open for the next wave of companies to do the same.

2025 is a critical year for the Paris Agreement. Ten years on, we need to rethink how we frame the challenge. And seeing challenges differently is what business and we are all about.

The report, Sustainable Skies – Positioning India as a Global SAF Hub, outlines a framework for enabling India’s aviation sector to decarbonise and lead global SAF production.

According to the report, SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel. However, the cost of SAF remains two to five times higher than standard aviation turbine fuel (ATF).

Global context: aviation’s rising emissions challenge

Aviation accounts for about 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions, and without decarbonisation, this share could rise to 20 per cent by 2050. As of 2023, international aviation contributed 58 per cent of total CO₂ emissions from the sector.

Globally, around 120,000 flights operate each day, including commercial, cargo, and private aircraft. In 2024, global air travel reached 9.5 billion passengers, surpassing pre-pandemic levels.

Commercial aviation consumes over 70 per cent of total ATF worldwide, with flights longer than 2,600 km accounting for 50 per cent of emissions, despite representing less than 15 per cent of total flights.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel has emerged as one of the most viable levers to decouple aviation growth from carbon intensity,” the FICCI-KPMG report stated. “It enables up to 80 per cent lifecycle emission reduction while integrating seamlessly into today’s aircraft, fuel infrastructure, and supply chains.”

India’s aviation landscape: growth and opportunity

India recorded approximately 239 million air passengers in FY2025, making it the fifth-largest aviation market globally by passenger volume.

As of 2025, the country has 163 operational airports, with plans to expand to over 350 airports by 2047, including 50 new airports in the next five years.

Advt

Domestic passenger traffic is projected to reach 172–176 million by the end of FY2025–26, growing 4–6 per cent year-on-year.

The report notes that India’s growing air traffic will increase its dependence on aviation fuel, but also offers the scale and feedstock diversity needed to develop a self-sustaining SAF industry.

Global SAF production and trends

Global SAF production stood at 600 million litres in 2023, increased to 1.3 billion litres in 2024, and is projected to double again to 2.7 billion litres in 2025.

Currently, HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology accounts for 95 per cent of global SAF production, making it the dominant production pathway. Despite the growth, SAF represented just 0.3 per cent of total global jet fuel consumption in 2024.

The report cites policy and investment momentum across major economies:

1. The ICAO’s Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) targets net-zero aviation by 2050.

2. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) provide incentives for SAF production.

India’s potential as a global SAF hub

The report identifies five foundational pillars for India’s transition into a major SAF-producing nation:

1. Policy architecture – phased mandates, fiscal incentives, financial de-risking, and feedstock mobilisation.

2. Infrastructure readiness – refinery co-location, airport retrofits, cluster-based SAF ecosystems, and digitally integrated logistics corridors.

3. Carbon market alignment – monetisation through SAF-linked credits, robust monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), and compliance frameworks.

4. Technology advancement – repurposing ethanol assets for Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) conversion, scaling HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) technologies, and forming global certification partnerships.

5. Export potential – positioning India as a trusted SAF hub with certified clusters and access to premium markets.

“Realising India’s potential as a global hub for SAF will require a holistic systems-level approach — one that integrates strategic policy design, innovative business models, and coordinated industry action,” the report noted.

Economic implications and strategic benefits

A 10 per cent SAF blend in India could offset billions of dollars in annual aviation fuel imports and generate tens of thousands of rural and industrial jobs.

The report highlights that India’s established refining capacity, large bioenergy base, and energy transition policies make it well-placed to scale domestic SAF production.

It adds that developing a local SAF industry could also reduce crude import dependence, enhance rural incomes, and create green industrial value chains.

“Beyond emissions reduction, SAF symbolises the convergence of industrial policy, energy security, and climate leadership,” the report stated. “It bridges India’s aviation ambitions with its net-zero commitments.”

Outlook and challenges

While India holds potential to lead in SAF production, meeting the CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) targets will require coordinated action.

India must produce 53 million litres of SAF for a 1 per cent blend by 2027 and 290 million litres for a 5 per cent blend by 2030 for international flights alone.

The high production cost, limited supply chains, and feedstock aggregation remain near-term challenges, but the report notes that the economic and strategic case for SAF remains strong.

Woranate Laprabang, chief executive of Vietjet Thailand, said the Bangkok-Phu Quoc route started using the SAF blend yesterday, with usage expected to expand to other routes next year, such as from Bangkok to Cam Ranh and Danang.

He said SAF could reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared with the commonly used A-1 jet fuel.

Following the International Civil Aviation Organization's standard, the airline aims to use SAF blending of 5% across all routes by 2030, helping to reduce carbon emissions by 153,000 tonnes over the next six years.

The airline plans to sign a memorandum of understanding with PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc to ensure sufficient supply in the future.

Even though SAF costs more than twice the price of Jet A-1, it should not significantly impact passenger airfares as the blending portion is only 1%, he said.

With its entire fleet expected to change to Boeing B737-8s, he said the new aircraft model would cut fuel consumption by more than 15% compared to existing Airbus A320s.

However, the first delivery has been postponed four times this year, with the latest obstacle stemming from the US government shutdown, which is now the longest in American history.

Mr Woranate said the airline has been told that the first two planes would be delivered this month.

These planes will take 2-3 weeks for registration and should be ready to operate before Christmas this year.

The airline hopes to receive another five aircraft in December, and another two in January, a month behind schedule.

For the whole of next year, the airline should receive 13 new planes, followed by more than 10 jets in 2027 to fulfil its goal of having 50 aircraft by 2028.

As thousands of passengers were impacted by rescheduled flights due to delayed delivery, including direct routes from Bangkok to Tokyo (Narita) and Osaka, Mr Woranate said the airline would ensure that those tickets were fully refunded or rerouted to other connecting flights on Vietjet networks.

Speaking at an industry forum, Jürgen Westermeier, President and Managing Director of Airbus for India and South Asia, said voluntary Saf programmes being launched by Indian airlines offer a tangible way for corporates to participate in decarbonising aviation. “These are measurable, outcome-based investments in sustainability. Recognising them under CSR would encourage greater corporate participation and accelerate India’s shift towards cleaner skies,” he said.

Saf, or Sustainable Aviation Fuel, refers to renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets established environmental standards. It can cut lifecycle carbon emissions from flights by up to 80 per cent compared with conventional jet fuel, according to industry estimates.

Corporate Role In Creating Demand

Westermeier urged Indian businesses to support the nascent SAF ecosystem by joining voluntary purchase programmes being rolled out by airlines. “Even committing to buy Saf for a fraction of your company’s travel sends a strong and immediate demand signal to the market,” he noted.

He said scaling up Saf production could yield both economic and environmental dividends, with the potential to create between 1.1 million and 1.4 million jobs and enable productive use of about 230 million tonnes of agricultural residue annually.

India’s strong technology base and large biomass reserves give it a strategic edge in developing a domestic SAF industry, Westermeier observed. However, he cautioned that high production costs remain a hurdle, with Saf currently priced at two to four times the cost of conventional aviation turbine fuel.

The shift to SAF is also tied to international commitments under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which aims to cap aviation emissions globally. India, which has opted out of Corsia’s voluntary phase, will be subject to mandatory offsetting requirements in 2027.

The government has already indicated plans to introduce blending targets for SAF — one per cent in 2027, two per cent in 2028, and five per cent by 2030.

A report from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce & Industry (FICCI) and KPMG said that with over 680 MMT of agricultural residue, 3.4 MMT of used cooking oil, and ethanol capacity exceeding 1,800 crore litres, India has the raw materials to scale SAF production

The report presents a strategic road map, highlighting the country's preparedness to scale SAF production, enhance rural incomes, boost greener fuel alternatives, and access international export markets.

SAF can reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80 per cent, making it the most immediate and scalable decarbonisation lever for aviation, it said.

Further, the report mentioned the government-mandated blending targets of 1 per cent by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030.

The report emphasised the economic and ecological advantages, such as decreased fuel imports saving billions, job creation in green sectors, and enhanced income for rural communities.

India is well-positioned to supply SAF to premium markets like the EU, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East, it added.

Anish De, Global Head, Energy Natural Resources & Chemicals, KPMG in India, emphasised the need for a coordinated systems approach that aligns policy, finance, technology, and offtake commitments.

“India’s SAF journey will be built on the intelligent use of our abundant feedstock base - from agricultural residues and municipal solid waste to press-mud and used cooking oil,” said Vivek Rahi, Partner and National Head - Oil & Gas, KPMG in India.

The key to success will be establishing viable supply chains and long-term offtake frameworks involving airlines, OMCs, and technology providers, he added.

The plan includes a series of measures designed to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and marine biofuels, with the goal of reducing carbon emissions in these critical industries, reports Biodiesel Magazine.

Approach to boost renewable and low-carbon fuels

The STIP is expected to mobilize at least EUR 2.9 billion ($3.33 billion) by 2027, with a significant portion of this funding directed toward overcoming investment barriers and closing the financial gaps in the transition to cleaner energy. Key funding initiatives include at least EUR 2 billion, mobilized through InvestEU, dedicated to sustainable alternative fuels, which will play a crucial role in supporting the sector’s decarbonization efforts in the short term.

Additionally, the European Commission plans to propose EUR 300 million by 2025 to support hydrogen production for SAF and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF), to be managed through the European Hydrogen Bank. Research and innovation will also receive a boost, with approximately EUR 133 million allocated under the Horizon Europe program. Further, the Commission intends to mobilize EUR 153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and EUR 293 million for maritime fuel initiatives under the Innovation Fund.

One of the key components of the STIP is the launch of the eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project before the end of 2025. This project is designed to mobilize at least EUR 500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects, aimed at stimulating early investment in the sector.

The Commission’s plan also seeks to strengthen international collaborations to boost global production of sustainable fuels while ensuring that EU investments are protected and that fair competition is maintained for European fuel producers and users.

To meet the fuel targets set by the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, the European Commission estimates that approximately 12.2 million metric tons of biofuels and 6.8 million metric tons of e-fuels will be required. The market will need to invest an estimated EUR 100 billion by 2035 to reach these production volumes.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit-2025 in New Delhi, Naidu said the government’s upcoming SAF policy would be a crucial step towards balancing growth with environmental responsibility. The event is being organised by the Civil Aviation Ministry, in collaboration with FICCI.

The minister highlighted that the transition towards cleaner aviation fuel required greater innovation, investment and global partnerships. “The move from feedstock to fuel will connect farmers with flyers. Even used cooking oil from everyday kitchens could become part of this new green aviation journey,” the minister remarked, underlining the potential of waste-to-fuel technology.

India has set clear blending targets for the use of SAF in jet fuel, 1 % by 2027, 2 % by 2028 and 5 % by 2030. SAF can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), making it an immediately viable option for airlines.

Highlighting the opportunities within the sector, Naidu said private firms must actively participate in the production of SAF alongside public oil companies. With a global requirement of 183 million tonnes of SAF projected by 2040, India’s participation could play a decisive role in shaping the future of sustainable aviation.

The minister pointed out that the country has access to over 750 million tonnes of biomass and about 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue, which can be effectively used as feedstock for fuel production.

Naidu said the adoption of SAF would not only help India cut its crude oil import bill by an estimated USD 5-7 billion annually but could also create more than one million green jobs across the value chain. “The shift will empower farmers, potentially raising their incomes by 10-15 %,” he added.

Currently, the global production of SAF remains limited. However, Naidu expressed confidence that India could manufacture it at competitive prices, thereby positioning itself as a key player in the sustainable aviation market.

India is among the fastest-growing aviation markets in the world, with domestic airlines collectively ordering over 1,700 aircraft. Naidu said that adopting SAF on a large scale would be crucial in ensuring that this rapid expansion does not come at the cost of environmental sustainability.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/sortd-service/imaginary/v22-01/jpg/large/high?url=dGhldHJpYnVuZS1zb3J0ZC1wcm8tcHJvZC1zb3J0ZC9tZWRpYWM4ZDk2ODIwLWJiNTktMTFmMC1iMDY0LWVkNWUyYTYzNDljNy5qcGc=,N,,2025-11-06 17:16:33.467909

In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, we co-lead a group of 13 state agencies to identify actions to improve siting and permitting of clean energy projects.

The Clean Energy Council just issued a new report with recommendations for the governor and state legislature, developed with input from Tribes, industry, and interested parties. They address concerns such as limitations of the state’s electrical grid, planning for emerging technologies, and supporting Tribal clean energy projects and local government planning.

State agency actions on clean energy

Washington has already taken many strides to reach our clean energy goals. Our electricity needs are expected to double by 2050 with even more needed for large energy users, like data centers, and more action is needed. Agencies are improving customer service and providing information for developers of clean energy projects and the public on existing and new technologies.

In the past year, Washington has taken action to move clean energy forward including:

Providing funding for agencies, local governments, Tribes, and communities to work on clean energy planning, siting, environmental reviews, and permitting.

Finalizing statewide environmental studies for utility-scale solar and onshore wind energy projects and green hydrogen facilities – and providing tools to use them.

Studying rural clean energy economics.

Launching a collaborative process to identify opportunities and risks of geothermal energy.

Improving customer service and ideas for consolidating clean energy permits.

Building best practices for community and Tribal benefit agreements and developing an environmental justice toolkit for hydrogen projects.

Reporting on the emerging technologies of nuclear fusion and sustainable aviation fuel.

Recommended next steps

Building on the recommendations in the first annual report, the council developed new ideas that further advance the state’s energy policies. Recent changes at the federal level, as well as state and federal funding constraints, will affect clean energy development in Washington state.

Given the urgent need for clean energy to meet the rising state electricity demand, the council developed meaningful recommendations. These could be implemented with legislative direction or funding to enact.

The electrical grid provides clean energy to users across the state but is reaching its capacity in many places. The recommendations are to establish a state entity to develop and finance transmission projects, develop tools for siting and permitting, and improving existing electrical lines.

The council's recommendations include:

Supporting clean energy development through incentives for upgrades.

Promoting Tribal clean energy projects.

Looking at options that do not rely on the electrical grid.

Supporting Tribes with long-term funding.

Engaging Tribes early in actions that affect their resources.

Supporting local governments in clean energy planning and for dealing with emerging. technologies.

Public lands available for energy development could be assessed and tools for engaging with local communities would improve information sharing. A collaborative process for looking at risks and opportunities for geothermal energy has started, but more work could be done to gather data for these types of resources.

We believe these actions will improve siting and permitting of clean energy in Washington state and help meet our goals for a clean energy transition.

Opportunities for input

Our goals include promoting understanding, awareness, and visibility into the council's work. We hold workshops with interested parties and Tribes in the spring and fall to provide updates, hear issues and ideas, and share recommendation ideas. In the summer, we shared draft recommendations for comment and input on the annual report.

#Sustainability #GreenTransport #Aviation #Maritime #RenewableEnergy #EU #ClimateAction #Innovation #Investment https://lnkd.in/eKM8JSR2","Europe doubles down on sustainable transport fuels Yesterday, the European Commission unveiled its Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP) — a bold and strategic roadmap to accelerate the shift towards renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport. With fuel demand projected to reach 20 million tonnes by 2035, this plan signals a decisive push to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and sustainable maritime fuel (SMF) the new standard — not the exception. 💶 €100 billion in total investments will be needed to meet EU targets under the ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations. To kickstart this transition, the Commission plans to mobilise €2.9 billion by 2027, including: ✅ €2 billion via InvestEU to remove investment barriers ✅ €300 million through the European Hydrogen Bank for green hydrogen production ✅ €133 million for R&I projects under Horizon Europe ✅ €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel and €293 million for maritime fuels via the Innovation Fund Beyond financial measures, the STIP provides regulatory stability, supports revenue certainty mechanisms for producers, and strengthens international partnerships to ensure a level playing field for EU businesses. 🌍 Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas captured it well: “It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport.” Why this matters: The Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is more than a policy document — it’s a signal to global investors that Europe is ready to lead the clean fuels revolution. By de-risking investments, aligning regulation, and fostering innovation, the EU is positioning itself as a frontrunner in the race toward climate-neutral mobility by 2050. 🔗 Key takeaway: Aviation and maritime transport — often seen as “hard-to-abate” sectors — are finally getting a clear and credible investment framework. The next few years will show whether Europe can turn this strategic vision into large-scale industrial action. #Sustainability #GreenTransport #Aviation #Maritime #RenewableEnergy #EU #ClimateAction #Innovation #Investment https://lnkd.in/eKM8JSR2",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFS8JnSdKjvBg/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4EZpaOe15HcAw-/0/1762450340403?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=IgDkRoGX_N8pg9wVjT56Jak031_T7io3AzPHdvsxgbY,N,,2025-11-06 14:00:06.832425

SOURCE: XCF Global, Inc. View the original press release on ACCESS Newswire","HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / November 6, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF"") was featured in a white paper titled, ""Unlocking the Full Value of Renewable Fuel Facilities: Powering the Future with Posh Flex Gensets"" written by Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator. As previously announced, XCF and Posh have signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") to explore deploying Posh's Flex Gensets at our New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's white paper provides its economic and technical roadmap for integrating Posh Energy's Flex Gensets into SAF and renewable diesel (""RD"") facilities, such as at XCF's New Rise Reno facility. Posh's analysis shows how producers using its Flex Gensets process can convert propane-rich byproduct streams, typically ~8% of total output, into renewable electricity, transforming a flared or low-value stream into a source of zero-carbon power.

Further, the white paper demonstrates how integrating Posh Flex Gensets into SAF and RD production may be able to deliver both economic and environmental benefits today, while advancing the industry's trajectory toward eSAF and fuels with near-zero - or even negative - carbon intensity (""CI"").

From Byproducts to Profits

The white paper highlights how incorporating Posh's Flex Gensets at facilities such as XCF's New Rise Reno facility has the potential to turn SAF and renewable fuel facilities into integrated energy hubs, producing not only renewable fuel but also clean power and food-grade CO₂. The result is the opportunity to create diversified revenue streams, stronger credit generation, and measurable margin growth.

By replacing grid power with on-site renewable electricity, producers have the potential to reduce lifecycle carbon intensity (CI), boost Section 45Z and Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits, and strengthen energy resilience for both operations and power grids.

In addition to enhancing the value of its renewable fuels, the white paper illustrates that integrating Posh's Flex Gensets has the potential to deliver:

Improvement in operating margin, driven by electricity sales and eligibility for the Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit

Additional revenue streams through the sale of biogenic, food-grade CO₂ with market prices as high as $700 per metric ton, equating to approximately $0.22 per gallon of added value

Up to 80% higher electrical efficiency and near-zero local emissions

Advancing XCF's Growth Model

The white paper builds on the LOI signed in September 2025, which outlines plans for a 100 kW pilot deployment of Posh's Flex Gensets at the New Rise Reno facility, followed by a modular scale-up to 10 MW of installed capacity.

The non-binding LOI reflects a shared vision to convert byproducts from the production of renewable fuels into zero-carbon electricity, unlocking the full value of production while advancing both sustainability and profitability goals. Execution remains subject to customary due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

Mihir Dange, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, commented:

""Our potential partnership with Posh Energy to deploy Flex Gensets at New Rise Reno demonstrates how renewable fuel facilities can evolve into next-generation, integrated energy platforms. By eliminating flaring and converting propane byproducts into zero-carbon electricity, we have the opportunity to both improve margin and create a circular economy where every drop of feedstock delivers value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy, commented:

""Our Flex Gensets make the energy transition practical - turning hard-to-process waste streams into clean, reliable powerwith 80% higher efficiency. Working with XCF validates how this technology can simultaneously decarbonize operations and open new, credit-backed revenue opportunities for SAF and renewable fuel producers worldwide.""

A Broader Vision

The white paper also highlights the opportunity for renewable fuel producers to help address one of the decade's biggest infrastructure challenges - the surging electricity demand from AI and hyperscale data centers, which now account for an estimated 44 percent of U.S. electricity load growth.

Over $1 trillion is expected to be invested in new U.S. data center infrastructure by 2030, and much of that growth will be constrained by limited grid interconnection capacity. By deploying Posh Flex Gensets, SAF and renewable fuel producers can help stabilize regional grids while monetizing byproducts that were previously wasted, positioning themselves as essential players in the decarbonization of both transportation and digital infrastructure.

With its rapidly expanding aviation sectorâcurrently the fifth largest worldwide and expected to rise to third place by 2030âthe nation is uniquely positioned to lead in SAF production. This shift is supported by ambitious government mandates requiring a minimum blend of 1 percent SAF by 2027, increasing to 2 percent by 2028, and reaching 5 percent by 2030.
 The report highlights Indiaâs vast potential through its rich availability of renewable feedstocks. The country generates over 680 million metric tons of agricultural residue annually, along with 3.4 million metric tons of used cooking oil and an ethanol production capacity surpassing 1,800 crore liters. These resources form a robust foundation for scaling up SAF manufacturing while simultaneously addressing environmental challenges and boosting rural economies.
 Sustainable aviation fuels offer significant climate benefits, capable of reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. As one of the most practical and scalable solutions for decarbonizing air travel, SAF represents a critical step toward achieving net-zero goals in the aviation industry. The report outlines a comprehensive roadmap emphasizing the importance of integrating policy support, financial incentives, technological innovation, and secure off-take agreements among stakeholders.
 Beyond environmental gains, the transition to SAF promises substantial economic returns. It could significantly cut down on fuel import dependency, save billions in foreign exchange, create employment opportunities in emerging green industries, and increase income for farmers and rural populations involved in biomass collection and processing.
 India also stands ready to tap into lucrative international markets, including the European Union, Japan, Singapore, and the Middle East, where demand for low-carbon aviation fuels is rising due to stringent carbon regulations and sustainability commitments. Experts stress that successful implementation hinges on building resilient supply chains and securing long-term contracts between airlines, oil marketing companies, and technology partners.
 Anish De, Global Head of Energy, Natural Resources & Chemicals at KPMG India, emphasized the necessity of a holistic strategy that brings together policymakers, financiers, innovators, and end-users. Vivek Rahi, Partner and National Head â Oil & Gas at KPMG India, noted that leveraging diverse domestic feedstocksâfrom crop waste and urban refuse to sugarcane press mud and recycled oilsâis central to this transformation.

The long road to the zero emission aircraft of the future has been a long one, but the nut has finally begun to crack around the edges. In the latest development, the EU Innovation Fund has greenlighted a €21.4 million grant to the US-UK firm ZeroAvia. The funds will support a pilot project under which ZeroAvia will retrofit 15 Cessna Caravan aircraft with its ZA600 hydrogen fuel cell electric engines.

The Fuel Cell Chicken & Egg Problem

If you’re wondering where the hydrogen fuel will come from, that’s a good question. It’s similar to the questions raised when battery-electric cars first came on the scene, before EV charging stations became as commonplace as gas stations, or even more so considering the popularity of home EV charging.

Advocates for hydrogen fuel cell technology are facing a similar chicken-and-egg obstacle, and the EU grant also covers that. Under the title ODIN (short for Operations to Decarbonize Interconnectivity in Norway), the project involves outfitting 15 Norwegian airports with hydrogen refueling and storage facilities.

The ODIN project also faces another hurdle that bears some similarity to the EV situation of years gone by, when recharging a battery often meant tapping into a grid saturated with coal and natural gas. Fuel cell aircraft produce no emissions except water vapor, but the global hydrogen supply chain leans almost entirely on natural gas, with coal also involved to a lesser extent.

More Green Hydrogen For Fuel Cell Aircraft

The hydrogen supply chain is beginning to decarbonize, with the European Commission among the government bodies supporting a new, green supply chain based on renewable resources. On its part, ZeroAvia has also focused attention on securing a supply of green hydrogen for its fuel cell aircraft while cutting the cost of green hydrogen as well (see more ZeroAvia background here).

Green hydrogen or not, the impact on direct aircraft emissions from the retrofitted Caravans will be significant. “These zero-emission aircraft are planned to replace conventional kerosene-fueled turboprops on cargo routes and expected to see in excess of 95% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,” ZeroAvia states.

The Cessna Caravan is rather small in size, reflecting the current state of fuel cell electric flight. However, the ODIN project is significant as the first introduction of hydrogen fuel cell aircraft into the European Economic Area. ZeroAvia is already billing the 15 airports in Norway as the “world’s largest network of zero-emission commercial flights.” ODIN is also expected to spur scaleup activity among other regional transportation networks elsewhere.

“The ODIN project aims to validate the technical performance and economic case for utilizing hydrogen-electric aircraft in commercial operations, with a view to catalyzing further adoption in Norway, across the EU and further afield,” ZeroAvia elaborates.

Next Steps For Zero Emission Flight

The ODIN grant is still in the preparatory stage for finalizing the agreement. If all goes according to plan, the network will be up and running in 2028.

Meanwhile, ZeroAvia has been working to scale up fuel cell flight for passengers. Currently in the works for certification is an engine designed for aircraft of up to 20 seats, and a larger version aimed at the 40-80 seat market.

That’s an impressive jump up from the 6-seat aircraft ZeroAvia launched in 2020. However, even 80 seats is nowhere near the scale of today’s airliners. Long distance travel also remains a distant goal. In the meantime, the company has retooled its business model to sync up with the emerging market for unconventional aircraft.

“Separately, hydrogen is picking up new impetus in other segments of aviation thanks to a unique set of drivers: new approaches to regulation, a thirst for greater endurance of novel electrical aircraft, such as electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), and corresponding space and weight efficiency advances in low-to-mid power modular hydrogen fuel cell systems,” ZeroAvia explains.

In particular, ZeroAvia takes note of the new MOSAIC (Modernization of Special Airworthiness Certification) rule introduced by the Federal Aviation Administration in August.

The new rule provides for additional design flexibility by removing the weight limit and allowing up to four seats in the general aviation category. “Qualifying aircraft are no longer limited to single piston engines, opening up the opportunity to certify these with new electric and hydrogen-electric powertrains,” ZeroAvia emphasizes.

Fuel Cells Vs. Batteries

As a singular advocate for fuel cell flight, ZeroAvia pulls no punches against the competition from battery-electric stakeholders, particularly in the rush to take advantage of new opportunities under the MOSAIC rule.

“Replacing battery power systems with hydrogen fuel cells can significantly extend range, reduce maintenance costs caused by battery cycling, and improve operations thanks to quicker turnaround time,” ZeroAvia asserts.

If you have any thoughts about that, drop a note in the comment thread. The big question is whether or not fuel cell propulsion can compete on cost. In that regard, ZeroAvia is banking on its new “SuperStack Flex” modular fuel cell system to give it an edge in the light-sport and eVTOL (electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing) markets.

“SuperStack Flex offers scalable power output, is compact and lightweight to meet aviation’s strict weight and space constraints, and allows flexible integration, making it compatible with both conventional and unconventional aircraft structures,” ZeroAvia asserts.

Fuel Cells Vs. Batteries Vs. SAF

Looming over both fuel cell and battery-electric flight is the SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) industry, which aims to provide drop-in liquid replacements for kerosene jet fuel based on renewable resources, recovered wastes, or both.

Progress in that area has been slow and partly hampered by land use issues involving energy crops. By 2021, though, the US Air Force was among the advanced aviation stakeholders supporting a whole new supply chain, consisting of drop-in liquid fuels synthesized from green hydrogen and captured carbon. By 2022 Texas (of course) was already emerging as a hotspot for electrofuels innovation.

In one variation on the topic, earlier this year the Swiss firm Metafuels described a flexible e-fuels system powered by electricity sourced from renewable resources. “Green H2 can be generated from water electrolysis driven by renewable electricity while CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere using direct air capture technology (DAC) or captured from other biogenic sources,” Metafuels explained, noting that its system is designed to switch gears depending on feedstock availability.

Competition from existing rail and road transportation networks could also complicate matters for electric aircraft stakeholders. Yesterday, for example, the EU Commission expanded its commitment to high-speed rail.

Christopher Efird, CEO & Chairperson of NXTClean Fuels: said:

“The Topsoe technologies and catalysts dramatically reduce the carbon intensity of our fuels, making our products among the cleanest SAF and renewable diesel supplies in the world.”

This agreement addresses the rapidly growing global demand for SAF. The International Air Transport Association projects that SAF production will more than double in 2025 compared to 2024, reaching 2.1 million tons (2.7 billion liters), or 0.7% of total global jet fuel production [1].

By integrating Topsoe’s HydroFlex™, SynCOR™ and H2bridge™ technologies, the NXTClean Fuels facility at Port Westward expects to recycle biogenic propane and off-gas to create hydrogen with lower carbon intensity, while also producing sufficient excess low-carbon hydrogen to be able to displace fossil fuel used for refinery heat. Taken together, these innovations will significantly reduce the carbon intensity of the renewable diesel and SAF that the facility will produce.

About HydroFlex®

With HydroFlex, customers can convert various fats, oils and greases into drop-in renewable jet and diesel that meet all globally accepted specifications for these fuels. Topsoe’s HydroFlex can be deployed in both greenfield units and revamps for co-processing or fully renewable applications.

About SynCOR™

SynCORTM technology enables hydrogen production as well as cost efficient carbon capture. SynCOR™ is Topsoe´s proprietary technology based on advanced autothermal reforming principles. Supported by 300 years of accumulative, safe operation, SynCOR™ is often the preferred technology for mega scale hydrogen production, due to its maturity and low capital and operating costs.

About H2bridge™

The H2bridge™ technology replaces external fossil feedstocks for production of hydrogen by processing the waste propane and off gases from the HydroFlex™ process and converting it into green hydrogen that is then consumed in the same process (i.e. HydroFlex™). This patented process integration provides the customers with improved carbon intensity score.

According to the Commission, however, while EU production capacity of sustainable fuels is on track for the targets from 2025 – 2029, investment planning does not appear sufficient to meet the regulations’ targets after 2030.
Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said: “Our Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a decisive step towards a sustainable future.
It’s not just about cutting emissions – it’s about building a stronger, more competitive and resilient Europe that leads in sustainable transport.
This ambitious plan shows the Commission’s firm commitment to scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels in aviation and waterborne transport.”","The European Commission announced the launch of its new Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), setting out its roadmap and planned investments to dramatically accelerate the production of sustainable and low-carbon fuels needed to help reach its aviation and maritime transport sector decarbonization goals.

The new plan follows the adoption in 2023 by EU lawmakers of ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime regulations, setting binding targets to ramp up low-carbon fuel usage in the aviation and maritime shipping sectors, respectively. Targets included in the regulations include a minimum share of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at EU airports, starting a 2% in 2025, and increasing over time to reach 70% by 2050, as well as a minimum share of synthetic fuels starting in 2030 and also increasing through 2050, and for maritime shipping, requirements to gradually reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of fuels, starting with a 2% reduction in 2025, and reaching as much as 80% by 2050.

According to the Commission, however, while EU production capacity of sustainable fuels is on track for the targets from 2025 – 2029, investment planning does not appear sufficient to meet the regulations’ targets after 2030. The Commission added that investments to sufficiently scale up production of renewable and low-carbon fuels will need to reach an estimated €100 billion by 2035.

The Commission said that the new Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is aimed at addressing the barriers to investment to enable the needed increase in production of renewable and low-carbon fuels, in addition to help producers access biological feedstocks for the fuels.

In total, the Commission’s plan aims to mobilize at least €2.9 billion in investments through the end of 2027, with specific investments including at least €2 billion for sustainable alternative fuels through the InvestEU programme, €300 million by end of this year to support the production of hydrogen for SAF and sustainable maritime fuels (SMF) through the European Hydrogen Bank, support from the Commission of around €133 million under Horizon Europe for research and innovation projects, as well as the mobilization of €153 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects and €293 million for maritime fuel projects under the Innovation Fund.

In addition, the Commission announced plans to launch an eSAF Early Movers Coalition pilot project aimed at mobilizing €500 million for synthetic aviation fuel projects by the end of this year, as well as to establish a mechanism connecting fuel producers and buyers to provide revenue certainty and de-risk investments.

Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism, Apostolos Tzitzikostas, said:

It comes as Europe’s airlines face tighter climate rules under the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which will require at least 2% of all jet fuel sold in the bloc to be sustainable by 2025, rising to 70% by 2050.

Major EU funding boost for sustainable aviation fuel

The €3 billion package aims to bridge the gap between policy and production. Most of the funding will support efforts to expand Europe’s SAF manufacturing capacity, reduce reliance on imports from the US and Asia, and make green jet fuel affordable enough for widespread airline adoption.

According to officials familiar with the plan, €2 billion ($2.3 billion) will be channelled through the InvestEU programme to build new SAF plants and attract private investment.

Another €133 million ($153 million) will support research under Horizon Europe, focusing on advanced biofuels and synthetic aviation fuels, while €153 million ($176 million) from the Innovation Fund will finance large-scale demonstration projects.

A new “eSAF Early Movers Coalition”, expected to raise around €500 million, will back early production of synthetic e-fuels that can be blended directly with conventional jet fuel.

Europe’s SAF production still faces a steep climb

Despite its global leadership on climate policy, Europe’s actual SAF output remains minimal. The continent currently produces less than 300,000 tonnes per year, compared with the estimated 7 million tonnes needed annually by 2035 to remain on track for net-zero aviation.

The shortfall is driven by the high capital costs of SAF facilities and limited access to sustainable feedstocks. EU officials hope the new investment package will give private investors the confidence to scale up quickly.

A significant focus of the plan lies in synthetic e-fuels, produced by combining captured carbon dioxide with hydrogen generated from renewable power. These fuels can be used in today’s aircraft engines and refuelling infrastructure, an advantage over hydrogen or battery-electric aircraft, which remain years from commercial adoption.

To accelerate development, Brussels plans to hold its first “pooled double auction” in 2026. The mechanism will match fuel producers with guaranteed buyers at pre-agreed prices, giving investors the long-term certainty needed for commercial-scale production.

Industry experts say this could finally create a viable market for synthetic aviation fuels, replacing the cycle of pilot projects that fail to reach maturity.

Safeguarding Europe’s leadership in sustainable aviation

The European Commission also sees the investment as a way to reinforce the continent’s aerospace competitiveness.

By leading the global shift to SAF, Brussels hopes to strengthen companies such as Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Safran, which are already testing aircraft and engines certified for 100% SAF use.

In a statement, Airbus said the new plan “will help ensure that fuel availability keeps pace with certification and airline demand.”

Rolls-Royce, which has completed multiple SAF trials across its engine families, called the initiative “crucial for maintaining momentum in decarbonising long-haul aviation.”

What’s next for Europe’s SAF expansion?

The European Commission will now finalise project lists with member states and private-sector partners. The first funding rounds under InvestEU are expected in early 2026, targeting plants capable of producing several hundred thousand tonnes of sustainable fuel per year.

Over time, Brussels aims to create a fully integrated European SAF market with harmonised standards, stable pricing mechanisms, and commercial viability at scale.

As one EU transport adviser put it:

“Aviation’s green transition won’t happen overnight. But this investment starts the engines—and keeps Europe in the pilot’s seat.”",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Air-France-Sustainable-aviation-Fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-11-06 12:01:37.059934

With the EU's binding climate goal of achieving climate-neutrality by 2050, compared to 1990 levels, slashing emissions in aviation and maritime transport is both essential and challenging for the EU27.

Commercial planes and ships are the hardest transports to decarbonise, and to this day they are still powered mainly by fossil fuels, despite EU legislation meant to help the shipping and aviation sectors to become climate-neutral.

""The package is about strengthening Europe’s competitiveness while moving decisively towards a net-zero future. By investing in scaling up renewable and low-carbon fuels, we are making Europe’s transport system cleaner, more resilient and more affordable for citizens,"" said Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas.

The EU executive estimates that around 20 million tonnes of sustainable fuels, including biofuels and e-fuels, will be needed by 2035 to meet green fuel targets for aviation and maritime transport. Achieving this will require an estimated €100 billion in investment, the Commission stated.

The nearly €3 billion announced on Wednesday is expected to be disbursed from the EU's multiannual budget, running until 2027, to be invested in renewable and low-carbon fuel technologies.

Under existing EU law, the maritime sector must reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2% from 2025, compared to 2020 levels. By 2050, shipping is expected to reduce its GHG intensity by 80%.

The aviation sector is expected to have 20% of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — feedstocks like used cooking oil, agricultural waste and captured carbon — supplied at EU airports from 2035. Five per cent needs to be e-SAF — a type of synthetic jet fuel made from carbon dioxide, water, and renewable electricity.

By 2050, green fuels for aviation must account for 70%, of which 35% must be eSAF.

However, available and estimated volumes of bio and e-SAF are far from meeting the post-2030 green fuel needs for aviation, according to the Commission.

""Mandates alone do not create a functioning SAF market, and it is high time we collectively admit that and take action to accelerate affordable SAF,” Ourania Georgoutsakou, managing director of the aviation lobby group Airlines for Europe (A4E), said in a statement.

""Ultimately, reducing SAF costs is essential to ensuring air travel remains accessible to all while reinforcing the competitiveness of European airlines,"" A4E stated.

e-fuels and biofuels

More than 40 e-fuel production projects are at a planning stage in the EU, but none have yet reached a final investment decision, the Commission said.

Challenges in scaling up e-fuels are hampered by the availability, cost and maturity of renewable energy, eligible carbon storage and capture technologies and the energy intensity linked to generating green hydrogen.

Antony Froggatt, senior director for aviation, shipping and energy at the campaign group T&E, welcomed the Commission's plan and the inclusion of e-fuels.

“For the first time, the EU will develop an effective financial instrument to kickstart production. The EU must now follow through on these commitments if it is to help preserve Europe’s technological leadership in e-fuels,"" Froggatt said.

Concerns were raised about the use of biofuels, which Froggatt said would only ""detract from"" commitments to e-fuels.

""It is crucial that only e-fuels be eligible for the auctions as there are no market barriers for biofuels production"", T&E stated, in reference to the European Hydrogen Bank auction due by the end of the year with a €300 million window for aviation and maritime projects. This is part of the €2.9 billion unveiled by the Commission.

Jim Corbett, World Shipping Council’s (WSC) environmental director, said the Commission's plan was a ""promising first step"" to accelerate the energy transition in shipping in Europe.

""WSC is eager to work with the Commission to ensure the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan translates to concrete measures that bridge the cost gap between renewable marine fuels and conventional bunkers.

Advancing the science of aviation fuel

Harris studies zeolites, a class of microporous crystalline oxides typically comprised of silicon and aluminum. Zeolites have a rigid, porous structure that can host active sites that enable chemical reactions necessary to transform ethanol into sustainable aviation fuel.

Harris plans to work with researchers from Johns Hopkins University to computationally model yttrium’s structure and compare it to his data on how it behaves in experiments. Understanding why and how yttrium-containing zeolites behave the way they do — and how we can take advantage of them — will help advance the catalysis science necessary for production of sustainable aviation fuel.

“A typical quantum dot contains hundreds or thousands of atoms, but typically, no two quantum dots are alike,” said Fedin.

A senior IATA official warned that mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) without incentives are a ""no-go area"" that would harm airlines. India aims for 1% SAF blending by 2027, but IATA advocates for incentives to boost SAF production before imposing mandates. The government is developing a SAF policy to reduce oil imports and create green jobs.

Mandates for blending sustainable aviation fuel with jet fuel without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and such a situation would hurt airlines, a senior IATA official said on Thursday amid authorities pushing ahead with efforts to reduce carbon emissions.

The government has set a target to have 1 per cent blending of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028 and 5 per cent by 2030 for international flights. India is one of the world's fastest-growing civil aviation markets, and with the availability of feedstock, the country also has significant potential for producing SAF.

Globally, the requirement for SAF is estimated at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Tuhin Sen, Head Sustainability India at IATA, said IATA would prefer to have incentives for a technological push for producing SAF to precede the mandate for the use of SAF.

Mandates for blending of SAF without incentives are a ""no-go area"" and will have unintended consequences as airlines are also enablers for connectivity and growth, he noted.

Live Events

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) represents around 350 airlines, including Indian carriers, worldwide that account for more than 80 per cent of the global air traffic.

Participating in a panel discussion as part of the 'India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit' that was organised in the national capital on Thursday, Sen also mentioned that for airlines, currently, Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) accounts for around 44 per cent of the overall operating costs while the quantum is around 34 per cent globally.

At the panel discussion, Asangba Chuba Ao, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Civil Aviation, emphasised the need for a multi-pronged approach and that there was no ""silver bullet"" to address the issues.

The government is open to suggestions, he said with respect to developing the SAF ecosystem.

Earlier in the day,Civil Aviation Minister K Rammohan Naidu said the government will very soon come out with a policy on SAF, which can help reduce crude oil imports, increase farmers' income and create more green jobs.

""From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that (those) frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement (on SAF),"" Naidu said.

India has more than 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The global aviation safety watchdog International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) aims to reduce CO2 emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030, and reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. India too has set targets to blend SAF into its international flights, starting with a 1% blend by 2027, increasing to 2% by 2028, and reaching 5% by 2030 under ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) programme.

In a bold move to lead the world into a cleaner aviation era, the country is now aiming to eliminate fossil fuels from its airspace. Hybrid-powered jets, built to run entirely on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), are being developed with a goal to end fossil fuel dependency in flights. The real game-changer? Sweden’s ES-30 — a 30-seater hybrid-electric plane that blends electric and SAF tech to fly into a greener future.

Commitment

Sweden isn’t just flirting with the idea of clean aviation — it’s all in. The country has laid out a clear path toward replacing fossil jet fuel with 100% SAF for all domestic flights within the next decade. This move ties directly into Sweden’s broader climate target of becoming net-zero by 2045.

Aviation, traditionally a heavy polluter, has long lagged behind in sustainability. Sweden is flipping that script with its SAF initiative. Unlike regular jet fuel, SAF is made from renewable sources like used cooking oils, agricultural residues, and even captured carbon dioxide. It’s not just a cleaner option — it’s a smarter one.

Innovation

At the center of Sweden’s clean aviation mission is the ES-30. Developed by Swedish startup Heart Aerospace, the ES-30 is a hybrid-electric aircraft that seats 30 passengers. It’s tailor-made for regional travel, especially suited for short routes like those connecting remote regions with major cities.

This jet is designed to operate on a full-electric range of 32 km, and up to 200 km using its hybrid SAF engine. It’s ideal for daily essential flights to islands like Gotland, which rely on consistent air travel to the mainland.

Partnerships

Sweden is building a full ecosystem around its green aviation dream. Airports like Säve in Gothenburg are upgrading facilities to support electric and SAF-powered planes. We’re talking about charging stations, battery safety zones, and SAF blending hubs — all ready to go.

Meanwhile, authorities are fast-tracking new regulatory frameworks. The current aviation certification systems, still tied to fossil-fueled aircraft, are being overhauled to meet the needs of electric aviation. It’s a ground-up rebuild of how flight is done.

Infrastructure

To pull off a national shift to clean aviation, infrastructure is everything. Sweden knows that it’s not just about the aircraft — it’s about the full supply chain. The country is working closely with airlines, airport operators, energy providers, and tech startups to ensure SAF can be produced, delivered, and refueled at scale.

In fact, agreements have already been signed with companies like Elfly Group, and airfields are getting equipped with all the tools needed to support hybrid-electric jets.

Here’s a look at how the aviation upgrade is shaping up:

Regulation

To make this dream fly, Sweden is rewriting aviation laws. Outdated certifications don’t support SAF and electric aircraft. That’s why Sweden’s transport and environmental regulators are partnering with research institutions and private aviation players to develop fast-track approval systems.

Over 100 projects are underway — from SAF testing to air taxi development. Sweden’s aviation rulebook is being reimagined for a carbon-free future.

Vision

This isn’t just about reducing carbon — it’s about eliminating fossil fuels altogether. Sweden wants to be the first country where commercial flights operate without burning a single drop of fossil jet fuel. And with SAF that’s proven to be cleaner, easier to produce, and more practical than hydrogen or all-electric propulsion, that future feels within reach.

Gotland, one of Sweden’s more remote areas, is already leading the charge, proving that even the most isolated regions can plug into this new system. The journey to the skies now comes with a lighter footprint.

With this SAF revolution, Sweden is setting a powerful example for the world. The vision is clear: sustainable skies, clean engines, and fossil-free flying. This isn’t a pipe dream. It’s already taking off.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel.
Leveling the Playing Field Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been “extraordinarily active” in 2025, making three significant changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that are poised to reshape the biomass-based diesel market.

University of Illinois, Todd Gleason spoke to agricultural economists Dr. Todd Hubbs of Oklahoma State University and Dr. Scott Irwin of the University of Illinois, who outlined how these complex rulings create strong incentives for domestic soybean oil and other feedstocks.

“It has been something this year,” Hubbs said, detailing the EPA’s recent actions.

The changes, which are the focus of a new series of articles by Hubbs and Irwin, include:

June: The EPA finalized the Renewable Volume Obligations (RVOs) for 2026 and 2027.

July: The agency released a comprehensive ruling on Small Refinery Exemptions (SREs) that had been pending since 2018.

September: The EPA established a new framework for reallocating those SREs.

The Mandate is Growing

Host Todd Gleason clarified that these changes do not impact the 15-billion-gallon component of the RFS, which is generally met by corn-based ethanol. Instead, the focus is on biomass-based diesel (often called soy diesel).

The mandate for this category is set for a 40% increase, rising from 5.36 billion gallons annually to 7.5 billion gallons by 2027.

A “Messy” Solution to Small Refinery Exemptions

A major part of the EPA’s recent action was resolving the backlog of SREs, which allow small refineries to get out of the RFS mandate.

Dr. Hubbs explained that the EPA was “more stringent” in granting new exemptions than the previous administration. For the exemptions it did grant (covering 2018-2022), the agency returned “worthless” RINs (Renewable Identification Numbers, or credits) from those past years, rather than current, valuable RINs. This effectively removed those credits from the marketplace.

“That’s a mess,” Hubbs said, summarizing the complex situation.

Crucially, the EPA’s new “reallocation” policy means that the exempted gallons will be added back into the RFS, making other, non-exempt obligated parties responsible for making up the difference in 2026 and 2027.

This combination of stringent new rules and reallocation is “helpful” for the agriculture sector and points to “really strong growth” for biomass-based diesel. Hubbs projects the mandate could jump from 5.5 billion RIN gallons in 2025 to over 7.23 billion in 2026.

“Half-RIN” Policy Favors Domestic Production

Perhaps the most significant change, according to Hubbs, was the introduction of a “half-RIN policy” in June, which he described as “unheard of previously.”

Under this new rule, any imported fuel or imported feedstock used to make fuel will only receive half the RIN value.

“Well, that sort of totally favors it, right?” Gleason asked.

Hubbs agreed, noting the policy “sort of favors domestic feedstock and domestic production” and has “big implications” for U.S. producers.

Leveling the Playing Field

Finally, the EPA also adjusted the credit values to put different types of biomass-based diesel on a more equal footing.

The agency lowered the RIN value for non-ester renewable diesel (and Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF) from 1.7 RINs per gallon down to 1.6. This brings it closer to traditional FAME (soy diesel), which has a 1.5 RINs-per-gallon value.

,,2025-11-06 11:06:00+00:00,www.consultancy.eu,Five tips to kickstart the decarbonisation journey - Consultancy.eu,"Consultancy.eu, www.consultancy.eu",,,,,https://www.consultancy.eu/news/12693/five-tips-to-kickstart-the-decarbonisation-journey,"For organisations beginning their decarbonisation journey, a strong start is vital to build lasting momentum.
Set ambitious yet achievable targets Targets give direction, but they must be credible.
The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provides a framework to ensure emissions targets are science-aligned rather than arbitrary.

Steps towards the net-zero future Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step.","For organisations beginning their decarbonisation journey, a strong start is vital to build lasting momentum. Carolina Paes, Climate Consultant at Nexio Projects, shares five key tips to help spark ambition and set initiatives firmly on the right path.

1. Measure from the start

No decarbonisation strategy can advance without a clear picture of today’s emissions. A full carbon footprint measurement, covering Scope 1, Scope 2, and relevant parts of Scope 3, will reveal where the biggest impacts lie.

Scope 3 is where many businesses find unexpected challenges. Upstream suppliers, distribution networks, and product lifecycles often account for most emissions. Tackling these early, even with high-level estimates, ensures action plans are grounded in reality and not assumption.

This step forms the backbone of carbon accounting and builds credibility with stakeholders who expect reliable disclosure.

2. Build a coalition of stakeholders

Effective decarbonisation requires collective engagement – achieving net zero is rarely achieved in isolation. Stakeholder mapping allows you to identify champions and potential blockers.

Invest time to understand:

Who influences strategic decision-making

Which departments drive the largest emissions

Which suppliers or customers are critical in shaping carbon outcomes

This coalition-building is not about bureaucracy; it is about positioning sustainability at the centre of organisational DNA. When stakeholders feel informed and involved, carbon reduction targets move from paper commitments to cultural practice.

Source: Nexio Projects

3. Set ambitious yet achievable targets

Targets give direction, but they must be credible. The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) provides a framework to ensure emissions targets are science-aligned rather than arbitrary. A decarbonisation strategy that adopts the SBTi communicates a clear message to investors and employees: “Our ambition is real, not symbolic.”

The most effective targets are structured in layers:

Near-term achievable milestones, such as energy efficiency and low-carbon procurement

Longer-term net-zero sustainability goals, covering full value chains

This journey of ambition, supported by data, enables organisations to build a resilient reputation on climate leadership.

4. Integrate risk management into decisions

Climate-related risks are no longer abstract. They translate into tangible financial, operational, and legal consequences. By embedding risk management into the decarbonisation journey, businesses can identify vulnerabilities early.

For example, energy price volatility can amplify costs for carbon-intensive operations, while shifting regulations such as carbon taxes impose new liabilities. Mapping these risks during the early stages allows leaders to develop a proactive, future-proof decarbonisation strategy.

With these foresight mechanisms, organisations protect both their operations and their credibility.

5. Celebrate momentum through tangible action

The worst mistake at the beginning is to wait for a perfect plan. Decarbonisation gains momentum through tangible first steps, not elaborate strategies that never leave the page.

Introduce immediate actions such as:

Switching to renewable electricity contracts

Improving building energy efficiency

Revisiting staff travel policies

Every action reinforces internal belief and builds external trust. These early achievements serve as proof points that cultivating carbon neutrality goes beyond the theoretical – and can be achieved starting today.

Steps towards the net-zero future

Starting the decarbonisation journey means realising that every significant transformation begins with a first step. By measuring emissions, building coalitions, setting science-based targets, embedding risk management, and acting with immediacy, organisations lay the foundation for credible climate leadership.

The evidence-based review, titled Oil-Based Cover Crops for Aviation Fuel in Scotland – Question and Answer Report, assesses the feasibility of cultivating oil-producing crops for biofuel production. The work follows a key recommendation from the recent Project Willow report — a joint UK and Scottish Government study exploring low-carbon industrial opportunities for Scotland’s Grangemouth site.

The report identifies camelina as the leading candidate crop. Already cultivated in several countries for aviation fuel production and in the UK for the health food market, camelina is considered a strong option due to the quality and suitability of its oil, according to a press release.

Next, researchers will launch field trials to study how camelina performs under Scottish growing conditions and how it might integrate into local crop rotations. The project will also assess potential environmental impacts — both positive and negative — to better understand camelina’s role in Scotland’s transition to sustainable agriculture and low-carbon fuel production.

“Camelina, particularly winter grown camelina, is a relatively novel crop for Scotland,” said Dr. Tracy Valentine, Project Lead and Senior Research Scientist. “By growing over winter, we hope to fit in with the main spring cropping season. Initially we will be looking at frost tolerance, growth rates, pests and fertiliser requirements, and ease of crop agronomy for farmers.

“This work will help to understand the potential for camelina to be grown as a biofuel crop in Scotland. Camelina is an oil seed plant, similar to oil seed rape and is part of the Brassicaceae (commonly known as mustard) plant family. It is widely grown across north America and Europe and is used for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production due to its high oil content and ultra-low carbon intensity compared to other alternative crops.”

One tonne of camelina seeds can yield roughly 200 to 230 litres of aviation fuel, though the exact output depends on the seed’s oil content, which typically ranges from 38% to 47%. For comparison, a light aircraft consumes an average of 22 to 45 litres of fuel per hour.

Beyond its potential as a renewable fuel source, camelina oil is also gaining popularity as a cooking oil. Naturally rich in vitamin E and omega fatty acids, it offers both nutritional benefits and a higher smoke point than many conventional oils, making it suitable for a range of culinary uses.

While this momentum enhances global access and mobility, it also drives up fuel consumption and significantly increases carbon emissions, intensifying environmental challenges. Without effective mitigation, aviation’s environmental footprint could undermine global climate objectives, underscoring the urgent need for industry-wide decarbonisation.

Among the various approaches to decarbonise aviation, the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is recognised as one of the most promising solutions. It is projected to contribute approximately 65 per cent of the total emissions reductions for the sector to achieve net-zero by 2050. SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable feedstocks such as agricultural residue and municipal waste. Although its hydrocarbon structure closely resembles that of conventional fossil fuel, resulting in similar tailpipe emissions, the key difference lies in its origin.

India holds a strategic edge in SAF production due to its abundant bio-based feedstocks, producing nearly 230 million tonnes of surplus biomass.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/in/images/2025/11/fuelling-a-cleaner-sky-indias-opportunity-in-sustainable-aviation-fuel.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 09:01:31.292508

With aviation responsible for nearly 2.5 per cent of global CO₂ emissions and passenger volumes continuing to rise, decarbonisation has become central to the sector’s long-term viability. Within this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the most practical, immediate, and scalable solution. SAF not only delivers substantial lifecycle carbon reductions, but also integrates seamlessly into existing aircraft engines, fuel supply chains, and airport infrastructure, thus enabling transition without disruption.

For India, this transition represents both an imperative and an opportunity. It is one of the fastest growing aviation markets in the world crossing ~239 million passengers in FY 2024-25, and on the path to become the third largest. Fleet expansions by leading carriers, supported by record aircraft orders exceeding 1,500, reflect confidence in India’s long-term economic fundamentals. Further, the firm order for widebody aircraft illustrates a new phase of ambition to connect to long-haul international markets. The progress achieved in India’s aviation sector is a direct outcome of deliberate policy foresight and sustained institutional commitment. This expansion has already pushed ATF consumption from 6.3 MMTPA in FY2015-16 to 8.98 MMTPA in FY2024-25, with volumes expected to more than double by 2040. Despite newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft, every capacity addition increases fuel demand, intensifying environmental pressures.

India faces rising fuel demand but also possesses the assets to lead - abundant feedstock, deep refining capacity, proven bioenergy experience, and a strong policy focus on energy transition. The resources, infrastructure, and policy intent are already in place. The real challenge and the strategic opportunity lies in orchestrating them into an integrated value chain that translates potential into measurable climate and competitiveness gains. The development of a domestic SAF industry can deliver multiple dividends: reduced crude import dependence, enhanced rural income, new technology value chains, and green job creation.

The transition to SAF is more than a technological shift, it is a test of strategic intent. India stands at the threshold of redefining its aviation sector not merely as a consumer of cleaner fuel, but as a producer, innovator, and global supplier of it. India’s airlines, airports, regulators, and innovators together represent a confident ecosystem ready to shape the next phase of green aviation. By aligning policy ambition with industrial execution, and pairing domestic feedstock strength with global collaboration, India can chart a flight path where economic growth and climate responsibility move in tandem. As India advances towards Viksit Bharat 2047, its leadership across the aviation value chain from connectivity to manufacturing, from sustainability to digital innovation will define it as a dominant and responsible player in global aviation.

In technical parlance, SAF refers to renewable or waste-derived aviation fuel that adheres to sustainability criteria.

“All industry players will be consulted before the policy is officially rolled out,” Naidu told businessline on the sidelines of an industry event here.

“Not just public sector refiners but also private ones will be consulted. Their participation in the SAF ecosystem is important if India is to emerge as a major exporter of SAF.”

businessline was the first to report that India is in the process of framing a comprehensive policy to promote both the production and utilisation of SAF.

In September 2025, Naidu emphasised that India holds a natural advantage in this segment in terms of geography, which allows it to become an exporter, and the massive availability of feedstock.

At present, India has over 750 million metric tonnes of available biomass and nearly 230 million metric tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

Besides, India’s cost advantage in skilled labour and manufacturing will ensure that SAF is produced at a far more competitive rate compared to any other region in the world.

Nevertheless, one of the current challenges is price competitiveness.

Presently, industry estimates that the price of SAF is two to four times higher than that of traditional jet fuel.

Moreover, SAF plays a pivotal role in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

This scheme is being implemented in three phases, with participation voluntary between 2021 and 2026.

India has chosen not to participate in the voluntary phases. However, offsetting requirements under CORSIA for Indian carriers will begin in 2027.

The scheme applies to international flights originating in one country and landing in another.

The Centre plans to implement the scheme with indicative targets of a one per cent SAF blend in ATF starting in 2027, increasing it to two per cent in 2028, and eventually reaching five per cent by 2030.

Recently, Indian Oil Corporation received certification to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery. This certification, a prerequisite for commercial SAF production, marks a significant step forward in India’s ability to produce, certify and distribute SAF at scale.

A new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) policy is imminent, aiming to boost farmers' incomes and create green jobs while reducing crude oil imports. India targets significant SAF blending by 2030, leveraging abundant biomass and agricultural residue. This initiative promises to balance aviation growth with sustainability goals.

The government will soon unveil a policy on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which could help reduce crude oil imports, boost farmers’ incomes, and generate more green jobs, reported PTI quoting Civil Aviation Minister K. Rammohan Naidu on Thursday.

Speaking at the India Sustainable Aviation Fuel Summit 2025 in the national capital, Naidu said adopting SAF would require greater innovation, investment, and international collaboration.

“From feedstock to fuel, from farmers to flyers, and from frying to flying, who would have actually imagined that those frying samosas also can participate in this whole global aviation movement,” he said.

India aims for 1 per cent SAF blending in jet fuel by 2027, 2 per cent by 2028, and 5 per cent by 2030. The fuel can be used as a drop-in substitute in Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), which powers aircraft.

The minister urged private players to participate in SAF production alongside oil companies. Globally, the demand for SAF is projected at 183 million tonnes by 2040.

Live Events

Highlighting India’s potential, Naidu said the country has over 750 million tonnes of available biomass and nearly 213 million tonnes of surplus agricultural residue.

The government plans to release its SAF policy shortly. Naidu noted that SAF could raise farmers’ incomes by 10-15 per cent, reduce crude oil import bills by USD 5-7 billion annually, and create more than 1 million green jobs along the SAF value chain.

“While global SAF production is currently very low, India can produce SAF at highly competitive rates, helping balance growth with sustainability,” he said.

India is among the world’s fastest-growing civil aviation markets, with domestic carriers having placed orders for over 1,700 planes.

While momentum clearly faded this year, its 3-year total return remains an impressive 48%, so the long-run trajectory is still positive for those who held through the turbulence.

If Fluor's ups and downs have you wondering what else is worth watching, this could be the perfect time to discover

The big question now, after a year of sharp swings and mixed signals, is whether Fluor is trading at a bargain due to short-term troubles or if the market has already taken the company’s growth prospects into account.

Most Popular Narrative: 5% Undervalued

According to the most widely tracked narrative, Fluor's fair value sits at $49.89, while the last close was $47.41. This suggests the shares are still trading below what analysts expect. Even after a turbulent year and recent guidance issues, this valuation hints that the market may be overlooking Fluor's resilience and future catalysts.

The analysts have a consensus price target of $49.889 for Fluor based on their expectations of its future earnings growth, profit margins and other risk factors. However, there is a degree of disagreement amongst analysts, with the most bullish reporting a price target of $57.0, and the most bearish reporting a price target of just $40.0.

Want to know what bold projections are driving that upside? The heart of the narrative is a rapid shift in earnings, razor-thin future profit margins, and a price multiple typically reserved for market leaders. Curious what numbers underpin these optimistic assumptions? Click in to see why this fair value could be within reach.

Result: Fair Value of $49.89 (UNDERVALUED)

However, project delays and a decline in cash flow could quickly challenge the current outlook. These are key watchpoints for any narrative optimism.

Another View: SWS DCF Model Offers a Cautious Signal

While analysts see Fluor as undervalued based on earnings trajectories, our SWS DCF model offers a more reserved take. According to its calculations, Fluor is trading modestly above its fair value at this time. This suggests that recent market optimism may have already priced in the upside potential. Could alternative scenarios still play out?

Revolutionizing Clean Aviation

The SAF Imperative

Aviation accounts for approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, and the industry has committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents the most immediately scalable solution for aviation decarbonization.

Unlike electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft that remain years away from commercial viability for long-haul flights, SAF can be used in existing aircraft with existing infrastructure, offering an immediate pathway to emissions reduction of up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

XCF's Production Technology

The New Rise Reno Facility

XCF's cornerstone asset is the New Rise Reno production facility, which began producing SAF and renewable diesel in February 2025. The facility represents over $350 million in invested infrastructure and incorporates advanced refining processes including hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) and feedstock pretreatment technologies.

The facility is flexible and modular, capable of producing both SAF and renewable diesel depending on market demand and pricing dynamics. This operational versatility provides XCF with strategic optionality in responding to evolving market conditions.

Additional production sites are planned across the U.S. to expand capacity and market reach, positioning XCF for significant production scaling as SAF demand accelerates.

Competitive Positioning

XCF competes in a rapidly consolidating SAF market dominated by established players like Neste and TotalEnergies. However, XCF's strategic advantages include:

- Production capacity: Producing and delivering renewable diesel during the ramp-up process, with SAF production expected to come back online as early as Q1 2026

- Modular, scalable platform: Facility design enables rapid global deployment as demand for SAF increases

- Strategic market positioning: Targeting high-visibility premium segments like private aviation in addition to commercial aviation and logistics markets

- U.S. production advantage: Domestic operations benefit from federal tax credits and incentives; supports the Made in America manufacturing initiative

Explosive Market Growth Trajectory

SAF Market Size & Projections

The numbers are staggering:

- 2025 Market Size: $2.25 billion

- 2034 Projected Size: $134.57 billion

- 10-Year CAGR: 57.5%

- 2025 Production Volume: ~2 million tonnes (doubled from 2024)

- 2030 Projected Demand: 15+ million tonnes

Key Growth Drivers

- Regulatory Mandates: EU ReFuelEU Aviation mandate requires 2% SAF blending in 2025, escalating to 70% by 2050

Detailed Catalyst Analysis

#1: Strategic Private Aviation Partnership Unlocks $17B Premium Market

The Game-Changing Impact Jets MOU

On November 3, 2025, XCF Global announced a Memorandum of Understanding with Impact Jets, LLC to accelerate SAF adoption across the private jet market through a ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program. Together with its existing supply and offtake agreement with Phillips 66, a Fortune 50 energy company, XCF is poised to capitalize on both commercial and private aviation markets.

Why This Matters:

- Market Access: Immediate access to Impact Jets' network of ~130 operators representing a fleet of ~1,400 aircraft

- Premium Segment: U.S. private aviation represents a $17 billion market with 3+ million flights annually and burning 5.5 million gallons of fuel per day

- High Visibility: Private jet clients are early adopters of best-in-class, reputation-enhancing technologies

- Price Premium: Private aviation clients are less price-sensitive and willing to pay for verified, traceable SAF

- Scalable Model: Success in private aviation would validate XCF's direct-to-customer model for commercial expansion

The Numbers:

- 3 million+ private flights in U.S. in 2024 (40% of global private jet activity)

- ~2 billion gallons of jet fuel consumed annually by U.S. private aviation

- General aviation accounts for 8% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption (~5.5M gallons/day)

- A largely untapped market for SAF with significant growth potential

CEO Mihir Dange commented:

""Private aviation is an emerging frontier for SAF demand, a premium segment combining strong visibility with significant commercial potential. We're not just delivering cleaner fuel; we're transforming the experience of private flight into one of leadership in sustainability.""

#2: Deeply Oversold Technicals Signal Potential Reversal

Multiple technical indicators suggest SAFX may be approaching a near-term reversal from deeply oversold conditions:

- RSI (14): 20.18 (deep oversold territory, well below 30 threshold)

- Stochastic Oscillator: 8.78 (extreme oversold, well below 20)

- CCI (14): -104.67 (oversold signal, below -100)

- Technical Signals: 8 Buy signals, 7 Sell signals, 2 Neutral (per recent analysis)

What Is a Technical Reversal?

According to Investopedia: ""A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. Following a downtrend, a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart.""

When multiple indicators simultaneously reach oversold extremes, it often signals that selling pressure may be exhausted and a technical bounce could be approaching. Combined with fundamental catalysts like the Impact Jets MOU and operational production milestones, this technical setup presents an interesting entry point for technical traders.

Note: Technical indicators should never be used in isolation. They are most valuable when combined with fundamental analysis and catalyst timing. Past technical patterns do not guarantee future performance.

#3: Riding The Massive SAF Market Wave (57.5% CAGR)

XCF Global is strategically positioned to capitalize on one of the fastest-growing markets in the entire energy sector. The SAF market's projected 57.5% compound annual growth rate through 2034 represents an extraordinary expansion trajectory driven by regulatory mandates, corporate commitments, and technological maturity.

Market Drivers Creating Structural Tailwinds:

- Regulatory Momentum: EU mandates requiring 2% SAF in 2025, escalating to 20% by 2035 and 70% by 2050

- UK Mandate: Progressive SAF blending requirements beginning 2025

- U.S. Grand Challenge: Government target of 3 billion gallons SAF production annually by 2030

- Corporate Commitments: Major airlines have committed to 10-35% SAF usage by 2030

- Investment Surge: Billions in capital flowing to SAF production infrastructure

- Technology Scaling: Production costs declining as scale and efficiency improve

The Supply-Demand Gap:

Current global SAF production of ~2 million tonnes in 2025 needs to scale to 15+ million tonnes by 2030 to meet demand projections. This 7.5x increase in just five years creates enormous opportunities for producers with operational capacity and a strong project pipeline like XCF. The company's modular, scalable facility design positions it to capture significant market share as the industry scales.

XCF has announced plans for three additional U.S. sites including a second production facility next to the existing New Rise Reno facility which would double capacity and expand market reach, plus international expansion through licensing partnerships in Australia and potentially other markets. The company's strategic plan includes an investment of ~$300 million; expected to begin construction of New Rise Reno 2 in 2026 . This multi-facility strategy provides geographic diversification and significant scalability.

#5: Government Mandates & Tax Credits Creating Structural Demand

Perhaps the most powerful catalyst: regulatory and financial support creating guaranteed demand for SAF producers like XCF.

U.S. Government Support:

- Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit: Federal tax credits for SAF production

- Inflation Reduction Act: Enhanced tax credits for clean fuel production

- SAF Grand Challenge: USDA/DOE/DOT initiative targeting 3B gallons/year by 2030

- Bipartisan Support: SAF development enjoys rare political consensus

International Mandates:

- EU ReFuelEU Aviation: Mandatory blending starting 2% (2025), rising to 70% (2050)

- UK Mandate: Progressive SAF requirements beginning 2025

- ICAO CORSIA: International carbon offsetting scheme creating SAF demand

What This Means for XCF:

These mandates don't just create demand; they create GUARANTEED demand that airlines must fulfill regardless of price premiums. As one of the few U.S.-based producers, XCF is strategically positioned to capture significant value from both regulatory requirements and government incentives that improve production economics. The combination of mandated blending requirements and favorable tax treatment creates a structural tailwind that should support industry growth through 2050.

Investment Considerations & Risk Factors

Investment Opportunities:

- Early-mover operational advantage in rapidly scaling SAF market

- Multiple near-term catalysts including partnership formalization and production milestones

- 57.5% market CAGR creates rising tide for established producers

- Government support creating structural tailwinds through 2050

- Strategic positioning in high-visibility premium market segments

Material Risk Factors:

- Early-stage company with recent public listing and evolving business model

- SAF currently costs 3-5x conventional jet fuel, requiring subsidies for economic viability

- Feedstock constraints may limit HEFA pathway scaling in the future

- Production ramp risks and operational challenges at New Rise Reno facility

- Competition from well-capitalized incumbents (Neste, TotalEnergies (NYSE:$TTE), Phillips 66 (NYSE:$PSX))

- Recent Nasdaq listing compliance issues (resolved as of October 2025)

- Company has faced challenges with timely SEC filing requirements

- Ongoing landlord and lender disputes related to New Rise Reno facility

- Regulatory and policy uncertainties, particularly regarding tax credit continuity

- High volatility and speculative nature of small-cap clean energy stocks

The Bottom Line

XCF Global represents a high-risk, high-potential opportunity at the intersection of multiple powerful trends: aviation decarbonization, government-mandated SAF adoption, private jet sustainability consciousness, and explosive market growth.

With renewable diesel production underway and the return to SAF production as early as Q1 2026, strategic partnerships expanding into premium markets, deeply oversold technical indicators, and government mandates creating structural demand, SAFX presents an asymmetric risk/reward profile for investors willing to accept the inherent volatility and execution risks of an early-stage SAF producer.

The combination of:

- A massive TAM growing at 57.5% annually

- Operational production advantage vs. competitors

- Strategic positioning in high-value market segments

- Government support creating guaranteed demand

- Multiple near-term catalysts on the horizon

This suggests SAFX merits serious consideration for speculative clean energy portfolios with appropriate position sizing relative to individual risk tolerance and investment objectives.

Key Monitoring Points:

- Additional strategic partnership and offtake agreement announcements

- Formalization of Impact Jets partnership into definitive agreement

- First revenue announcements from ""Powered by XCF SAF"" program

- Production volume updates and ramp progress from New Rise Reno facility

- Quarterly financial results and operational metrics disclosures

- Resolution of landlord and lender disputes

- Progress on additional U.S. production facility development

The quarter also saw growing momentum in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption, reinforcing Neste’s position as the global leader in renewable aviation solutions.

Demand for renewable products increased across Europe during the quarter, driven by a strengthening market environment and ongoing regulatory developments supporting the transition to lower-emission fuels.

Notably, several key markets continued to advance policies encouraging greater uptake of biofuels, including SAF, reaffirming the long-term structural need for renewable solutions in the aviation sector.

President and CEO Heikki Malinen commented: “We delivered improved results in the third quarter, underpinned by the successful continuation of our performance improvement programme and reliable, safe operations. T

“The market environment in Europe strengthened, with increased demand for our products. Middle distillate prices rose from the second-quarter levels and had a positive impact on our result. Furthermore, we observed supportive developments in biofuel regulation across several key markets, reinforcing the long-term structural demand for renewables.

“Our comparable EBITDA in the third quarter reached €531 million. With our performance improvement programme, we achieved €229 million EBITDA run-rate annualised impact by the end of the third quarter.

“Higher inventories in preparation for the planned maintenance activities in Rotterdam and Singapore increased our working capital, resulting in free cash flow of EUR -50 (16) million. Leverage ratio was 38%, well in line with our financial target.”

Neste continues to expand its global SAF production capacity and partnerships with airlines and airports around the world.

The company remains committed to supporting the aviation industry’s transition to lower-emission operations, with SAF capable of reducing lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil jet fuel.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Neste-strengthens-pic-Biofuel-6-11-768x511.png,N,,2025-11-06 03:16:45.356589

Garuda Indonesia aligns with Indonesia’s SAF regulations, while Thai Airways adopts national SAF standards. Philippine Airlines, targeting net-zero by 2050, explores SAF use by 2030. Government blueprints and amendments across the region shape these policies, driving fleet modernization, SAF use, and carbon reduction goals. These regulations are part of a broader regional effort to reduce aviation emissions, with governments implementing market-based measures to foster green aviation.

Singapore Airlines (SIA) – Singapore

Government requirements

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate and SAF levy – Singapore’s Ministry of Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) require all flights departing Singapore to use SAF starting in 2026 with a 1 % SAF target, increasing to 3–5 % by 2030[1]. To implement the SAF mandate, the CAAS (Amendment) Bill (Sept 2025) authorises CAAS to collect a SAF levy and centralise procurement; the levy will provide cost certainty and fund a centralised SAF fund[2]. The bill emphasises that a centralised procurement approach will aggregate demand and secure better commercial terms for airlines[3].

Establishment of SAFCo – In Oct 2025, CAAS announced the creation of Singapore Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company Ltd (SAFCo) to procure SAF and manage the SAF levy. SAFCo will aggregate voluntary demand, contract with suppliers and help achieve the 1 % SAF target in 2026 and 3–5 % by 2030[4]. The company will support the development of a scalable SAF ecosystem[5].

Operational and airport initiatives – Singapore’s 2024 Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint commits to improving air‑traffic management, deploying energy‑efficient operations at Changi Airport, expanding solar power and electrifying all new airside vehicles by 2025 to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050[1].

Impact on Singapore Airlines’ policies

Commitment to net‑zero and fleet modernisation – The SIA Group aims to be net‑zero by 2050. It has a young fleet (average age about 7 years) consisting of fuel‑efficient Airbus A350 and Boeing 787 aircraft, with upcoming Boeing 777‑9 and A350F freighters. The fleet modernisation is aligned with the government’s decarbonisation blueprint[6].

SAF procurement and initiatives – SIA trialled sustainable fuel with CAAS and GenZero, purchasing 1 000 tonnes of neat SAF that reduced ~2 500 tonnes of CO₂. The trial showed voluntary demand alone is insufficient, leading to the mandated SAF requirement[7]. SIA’s FY2024/25 sustainability report states the group purchased 2 000 tonnes of neat SAF and signed an MoU with Aether Fuels to explore SAF derived from carbon feedstock; SIA also joined the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines pledge to replace 5 % of fuel consumption with SAF by 2030[8][9]. As SAF is integrated via SAFCo, SIA will need to plan its fuel procurement and pricing under the government’s levy system.

Operational efficiency and air‑traffic management – The blueprint’s Long Range Air Traffic Flow Management trial with SIA aims to reduce holding times and unnecessary fuel burn, with implementation planned for 2026[10]. SIA also implements weight‑reduction measures and optimised flight plans to save fuel[6].

Garuda Indonesia – Indonesia

Government initiatives

Decarbonisation commitment – Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation (Directorate General of Air Transportation) commits to reducing greenhouse‑gas emissions from aviation to support the Paris Agreement and the country’s 2060 net‑zero goal. A July 2025 Antara News report (state‑run) states that the ministry’s programme includes monitoring emissions, encouraging SAF implementation, carbon offsetting under CORSIA, improving energy efficiency of airport operations and flights, and ensuring transparent emission reporting[11].

Accelerating SAF regulations – An October 2025 Antara article quotes the ministry’s Director of Airworthiness and Aircraft Operations, Sokhib Al Rokhman, saying that Indonesia is strengthening the SAF roadmap, developing monitoring‑reporting mechanisms and implementing CORSIA standards. With proper certification and incentives, the ministry expects domestic SAF adoption to reduce emissions without disrupting operations[12].

Implications for Garuda Indonesia

SAF adoption and compliance – As the national flag carrier, Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with the Ministry of Transportation’s SAF roadmap and the CORSIA reporting requirements. The government’s focus on MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) and certification suggests that airlines will be required to adopt SAF blends and report emissions, which will shape Garuda’s fuel procurement and fleet‑planning strategies.

Operational efficiency – Improvements in energy efficiency at airports and flights, as outlined by the ministry, may require Garuda to invest in newer aircraft, upgrade air‑traffic management procedures, and participate in carbon‑offset programmes. Garuda is also expected to participate in stakeholder collaborations to align operations with national decarbonisation targets.

Thai Airways – Thailand

Government direction

Support for SAF and multi‑sector cooperation – A July 2025 article from the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) (official website) reports on the SEA SAF Forum 2025. CAAT director Air Chief Marshal Manat Chuanpraphrue participated in a session on the “Role of SAF in Aviation Transport Decarbonization.” The article highlights Thailand’s commitment to promoting the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce greenhouse‑gas emissions and emphasises that cooperation between government, private sector and academia is needed to drive a concrete transition[13].

Regional SAF roadmap – According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the Thai Ministry of Energy aimed to finalise guidelines for SAF use by the end of 2024 and there are planned SAF production facilities (e.g., Bangchak’s Phra Khanong plant) expected to start producing SAF in 2025[14]. Although this is an intergovernmental report, it shows that Thai authorities recognise SAF as key to decarbonising aviation.

Impact on Thai Airways

Policy alignment – Thai Airways, as the national flag carrier, is expected to align with Thailand’s emerging SAF guidelines and collaborate with CAAT and energy agencies. Participation in forums indicates the government’s expectation that the airline will adopt SAF when domestic production becomes available.

Fleet and route optimisation – Thailand’s policy environment encourages airlines to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions through fleet renewal and optimised operations. Thai Airways will need to incorporate these requirements into its post‑pandemic restructuring, which includes modernising its fleet and exploring partnerships for SAF supply as domestic production scales up.

Malaysia Airlines – Malaysia

Government policies

Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) – Launched in 2024, the MADB aims for net‑zero aviation emissions by 2050. The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia’s Waypoint document explains that the blueprint sets four strategies: reducing emissions via aircraft technology (18 % contribution), operational improvements (5 %), adoption of SAF (46 %), and market‑based measures such as carbon offsetting (31 %)[15]. The plan calls for integrating SAF into the fuel supply chain, investing in airport infrastructure for next‑generation fuels, electrifying ground vehicles, improving energy efficiency and waste management, and updating environmental management plans[16].

Investment in SAF production – The same document notes that Petronas and partners are building a biorefinery in Johor to produce SAF and other biofuels by 2028[17], indicating a national commitment to local SAF production.

Policy coordination – Implementation involves cross‑ministerial cooperation: the Ministry of Plantation and Commodities will lead the national SAF blending mandate, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability will develop a national carbon‑market policy, and the Ministry of Transport chairs a steering committee to monitor progress[16].

Influence on Malaysia Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero commitment and SAF partnerships – Malaysia Aviation Group (MAG), parent of Malaysia Airlines, supports the MADB. In February 2025, MAG signed an MoU with FatHopes Energy to explore using used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstock for SAF. The partnership aims to collect UCO sustainably and convert it to neat SAF, assess scalability and economic feasibility, and build a local SAF ecosystem, supporting Malaysia’s net‑zero aviation ambitions[18]. This initiative positions Malaysia Airlines to integrate domestic SAF into its operations once production is available.

Passenger engagement and carbon fees – The Waypoint document mentions that Malaysia Airlines offers passengers the option to contribute to carbon‑offset and SAF initiatives, while low‑cost carrier AirAsia may impose a mandatory carbon fee to fund SAF and other sustainability programs[19]. Such mechanisms reflect how environmental policies influence fare structures and customer engagement.

Fleet efficiency and ground operations – The MADB’s call for operational improvements implies that Malaysia Airlines will continue to modernise its fleet and implement fuel‑efficiency programs. Electrification of ground vehicles and energy‑efficient airport operations may require investments in infrastructure at its hubs.

Philippine Airlines – Philippines

Government efforts

Commitment to SAF production – In February 2025, the Department of Transportation (DOTr) announced plans to partner with Boeing to produce and use Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The department said the Philippines has sufficient agricultural waste feedstock to meet its jet‑fuel needs and possibly export SAF. It emphasised that SAF could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80 % and that innovation and partnerships would create jobs and make the Philippines a leader in SAF production[20].

Global aviation engagement – The Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) noted in December 2023 that Philippine delegations to ICAO’s Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels aimed to support sustainable aviation fuel development and that sustainability would be a key theme at the 59th DGCA conference, which the Philippines planned to host in 2024[21].

State‑run news agency reports – A 2023 Philippine News Agency article reported that Philippine Airlines (PAL) aims to achieve net‑zero carbon emissions by 2050. PAL has a holistic carbon‑reduction programme covering flight and ground operations, uses renewable energy in its offices, is exploring SAF, and applies fuel‑efficiency measures such as single‑engine taxiing[22]. Another PNA report from November 2023 quotes a PAL spokesperson stating that the airline is exploring SAF with the aim of using it by 2030; the airline is working with stakeholders to make SAF more affordable and available[23].

Effects on Philippine Airlines’ policies

Net‑zero target and carbon‑reduction programme – PAL’s net‑zero commitment aligns with DOTr’s ambition to make the Philippines a leader in SAF production. PAL has begun renewable energy use in its offices and adopted fuel‑efficiency initiatives (single‑engine taxiing, reduced acceleration altitude)[22].

SAF exploration and timelines – PAL’s plan to start using SAF by 2030 supports the government’s strategy to develop local SAF production. The DOTr–Boeing partnership indicates that feedstock availability and private‑public collaboration will help accelerate SAF use[20].

International collaboration – Participation in ICAO’s alternative‑fuels conferences and the DGCA meeting underscores the Philippines’ commitment to aligning its policies with global decarbonisation goals. PAL will need to comply with future SAF mandates and carbon‑offset schemes resulting from these engagements.

Conclusion

In 2024‑2025, Southeast Asian governments intensified efforts to decarbonise aviation. Singapore legislated a SAF mandate and levy, established a central procurement company, and required improvements in air‑traffic management and airport operations. Indonesia’s transportation ministry accelerated SAF regulations and emphasised CORSIA compliance. Thailand promoted SAF adoption through regulatory guidance and multi‑sector cooperation, while Malaysia launched a comprehensive decarbonisation blueprint prioritising SAF and invested in domestic bio‑refineries. The Philippines pursued SAF partnerships and planned to harness agricultural waste for fuel, while emphasising net‑zero targets and international collaboration.

These policies directly influence airline strategies. Singapore Airlines must procure SAF through the new levy and centralised system, invest in fleet modernisation and participate in operational efficiency trials. Garuda Indonesia will need to comply with SAF roadmaps and reporting requirements. Thai Airways must prepare for SAF adoption and optimize operations as national guidelines solidify. Malaysia Airlines is exploring used‑cooking‑oil‑based SAF and offering passengers carbon‑offset options, aligning with the government’s blueprint. Philippine Airlines pursues a net‑zero target by 2050, exploring SAF with a 2030 timeline and engaging in government‑led partnerships. Together, these actions illustrate how environmental impact and carbon‑emission concerns are reshaping airline policies across Southeast Asia.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-10-31-085959-3.jpg,N,,2025-11-06 03:17:10.107863

Scaling green logistics solutions requires active government intervention, fair regulation, and investment in renewable fuel and electricity production to ensure environmental progress remains financially viable.

Data-driven emissions tracking, stronger collaboration across the supply chain, and customer demand for verified sustainability credentials are making decarbonisation a strategic advantage rather than a compliance exercise.

The industry has long been seen as one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonise, caught between the urgency of global supply chains and the need to cut emissions. With sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in short supply and often prohibitively expensive, stakeholders are rethinking how to keep critical shipments moving while reducing environmental impact.

In the face of limited access to affordable SAF, players are searching for solutions that don’t just wait for greener fuels to arrive. “In the absence of a consistent and affordable supply of sustainable aviation fuel, we believe the industry needs to reengineer supply chains through new technologies and alternative flight capabilities for the distribution of urgent and critical shipments,” said Val Karren, Director of Sustainability at DANX Group.

One example is the use of drones as a supplement to the traditional hub-and-spoke flight pattern. For time-sensitive shipments, this model promises not only efficiency but also a measurable reduction in carbon emissions. “Drones capable of carrying 300–350 kilograms can extend service beyond the immediate hub areas while lowering the intensity ratio of kgCO₂e per tonne-kilometre,” Karren explained.

Creative initiatives beyond carbon reduction

Sustainability is not only about flight operations. On the ground, new approaches are reducing the industry’s reliance on fossil fuels and minimising waste. “We have already replaced ground power units with electric versions, which provide aircraft power during loading, unloading, and start-up without the need for hours of diesel engine use,” said Karren.

Where diesel equipment is still necessary, alternatives are emerging. “HVO is already being used as a replacement fuel to limit CO₂ emissions from fork lift trucks and belt loaders,” he noted. Recycling efforts also play a part: “Full recycling of handling materials, from wood to plastic wraps, provides a small financial return from waste companies.”

Scaling green technologies

Even the most innovative technologies face a fundamental challenge: scaling. “Scaling these solutions will only be possible with continued government intervention,” Karren emphasised. He argued that mandates around SAF adoption must be “backed by fair regulation of how suppliers pass on costs to customers,” otherwise compliance risks becoming “prohibitively expensive for end users.”

The same applies to other alternatives such as HVO and renewable electricity. “We need governments and policymakers to actively stimulate production and storage capacity,” Karren said. Without it, he warned, “scaling will remain slow.”

Speed, cost, and environmental responsibility

For an industry built on speed, sustainability introduces inevitable trade-offs. Electric vehicles, for example, are promising but bring their own challenges. “Their limited battery capacity introduces both logistical and cost challenges,” said Karren. “Careful evaluation of which routes are suitable for EVs is important as the charging infrastructure has to be in place, and charging times can cause delays if not properly planned.”

Costs are another hurdle. “Having to dispatch two EVs to deliver what one diesel powered van or truck could deliver of course creates costs that are hard to carry without direct customer contribution,” he explained. Yet there are encouraging signs. “HVO in a few of our most important markets is at parity—or very close to—with diesel. As we see supply and availability of HVO grow, this provides a great savings of CO₂ emissions vs. diesel without causing pressure on financial margins.”

Measuring, collaborating, and looking ahead

Data is becoming the foundation for sustainability strategies. “Accurate measurement of Scope 3 emissions in a shared logistics network is simply too complex to be managed with traditional tools like spreadsheets,” said Karren. Instead, digital tools are enabling more precise allocation of emissions to customers and helping to build “reduction strategies that align with service level agreements instead of undermining them.”

Collaboration is equally vital. Karren pointed to challenges such as “shared costs, uncoordinated timelines and goals, and a lack of enforcement of industry best practices.” Without stronger alignment between airlines, forwarders, and ground handlers, progress risks being piecemeal.

Yet customer expectations are already driving change. This means sustainability is becoming not just an environmental imperative but also a competitive one. “OEM shippers are increasingly demanding demonstrable ‘green credentials’ from their logistics partners before allowing them to even participate in RFQs,” Karren said.

Looking ahead, he sees major opportunities in next-generation solutions. “One of the most exciting possibilities is the rise of autonomous cargo drones capable of transporting hundreds of kilograms over thousands of kilometres using biofuels or renewable electricity,” Karren concluded.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Page-20-Val-Kerran-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 20:00:17.543759

John Curtis (R-UT) and Maria Cantwell (D-WA) introduced the “Fusion Advanced Manufacturing Parity Act,” which would extend the advanced manufacturing production credit (Section 45X) to fusion energy technologies. The bill provides a 25% production tax credit for a wide range of domestically manufactured fusion components like superconducting magnets, plasma vacuum vessels and fusion heating systems. It also expands the federal critical minerals list to include key materials like deuterium, tritium and helium-3. In the House, Rep. Carol Miller (R-WV) leads the companion bill with Reps. Suzan DelBene (D-WA), Claudia Tenney (R-NY) and Don Beyer (D-VA).

Schumer, Wyden and Warren Send Letters Regarding IRS CEO Position: On Oct. 28, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senate Finance Committee (SFC) Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) sent letters to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Social Security Administrator Frank Bisignano regarding the new chief executive officer position at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In the letter to Commissioner Bisignano, the senators expressed concerns regarding the legality of his dual role as Social Security Administration (SSA) commissioner and the newly created chief executive officer (CEO) of the IRS. They questioned the statutory authority for the IRS CEO position, noting that it bypasses Senate confirmation and raised doubts about his capacity to manage two large federal agencies effectively, especially as they are headquartered in different cities amid significant workforce reductions and operational challenges.

In the letter to Secretary Bessent, the senators raised legal and operational concerns about the appointment of Commissioner Bisignano as “Chief Executive Officer” of the IRS. They argue that this dual role conflicts with Bisignano’s existing duties at the SSA and undermines the need for a full-time, Senate-confirmed IRS commissioner, especially ahead of the 2026 filing season. They questioned the legal basis for delegating IRS commissioner duties to Commissioner Bisignano, the compliance of this arrangement with the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, potential conflicts of interest given ongoing SSA-IRS litigation and requested detailed explanations of the delegation of authority and oversight mechanisms.

Taxpayers Revive IRS Dispute Resolution Program: Last year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) expanded its alternative dispute resolution (ADR) resources to encourage taxpayers to resolve disputes before litigation. Recently, the programs saw a 25% increase in usage by companies and individuals in fiscal year (FY) 2024 and is maintaining that upturn in FY2025. In early October, the IRS announced modifications to its post-appeals mediation (PAM) program, now assigning unresolved cases to Office of Appeals teams with no prior involvement in the case for an expedited, unbiased review. Earlier this year, the IRS relaxed eligibility rules for its Fast Track Settlement program, allowing cases with some ineligible issues still to participate and enabling more taxpayers, especially small businesses/self-employed, to join after points at which such cases have traditionally been excluded from the program, for example, the issuance of a 30-day letter or filing a protest with the Office of Appeals.

ERC Claim Processing Impacted by Government Shutdown: The shutdown is worsening existing difficulties that taxpayers face in claiming the Employee Retention Credit (ERC) for businesses. Thousands of ERC claims remain unprocessed due to a significant IRS backlog that existed even before the shutdown. The shutdown has forced the IRS to reduce staff by roughly half, paused appeals conferences and shuttered the Taxpayer Advocate Service, which normally assists with administrative issues, leaving taxpayers with fewer resources to resolve problems. Meanwhile, a two-year statutory deadline for filing refund suits looms and delayed appeals scheduling risks causing taxpayers to miss critical deadlines.

SCOTUS to Decide Scope of IEEPA Powers: This morning, the U.S. Supreme Court began oral arguments in a landmark case challenging the legality of tariffs imposed by President Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The court will consider whether IEEPA grants the president authority to impose broad tariffs without explicit congressional approval and whether that delegation of power is constitutional under the non-delegation and major questions doctrines. The ruling could significantly affect the scope of executive authority, the separation of powers and future use of emergency economic powers. Oral arguments are scheduled for Nov. 5.

EU Countries Raise Concerns Over U.S. Global Tax Deal: Last week, the United States reportedly moved closer to a deal on coexistence with the OECD’s Pillar Two framework. Some EU countries, including Hungary and Estonia, have voiced skepticism, expressing concern that the United States might undercut Europe’s tax regime. Although the framework is intended to curb harmful tax practices and ensure multinational corporations pay a sufficient amount of tax, negotiations over U.S. exemptions risk weakening international support. OECD officials remain hopeful that a “side-by-side system” could preserve U.S. participation, but the path to a final agreement remains uncertain.

French DST Proposal Draws More Backlash from Congress: Last week, French lawmakers approved an amendment to increase the digital services tax on American technology companies from 3% to 6%. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC), a member of the Senate Finance Committee, criticized the measure and warned that the United States must respond with consequences, arguing that the tax disproportionately targets U.S. digital platforms. The move signals a potential escalation in trade tensions between the two nations, especially as the EU continues to finalize a broad-based trade agreement with the United States.

Asia Trade Deals Include DST Concessions: Last week, the Trump administration signed new trade agreements and frameworks with several Asian countries, including Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand. The deals signal a shift toward addressing digital services taxes (DSTs) through trade agreements rather than traditional tax treaties. Cambodia and Malaysia committed not to impose DSTs or discriminatory taxes on U.S. firms, while Thailand agreed to refrain from adopting such measures.

The French National Assembly has overwhelmingly rejected a provision in the 2026 finance bill that aimed to reduce the tax advantages of E85 ethanol and B100 biodiesel. The proposal sought to eliminate the preferential tax rate on B100, which is primarily used by transporters, and gradually reduce the tax advantage for E85 compared to conventional fuels.

The amendment put forward by Richard Ramos, a deputy from the MoDem party, was approved by 147 votes to 43, after receiving broad support from lawmakers across different political parties. Opponents of the measure included left-wing MPs, as well as those from right-wing and centrist parties. The opposition was primarily driven by concerns over the negative impact on the French agricultural sector, which supplies the raw materials used in these fuels.

A Unified Political Front Against the Reform

The agricultural sector’s mobilization played a key role in the rejection of the measure. The National Federation of Farmers’ Unions (FNSEA), which represents beet and rapeseed producers, strongly opposed the reform, highlighting the negative effects it would have on outlets for farmers’ produce. E85 and B100 biofuels represent crucial markets for agricultural raw materials, with approximately 1% of France’s usable agricultural land currently allocated to these crops.

Deputy Daniel Labaronne (Renaissance) emphasized the need to maintain these tax advantages to “preserve French industries” and avoid greater reliance on imported fossil fuels. He noted that nearly 120,000 French farmers are engaged in producing these biofuels.

Disagreements Over the Definition of Biofuels

The ecologist group, which voted against the amendment for its repeal, questioned the very definition of “biofuel” for products such as E85 and B100. Deputy Benoît Biteau, representing the ecologists, criticized the use of fossil fuel-based fertilizers in the production of these biofuel raw materials. He argued that these agrofuels do not meet ecological criteria and are far from being sustainable alternatives.

On the majority side, Public Accounts Minister Amélie de Montchalin had supported an interim solution that would have phased in the tax increase on B100 over two years, without revisiting the increase on E85. However, this amendment could not be debated before the repeal amendments, due to the order in which votes were held.

La France Insoumise abstained from voting, while the RN group defended the argument that the tax increase would have unfairly penalized motorists using these alternative fuels.
