In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.

Founded in 2016 by the aerospace engineer Mark Lundstrom, Boulder-based Radia is working to build the WindRunner, a plane big enough to transport super-size wind turbines to onshore locations.

In a YouTube video posted by Radia, Lundstrom explains that wind turbines installed in offshore wind farms have blades that can exceed 100 meters (345ft) in length.

However, turbines built on land are typically limited to blades of about 70 meters 230ft - a problem chiefly caused by the challenge of transporting the blades along roads not built for such enormous cargo.

Turbines “simply too big” for road infrastructure

“It’s the inability to move big things that is basically the barrier that prevents us from super-sizing onshore wind turbines,” Lundstrom told an interview with the BBC this week.

In Radia’s video explainer, Lundstrom adds: “The turbines are simply too big to get under bridges, through tunnels, around curves.”

Why are bigger wind turbines important?

By enabling the installation of larger wind turbines in on-shore locations, wind farms’ productivity can be multiplied, notes the U.S. Department of Energy.

“Larger rotor diameters allow wind turbines to sweep more area, capture more wind, and produce more electricity,” the agency says.

“A turbine with longer blades will be able to capture more of the available wind than shorter blades - even in areas with relatively less wind.”

WindRunner dimensions - length, wingspan, payload:

According to Radia, the WindRunner will be 365ft in length, with a 261ft wingspan. Compare that to the Boeing 747, which measures a comparatively paltry 250ft in length and has a 224ft wingspan.

The WindRunner will have a payload volume of 272,000ft³, which the company notes is some 12 times greater than that of the Boeing 747.

The WindRunner’s length and payload would also outstrip those of the Antonov An-225 Mriya, so far the largest airplane ever built.

Built in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, the An-225 was 275ft long, with a payload bay some six times smaller. The craft was destroyed in 2022, during fighting in the Russia-Ukraine war.

Designed with a flying range of 1,200 miles, the WindRunner will run on sustainable aviation fuel, Radia says, and will be able to land on short, unpaved runways.

“It has the capability of […] landing on dirt within a wind farm,” Lundstrom says. “By doing this, we will be able to create the path to the cheapest energy in the world.”

Per Aerospace Global News, Radia aims to complete its first WindRunner in 2028, before pressing the craft into full service by 2030.

“The airline industry does in my view have a serious intent to meet net-zero targets but faces increased challenges in doing so”, John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, said. “Alternative technologies are being pushed further out, which means an increased emphasis on the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which is still in limited supply.”

The delays may also create another obstacle to the planned expansion of Heathrow. The airport said on August 1 that it would “only deliver expansion in a way that is consistent with net zero 2050”. And some analysts believe the hold-up increases the chances of a challenge to Boeing and Airbus from new entrants more eager to take up the environmental mantle.

Aviation is estimated by the International Energy Agency to account for 2.5 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, with a slightly greater — 4 per cent — contribution to global warming thanks to the creation of vapour trails. In the UK, it has a greater share of direct emissions: 9 per cent this year, according to the Climate Change Committee, the government’s independent advisers. That share is forecast to grow to 11 per cent by 2030 and 16 per cent by 2035.

That global emissions share is also likely to increase. After a severe decline during the pandemic, flights are now increasing fast. Iata, the airline trade body, has said passenger numbers will grow nearly 6 per cent this year to just under 5 billion and could hit 16 billion by 2050. As other energy-intensive industries find ways to cut their carbon emissions — electricity replacing blast furnaces in steel, new technology for making cement, and electric vehicles for land transport — aviation’s share of total CO₂ could, by some estimates, rise to 20 per cent by 2050.

Carbon-cutting technology for aviation is proving slow to arrive. Most experts think battery-power will be limited to small commuter aircraft, but there are high hopes for hydrogen. Airbus had invested significantly, including a plan to test a hydrogen fuel-cell engine on a modified A380 superjumbo. But it paused work in February, saying progress on “key enablers”, in particular the production of large amounts of hydrogen from renewable energy, was “slower than anticipated”.

Boeing has been less interested in hydrogen, but said the X-66A could lead to a 10 per cent reduction in emissions. When it cancelled the project it said it would instead concentrate on other designs for thinner, more efficient wings.

Neither manufacturer appears in any rush to bring out radical designs. Airbus’s plan to replace its bestselling A320 family of aircraft envisages something familiar to passengers today, albeit with engines that can be powered by conventional fuels or “sustainable” replacements. That plane is unlikely to enter service until 2035 at the earliest, and probably much later.

Boeing, which has been beset by a series of crises in the past year, also appears to be in no hurry. At its quarterly results on July 29, chief executive Kelly Ortberg said: “I don’t think the market is ready yet for a new airplane.”

• Boeing 737 Max 8: which airlines use the plane and is it safe?

Slow progress on alternative technology means airlines’ hopes rest on the rapid introduction of sustainable fuels — hydrocarbons not pumped from the ground, but made from plants or re-used oils, or directly synthesised. However, the current supply is tiny — a mere 0.53 per cent of total aviation fuel worldwide last year, according to Air Transport Action Group (Atag), which brings together airlines, airports and aerospace manufacturers.

Atag’s Waypoint 2050 report concluded that making enough sustainable fuel to hit net zero would require the construction of 5,000 refineries, costing $1.45 trillion over the next 25 years. IBA, the aviation consultancy, has forecast production of sustainable fuels will hit 18 million tonnes a year by 2035 — but that will be 23 million tonnes short of demand.

Environmental campaigners are scornful. “The only serious remedy [to increasing CO₂ emissions] is demand restraint,” Dr Douglas Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said. “Everything else — the nonsensical offset schemes, the utopian technology forecasts and now the implausible optimism surrounding ‘sustainable’ aviation fuel — is primarily a collection of elaborate misdirection techniques.”

If aviation’s emissions do grow as a proportion of the total, Airbus and Boeing could face societal pressure to do more. Nick Cunningham, managing partner at Agency Partners, an aerospace analysis firm, recently published a note on how “complacency” on decarbonisation posed an “existential risk” to the companies.

Cunningham said planemakers were understandably reluctant to make large investments in new technology. “Boeing does not at the moment have the financial resources to develop an all-new aircraft. Airbus has reason to be wary because some of its development programmes — the A380 and the A400M for example — ended up way over budget.”

• Net zero by 2050 struggles with reality

The Chinese aerospace industry could be a potential challenger. There are now 16 Comac C919s, the first modern Chinese airliner, in service, with a second, larger aircraft, the C929, expected to begin commercial flights towards the end of the decade. Cunningham said, however, that carbon reduction is not China’s main goal. “There could be a challenge from China, but for the moment it is concentrating on replacing imports of western aerospace equipment,” he said.

One potential rival to the Airbus-Boeing hegemony is JetZero, a California-based company set up in 2021. It has ambitious plans to build a radical new type of passenger aircraft: a blended wing body, where the wings and fuselage are one smooth shape. The Northrop Grumman B-2 stealth bomber, used by the US Air Force in the recent attacks against Iran, is such a design.

JetZero claims its design could cut emissions in half compared to conventional designs. It has secured backing from two big US carriers, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines, including a commitment from them to buy aircraft. The USAF has awarded it a development contract for a potential new transport aircraft.

“JetZero is extremely interesting,” Cunningham said. “The backing it has from airlines and the air force give it credibility, and it has very ambitious production plans. Its design would be more efficient than conventional aircraft, and crucially it would lend itself to a switch to hydrogen fuel when that is adopted.”",https://www.thetimes.com/imageserver/image/%2F7a76cc80-d40b-4ce7-a770-c0b6a20a95b8.jpg?crop=2325%2C1308%2C0%2C0&resize=1200,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:18.379222

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.
Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.
“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.” British farmers facing disaster Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.
This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.","Labour’s “flight tax” on airlines will add more than £50 to the cost of a family holiday within a decade, analysis shows.

Net zero rules introduced by Sir Keir Starmer mean planes must be filled with at least 2 per cent sustainable fuel, which will rise to 10 per cent followed by 22 per cent by 2040.

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate means airlines that do not comply with the green policy face heavy fines likely to be passed on in part to passengers.

Costs associated with the new levy are expected to reach £4.5 billion by 2035, according to a new analysis by Public First.

This works out at £12.79 per passenger per flight leaving the UK, adding £51.16 to the average overseas holiday taken by a family of four.

The impact of the policy is expected to hit Britons as soon as 2027, with its cost hitting £200 million in that year.

‘Ludicrous net stupid zero’

By 2030, this figure will have ballooned to £1.5 million, the equivalent to £4.64 per passenger per flight – making a holiday for a family of four £18.56 more expensive.

Richard Tice, the Reform UK deputy leader, told The Telegraph: “This is yet another egregious tax on working citizens to pay for the ludicrous net stupid zero. A Reform government will scrap all this nonsense.”

Greg Smith, a Tory transport minister, said: “Labour said the transition to green aviation would cost pennies but now families are being hit with soaring ticket prices to fund Ed Miliband’s net zero experiment.

“It’s not just weekend getaways being priced out. It’s regional airports under threat, tourism on the ropes, and British families paying the price for Labour’s ideological fantasy.

“The truth is net zero by 2050 is impossible without bankrupting our country and Labour’s plan to chase it will ground British families before it ever lands.”

80pc cost could be passed to consumers

The Government’s own impact assessment of the green mandate found that as much as 80 per cent of its cost could be passed on to consumers.

Labour claims the pledge to use more sustainable fuel will support thousands of jobs while cutting the UK’s transport emissions on the way to becoming a “clean energy superpower”.

The figures come as ministers were urged to relax red tape that means SAF cannot currently be made from non-food grade British-grown wheat.

Phil New led the Government’s independent review into the future of SAF and urged it to consider British bioethanol as a credible and scalable option.

Mr New said: “Ethanol made from British-grown milling wheat, which would otherwise be exported as animal feed, can be processed into SAF in a way that meets the emissions reductions required by the UK’s standards.

‘Home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry’

“This is a real opportunity to create a home-grown, low-carbon aviation fuel industry that supports British agriculture, strengthens fuel security and helps us meet our climate ambitions.”

Ben Hackett, managing director at Vivergo Fuels, added: “The UK has the capability today to produce sustainable aviation fuel from home-grown non-food grade wheat – supporting British farmers, reducing carbon emissions, and improving our energy security. But outdated regulations are blocking this from happening.

“It makes no sense that ethanol from British wheat can be blended into petrol for cars, but not used to make jet fuel, especially when other countries are already moving ahead with this technology.”

The analysis by Public First also found the UK could require the output of seven large-scale bioethanol plants by 2035 to meet growing domestic demand for SAF.

Industry leaders fear that excessive reliance on imported cooking oil could hinder progress in growing domestic demand.

Liz Webster, the founder of Save British Farming, said: “British farmers should be able to grow British wheat to power British planes.

“It’s a win-win, unless we cave to foreign pressure and let down British farmers yet again.”

British farmers facing disaster

Earlier this year, a leaked memo claimed British farmers were facing disaster because of Sir Keir’s trade deal with Donald Trump.

Under the deal struck by Sir Keir, which has not yet come into force, the US will be able to supply Britain with some 1.4 billion litres of duty-free ethanol.

Vivergo runs the UK’s largest bioethanol plant at Saltend in East Yorkshire, but has warned this will have to close without help given from the Government.

This would in turn represent a fresh blow to thousands of British farmers who provide grain to the site.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: “The move to greener fuels has been designed to cut emissions while protecting both industry and consumers from excessive cost increases. Any impact on ticket prices is expected to be within the range of normal year to year changes in air fares.

“Our SAF mandate sets out ambitious but achievable targets. Our approach to growing the UK SAF industry will also support skilled jobs in every part of the country, while boosting economic growth and reducing our emissions.”",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2025/08/03/TELEMMGLPICT000434587637_17542299168040_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?impolicy=OG-Standard,N,,2025-08-03 11:56:23.074738

One of those countries, Japan, has been one of the U.S.’s most dependable trading partners. That deal was announced July 23 and the White House also announced a pact with Indonesia on July 22.

Japan

Japan will invest $550 billion directed by the U.S. to rebuild and expand core American industries, the White House said. The funds, at Trump’s direction, will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s strategic industrial base in five core areas: Energy infrastructure and production; semiconductor manufacturing and research; critical minerals mining, processing, and refining; pharmaceutical and medical production; and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. The White House believes the agreement will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan with an enforceable and transparent trade policy.

The agreement also calls for increased market access for agricultural producers. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75% with a major expansion of import quotas. Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The agreement was applauded by U.S. Meat Export Federation and CEO Dan Halstrom.

“USMEF greatly appreciates the Trump administration with Japan, reassuring and expanding opportunities in the No. 2 export destination for U.S. beef and pork,” Halstrom said. “In President Trump’s first term, the critical U.S.-Japan Trade Agreement was reached, returning U.S. red meat to a level playing field in Japan reinforcing its position as an extremely reliable market.”

According to the information released by the White House, the new agreement focuses on reinforcing the long-term economic partnership between the two countries, which for decades has delivered tremendous benefits for U.S. livestock and meat industries and for Japanese consumers, importers and customers, he added.

Indonesia

The Republic of Indonesia agreed to a framework for negotiating an agreement on reciprocal trade, the White House announced. That agreement builds on a longstanding agreement that was first signed in 1996.

Indonesia will eliminate an approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.

The U.S. will reduce to 19% the reciprocal tariff that was started on April 2 on goods originating in Indonesia, and identify certain commodities that are not naturally available or domestically produced in the U.S. for a further reduction in the reciprocal tariff rate.

In the agricultural front, the two countries agreed to address and prevent barriers to U.S. food and agricultural products in the Indonesia market, including exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes, including commodity balance requirements. It provides permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin designation for all applicable U.S. plant products. The agreement recognizes U.S. regulatory oversight, including the listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

Halstrom said Indonesia is a market with incredible potential and could mean as much as $250 million annually for U.S. beef.

“But today, exports are minimal due to numerous trade barriers,” he said. “We are encouraged to see that the highlights detailed in the U.S.-Indonesia joint statement include resolving key issues such as import licensing, the commodity balance policy and Indonesia’s onerous plant-by-plant approval process.

“For both U.S. beef and U.S. pork, these longstanding restrictions have limited exports to Indonesia. Indonesian importers and consumers are demanding U.S. red meat, and we look forward to the swift conclusion of these negotiations and expanded export opportunities.”

The White House also announced that Indonesia has agreed to purchase soybeans, soybean meal, wheat and cotton with an estimated value of $4.5 billion.

King Charles has put late Queen’s luxury helicopter up for sale with a reported price tag of staggering £5 million.

The eight-seater red 2009 Sikorsky, which was owned by King Charles’ mother since 2019, served the royal family for over 15 years.

Prince William’s father’s decision aligns with the broader shift towards eco-friendly transportation as the 76-year-old monarch will instead use two environmentally friendly jets, believed to cost £8.5m each.

Since last year, the royal family has been using the new AgustaWestland AW139s, which run on 50 per cent sustainable aviation fuel.

The late Queen's opulent chopper’s interior has revealed for the first time after His Majesty put it up for auction.

According to its broker AeroAsset, the helicopter had 5222 hours of flying and comes with “ultraleather and ultrasuede interior panel upholstery.”

The former monarch last travelled in the helicopter from Sandringham to Windsor a few months before she died in 2022.

Not only the flying vehicle, King Charles has also auctioned late Queen’s personal Range Rover, which she used between 2006 and 2008.

The Japanese conglomerate's performance underscores its ability to adapt to volatility while maintaining profitability and long-term growth momentum. For investors seeking stability amid uncertainty, ITOCHU's strategic reinvention and diversified portfolio position it as a compelling case study in resilience-driven value creation.

Resilient Earnings Amid Economic Headwinds

ITOCHU's Q1 2026 results highlight a striking divergence between revenue and profit trends. While total revenue declined 1.1% to ¥3.56 trillion, net profit surged 37% year-on-year to ¥283.9 billion. This outperformance was driven by disciplined asset management and sectoral reallocation. The privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, boosted the Textile segment's profitability by 37%, showcasing ITOCHU's agility in optimizing its portfolio. Similarly, the Food division benefited from Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, while the North American electric-power-related business thrived due to rising electricity demand and maintenance-free operations.

The company's ability to generate robust earnings despite a stronger yen (averaging 144.59 against the dollar) and falling resource prices reflects its strategic focus on high-margin services like logistics and renewable energy. This shift reduces exposure to cyclical commodities and aligns with global decarbonization trends, a critical factor for long-term sustainability.

Strategic Initiatives: Innovation and Diversification

ITOCHU's growth strategy is anchored in three pillars: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), North American energy expansion, and shareholder alignment.

Leading the SAF Revolution

ITOCHU has emerged as a key player in the global transition to cleaner energy. The company completed Phase 1 of a world-first initiative to promote SAF usage, collaborating with partners like ENEOS and Japan Airlines. This effort, validated by third-party verification from Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK), paves the way for a scalable Scope 3 environmental value trading system. By diversifying SAF production pathways—Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)—ITOCHU mitigates feedstock volatility and technological risks. Strategic partnerships with Neste and Raven SR ensure access to 2.2 million tons of HEFA-based SAF capacity by 2026 and 200,000 tons of FT-based SAF by 2025, aligning with Japan's 2030 mandate for 10% SAF blending.

North American Energy Expansion

The North American electric-power-related business is a cornerstone of ITOCHU's energy strategy. Q1 2026 saw a 21% progress toward the annual goal, driven by increased electricity sales revenue and the absence of maintenance disruptions. The company is accelerating investments in solar power and renewable development assets, leveraging tax incentives and global demand for clean energy. With plans to expand peripheral services like operation and maintenance, ITOCHU is positioning itself to capitalize on the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and Europe's ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, creating complementary markets for its SAF exports.

Shareholder Alignment and Financial Discipline

ITOCHU's commitment to shareholder returns is evident in its 50% total payout ratio, exceeding its own Management Policy target. The company maintained a dividend of ¥200 per share and executed a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already completed in Q1. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical in an environment where interest rate uncertainty and potential recessions in developed markets could strain cash flow. A net debt/EBITDA ratio under 0.6x and ¥1 trillion in planned investments underscore ITOCHU's disciplined capital allocation, ensuring it remains financially robust while funding growth.

Risk Mitigation and Global Positioning

ITOCHU's strategic depth is further reinforced by its proactive risk management. The company has expanded PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA, a sustainability service firm, and deepened its Silicon Valley presence to target tech-driven business development. These moves align with global decarbonization trends and diversify revenue streams. However, risks such as potential U.S. trade policy shifts under a “Trump 2.0” administration and yen strength remain. ITOCHU's focus on renewable energy and high-margin services, however, provides a buffer against these uncertainties.

Investment Outlook

For investors, ITOCHU represents a rare blend of defensive qualities and growth potential. Its current valuation (P/E of ~14x) reflects stable earnings from its core trading business while offering exposure to high-growth SAF and renewable energy markets. Analysts project annual revenue growth of 4% and a 2.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings, with return on equity (ROE) expected to reach 14% in three years.

Recommendation: ITOCHU is well-positioned to navigate macroeconomic headwinds through its diversified portfolio, innovative strategies, and financial prudence. Investors seeking exposure to the energy transition and sustainable logistics should consider a long-term position, with a focus on monitoring the company's North American energy projects and currency risk management. With a target net profit of ¥900 billion for FYE 2026 and a clear path to scaling SAF production, ITOCHU exemplifies how strategic agility can turn uncertainty into opportunity.

In a world where resilience is the new competitive edge, ITOCHU Corporation stands out as a model of adaptive leadership—a company not just surviving, but thriving, in the face of global challenges.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:23.746921

Peningkatan harga tiket disebabkan kebijakan baru Pemerintah Singapura yang mewajibkan penggunaan bahan bakar penerbangan ramah lingkungan atau sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dengan komposisi campuran minimal 1 mulai 1 Januari 2026.

Berikut fakta harga tiket pesawat akan naik, pajak karbon masuk hitungan yang dirangkum Okezone, Minggu (3/8/2025).

1. Mulai 1 Januari 2026

""Singapura itu, mulai 1 Januari 2026 itu mandat 1 dengan SAF. Kemudian konsekuensinya, kalau kita belum ada mandat (penggunaan SAF) tetapi pesawat rute internasional kita terbang di wilayah udara lain yang sudah mandat, itu akan kena carbon tax,"" ujarnya saat ditemui pada acara Indonesia Aero Summit 2025 di Jakarta.

Denon menjelaskan, kebijakan Singapura atau negara lain itu akan memicu tambahan beban biaya operasional bagi maskapai, terutama akibat penerapan pajak karbon atau carbon tax yang dikenakan kepada penerbangan yang memasuki atau melintasi wilayah udara negara-negara yang telah menetapkan mandat emisi karbon. Menurutnya, tambahan itu pada akhirnya akan dibebankan kepada penumpang.

2. Tiket Bakal Lebih Mahal

Dengan demikian, tiket pesawat tujuan Singapura dipastikan akan lebih mahal dibandingkan sebelumnya. Kenaikan ini bukan hanya disebabkan oleh harga bahan bakar alternatif yang lebih tinggi, tetapi juga oleh konsekuensi regulasi karbon yang kini semakin ketat di kawasan Asia Tenggara.

""Contohnya kalau sekarang ada rute Garuda ke Amsterdam, itu kan melewati juga sebagian besar Mainland, nah itu akan kena carbon tax, per penumpang,"" tambahnya.

3. Harus Susun Regulasi

INACA mendorong pemerintah untuk menyusun regulasi pengelolaan ruang udara Indonesia. Salah satunya pengenaan carbon tax bagi maskapai asing yang belum menerapkan mandat SAF jika melintasi ruang udara Indonesia.

""Sehingga kalau misalnya ada maskapai lain yang lewat di airspace Indonesia, penerapan pentarifan carbon tax-nya juga harus didesain oleh Indonesia. Karena setiap negara yang dilewati pesawat itu buang karbon di negara mereka, itu kena carbon tax,"" lanjutnya.

4. Transisi Penerbangan Berkelanjutan

INACA mendukung transisi menuju penerbangan berkelanjutan. Di Indonesia sendiri, pemerintah melalui Pertamina dan Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM) tengah mempersiapkan penerapan bioavtur berbasis used cooking oil (minyak jelantah) dengan target campuran sebesar 3 persen pada 2026.

5. Target Net Zero Carbon pada 2060

Langkah ini dilakukan untuk mendukung target nasional mencapai net zero carbon pada 2060.

6. Penerapan Bahan Bakar

INACA menekankan bahwa penerapan bahan bakar ramah lingkungan harus diikuti dengan strategi distribusi yang efisien dan terdesentralisasi agar biaya tidak melonjak tajam. Jika dikelola dengan baik, penggunaan bioavtur dalam negeri diharapkan dapat menekan biaya operasional maskapai dan menjaga harga tiket tetap terjangkau bagi masyarakat.",https://static.rctiplus.id/media/600/files/fta_rcti/news/images/harga_tiket_pesawat-7bDo_large.jpg,N,,2025-08-03 03:56:35.702987

In an unprecedented move towards decarbonizing aviation, Japan Airlines (JAL), ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS Corporation, and a consortium of industry leaders have completed the first phase of a groundbreaking project that aims to foster the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through innovative Scope 3 environmental value trading. This initiative, launched in August 2024, marks a historic step towards achieving more sustainable practices in the aviation sector. The demonstration phase, which ran from August 2024 to March 2025, has set the stage for future expansion, with the goal of significantly reducing aviation’s carbon footprint through the promotion of SAF.

The collaboration among leading companies such as Japan Airlines, ITOCHU Corporation, ENEOS, and Narita International Airport Corporation represents a united effort to develop a platform for trading Scope 3 environmental value. This scheme is designed to incentivize companies in the aviation sector to adopt SAF by facilitating the buying and selling of environmental value associated with its use.

Demonstration Test Phase: Outcomes and Key Findings

The Phase 1 demonstration test allowed the participating companies to assess the effectiveness of Scope 3 environmental value trading. Key findings from this phase include the successful establishment of a platform that brought together multiple companies to trade environmental value, the first successful trades through bilateral contracts, and the confirmation of the system’s transparency and reliability, as evaluated by the third-party organization Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).

The demonstration test was a vital first step in proving the viability of Scope 3 environmental value trading as an effective tool in promoting the use of SAF in the aviation industry. The initiative demonstrated that by registering environmental value and trading it among companies, it is possible to create an economic incentive for adopting SAF and other sustainable practices in aviation.

According to the project partners, this phase provided valuable insights into the operational mechanics of the trading system and helped identify potential challenges that need to be addressed in future phases. Despite these challenges, the results from Phase 1 are seen as a significant milestone in advancing the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts.

Collaboration Among Industry Leaders

The success of the Phase 1 testing is the result of a collaborative effort among a diverse group of companies committed to reducing the environmental impact of aviation. ITOCHU Corporation, a key participant in the project, has been actively promoting the adoption of SAF and Scope 3 environmental value trading as part of its broader sustainability efforts. The company expressed that the success of the demonstration test was a critical step toward the creation of a circular economy within the aviation sector, encouraging further use of SAF and promoting environmental responsibility.

ENEOS Corporation, which is involved in the procurement and production of SAF, also praised the project’s success. The company confirmed that the successful demonstration of Scope 3 environmental value trading was a significant step toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation industry. ENEOS reiterated its commitment to continuing its efforts in SAF production and environmental value trading to support sustainable aviation practices.

Japan Airlines, a major carrier in the initiative, highlighted the importance of environmental value trading as an essential tool for achieving decarbonization in aviation. JAL expressed its intent to continue collaborating with its partners to promote the widespread adoption of SAF and environmental value trading, which it sees as a vital mechanism for the industry’s sustainability.

A New Approach to Promoting SAF Use and Decarbonization

The Scope 3 environmental value trading scheme is unique in its approach to promoting SAF usage and reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint. By creating an economic value for companies adopting SAF, this project has the potential to drive broader adoption of sustainable fuels in the aviation industry. Scope 3 environmental value trading essentially involves the buying and selling of the environmental benefits associated with SAF use, allowing companies to offset their carbon emissions and contribute to the decarbonization of aviation.

In addition to the benefits for companies using SAF, the system also creates a transparent platform that encourages collaboration among various sectors of the aviation industry, from airlines to fuel producers to financial institutions. This collaboration is crucial for creating a sustainable aviation ecosystem, and the success of the demonstration test has paved the way for expanding the initiative in the second phase.

Expansion of the Project in Phase 2

The results of Phase 1 have been promising, and the partners are now preparing for Phase 2, which will see an expansion of the number of participating companies. Phase 2 will focus on increasing the awareness of Scope 3 environmental value trading and accelerating its adoption across the aviation industry. The partners are also looking at ways to address the challenges identified during the demonstration phase and refine the system to make it more efficient and scalable.

The expansion in Phase 2 will also involve an increased effort to integrate the Scope 3 environmental value trading scheme into broader sustainability initiatives, encouraging more companies to participate and create a stronger market for SAF. By expanding the scope of the initiative and building upon the lessons learned in Phase 1, the partners aim to make this system an essential component of aviation’s decarbonization strategy.

Looking Ahead: A Sustainable Future for Aviation

The successful completion of Phase 1 in this pioneering SAF and decarbonization initiative is an exciting step towards achieving a more sustainable future for aviation. The collaboration among Japan Airlines, ITOCHU, ENEOS, and other key players highlights the growing commitment within the industry to reduce its environmental impact and contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.

As Phase 2 of the project moves forward, there is hope that Scope 3 environmental value trading will become a standard practice across the aviation sector. The initiative is not only expected to accelerate the adoption of SAF but also to create a ripple effect across other industries, encouraging more sustainable practices in sectors that contribute to carbon emissions.

For travelers, the successful implementation of such initiatives could lead to more sustainable flying options, with airlines using SAF to reduce their carbon footprint. As the aviation industry continues to evolve, projects like this offer a glimpse into a future where sustainability and travel go hand in hand.

A Step Towards a Greener Aviation Industry

With Phase 1 successfully completed, the Scope 3 environmental value trading initiative marks a major step forward in aviation’s journey towards decarbonization. By leveraging the collective efforts of various industry leaders, this project demonstrates the power of collaboration in addressing global environmental challenges. As the project moves into its second phase, there is optimism that the adoption of SAF and the use of environmental value trading will play a critical role in reducing the carbon footprint of aviation and creating a more sustainable travel industry.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning.
Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks.
However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer.
Investment Implications For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation.","Japan's ITOCHU Corporation, a global trading giant with a diversified portfolio spanning energy, machinery, textiles, and food, has delivered a Q1 FYE2026 performance that underscores its operational resilience in a turbulent global economy. Despite a 1.1% decline in revenue to ¥3.56 trillion, the company reported a staggering 37% year-on-year surge in net profit to ¥283.9 billion. This divergence between top-line and bottom-line results reveals a strategic recalibration that positions ITOCHU to navigate macroeconomic headwinds while capitalizing on emerging opportunities.

Navigating a Fractured Global Market

The first quarter of FYE2026 unfolded against a backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty, fluctuating exchange rates, and resource price volatility. ITOCHU's ability to boost profits despite these challenges speaks to its structural adaptability. The yen's appreciation and falling commodity prices—iron ore dropped from $111 to $98 per ton, and crude oil fell from $85 to $67 per barrel—eroded margins in its Metals & Minerals segment. Yet, the company offset these pressures through strategic asset management and sectoral reallocation.

A key driver was the privatization of DESCENTE, a premium apparel brand, which contributed significantly to the Textile segment's 37% profit growth. By consolidating this asset, ITOCHU not only strengthened its direct-to-consumer model but also leveraged lean management practices to enhance profitability. Meanwhile, the Food division, bolstered by Dole's performance and provisions-related transactions, demonstrated resilience against inflationary pressures.

The company also navigated U.S. tariff risks with relative success. While the immediate impact of Trump-era trade policies on Q1 was limited, ITOCHU remains vigilant about potential escalation. Its North American electric-power-related business, however, thrived due to rising electricity demand and the absence of maintenance costs, highlighting the value of its renewable energy investments.

Strategic Reinvention: From CAPEX to Shareholder Returns

ITOCHU's Q1 results reflect a disciplined approach to capital allocation and long-term positioning. The company executed ¥185 billion in investments approved in FYE2025 and added ¥50 billion in new initiatives, including CAPEX of ¥62 billion. These funds are directed toward high-growth areas such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), cellulose nanofiber-reinforced plastics, and logistics innovations. For instance, the launch of PT PROJECT TREE INDONESIA—a sustainability service company—aligns with global decarbonization trends, while its Silicon Valley expansion targets tech-driven business development.

Shareholder returns remain a priority. ITOCHU maintained its dividend at ¥200 per share and announced a ¥150 billion share buyback program, with ¥40.1 billion already executed by Q1's end. The 50% total payout ratio exceeds its own Management Policy target, signaling confidence in its cash flow generation. This balance between reinvestment and returns is critical for investors seeking both growth and income in an uncertain environment.

Risks and Opportunities in the Outlook

While ITOCHU's Q1 performance is commendable, the road ahead is not without risks. A potential “Trump 2.0” administration could disrupt global trade dynamics, and a recession in developed markets could dampen demand for machinery and energy. Moreover, the yen's strength—averaging 144.59 against the dollar in Q1—continues to pressure resource-based profits.

However, ITOCHU's strategic depth offers a buffer. Its diversified portfolio limits exposure to any single sector, and its focus on high-margin services (e.g., logistics, renewable energy) reduces reliance on cyclical commodities. The company's 2.2% net profit growth guidance for FYE2026, coupled with a robust balance sheet (net debt/EBITDA <0.6x), suggests a conservative yet ambitious approach.

Investment Implications

For investors, ITOCHU's Q1 results present a compelling case for long-term value creation. The company's ability to generate strong earnings growth in a volatile environment, coupled with its proactive reinvestment in sustainable and tech-enabled sectors, positions it as a defensive yet growth-oriented play.

However, prudence is warranted. A 50% total payout ratio is ambitious, and any sharp rise in interest rates or a global economic slowdown could strain cash flow. Investors should monitor ITOCHU's progress in its North American energy projects and its capacity to mitigate currency risks.

In a world where global supply chains are increasingly fragmented and environmental regulations tighten, ITOCHU's blend of operational agility and strategic foresight makes it a standout. As it moves through FYE2026, the company's focus on asset optimization, innovation, and shareholder alignment will be key metrics to watch.

For now, ITOCHU offers a rare combination: resilience in the present and a clear-eyed vision for the future. In an era of uncertainty, that is precisely the kind of business model that can outperform.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 21:56:18.385957

""Selama tahun 2024 dan 2025 industri penerbangan nasional masih belum membaik dan masih menghadapi banyak tantangan baik tantangan global maupun nasional,"" kata Ketua Umum INACA Denon Prawiraatmadja dalam keterangan di Jakarta, dikutip Antara, Sabtu, 2 Agustus.

Menurutnya, memanasnya kondisi geopolitik global mempengaruhi berbagai hal dalam industri penerbangan, seperti terganggunya rantai pasok untuk pesawat dan sparepart, serta harga minyak dan kurs rupiah terhadap dolar Amerika Serikat (AS) yang cenderung meningkat.

Di dalam negeri, katanya lagi, dampak pandemi COVID-19, kebijakan serta iklim usaha yang diwarnai persaingan bisnis tajam, juga membuat industri penerbangan belum kembali seperti sebelum pandemi.

Hal itu mengakibatkan jumlah penumpang domestik untuk penerbangan berjadwal selama tahun 2024 stagnan dengan tahun 2023. Selain itu, jumlah pesawat juga turun karena banyak pesawat yang masuk perawatan Repair and Overhaul (MRO) dan kesulitan mendapatkan spareparts.

Menurutnya, terdapat beberapa tantangan penerbangan nasional, baik untuk maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, dan kargo yang harus disikapi bersama stakeholder penerbangan, yaitu regulasi yang kurang fleksibel; risiko nilai tukar rupiah terhadap dolar AS; pengadaan spareparts; hubungan dengan pengelola bandara dan Airnav.

Kedua, dilanjutkan pembahasan upaya peningkatan kondisi finansial maskapai penerbangan baik maskapai penerbangan berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo dan perintis melalui regulasi operasional bisnis penerbangan yang lebih adil

""Ketiga menyelenggarakan konektivitas penerbangan secara komprehensif dengan sistem hub dan spoke baik untuk penerbangan domestik maupun internasional,"" katanya pula.

Keempat melakukan deregulasi terkait proses ekspor-impor sparepart baik yang melekat maupun tidak melekat di pesawat dengan menggunakan Ilustrated Part Catalog (IPC) serta berdasarkan aturan Tokyo Round dari WTC.

Kelima meningkatkan implementasi safety management system (SMS) dan peningkatan safety culture dalam operasional penerbangan dari semua stakeholder, baik itu regulator (pemerintah), operator penerbangan (maskapai, bandara, MRO), dan masyarakat.

""Keenam dibentuknya Dewan Transportation Board bekerjasama dengan moda transportasi lain dan stakeholder terkait untuk mengembangkan transportasi multi moda dalam rangka mendukung pertumbuhan perekonomian nasional Indonesia,"" ujar Denon.

INACA juga berharap peningkatan dukungan pemangku kepentingan di sektor penerbangan terhadap maskapai penerbangan nasional baik berjadwal, tidak berjadwal, kargo, dan perintis.

Dengan begitu dapat meningkatkan konektivitas penerbangan dan menjembatani kesenjangan pembangunan, mendukung desentralisasi, meningkatkan daya saing komoditas lokal, dan meningkatkan fungsi sebagai katalisator bagi pembangunan ekonomi lokal sehingga memastikan tidak ada wilayah Indonesia yang tertinggal.

After five years in deep storage triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, the final two giants are being readied for service, signaling a renewed era of ultra-luxury and high-capacity air travel.

Etihad Airways is set to reintroduce two more Airbus A380-800 aircraft into its fleet. The move was initially reported by aviation journalist Andreas Spaeth, who identified aircraft A6–APC and A6-APB as the next in line to return to active duty.

Confirmation followed during an Etihad open day held for Wizz Air Abu Dhabi staff in late July 2025. At the event, Arik De, Etihad’s Chief Revenue and Commercial Officer, shared the carrier’s strategy for expanding its A380 operations.

According to the timeline:

A6-APC is scheduled to rejoin the fleet by June 2026

A6-APB will return by January 2027

These two will complement the seven A380s already flying for Etihad, bringing the total to nine by early 2027. One A380, A6-APA, remains in storage but is being parted out and will not return to service.

Etihad’s CEO, Antonoaldo Neves, has expressed a clear long-term vision to keep the A380 flying until at least 2032, bucking the trend of other airlines retiring the type in favor of smaller, more fuel-efficient aircraft. This decision comes as the airline experiences strong demand recovery and expands its global reach.

Currently, Etihad’s A380s serve major international routes from Abu Dhabi (AUH) to destinations including: London (LHR), Paris (CDG), Singapore (SIN), Toronto (YYZ)

A380 service to New York (JFK) was recently dropped due to underperformance, though new long-haul destinations are under review.

Etihad is in full expansion mode. In July 2025 alone, the airline accepted delivery of:

Its first Airbus A321LR (set for commercial service to Phuket starting August 1)

Two Boeing 787 Dreamliners

What are the potential factors driving the growth and Key Trends of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Solution Market?

The growth of the South Korea Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) solution market is being driven by a combination of regulatory pressure, environmental consciousness, and advancements in fuel technology. As global and domestic aviation industries face increasing scrutiny over carbon emissions, South Korea is aligning with international initiatives such as ICAO’s CORSIA and the EU's Fit for 55 package. This has led to a push for decarbonization and sustainability within the aviation sector, making SAF a critical component of future-ready operations. Government incentives, including tax credits and subsidies for biofuel production, are encouraging energy companies and airlines to invest in SAF technologies. The rising cost of conventional jet fuel and the economic volatility associated with fossil fuel markets further reinforce the shift toward more stable and environmentally friendly alternatives like SAF. Additionally, strategic partnerships between airlines, refiners, and biotech firms are accelerating the commercialization and local production capacity of SAF, which is essential to meet domestic demand while minimizing dependence on imports.

Key trends shaping the South Korea SAF solution market include the emergence of advanced feedstock technologies, such as waste oils, algae, and municipal solid waste, which provide more sustainable and scalable sources for fuel production. Technological innovation in hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, and alcohol-to-jet pathways is enhancing fuel performance and reducing lifecycle emissions, making SAF more viable for long-haul and international flights. The market is also witnessing increasing engagement from major Korean carriers who are committing to net-zero targets and trialing SAF-blended flights, often in partnership with global sustainability coalitions. Furthermore, the growth of green airport infrastructure and carbon offset programs is creating a broader ecosystem to support SAF adoption. These developments, coupled with a growing public and corporate emphasis on ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance, are positioning the SAF solution market as a pivotal sector in South Korea’s transition to a low-carbon economy.

Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy.","Fluor Corporation (NYSE: FLR) has always been a barometer of the energy and infrastructure sectors. Its second-quarter 2025 earnings report, however, reveals a company navigating a turbulent landscape. Revenue of $4 billion and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.43 fell short of historical benchmarks, with adjusted EBITDA declining 42% year-over-year to $96 million. Yet, beneath these figures lies a story of strategic recalibration and long-term positioning in megatrends that could redefine global energy systems. For investors, the question is not whether Fluor is struggling, but whether its resilience and adaptability can unlock value in a world increasingly defined by decarbonization and digital transformation.

Headwinds and Hurdles: A Q2 in Context

Fluor's Q2 results reflect the dual pressures of sector-specific challenges and macroeconomic headwinds. The Energy Solutions segment, once a cornerstone of profitability, saw profits plummet from $75 million in Q2 2024 to $15 million, driven by cost overruns on three infrastructure projects and an unexpected $31 million arbitration ruling. Meanwhile, the Mission Solutions segment, while posting a $35 million profit, faced a temporary stop work order on a key airfield project.

The Urban Solutions segment, which reported a modest $29 million profit, has been particularly vulnerable to subcontractor errors and project delays. Fluor's response—strengthening execution teams and taking legal action against underperforming partners—signals a recognition of operational fragilities. Yet, these issues are symptomatic of a broader industry-wide struggle with supply chain bottlenecks and inflationary pressures.

Strategic Resilience: The Long Game in Energy Transition

While the Q2 numbers are sobering, Fluor's long-term value proposition hinges on its alignment with the energy transition. The company's $28.2 billion backlog—80% reimbursable—provides a critical buffer against short-term volatility. This includes high-margin, long-term contracts in hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture, sectors poised for explosive growth.

The LNG Canada project, now shipping its first cargo after achieving Ready for Start-Up (RFSU) for Train 1, exemplifies Fluor's ability to deliver complex, capital-intensive projects. The proposed phase 2 expansion, which could double the facility's size, underscores its relevance in a world increasingly reliant on cleaner energy sources. Meanwhile, Fluor's 51% stake in NuScale Power—a leader in small modular reactors (SMRs)—offers a unique advantage in the nuclear renaissance. A $3.2 billion pretax mark-to-market gain from NuScale in Q2, though non-recurring, highlights the potential of this asset to generate long-term value.

Fluor's foray into green hydrogen and carbon capture further cements its role in the energy transition. The company's expertise in converting existing facilities into renewable fuels production sites—such as the former Come By Chance refinery—positions it to capitalize on the shift toward sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel. Additionally, Fluor's patented Econamine carbon dioxide recovery technology is being deployed in projects like the Albemarle Lithium Conversion Project, aligning with global net-zero targets.

The Infrastructure Imperative: A $57 GW Opportunity

The infrastructure segment remains a double-edged sword for Fluor. While cost overruns and execution challenges have dented profitability, the underlying demand for infrastructure is robust. By 2030, data centers alone are projected to drive 44 GW of additional energy demand, much of it to be met by renewables. Fluor's work on colocation data centers in India and its partnerships with tech firms to deploy AI-optimized power systems position it to benefit from this surge.

However, Fluor must address its operational execution risks. The company's revised 2025 guidance—adjusted EBITDA of $475–525 million and operating cash flow of $200–250 million—reflects a more cautious outlook. Share repurchases have been scaled back to $450–500 million for the year, a sign of fiscal prudence in uncertain times. For investors, the key will be whether Fluor can stabilize its infrastructure segments while accelerating its energy transition bets.

Investment Thesis: Balancing Caution and Opportunity

Fluor's Q2 results underscore the challenges of executing large-scale infrastructure projects in a high-inflation environment. Yet, its strategic focus on energy transition and digital transformation—through tools like Building Information Modeling (BIM) and AI-driven predictive analytics—positions it to outperform in the long run. The company's $2.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, coupled with a manageable debt-to-equity ratio of 0.75, provides flexibility to weather near-term headwinds.

For investors, the path forward is nuanced. Fluor's revised guidance and cash flow challenges suggest caution in the short term. However, its backlog, energy transition expertise, and NuScale stake offer compelling long-term upside. A prudent approach would involve a staggered entry into the stock, with a focus on its exposure to hydrogen, nuclear, and carbon capture—a $2.5 trillion global market by 2030. Historically, a simple buy-and-hold strategy following Fluor's earnings releases has shown promising results, with a 57.14% win rate over three days, 71.43% over ten days, and 78.57% over thirty days, peaking at a 10.47% return on day 59.

Conclusion: A Company at the Crossroads

Fluor Corporation stands at a crossroads. Its Q2 2025 earnings highlight the fragility of its infrastructure business but also the strength of its energy transition strategy. While the near-term outlook is cautious, the company's alignment with megatrends like decarbonization, AI-driven efficiency, and green hydrogen offers a compelling narrative for long-term investors. For those willing to navigate the volatility, Fluor represents a unique opportunity to bet on the future of energy—one modular reactor, one carbon capture project, and one data center at a time.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 15:56:24.396425

This decision, driven by an irreconcilable valuation gap with Air Europa's owners, reflects a broader shift in strategic priorities and underscores the mounting risks facing investors in a sector grappling with financial, regulatory, and environmental headwinds.

A Failed Bid and the Valuation Dilemma

Air France-KLM's €300 million offer for 51% of Air Europa—a valuation of roughly €600 million—was dismissed as insufficient by the Hidalgo family, who valued a 25% stake at the same amount (implying a €960 million total valuation). This discrepancy highlights the challenges of aligning expectations in a market where recovery trajectories remain uncertain. For Air France-KLM, the decision to exit the race was a pragmatic one, avoiding a costly stalemate with stakeholders unwilling to compromise. However, it also signals a recalibration of appetite for large-scale acquisitions in an environment where capital allocation must now balance growth ambitions with profitability pressures.

The airline's repeated attempts to secure a stake in Air Europa—from a 2019 bid derailed by Iberia's interest to a 2021 partnership with Delta Air Lines—underscore the strategic value of Madrid-Barajas as a hub for transatlantic and Latin American routes. Yet the failure to finalize a deal now shifts the spotlight to Lufthansa and Turkish Airlines, both of whom are reportedly circling the Spanish carrier. This dynamic illustrates the intensifying competition for market share in a fragmented industry, where access to key hubs and route networks remains a critical differentiator.

Post-Pandemic Consolidation: Strategic Gains and Structural Risks

The European airline sector is undergoing a wave of consolidation, driven by the need to counteract the pandemic's long-term effects, including reduced consumer demand, higher fuel costs, and the transition to sustainable aviation. Lufthansa's integration of ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's fleet modernization with A350s and 787-10s are emblematic of this trend. These moves aim to enhance unit revenue, reduce costs, and align with 2030 sustainability targets. However, the sector's gains are tempered by systemic risks that investors must scrutinize.

One such risk is the soaring cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is now 4.2 times pricier than conventional jet fuel. While European carriers are investing in SAF partnerships, scaling production will require regulatory incentives and technological breakthroughs. Additionally, supply chain bottlenecks have delayed aircraft deliveries, pushing the average fleet age to 15 years and constraining capacity growth. These constraints are compounded by CORSIA compliance costs, which could drain €1 billion from the sector in 2025 alone.

Regulatory scrutiny further complicates consolidation efforts. The European Commission's evolving merger framework—combining route-based and airport-based market definitions—has raised the bar for approvals. For example, the EC's rejection of the Connect Airways/Flybe merger hinged on the inability to transfer valuable take-off and landing slots, a hurdle that Air Europa's bidders must now navigate. With Brexit-era regulatory duality (e.g., UK Competition and Markets Authority involvement), the path to cross-border deals is fraught with legal and political uncertainties.

Investment Implications: Balancing Resilience and Volatility

Despite these challenges, the sector offers compelling opportunities for investors who can discern resilience amid volatility. The European airline industry's net profit margin improved to 4.3% in 2025, outpacing historical averages in the context of higher operating costs. Low-cost carriers like Ryanair and Wizz Air have accelerated capacity expansion, operating at 105.2% of 2019 levels, while legacy carriers are leveraging premium offerings (e.g., Lufthansa's Allegris brand) to capture higher-yielding passengers.

However, investors must remain cautious. Sudden spikes in fuel prices, geopolitical shocks, or regulatory overreach could erode margins swiftly. For instance, Air France-KLM's recent operating profit of €736 million in Q2 2025 masks underlying fragility: a 2.4% increase in unit revenue per ASK is modest against a backdrop of rising SAF and CORSIA costs. Similarly, Lufthansa's 27% year-on-year profit growth is contingent on maintaining cost discipline and navigating aircraft delivery delays.

For investors, the key is to adopt a diversified approach. Strategic alliances—such as Lufthansa's stake in ITA Airways and Air France-KLM's investment in SAS—offer a safer path to expansion than outright acquisitions. Additionally, companies positioned in premium and intercontinental markets (e.g., British Airways, Air France) are better insulated against price-sensitive demand shifts.

Conclusion: Navigating the New Normal

Air France-KLM's exit from the Air Europa bid is a microcosm of the European airline industry's broader transformation. While consolidation remains a strategic imperative, the sector's risks—ranging from regulatory hurdles to sustainability costs—demand a measured approach. Investors who prioritize flexibility, sustainability alignment, and regulatory foresight will be better positioned to capitalize on the sector's long-term potential. In a market where the only certainty is uncertainty, adaptability will be the ultimate differentiator.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 14:56:11.616668

The project is designed to attract investment for large-scale SAF production facilities, helping to increase the availability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.
SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production.","The University of Sheffield has received significant backing from the UK government to push forward the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), marking a major stride towards cleaner air travel.

During a visit to the university on Monday, 21 July, Aviation Minister Mike Kane MP announced that Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million initiative aimed at commercialising a new SAF production method. The project is designed to attract investment for large-scale SAF production facilities, helping to increase the availability of low-carbon fuels across the aviation sector.

The initiative, known as NextGen-SAF, brings together an international consortium of partners, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK). It has also garnered letters of support from key industry players such as Airbus, Boeing, Qatar Airways, and the City of Doncaster Council.

Traditional SAF production typically relies on bio-based or waste-derived feedstocks, raising questions about the long-term sustainability and scalability of supply. The University of Sheffield’s innovative approach bypasses this challenge. Instead, it uses renewable energy and advanced carbon capture technologies to create synthetic fuel.

At the core of this approach is a method known as Power to Liquid (PtL), which combines renewable electricity and atmospheric or industrial carbon dioxide to produce hydrogen. These elements are then converted into synthetic hydrocarbons, which are refined into SAF.

The process not only holds promise for reducing aviation emissions but could also offer a cost-effective and flexible solution for decarbonising other industrial operations.

NextGen-SAF plans to build the world’s first demonstration plant integrating two breakthrough technologies: a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advanced Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The MCFC is capable of both generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂, while the AFT reactor transforms these components into synthetic fuel. The demonstration plant will test the full system’s performance, with the goal of scaling it up for commercial use.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

“We are proud to lead this pioneering project, made possible through crucial government funding, to develop a new route for producing sustainable aviation fuel. SAF is vital for cutting emissions in aviation, and this work represents a significant step in scaling up domestic SAF production. This project not only aligns with national sustainability goals but also strengthens the UK’s fuel production capabilities and long-term economic growth.”

The announcement comes as part of a wider £63 million funding package from the Department for Transport, supporting 17 projects across the UK aimed at boosting SAF innovation.

“This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution,” said Aviation Minister Mike Kane. “We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and cementing the UK’s place as a global leader in sustainable flight.”

The University of Sheffield is internationally recognised for its leadership in SAF research. Its Energy Innovation Centre is equipped with state-of-the-art pilot-scale testing facilities, enabling close collaboration between researchers and industry to trial clean energy technologies before they’re brought to market.

The university is also home to the UK SAF Clearing House, one of only two centres globally that support fuel producers in gaining certification for SAF to be used in commercial aviation.

Sheffield played a key role in the world’s first transatlantic flight powered entirely by SAF. Its researchers assessed the impact of the fuel on particulate emissions and contrail formation, with findings showing a reduction in emissions of up to 70%, thanks to testing conducted at the Energy Innovation Centre.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-8.png,N,,2025-08-02 11:56:37.484198

Heathrow Airport Aims Long-Term Sustainability Heathrow aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.","LONDON — Heathrow Airport (LHR) has formally submitted a $65 billion (£49 billion) privately financed expansion plan to the UK Government, which includes a third runway and new terminals. If approved, flights could take off from the new runway within a decade.

The expansion will boost connectivity with at least 30 new daily routes, modernised terminals, and capacity for 150 million passengers annually. The project aligns with Heathrow’s net-zero by 2050 commitment and supports long-term UK economic growth.

London Heathrow Plans Third Runway and New Terminals

Heathrow Airport (LHR), home to British Airways (BA) and others, has launched its most ambitious development yet. A third runway measuring 3,500 metres will lift annual capacity to 756,000 aircraft movements and 150 million passengers. Parliament has approved the proposed layout and design.

To support this, Heathrow will expand terminal infrastructure. The plan includes Terminal 5X, three satellite terminals, and a larger Terminal 2. Terminal 5X will serve as a second main entrance to Terminal 5, with a shared transport interchange.

The airport will phase out Terminal 3 and redevelop the Central Terminal Area. These upgrades aim to improve operations and passenger experience. Heathrow wants to streamline transfers across terminals.

Heathrow will invest $27.9 billion (£21 billion) on the third runway and airfield expansion, $16 billion (£12 billion) on new terminals and airport infrastructure, and $20.7 billion (£15 billion) to upgrade existing infrastructure. These costs reflect inflation and project complexity.

The third runway and initial works should finish by the mid-2030s. Terminal upgrades will follow in stages. All funding will come from private investors under a tailored regulatory system.

Heathrow Airport’s Expansion Boosts Economy and Connectivity

Heathrow’s expansion could boost UK GDP by 0.43 percent. The airport supports over $260 billion (£200 billion) in annual trade and connects exporters to 92 percent of global output. A third runway would raise cargo capacity by 50 percent and add long-haul routes.

The plan will improve regional connectivity. Areas like Cornwall, Scotland, and Northern Ireland will gain better access to Heathrow’s global network. Business leaders across the UK welcome the inclusive growth model.

easyJet (U2) plans to scale operations at Heathrow. The carrier sees more competition and lower fares ahead. This may reshape Heathrow’s accessibility for budget travellers.

Surface transport links will also improve. A new road tunnel, two parkways, and upgraded rail connections are planned. Walking and cycling paths will promote greener journeys.

Construction and operations will generate tens of thousands of jobs. Around 60 percent of supply chain spending will support regions beyond London. A community fund will assist local residents.

Heathrow Airport Aims Long-Term Sustainability

Heathrow aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. Since 2019, it has cut flight emissions by 10 percent and ground emissions by 15 percent. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and clean energy drive this strategy.

Redesigned airspace will reduce delays and holding patterns. This improves punctuality and cuts emissions. Current air quality monitors remain within legal limits.

Heathrow has reduced its noise footprint by 41 percent since 2006. Expansion will standardise flight paths and lessen disruption. Environmental assessments will continue throughout the project.

New terminals will adopt energy-efficient designs and support electric vehicles. SAF infrastructure and low-emission ground equipment will be built in. These steps align with the UK’s climate goals.

Heathrow will engage closely with regulators and communities. It aims to set global standards in green aviation. Ongoing consultation will ensure progress is transparent.

Government Support and Industry Backing

Business groups strongly support the expansion. The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, and Federation of Small Businesses see trade and regional growth opportunities. They call it a national priority.

easyJet (U2) endorses the expansion plans. The airline expects better fares and more consumer choice. Heathrow could soon serve more price-sensitive travellers.

Regional airports like Newquay (NQY) back the third runway. They ask for fair slot allocation and affordability. Regional involvement will remain key during planning.

The Heathrow Business Coalition, which includes exporters and logistics firms, supports the project. Members say it will boost competitiveness and supply chains. They view extra capacity as essential.

CEO Thomas Woldbye confirmed Heathrow is ready to proceed with approval. Past projects like Terminals 2 and 5 finished on time and on budget. A government decision is expected by September to maintain timelines.

If you’ve ever wondered why airports seem busier every year, you’re not alone. Boeing, one of the world’s leading aircraft manufacturers, predicts that air travel isn’t just holding steady—it’s about to skyrocket. The company’s latest outlook suggests that by 2044, there could be as many as 50,000 planes crisscrossing our skies. That’s a staggering leap from today’s fleet, and it raises a big question: what’s fueling this massive growth?

How Are Emerging Markets Changing the Aviation Game?

Let’s start with a simple truth: the world is getting more connected, and much of that growth is happening outside traditional aviation powerhouses. Countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are investing heavily in airports, runways, and air traffic control systems. These aren’t just vanity projects—they’re laying the groundwork for millions of new travelers to take to the skies.

Take India, for example. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), India is on track to become the world’s third-largest aviation market by 2026. Airports are expanding, new routes are opening, and low-cost carriers are making air travel accessible to a broader swath of the population. Similar stories are unfolding in Vietnam, Indonesia, and Nigeria, where rising incomes and urbanization are turning air travel from a luxury into a necessity.

What Role Does the Expanding Global Middle Class Play?

Here’s where things get interesting. The global middle class is booming—especially in Asia. The Brookings Institution estimates that by 2030, two-thirds of the world’s middle class will live in Asia. More disposable income means more people booking flights for business, leisure, and family visits.

This isn’t just about vacations, either. As people move into higher income brackets, their expectations shift. They want faster, more convenient ways to travel, both domestically and internationally. Airlines are responding with new routes, better service, and more competitive prices. The result? Air travel becomes the default choice, not just for the wealthy, but for millions of everyday families.

Are Airlines and Airports Ready for This Surge?

Growth is exciting, but it comes with challenges. Airports in rapidly developing regions are racing to keep up with demand. In China alone, more than 200 new airports are planned or under construction, according to the Civil Aviation Administration of China. Meanwhile, airlines are placing record orders for new aircraft, betting big on the future.

But it’s not just about building runways and buying planes. There’s a pressing need for skilled pilots, air traffic controllers, and maintenance crews. The aviation industry is investing in training programs and technology to ensure safety and efficiency keep pace with expansion. Boeing’s own projections highlight a need for over 600,000 new pilots globally by 2040. That’s a hiring spree of epic proportions.

How Will This Boom Affect the Environment?

It’s impossible to talk about aviation’s future without addressing its environmental impact. More planes in the sky mean more carbon emissions—unless the industry adapts. The good news? Airlines and manufacturers are making real strides. Sustainable aviation fuel, lighter materials, and more efficient engines are all part of the equation.

Boeing, for instance, is investing heavily in research to reduce the carbon footprint of its next-generation aircraft. Meanwhile, international agreements like CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) are pushing airlines to offset emissions and invest in greener technologies. It’s not a perfect solution yet, but the momentum is real.

What Does This Mean for Travelers and the Industry?

For travelers, the coming decades promise more choices, better prices, and new destinations. Imagine flying direct from a mid-sized city in Africa to Southeast Asia, or hopping on a budget flight across South America with ease. The democratization of air travel is a win for global connectivity, business, and cultural exchange.

For the industry, the stakes are high. Companies that adapt quickly—by embracing new technologies, investing in sustainability, and training the next generation of aviation professionals—will thrive. Those that don’t may struggle to keep up with the pace of change.

The big takeaway? The future of air travel isn’t about perfection—it’s about smarter adjustments. Start with one change this week, and you’ll likely spot the difference by month’s end. The sky’s not the limit; it’s just the beginning.",https://www.globalvillagespace.com/tech/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/soaring-skies-ahead-as-global-air-travel-set-to-surge-with-expanding-middle-class.avif,N,,2025-08-02 13:56:53.282973

North American airlines have emerged as pioneers in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry. Their leadership is visible in long-term SAF offtake agreements, early infrastructure deployment, and corporate partnerships that foster demand aggregation. As of 2025, five major carriers United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, American Airlines, Air Canada, and JetBlue have committed to substantial SAF volumes, illustrating the increasing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size in the region.

United Airlines leads the charge with a total of 2.9 billion gallons in SAF commitments. Notably, a landmark 1 billion gallon agreement with Cemvita marks a shift toward synthetic fuel pathways. United plans to use 10 million gallons of SAF in 2025, tripling its 2022 volume.

Delta Air Lines has secured offtake agreements totaling 910 million gallons 525 million from Gevo and 385 million from DG Fuels targeting a 5% SAF blend by 2030.

American Airlines has inked deals worth 620 million gallons through 2030. Its partnerships with Aemetis and Gevo include annual deliveries beginning in 2024, reinforcing its strategic SAF ambitions.

Air Canada will deploy 77.6 million liters (20.5 million US gallons) of Neste SAF in 2025, representing 1% of its fuel consumption, with further growth expected under Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations.

JetBlue, while smaller in scope, has launched a 1 million gallon per year SAF program at JFK, marking the first regular SAF supply at that major hub.

These examples reflect growing Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share among North American airlines.

Barriers to Scaling SAF

Despite remarkable progress, the SAF Industry faces systemic barriers that hinder broader adoption. Chief among them are cost premiums, feedstock limitations, infrastructure inadequacies, and inconsistent policy frameworks.

SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel often 2 to 5 times the cost. In Europe, SAF blending mandates are projected to add $1.7 billion in airline costs in 2025 alone. These price disparities reduce competitiveness, especially for carriers operating on tight margins.

Feedstock availability poses another critical challenge. Most SAF today is produced using the HEFA pathway, reliant on used cooking oil and animal fats. However, this feedstock stream is expected to plateau at 2 million tonnes by 2030. Advanced feedstocks like municipal solid waste and cellulosic biomass require intricate logistics and higher processing costs.

Infrastructure remains a bottleneck. Only 25% of North American airports are SAF-capable, and retrofitting facilities is capital intensive. The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market cannot scale unless distribution and blending infrastructure is widely available.

Finally, regulatory fragmentation further complicates progress. The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge sets ambitious voluntary goals, but lacks federal blending mandates. Tax credits under Section 45Z expire between 2024–2027, creating long-term uncertainty. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations are more prescriptive, requiring 1 billion liters of SAF by 2030, but regional differences remain.

Opportunities for Acceleration

Despite these challenges, significant opportunities exist to catalyze SAF Market growth across North America.

Emerging SAF pathways, such as Power-to-Liquid (PtL) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ), promise dramatic lifecycle emissions reductions. United Airlines is investing in Twelve’s CO2-to-fuel technology, which can reduce emissions by up to 90%. DG Fuels is developing timber waste-to-SAF conversion plants with 85% reduction potential.

Corporate demand aggregation is gaining traction. Programs like Eco-Skies Alliance enable cargo and logistics companies (e.g., SEKO Logistics) to co-invest in SAF, creating reliable demand pools and de-risking project financing.

Policy incentives are proving effective. California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) credits and Michigan’s $1.50/gallon SAF tax credit stimulate regional production and feedstock utilization, helping to expand Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Technological integration also supports scaling. Companies like LanzaJet are deploying modular ATJ facilities to lower capital expenditure. Digital platforms, such as SAFc-Registry powered by Chooose, streamline SAF transaction certification and traceability.

Policy and Regulatory Environment

North American policy is evolving to support the SAF Industry, but further alignment is needed to create long-term stability.

In the U.S., the SAF Grand Challenge outlines a goal of 3 billion gallons of annual SAF production by 2030, scaling to 35 billion by 2050. The Inflation Reduction Act offers Section 45Z tax credits of $1.25–$1.75/gallon, contingent on emissions reductions of over 50%.

State-level programs complement federal efforts. California’s LCFS rewards carbon intensity reductions, while Michigan offers per-gallon credits to SAF producers. However, without a federal mandate, airlines and producers still face demand uncertainty.

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations offer more structured targets: 1 billion liters by 2030 (approximately 10% of aviation fuel) and up to 25% by 2035. Provincial mandates and incentives further support regional development, boosting Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Trends.

Strategic Recommendations

To expand the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Size and achieve net-zero aviation by 2050, coordinated efforts are required:

Establish a federal blending mandate in the U.S., starting at 2% in 2025 and scaling to 10% by 2030. This would create predictable demand and incentivize private investment.

Extend and expand tax incentives under Section 45Z and explore Contracts for Difference (CfDs) to reduce financial risk for producers.

Invest in advanced feedstocks such as cellulosic biomass, algae, and direct air capture through grants and tax credit mechanisms.

Fund infrastructure retrofits at major hubs to enhance SAF blending and storage capabilities.

Strengthen partnerships between airlines, SAF producers, and corporations to promote collaborative offtake agreements and boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Share.

Fueling the Future of Flight

North American airlines are setting the global pace in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel. Through bold commitments, innovative partnerships, and policy advocacy, they are building the foundation for a low-carbon aviation sector. Yet realizing the full potential of the SAF Market depends on overcoming high costs, scaling feedstock supply, harmonizing policy, and upgrading infrastructure. As these elements align, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Industry will be poised for exponential growth, enabling aviation to meet its climate goals and reshaping the future of flight.

Investment proposal

The £49bn investment consists of three main elements: £21bn (US$27bn) for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14bn in 2018 due to construction inflation); £12bn (US$16bn) for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X; and £15bn (US$20bn) to modernize the current airport by expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3. The blueprint details a north-western runway up to 3,500m, and increased capacity to accommodate up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers.

According to the airport, a third runway and supporting infrastructure could be ready within a decade, with the full investment across all terminals taking place over the coming decades.

A new road tunnel and plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station have also been proposed. Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transportation, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts.

Advantages

The airport says the expansion would add approximately 30 extra daily domestic routes connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Terminals will be more spacious and accessible, and the once-in-a-generation redesign of the airfield will enable flights to take off more quickly.

Once completed, Heathrow’s plans are projected to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, adding 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn (US$260bn) of annual trade. Expanding Heathrow is expected to deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes.

Local employment

The airport has highlighted the tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East. A community fund is being proposed for the airport’s nearest neighbors.

Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow, said, “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit-for-purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilize and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

Next steps

If the UK government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow will consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

The Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, Make UK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, stated, “The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway – an investment in the nation’s future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs and driving skills across the country.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, added, “Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Sustainable growth

With this proposal, Heathrow has confirmed its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and set targets on noise reduction and air quality. So far, the airport has cut 10% of its carbon from flights since 2019, and 15% of its carbon emissions on the ground. It has plans to further ramp up its world leadership on the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has also reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits.

This proposal is not just an airport expansion—it is an investment in the country’s future.","The London airport of Heathrow unveiled a firm and ready-to-execute proposal this Friday: the construction of a third runway entirely financed with private capital, which could be operational in less than ten years. This project, valued at £21 billion, represents a direct commitment to the economic growth of the UK and its leadership in global connectivity.

More Flights, Better Prices, and Greater Connectivity

The expansion would allow the airport to handle up to 756,000 flights and 150 million passengers annually, unlocking at least 30 new daily routes and strengthening domestic connections. This will translate into more destination options, better schedules, and more competitive fares, thanks to increased competition among airlines.

Additionally, a complete transformation of the airfield is planned, promising faster takeoffs and more spacious, accessible terminals. The new “T5X” terminal, along with the expansion of Terminal 2 and the construction of three satellite terminals, are part of this ambitious overhaul.

Direct and Distributed Economic Impact

The expansion would add 0.43% to the UK’s GDP, with 60% of that benefit generated outside London and the Southeast. Heathrow, already considered the country’s most valuable port with over £200 billion in annual trade, would increase its cargo capacity by 50%.

→ Global Passenger Demand Grows in June, but at a Slower Pace, IATA says

The impact will also be felt in employment: tens of thousands of jobs will be created during the design, construction, and operational phases. Sixty percent of the supply chain spending will benefit companies located outside the London metropolitan area, reinforcing the national character of the project.

Environmental Commitment: Carbon, Noise, and Accessibility

Heathrow is not only betting on growth but also on doing so sustainably. The proposal includes:

A goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

A 10% reduction in flight emissions since 2019 and a 15% reduction in ground emissions.

Promotion of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

A 41% reduction in noise footprint since 2006.

Compliance with air quality limits at all monitoring stations.

Additionally, significant improvements in public transport and airport access will be implemented: increased rail capacity, dedicated cycling and pedestrian routes, a new road tunnel, two dedicated parkways, and upgrades to the busiest bus and coach station in the country.

A Viable, Backed, and Ready Proposal

The plan includes a northwest runway of up to 3,500 meters, an infrastructure already backed by Parliament. Unlike other proposals, Heathrow has years of prior studies and engagement, enabling it to meet government deadlines and begin investments this year, provided the regulatory framework allows it.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye was emphatic: “It’s now or never. We are operating at capacity, affecting trade and connectivity. If the government gives the green light and provides the right regulatory support, we are ready to take off with investments across the country.”

Timeline and Next Steps

2025: Consultation with airlines, local authorities, and the community.

2028: Formal submission of the planning application.

2029: Expected approval.

Next decade: Third runway operational.

The project has the backing of chambers of commerce across the country, unions, educators, and construction sector businesses. All agree that this is a historic opportunity to strengthen access to global markets and secure the UK’s economic future.

An Airport at Capacity, a Nation at Risk

Heathrow currently connects British exporters to 92% of the global economy. Without expansion, the UK risks losing its position as an international hub to European competitors with room to grow.

The expansion plans aim to enable Heathrow to give passengers more choice – at least 30 new daily routes, extra domestic connections and a better selection of flight times to the most popular destinations. Once completed, Heathrow’s plans aim to grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP, add 50% capacity to the country’s most valuable trading port – already enabling more than £200bn of annual trade – while keeping its global competitive edge.

The blueprint submitted to Government today includes:

A north-western runway up to 3,500m – a design that already has Parliamentary support

Increased capacity to serve up to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers

A brand-new terminal ‘T5X’, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals

The investment consists of three main elements: £21 billion for the new runway and airfield infrastructure (up from £14 billion in 2018 due to construction inflation), £12billion for new terminal and stand capacity – the brand new T5X – and £15 billion for modernising the current airport through expanding Terminal 2 and ultimately closing Terminal 3.

A third runway and supporting infrastructure can be ready within a decade and the full investment across all terminals would take place over the coming decades.

Heathrow’s proposals include more choice and capacity on public transport, such as enhanced rail capacity and walking and cycling routes, reducing local and environmental impacts. A new road tunnel, plans for two dedicated parkways and improvements to the country’s busiest bus and coach station will make it easier to reach the airport.

Crucially, Heathrow is confirming its commitment to reach net zero by 2050 and has a deliverable plan to get there, as well as setting targets on noise reduction and air quality. The airport is already ahead of target on its decarbonisation journey, cutting carbon from flights by around 10% since 2019, and carbon on the ground by 15% and has plans to ramp up further its world leadership on the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Heathrow’s noise footprint has reduced by 41% since 2006 and all air quality monitors around the airport are meeting limits. A third runway and redesigned airspace will give communities and passengers more certainty and reliability on flight paths.

There will be tens of thousands of employment opportunities during design, construction and operation, unlocking lifelong careers for those who live closest. Meanwhile 60% of the wider supply chain spend will go to companies outside London and the South-East, a truly national endeavour.

For the airport's nearest neighbours, a community fund is being proposed, and Heathrow will continue to engage on how to be a better neighbour to its local community.

An appropriate regulatory framework needs to be put in place – one that encourages growth and investment while remaining affordable for customers – to secure many tens of billions of private capital from equity shareholders and from debt investors.

Feedback from the Government will be required by September to stay on track for Ministers’ set timeline.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said: “It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country, it is time to clear the way for take-off.”

If the Government implements the necessary policy changes, Heathrow plans to consult with airlines, the local community, local authorities, businesses and others from next year. A planning application is expected to be submitted in 2028.

Support for Heathrow expansion comes from Chambers of Commerce across the whole of the UK, businesses wanting better access to global markets, trade unions reaffirming the career opportunities, while local Chambers of Commerce, educators and construction firms are ready to roll up the sleeves and get to work.

Heathrow has stressed that its role in the country’s economy is unique. Today it connects UK exporters to 92% of the world’s economy in a direct flight. It argues that expanding Heathrow will deliver new long-haul routes to growing economies and increase cargo capacity by 50%, expanding trading opportunities for businesses of all sizes and that without action, the UK is at risk of losing its global aviation hub status in the face of growing competition from European hubs. While international competitors have room to grow, Heathrow is already at capacity. Without expansion the UK’s hub will fall behind, harming opportunities for the country’s economy.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander welcomed the initial proposals for Heathrow expansion. She said: “I am pleased to have received the initial Heathrow expansion proposals - a significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure to drive forward our Plan for Change.

“We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year.”

Kenton Jarvis, CEO, easyJet said: ""The UK business community supports the expansion of Heathrow with a third runway — an investment in the nation's future. The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.""

“Expansion at Heathrow will provide consumer and economic benefits and represents a unique opportunity for easyJet to operate from the airport at scale for the first time and bring with it lower fares for consumers.”

Amy Smith, Managing Director (Interim), Cornwall Airport Newquay, said: “Cornwall Airport Newquay supports infrastructure development that enables true regional connectivity. The proposed third runway at Heathrow has the potential to deliver meaningful hub access for regions like Cornwall - but only if there is a clear and sustained commitment to slot accessibility and affordability for regional carriers and regional routes. Direct and reliable connectivity to a UK hub is vital for Cornwall’s economy, inward investment and the future of sustainable regional aviation.”",,N,,2025-08-01 21:56:29.829336

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.","Gevo has long explored various processes, including synthetic biology and industrial chemistry, to develop cost-competitive pathways to create SAF (synthetic aviation fuel) using alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) methods and exploring the benefits of bio-based feedstocks.

Depending on the feedstocks used and the efficiencies built into the production process, our SAF can offer enough carbon abatement and sustainability as attributes that it can be classified as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Since it is ready to replace petroleum-based jet fuel, our ATJ SAF is demonstrated to meet or exceed the standards in ASTM D1655/7566 specification, which specifies blending up to 50 percent (though we’ve flown test aircraft on 100-percent SAF). Here’s a breakdown:

For flash point, the standard stipulates a 38 degrees C minimum, and ATJ is well within acceptable range at 45 to 50 degrees C.

Both also pass the standard for thermal oxidation stability.

For freezing point, the standard requires -40 degrees C maximum for Jet A and -47 degrees C for Jet A-1, and Jet A-1 complies with -50 degrees C, while ATJ is -78 degrees C.

The energy density standard is 42.8 MJ/kg minimum, and Jet A-1 complies with 42.9 MJ/kg, while ATJ has 44.0 MJ/kg.

The total sulfur content standard is 0.3 percent max, while Jet A-1 comes in at 0.05 percent and ATJ rates at less than 0.00 percent.

SAF Opportunities

While the terms Synthetic Aviation Fuel (SAF) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are often used interchangeably, there are important distinctions. Here’s a helpful breakdown of the determining qualifications for each label:

Synthetic Aviation Fuel

Synthetic aviation fuel refers to hydrocarbons created through chemical synthesis. These fuels can be derived from a wide range of sources, not all of which are sustainable, and have the following characteristics:

Usually considered sustainable aviation fuel only if the production process meets sustainability criteria.

Source materials also are a factor in determining the level of sustainability—not considered inherently sustainable unless made from green H₂ and captured CO₂.

Often made from fossil sources, such as coal or natural gas

Examples include:

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) using electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

CTL (Coal-to-Liquid) using coal

GTL (Gas-to-Liquid) using natural gas

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is an umbrella term for aviation fuels that reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. They must meet sustainability criteria, including feedstock origin and carbon intensity over the lifecycle of the product, and have the following characteristics:

Derived from renewable or waste-based feedstocks.

Must reduce lifecycle CO₂ emissions by at least 50 percent (per ICAO CORSIA standards).

Examples include:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) from used cooking oil or animal fats

FT-SPK (Fischer Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) produced through a process called Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, which converts synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen, into liquid hydrocarbons from solid waste or biomass

ATJ (Alcohol-to-Jet) converts alcohols like ethanol and butanol, derived from renewable sources, into sustainable aviation fuel

PtL (Power-to-Liquid) use renewable electricity to produce hydrogen via electrolysis and then combine it with carbon dioxide (CO2) to synthesize various liquid hydrocarbons fuels.

How Does Gevo Fit in the World of SAF?

Gevo Inc. is a U.S.-based company that produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and they fall into the “Alcohol-to-Jet” (ATJ) category, developing both ATJ and Ethanol-to-Jet (ETJ) pathways.

Gevo SAF at a Glance

Why Gevo’s SAF Is Both Synthetic and Sustainable

Gevo’s process synthesizes jet fuel molecules, but from biologically derived alcohols.

Since the source is renewable (plant-based sugars from regeneratively grown corn) and the process is engineered to minimize emissions, Gevo’s fuel meets sustainability criteria.

Therefore, while it’s chemically synthesized, it is certifiable as sustainable aviation fuel under the ATJ-SPK pathway.

In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).","Sustainable fuels, refinery flexibility, midstream and upstream are focus areas of Chile's state oil company Enap, which plans to invest US$3.78bn in 2025-29, up from US$3.50bn in its previous five-year plan.

Enap, whose bottom line climbed 84% year-on-year in January-June to US$318mn, has earmarked around 70% of its multibillion-dollar war chest to projects, with the balance assigned for maintenance.

Profit growth drivers were increased sales of added-value products, logistics optimization and lower financial costs linked to a debt-reduction process.

Sustainable fuels

In terms of energy diversification, Enap CEO Julio Friedmann, in response to a BNamericas question during a results presentation, said the company was working on three fronts: renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and green hydrogen.

Enap this year announced the launch of a renewable diesel pilot project, employing used cooking oils and infrastructure at its Aconcagua refinery in Valparaíso region. The mining industry was an offtaker of initial production last half, for usage in buses and trucks.

A next phase would involve building a standalone plant.

Echoing comments made by Enap chair Gloria Maldonado earlier in the week, Friedmann said long-term supply contracts would be needed to unlock further investment, adding that renewable diesel production is not something still stuck on the drawing board.

Friedmann said: ""We've got the capacity, today, to produce this renewable diesel; with successful sales and the agreement of long-term supply contracts, we'll be able to finalize the business case to justify the eventual construction of a plant dedicated to renewable diesel

""Depending on sales volumes, on how the market grows, we could, here, think about directing some of the investment plan to increase capacity, dedicated exclusively to renewable diesel.""

In parallel, Enap is sharpening its focus on SAF. The company already supplies the local aviation market with conventional jet fuel.

SAF development would follow a similar trajectory as that of renewable diesel, said Friedmann, adding that conceptual trial work was planned this half.

""We're in talks with airlines, which have expressed interest in the matter,"" Friedmann said.

He said development of this product, like renewable diesel, is not something that is a long way over the horizon.

The UN's civil aviation standards and planning agency, ICAO, is due to publish a Chilean SAF feasibility report this half, BNamericas reported recently. The airline industry aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, which will require a major uptick in SAF usage.

In terms of green hydrogen, Enap has begun ground preparation work at its Cabo Negro industrial site in Magallanes region, where a 1.2MW electrolyzer is due for installation by the end of the year. Output from the US$12mn wind-powered pilot facility, whose construction contract was awarded to Germany's Neuman & Esser, will initially be used in Enap industrial processes, with scope to potentially deploy it elsewhere in the region. Enap staff are receiving technical training.

The Enap facility will join HIF's Haru Oni e-fuels demonstration plant, also in Magallanes.

Refining

Another major pillar is refinery modernization and operational flexibility work, with goals including boosting capacity to process a wider range of crude.

In terms of flexibility, Friedmann referred to the need to mitigate global price and product volatility: ""So we've invested, and that's how it's going to continue. For example, we call it a retrofit – replacing some of the internal components of existing equipment so that we can, for instance, process a wider range of crude oils.""

Logistics, exports

Increasing logistics efficiency is also a key pillar. Enap has 11 ships and four maritime terminals, along with storage infrastructure.

""We're going to place a strong emphasis on modernizing our logistics infrastructure,"" Friedmann said. ""We want it to be more efficient, whether through our own investment plan or through partnerships with third parties we're working with. There's nothing we can announce at this time, as it always involves ongoing discussions and confidentiality agreements, but it's something we're actively working on as well.""

In the sphere of logistics efficiency, Enap is seeking the environmental green light to carry out a US$60mn dredging project at its San Vicente crude and fuel terminal in Biobío region to support the access of larger crude carriers.

""Our investment plan takes into account this dredging work,"" said Friedmann, who added work was underway to boost operational flexibility of the terminal.

This falls under a wider plan to have capacity to potentially export crude. Enap has ramped up oil imports from Argentina's Vaca Muerta shale play via the 110,000b/d Otasa duct, in which it is a stakeholder, along with YPF and Chevron.

In May, 12,000m3/d (75,477b/d) was exported to Enap's Biobío region refinery via the Otasa pipeline, according to data from Argentina's federal energy department.

About 30% of crude refined in Chile today comes from Vaca Muerta. Enap will retain capacity to obtain crude from diverse sources, such as Brazil and Ecuador.

A potential Otasa capacity expansion is being considered.

Upstream

In Chile, Enap operates in the upstream segment in Magallanes region, where the gas it produces supplies local offtakers, among them methanol producer Methanex.

A chunk of cash is earmarked for keeping gas flowing and replacing reserves both in Chile and elsewhere. After exiting Argentina, in terms of its international upstream footprint, Enap today has assets in Ecuador and Egypt.

Friedmann said: ""Part of the investment plan also involves Magallanes and ensuring the long-term supply for that region. Remember, that region is 100% dependent on natural gas production, and also Methanex, which is a private company.""

He added: ""And in our international operations, we've also made it a priority to see how we can responsibly replace reserves – whether through organic or inorganic growth – and that may also require a portion of our investment plan.""

At the end of December, Enap's total reserves stood at 121Mboe, chiefly spread across Chile and Ecuador. In 2024, Enap oil production in Chile was 23,000boe/d (20,000boe/d gas and the balance crude).

Refining capacity is around 224,000b/d, spread across three facilities.",https://cdnimg.bnamericas.com/tHTLxnvmPqLfzCmnIVzZTEwOUWmndaNZJhPnODUpmVSceUQWyUKZZmkzzbRpHroo.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 17:56:33.050738

Conclusion Heathrow's third runway is a transformative project with the potential to unlock £49 billion in economic value and reshape the UK's real estate and aviation sectors.","The proposed third runway at London Heathrow Airport has evolved from a contentious policy debate into a concrete infrastructure project with far-reaching implications for the UK's real estate markets, aviation sector, and regional economies. As the UK government weighs final approval by September 2025, investors and policymakers must assess how this £49 billion endeavor could reshape asset values, industrial demand, and economic connectivity across the country.

Strategic Implications for Real Estate Markets

Heathrow's expansion is already triggering a seismic shift in the West London industrial real estate landscape. Over 850,000 sq. ft. of industrial space within the development zone faces potential displacement, forcing occupiers to relocate to areas like Slough and Reading. This migration is tightening supply in these hubs, driving industrial rents upward. For instance, Slough currently commands £23–£28 per sq. ft., while Park Royal and Uxbridge see rates above £30 per sq. ft. Analysts project further increases as demand intensifies, creating a compelling case for investors to target logistics and warehousing assets in these regions.

The ripple effects extend beyond commercial property. As businesses and their workforces relocate, residential demand in Slough and Reading is likely to rise, buoyed by improved transport links and infrastructure upgrades. While the government has yet to finalize flight paths, the anticipation of increased economic activity alone could spur speculative development in these areas. Investors should monitor local planning decisions and housing supply trends, as residential property values may outpace national averages over the next five years.

Aviation and Environmental Considerations

Heathrow's third runway aims to elevate the UK's global aviation dominance, supporting up to 756,000 flights annually and connecting 92% of the world's economy to the UK. This expansion aligns with the government's broader Airports National Policy Statement, which prioritizes connectivity and economic growth. However, the project faces scrutiny over its carbon footprint. Heathrow's net-zero pledge by 2050 hinges on aggressive adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which currently accounts for less than 1% of jet fuel. The UK's £63 million Advanced Fuels Fund in 2025-26 is a step forward, but scalability remains a challenge.

Investors in the aviation sector must balance the short-term gains from increased passenger and freight traffic against long-term environmental risks. Airlines operating at Heathrow, including British Airways and easyJet, may benefit from expanded routes but could face pressure to offset emissions through SAF investments or carbon credits.

Regional Economic Growth and Diversification

The project's economic benefits are projected to extend beyond London, with 60% of the GDP uplift expected in regions like the Southeast. This aligns with the UK's “levelling up” agenda, aiming to reduce regional disparities. For instance, the relocation of the M25 motorway to a tunnel under the new runway could catalyze industrial growth in nearby areas, while the £15 billion modernization of existing infrastructure will create jobs and stimulate demand for construction materials.

Competing proposals, such as the Arora Group's shorter runway, highlight the government's dilemma between cost efficiency and long-term capacity. Investors should closely follow the September 2025 decision, as it will determine the pace and scale of economic activity.

Investment Opportunities and Risks

Industrial Real Estate: Focus on logistics hubs in Slough, Reading, and Uxbridge, where demand is surging. Consider REITs or private equity funds targeting UK industrial assets.

Infrastructure Providers: Companies involved in airport construction, such as Balfour Beatty or VINCI, could see increased contracts.

Sustainable Aviation: Invest in SAF producers or airlines prioritizing green technology, though this sector remains high-risk.

Regional Development: Monitor freeport-linked projects in Thames, Liverpool, and Teesside, which align with the government's industrial strategy.

Conclusion

Heathrow's third runway is a transformative project with the potential to unlock £49 billion in economic value and reshape the UK's real estate and aviation sectors. While environmental and political challenges persist, the project's strategic importance for global connectivity and regional growth cannot be overstated. Investors who position themselves early in logistics hubs and sustainable aviation may reap significant rewards, provided they navigate the uncertainties of regulatory outcomes and market dynamics. As the UK charts its post-Brexit economic path, Heathrow's expansion offers a rare opportunity to align infrastructure investment with long-term strategic goals.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-02 04:56:47.998656

Heathrow estimates the expansion would contribute around 0.43% to UK GDP, with 60% of economic benefits occurring outside London and the South East. The airport also expects to create employment opportunities through construction and operations, including across its national supply chain.

Additional capacity is intended to support up to 30 new destinations and strengthen domestic connectivity. Heathrow claims increased competition from more airlines operating at the airport would offer passengers a wider choice and could place downward pressure on fares.

Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

It has never been more important or urgent to expand Heathrow. We are effectively operating at capacity to the detriment of trade and connectivity. With a green light from Government and the correct policy support underpinned by a fit for purpose regulatory model, we are ready to mobilise and start investing this year in our supply chain across the country. We are uniquely placed to do this for the country; it is time to clear the way for take-off.

Transport and Environmental Commitments

Despite the controversy of the third-runway plans, the proposals include commitments to the environment and surrounding transport networks. These include improvements to surface transport connections, such as rail capacity enhancements, a new road tunnel, two new parkways, and expanded walking and cycling routes. Plans also involve upgrades to Heathrow’s bus and coach station to improve access for passengers and airport staff.

Environmental measures form part of the submission, including a target for net zero emissions by 2050. Heathrow reports it has already reduced carbon emissions from aircraft by 10% and ground operations by 15% compared with 2019 levels. It plans further use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and airspace redesigns intended to improve reliability and reduce community disruption.

The airport’s noise footprint has reportedly reduced by 41% since 2006, and all current air quality monitoring stations are said to be within legal limits.

Heathrow is now awaiting the Government’s response to keep the project aligned with their proposed roadmap. The airport operator has said it is ready to begin early-stage investment and supply chain mobilisation before the end of this year, subject to policy clarity and regulatory alignment.

The total 49 billion GBP investment comprises:

21 billion GBP for the runway and associated airfield infrastructure

12 billion GBP for the new terminal and additional stand capacity

15 billion GBP for modernisation of existing infrastructure, including a major redevelopment of Terminal 2 and phased closure of Terminal 3

The figures include inflationary increases since previous estimates in 2018 and are subject to adjustment as design and regulatory processes progress.

In this interview, Rebina Pozole, Head of Sustainability at Deutsche Aircraft, shares how the company is tackling sustainability challenges through smarter aircraft design, fuel experimentation, and strategic partnerships-with the D328eco aircraft leading the charge.

“We’ve always reduced fuel for economic reasons-now we’re doing it for environmental ones.”

Pozole explains that while long-term innovation is crucial, OEMs have a responsibility to pursue near-term, feasible solutions. For Deutsche Aircraft, this includes improving aerodynamics, weight, and engine efficiency while also testing alternative fuel types like hydrogen, batteries, and more sustainable hydrocarbon use.

“There aren’t that many energy carriers we can use in aviation. We need to explore realistic alternatives-and SAF is one of them.”

She highlights two tracks of experimentation:

Applied tech testing, like flights using zero-aromatics synthetic fuels

Research-based experimentation, exploring what may be possible in the future

One major milestone? The upcoming D328eco, scheduled for entry into service in late 2027:

“We’re on track. Seeing the aircraft take shape in the hangar-it’s really exciting.”

Pozole also dives into the critical need for deep, technical collaboration between OEMs, fuel producers, and other ecosystem players:

“It’s not just cooperation for the sake of it. We need to understand each other’s technical and business constraints-something we never had to do before.”

Looking ahead, Deutsche Aircraft is actively forming strategic partnerships with SAF producers to ensure their aircraft can fly with 100% PTL zero-aromatics fuel once it’s commercially available.

Questions asked include:

What role do OEMs play in the aviation industry’s sustainability journey?

How is aircraft design being optimized to reduce climate impact?

What are the key challenges in experimenting with new technologies and fuels?

Can you tell us about the progress of the D328eco?

,,2025-08-01 19:32:38+00:00,Canal Solar,Solar fuel used for the first time in commercial aviation - Canal Solar,Caique Amorim,,,,,https://canalsolar.com.br/en/solar-fuel-used-in-commercial-aviation/,"The Swiss company Synhelion, a world leader in the production of synthetic solar fuels, delivered 190 liters of solar fuel to Hamburg Airport in Germany, marking the world's first use of a nearly CO₂-neutral synthetic fuel in commercial flight operations.
The fuel was produced in Jülich, western Germany, using concentrated solar energy to power an innovative thermochemical process.
How does solar fuel work?
Unlike conventional biofuels, produced from organic waste, solar fuel from Synhelion is generated from a combination of solar heat, captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
According to the company, new solar fuel acquisitions are planned for next year, in partnership with SWISS and the Lufthansa Group.","The Swiss company Synhelion, a world leader in the production of synthetic solar fuels, delivered 190 liters of solar fuel to Hamburg Airport in Germany, marking the world's first use of a nearly CO₂-neutral synthetic fuel in commercial flight operations.

SWISS, a partner and investor in Synhelion since 2022, was the first airline to use the product, which covers around 7% of the energy required for a flight between Hamburg and Zurich.

The fuel was produced in Jülich, western Germany, using concentrated solar energy to power an innovative thermochemical process.

Synthetic crude oil, called syncrude, was processed in a refinery in northern Germany and subsequently integrated into the airport's conventional supply system, demonstrating that no modifications to the existing infrastructure are necessary to adopt this technology.

How does solar fuel work?

Unlike conventional biofuels, produced from organic waste, solar fuel from Synhelion is generated from a combination of solar heat, captured carbon dioxide and hydrogen.

The thermochemical process used by the company results in liquid fuels, such as kerosene, gasoline and diesel, with net CO₂ emissions up to 99% lower than those used in conventional fuels. fossil fuels.

The most significant innovation lies in the process's energy self-sufficiency: solar heat is stored and allows production to occur 24 hours a day, making the model scalable and less dependent on climate variations.

The future of solar flights

Although annual production is still modest, the growth potential is enormous. The DAWN demonstration plant, which began operations in late summer 2024, already produces limited quantities of fuel and is being expanded.

According to the company, new solar fuel acquisitions are planned for next year, in partnership with SWISS and the Lufthansa Group.

In the medium term, costs may still be reflected in the price of air tickets, but these values are expected to fall with increased production scale and the support of public policies.

Synhelion claims its technology is “drop-in,” meaning it is fully compatible with current engines and existing logistics infrastructure, which significantly facilitates its adoption.

In addition to aviation, the company also plans to distribute sustainable gasoline and diesel for land vehicles, ships and passenger buses at airports, as already planned for Zurich Airport from 2027.

Scaling and challenges

Despite the progress, expanding large-scale production still faces challenges. The biggest is the high investment cost of building plants capable of supplying the global market.

A recent example was the cancellation of the plant that was to be built in Spain, scheduled for 2027, due to difficulties in environmental licensing.

In response, Synhelion decided to expand its current facility in Jülich, building a plant approximately ten times larger. The goal is to reach annual production of 2030 tons by 100 with the future SHINE plant, the first truly competitive industrial-scale solar production complex.

Commitments to European sustainability

The initiative is in line with EU (European Union) targets, which require that, by 2050, 70% of flights on the continent use sustainable fuels.

From 2024, all airlines operating in the EU must ensure that at least 2% of the fuel used is SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), which represents around 1 million tonnes per year.

To meet the requirements of the EU's RED (Renewable Energy Directive), Synhelion's production undergoes independent audits and uses sustainable, traceable raw materials capable of guaranteeing a minimum 70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions throughout the life cycle.

Furthermore, the co-processing process, which mixes renewable raw materials with fossil fuels in existing refineries, allows for a gradual, rapid and cost-effective transition, without the need for new infrastructure, meeting technical certification standards such as ASTM D1655.",https://bcb27500.delivery.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/synhelion-solar-fuel-delivery-swiss.webp,N,,2025-08-01 22:56:39.797781

Here’s how it is cutting Scope 1 and 2 emissions from its operations:

It targets a 46% emissions cut by 2030, based on 2019 levels. The goal is to reach net zero emissions from its operations by 2050. This includes emissions from engine testing, which have increased due to higher development activity.

The company plans to use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in tests. They are shifting to clean power sources and installing batteries in locations like Friedrichshafen. Additionally, they are also buying renewable energy and focusing on efficiency improvements.

In 2024, total Scope 1 and 2 emissions increased to 301 ktCO2e. This rise includes a 55 ktCO2e jump in test-related emissions.

However, operational emissions dropped by 5 ktCO2e, a 3% decrease, which indicates progress.

Scope 3 Focus: Tackling Value Chain Emissions

Beyond direct emissions, Rolls-Royce is addressing Scope 3 emissions—especially from the use of its products (category 11) and purchased goods and services (category 1). These are major sources, with purchased goods accounting for 2.18 MtCO2e in 2024, around 2.5% of total emissions.

It is working with suppliers to set net zero targets, partnering with logistics firms for low-emission transport, and promoting resource efficiency to reduce waste.

Innovation for Cleaner Products

Rolls-Royce is investing significantly in future-ready, low-carbon products. They aim to ramp up their R&D spending on net-zero technologies by 75% this year.

Notable milestones include the UltraFan engine, a next-gen demonstrator with high fuel efficiency and SAF compatibility. All current in-production aero engines are certified to run on 100% sustainable aviation fuel. The company’s SMR projects aim to deliver scalable, clean electricity to national grids.

These projects are vital for its net-zero strategy and essential for decarbonizing the heavy industry and global aviation sectors.

All in all, Rolls-Royce demonstrates that climate action and financial growth can be mutually beneficial. From record profits to world-class clean tech investments, Rolls-Royce exemplifies how legacy companies can become climate leaders even without carbon credits. This approach helps create a responsible and profitable future.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_2147915845.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 13:56:22.736689

The feasibility study conducted by HAMR Energy identified refining technologies that offer a commercially viable path to converting methanol into SAF.
The study also assessed critical project considerations such as access to renewable energy, proximity to key markets, and construction economics.
This can lead to new regional employment opportunities, enhanced energy security, and better use of our renewable and biomass resources.
Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.” This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round.","HAMR Energy, a prominent developer of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLF), has unveiled its intention to establish Australia’s first major methanol-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production facility. With an estimated investment of $700–800 million, the proposed facility is designed to significantly reduce the carbon footprint of the aviation industry while generating hundreds of new jobs across construction and long-term operations.

This milestone announcement comes after the successful completion of a comprehensive feasibility study, positioning the project as a critical step in HAMR Energy’s broader plan to harness new international regulations that permit the use of methanol as a feedstock in SAF production. Methanol, which can be derived from a variety of renewable sources, is emerging as a game-changer in aviation fuel development due to its scalability, versatility, and ability to serve as a drop-in fuel for existing aircraft infrastructure.

The proposed facility will utilize approximately 300,000 tonnes of low-carbon methanol—produced from forestry waste and green hydrogen at HAMR’s Portland Renewable Fuels project—to generate around 125 million litres of SAF annually. This output would be sufficient to decarbonize nearly 3.5 million economy-class flights between Sydney and Melbourne each year, helping to bridge the global SAF supply gap, which is projected to reach 10 million tonnes by 2030.

The feasibility study conducted by HAMR Energy identified refining technologies that offer a commercially viable path to converting methanol into SAF. The study also assessed critical project considerations such as access to renewable energy, proximity to key markets, and construction economics. Based on these findings, South Australia and Victoria have emerged as the most promising regions for establishing the new facility.

HAMR Energy's vertically integrated approach—encompassing the entire production chain from biomass to final fuel—enables it to maintain one of the industry's lowest production costs. This is particularly attractive to airlines and other SAF buyers that are urgently seeking affordable and scalable decarbonization solutions. The company has already secured supply agreements for limited renewable biomass feedstock, further enhancing project viability.

Co-founder David Stribley emphasized the national benefits of this initiative, stating, “With appropriate policy support, Australia is well-positioned to develop a globally competitive LCLF industry. This can lead to new regional employment opportunities, enhanced energy security, and better use of our renewable and biomass resources. Our methanol-to-jet fuel project highlights how we can deliver investment-ready, competitive infrastructure that aids decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors like aviation.”

This announcement builds on recent momentum for HAMR Energy, as it nears completion of a $10 million Series A funding round. The round has attracted considerable interest from strategic partners and private investors, signaling growing confidence in the company’s vision and execution capabilities.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-01 12:56:19.462268

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played.
The lesson of collective wisdom In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares.
Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued.
It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.","Leaders aren’t typically known for playing games, but maybe it’s time they should, at least this one. It’s called the World Peace Game, and if you’re a leader with even the slightest interest in adaptability, resilience or how to grow the value of something, it’s time you had a look.

On its surface alone, two things immediately stand out. First, in no small way, the game is about dealing with uncertainty. The World Peace Game’s version takes the form of a hands-on political simulation made up of dozens of complex and interlocking problems — actual real-world problems that inhibit actual world peace. Within the game, players take on the roles of countries, international bodies, forces of nature and even ambiguity itself. Their objective is to solve every interlocking problem while leaving no player worse off at the end than they were at the start. The second and more bracing fact? The game was designed to be played by fourth graders.

Before you scoff at any of this or its relevance, you should know that the World Peace Game’s nine and ten-year-old players have more than once been invited to the Pentagon alongside the game’s creator, John Hunter, to consult with the secretary of defense and its generals about what they might learn from these short-in-stature but long-on-wisdom preteen leaders. If you’re a senior leader, those facts alone should have you asking, “What could this game teach me about how to lead better?”

A different view of leadership in uncertainty

Leading at any time is hard, but leading in uncertain times demands a new view. Uncertainty is every leader’s new abnormal, and in that unfamiliar terrain, the message is clear: What worked in the past won’t work now. What that means is that it’s high time you stopped looking in the usual places and to the usual suspects for leadership guidance.

Even before you play it, the World Peace Game offers you a fresh perspective simply by learning how it’s played. One awakening is learning who leads. Though the grown-ups (teachers and school administrators) choose the game, once the basic guidelines for play have been shared, the kids take over. You heard right. Those who by default and title typically lead literally step back and rely on those on the front lines to create, collaborate and solve. Across an intense week of play, the kids not only direct the game, they do it exceptionally, not just solving the challenges presented, but remarkably finding different ways to solve them every time.

The flipping of roles offers a powerful and uncommon chance for everyone to see bigger. It causes both students and teachers to revisit well-worn habits and see through new eyes. The approach quite naturally expands critical and creative thinking while supplanting black-and-white assumptions with a mindset of “what if …” There are countless other advantages and insights the game offers, yet even this one example alone stands in marked contrast to most real-world leadership. More than just a game, Hunter accurately describes it as “a flexible, renewable practice.”

The game teaches so much more, with many of those lessons easily gleaned by watching Hunter’s first TED Talk or reading his wonderfully titled book, World Peace and Other Fourth Grade Achievements. But whether you look further into this powerful game or not, there’s one lesson that must be shared here and now. It’s a lesson every leader in this new abnormal needs to embrace – not someday, but right now.

The lesson of collective wisdom

In a recent conversation, Executive Director of the World Peace Game Foundation Robin Klingler offered what just might be the most vital lesson the game shares. To her, it’s foundational and something she stays in touch with every day. Yet for many leaders, it’s a lesson overlooked and undervalued. “The Game doesn’t work without collective wisdom,” Klingler remarked. What’s obvious to her is hidden in plain sight for many leaders, in part because, despite these deeply uncertain times, we still carry around the mythology that leadership and the individual leader are one in the same. It’s never been true, but in an uncertain world, holding onto that expectation is a dangerous strategy.

The key to comfort with the unknown

More than just an insight about the World Peace Game, Klingler’s observation may just be the best advice any leader on any front can embrace if thriving in uncertain times is their goal. Indeed, collective wisdom and the range of knowledge and experience it implies have repeatedly been shown, including by Harvard Business Review, to make teams smarter, more resilient and perhaps most vital in uncertain times, “more likely to constantly reexamine facts and remain objective.” In short, more than a nice aphorism, Klingler’s insight is the fulcrum for the change leaders need and the key to the lasting success they seek. As Hunter says, the game is ultimately about learning to live and work comfortably in the unknown. Without collective wisdom, it’s a pretty tough lesson to master.

This agreement paves the way for jointly exploring the development of a small-scale commercial cellulosic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility, strategically co-located at RYAM’s Jesup, Georgia site.

The proposed project represents a forward-thinking initiative in the rapidly evolving clean energy sector. Under the terms of the MoU, GranBio will take the lead in this ambitious endeavor, deploying its cutting-edge proprietary AVAP® technology. This advanced process is designed to efficiently convert lignocellulosic biomass – a renewable resource derived from plant matter – into second-generation ethanol. This ethanol will then undergo further upgrading to produce SAF, a crucial component in the global effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. The produced SAF will be subsequently sold to an identified offtaker, ensuring a direct pathway to market.

A key advantage of this collaboration lies in its synergistic approach. The new facility is set to capitalize on RYAM’s extensive existing infrastructure at its Jesup plant. The project is poised to receive substantial financial backing, partially through a $100 million grant awarded to GranBio by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Beyond the immediate benefits of the SAF project, this MoU holds significant strategic implications for RYAM. Should the project successfully move forward, RYAM stands to gain a license to GranBio’s latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP® technologies.

When we hire and train with sustainability in mind, we’re not just filling jobs, we’re helping aviation reach its net‑zero future.”

— Giovanna Mirabile

KALKARA, SOUTH EAST, MALTA, August 1, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As airlines work to cut carbon emissions and meet net-zero targets by 2050, one area is starting to gain more attention: human resources.

While much of the aviation industry’s climate focus has been on cleaner fuels and electric ground vehicles, experts say the people behind daily operations could play just as important a role. From hiring and training to digital systems and flexible work, HR departments are beginning to influence how airlines meet their environmental goals.

Aviation makes up about 2.5% of global carbon emissions, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). And with air travel expected to grow, reducing that number will require change across the entire industry, not just in engineering.

One growing trend is known as sustainability in aviation HR. This means bringing climate awareness into how companies hire, train, and manage staff. It includes looking for employees who understand environmental issues, offering training on topics like energy efficiency, and encouraging low-impact travel to and from work.

Some companies have already started making changes. For example, many airlines in Europe have moved support roles to remote or hybrid work models. This has led to fewer internal flights and commuting, helping cut travel-related emissions by up to 40%. A study from Cornell University and Microsoft in 2023 found that full-time remote work can reduce a worker’s carbon footprint by more than half. Even hybrid models can cut emissions by nearly 30%.

Digital tools are also making a difference. HR teams are switching from paper-based processes to cloud systems, electronic contracts, and online payroll. A 2024 report from the Global Sustainable Aviation Forum found that digital HR operations can lower administrative emissions by up to 30% over five years.

Some companies are also offering green onboarding. One large maintenance provider in the Middle East recently added a sustainability module to its new employee training. It covers things like sorting waste, saving energy, and using lower-emission transport options like e-bikes or carpooling. The company saw a 17% improvement in recycling and a 12% drop in energy use within a year.

As airlines invest more in clean technologies like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electric equipment, they also need skilled people to manage those changes. HR teams are helping by quickly hiring and placing the right staff in new green projects. According to IATA, SAF use is expected to grow from less than 1% of fuel today to 10% by 2030, which means more training and hiring will be needed.

Aviation HR provider Aeroates is one example of a company helping airlines plan for this shift. They work with clients to add sustainability goals to job descriptions, build digital systems, and stay up to date with environmental rules and regulations.

There is also evidence that these changes are good for business. A 2025 survey by Deloitte found that 67% of airline executives saw better employee engagement when HR policies supported sustainability. More than half said their teams also became more efficient.

While aircraft design and clean fuel remain central to cutting emissions, many in the industry now believe people will play a bigger role than expected. Culture, behaviour, and day-to-day choices all matter, and that is where HR comes in.

With just 25 years left to hit net-zero targets, aviation companies are realising that sustainability needs to reach every part of the business. That includes the people who help it run every day. Human resources may not have been part of the climate conversation in the past, but it is becoming a key part of the solution.

The University of Sheffield is to lead a new £1.5 million UK government-funded project to speed up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and help bring passengers a step closer to greener flights

Sheffield will lead a consortium to commercialise its innovative SAF production pathway that can produce cleaner aviation fuel using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology

Consortium plans to attract investors to build SAF demonstration and production plants to boost the supply of UK-homegrown fuel

The University of Sheffield has been awarded UK government funding to accelerate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and bring passengers a step closer to greener flights.

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, during a visit to the University (Monday 21 July), Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain. The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF – a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF. The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said:

We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK. This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister, Mike Kane said:

This £63 million is lift-off for Britain’s green aviation revolution.

We’re not just backing brilliant British innovation, we’re creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

“From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.”

The University of Sheffield is one of the world’s leading universities for sustainable aviation fuel R&D. Its Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe, which include pilot scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House – one of only two centres in the world – that support fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel. Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 per cent reduction in emission levels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said:

It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

“At Sheffield we have some of the most advanced SAF research facilities in Europe and are excited to work with partners from the industry to help them test and develop new fuels and next generation clean energy technologies.”

The agreement with Cemvita could establish Rio Grande do Sul as a global hub for innovation in the circular bioeconomy.

Earlier this year, Cemvita announced a partnership with Be8, a biofuel pioneer, also located in Rio Grande do Sul to strengthen the SAF value chain, reinforcing Be8's long term goal to become sustainable biofuel solutions provider.

The signing ceremony was attended by acting governor Gabriel Souza, Invest RS CEO Rafael Prikladnicki, Cemvita CEO Moji Karimi, and Cemvita’s Strategy & Business Development Director, Fernando Borba at Palácio Piratini. The document formalizes the company's intention to install a sustainable oil production facility in Rio Grande do Sul, consolidating the state as a global hub for innovation in the circular bioeconomy.

“Rio Grande do Sul takes another important step toward becoming a global reference in innovation and bioeconomy. This partnership with Cemvita reinforces our commitment to sustainability, the attraction of high-impact investments, and the creation of opportunities for the people of Rio Grande do Sul in strategic sectors such as renewable energy, agriculture, and industry,” stated acting governor Gabriel Souza.

The facility will be used to produce low-carbon oil derived from crude glycerol, which will serve as feedstock for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The site will also produce a biofertilizer that supports regenerative agricultural practices. Earlier this year, Cemvita announced a partnership with Be8, a biofuel pioneer also based in Rio Grande do Sul, to strengthen the SAF value chain—reinforcing Be8’s long-term goal of becoming a provider of sustainable biofuel solutions.

“The signing of this engagement agreement with Cemvita marks a strategic milestone for Rio Grande do Sul and reinforces our leadership in innovation and technology. Invest RS’s role is precisely to enable projects like this, connecting companies with our state and offering technical support and tailored solutions,” said Rafael Prikladnicki, President of Invest RS.

Invest RS provides specialized technical support, institutional coordination, value chain mapping, identification of industrial areas, and assistance in securing economic and tax incentives. The state was chosen strategically due to its robust infrastructure, availability of crude glycerol, and strong track record in low-carbon public policies.

“This is a project that combines development and sustainability, fully aligned with the guidelines of our Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Development Plan, and one that strengthens the state's business-friendly environment by making it the choice of this American company,” said Deputy Secretary of Economic Development, Leandro Evaldt.

The plant will be the first in the world to operate at industrial scale using this bioconversion technology. The project represents a major technological leap that positions the state at the forefront of the energy transition, with direct impact on sectors such as aviation, agriculture, and renewable energy.

“Brazil, and especially Rio Grande do Sul, aligns perfectly with Cemvita’s strategic vision,” said Moji Karimi, CEO of Cemvita. “It offers the infrastructure, regulatory environment, and feedstocks needed to scale up our waste-to-value platform. We’re excited to find public and private partners equally committed to driving a low-carbon transition.”

This will be the first industrial-scale plant in the world using this technology, placing Rio Grande do Sul at the forefront of global innovation in circular bioeconomy. The facility represents a technological leap that integrates sustainable aviation fuel production with bio-based agricultural inputs, advancing global decarbonization efforts.

Industrial hemp is a miracle crop. It grows fast, absorbs up to 15 tonnes of CO2 per hectare, and can be used for building materials, textiles, and fuel. It needs little water, no pesticides, and improves soil quality. When you grow hemp, you grow hope.

Hemp is also a powerful tool for carbon removal. As it grows, it absorbs carbon from the air and locks it in the biomass. We use this carbon to build hempcrete homes or make sustainable aviation fuel. The carbon is stored for decades or burned cleanly in a circular economy model.

Our Ukraine project

In partnership with Hemp Ukraine Recover, we’ve built a powerful pilot project that delivers climate, social, and economic impact. We’ve already removed and permanently sequestered 500 tonnes of net CO2, housed 170 people, and proven the viability of hemp carbon removal in post-conflict zones, and everywhere else.

Every tonne of CO2 removed is measured and verified. We subtract all emissions associated with the project, including fuel use, to ensure net removals. And every removal credit can be tracked to a real impact on the ground.

A pathway for aviation

We are scaling hemp carbon removal as a solution for aviation. Hemp can also be used to produce sustainable aviation fuel with high energy density. Our vision is to turn airports into hemp farms that remove carbon and fuel planes at the same time.

High-quality removal credits can be sold to passengers, airlines, and airports. This creates new revenue streams, engages climate-conscious customers, and helps aviation meet its decarbonisation targets.

On 4 July 2025, GIZ Thailand, through the International Hydrogen Ramp-Up Programme (H2Uppp), in cooperation with the National Energy Technology Centre (ENTEC) and the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), organised ‘From Waste to Wings: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Thailand and Southeast Asia’ at Asia Sustainable Energy Week 2025 (ASEW 2025). The forum brought together policymakers, industry representatives and academics from the aviation and SAF industry to exchange insights and perspectives on the role and potential of SAF in creating a cleaner and more sustainable future for aviation, focusing on Thailand and Southeast Asia (SEA).

Dr Dominika Kalinowska, Transport Projects Director from GIZ Thailand, emphasised GIZ’s commitment to sustainable aviation, supported by a series of events organised under the H2Uppp SAF Working Group, as well as further GIZ initiatives assisting public stakeholders in developing an SAF roadmap for Thailand.

“The forum theme ‘From Waste to Wings’ reflects our vision to transform waste and renewable resources into low-carbon fuels, supporting decarbonisation of the aviation sector while enhancing energy security, economic value creation and regional cooperation. This forum aims to scale up ambition, align regional efforts, and chart a practical roadmap for Thailand and ASEAN to move from vision to action.”

The plenary sessions of the forum featured an array of distinguished speakers, who shared insights on a variety of SAF topics – from the SAF value chain, policies and regulations to production and trade.

Beginning the session was Air Chief Marshal Manat Chavanaprayoon, Director General of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), who spoke about SAF integration prospects in Thailand, emphasising aligning airline companies’ policies with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), advancing the SAF value chain in the country, and CAAT’s own SAF expansion framework.

Sutharee Kiatman from the Biofuel Development Division, Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency (DEDE), Ministry of Energy (MoE), provided an overview of Thailand’s national SAF policy and strategic approaches, underpinning the commitment reflected in the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) 2024 and the Oil Plan 2025.

Ketsada Sutthiumporn from the Department of Energy Business (DoEB) presented fuel regulations and standards related to SAF in Thailand, highlighting inspection and laboratory processes as key in ensuring biofuel standards.

Pahoong Thammaratdumrong from Energy Absolute (E@) shared insights into different SAF production methods, together with challenges and potential solutions through the company’s insights and experience in the field.

Finally, a presentation by Scott Turn, a professor from the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute (HNEI), University of Hawaii at Manoa, offered an in-depth observation of SAF development in Southeast Asia over the years, highlighting initiatives and progress from different countries such as Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam.

Following the plenary session, a panel discussion was held to exchange expert perspectives on aligning SAF to transport decarbonisation in Thailand and Southeast Asia through the perspectives of experts and project developers in relevant sectors. Focusing on the topic of SAF production, the panel suggested that, while feedstocks are abundant in countries such as Thailand, alternative feedstocks such as biomass-to-fuels and other pathways based on SAF demand-supply should be explored to ensure sustainability and environmental impact reduction from the production chain. With technologies and policy frameworks currently in place to support SAF in Thailand, the challenges now lie in aligning its implementation to meet decarbonisation and climate targets in the transport sector.

In the closing speech, Tim Nees, H2Uppp Project Manager, expressed his appreciation to the forum speakers and participants for fostering discussion and cooperation on SAF in the region. He also invited interested parties on SAF topics (as well as hydrogen and other PtX products) to further collaborate through networking opportunities and activities from the H2Uppp programme.

Additionally, H2Uppp also joined the Future Move Forum at ASEW 2025, where Dr Pramote Puengjinda introduced the project and shared insights into SAF feasibility and application potential, especially for decarbonising the transport sector. The project also organised an exhibition booth to offer information on the global H2Uppp project and engage with interested visitors around green hydrogen and PtX topics.

The H2Uppp programme, financed by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWE), is implemented globally. In Thailand, GIZ implements the project together with the German-Thai Chamber of Commerce (GTCC), with the aim of supporting policy and market development for green hydrogen and Power-to-X through expert networking, knowledge dissemination and public-private partnerships (PPP).

A green jet fuel investment worth £1.25bn could be at risk if the UK's largest bioethanol plant is forced to close, the firm behind it has said.

Meld Energy signed an agreement with Vivergo Fuels earlier this year for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel facility at the Saltend Chemicals Park in Hull.

However, Vivergo's future has been put in doubt over the past few months after the decision to end the 19% tariff on US bioethanol imports as part of the recent UK-US trade deal.

Meld Energy CEO and founder Chris Smith said that without Vivergo at the site they may have to look overseas where ""that infrastructure is already in place"".

He said: ""We're excited about the potential to bring our sustainable aviation fuel project to the Humber – one of the UK's most important industrial and energy hubs.

""A bioethanol plant on site at Saltend is a critical part of that mix.

""Without it, we'd have to consider alternative locations overseas where that infrastructure is already in place.""

Mr Smith's comments came as the Vivergo plant was expecting its last scheduled wheat delivery from a farm in Lincolnshire on Friday.

'Urgent support needed'

Last month, Vivergo Fuels, which is owned by Associated British Foods and employs more than 160 people, said staff had been told about its uncertain future, which could see production stop before 13 September, if it does not get support.

Earlier this year, managing director Ben Hackett also wrote to wheat growers to say that the plant will only be able to honour existing contracts for wheat purchases while the uncertainty continued.

Mr Hackett said: ""We have the site, the skills, the supply chain and the ambition to lead the way on sustainable aviation fuel.

""But without urgent government support for British bioethanol, the UK risks losing that opportunity, along with the jobs and billions of pounds in investment that depend on it.""

A government spokesperson said officials and ministers have met with Vivergo over the past few months to discuss options over the ""significant challenges"" that the bioethanol industry had been facing for some time.

""We will continue to take proactive steps to address the long-standing challenges the company faces and remain committed to working closely with them throughout this period to present a plan for a way forward that protects supply chains, jobs and livelihoods,"" the spokesperson added.

It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
If successful, the pipeline could become a model for future projects both in China and globally, advancing efforts to build low-carbon energy systems.","China has started building its first interprovincial green hydrogen pipeline, a major step in the country’s effort to expand clean energy infrastructure. The pipeline will carry hydrogen made from wind power in Ulanqab, Inner Mongolia, to Beijing, covering a distance of nearly 400 kilometers, reports Intellinews.com.

The project is being led by Sinopec, China’s top hydrogen producer. Once completed, the pipeline will supply up to 100,000 tonnes of green hydrogen annually to Sinopec’s Yanshan petrochemical complex in the capital. Future phases aim to raise that capacity to 500,000 tonnes.

Approved by the Inner Mongolia Energy Bureau, the pipeline is part of a broader national strategy to lower emissions from heavy industry and reduce energy waste. Inner Mongolia has abundant wind and solar energy, but much of it currently goes unused due to a lack of transmission systems.

A 1-gigawatt wind-powered electrolysis facility in Ulanqab will be at the heart of the project. Electricity from wind turbines will be used to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen will then be compressed and sent through the new pipeline to industrial users in Beijing.

This marks a shift from earlier hydrogen systems along China’s coast, many of which still rely on fossil fuels. The new project is designed to directly connect areas with surplus renewable energy to regions with high energy demand, such as the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei economic zone.

Sinopec says the project is a key step toward a cleaner, more flexible energy system. “This pipeline will help us move clean energy from where it’s made to where it’s needed, cutting waste and supporting industrial demand,” a company spokesperson said.

Transporting hydrogen by pipeline is expected to be far cheaper and more efficient than moving it by truck or mixing it with natural gas. This could remove one of the biggest hurdles in developing China’s hydrogen sector.

The project also supports Inner Mongolia’s regional development plan, which includes a network of hydrogen pipelines. It aligns with national goals set by the National Development and Reform Commission to promote green hydrogen and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.

Analysts warn that the success of the project will depend on how quickly industries adopt hydrogen and whether prices remain competitive. But many believe this new pipeline could encourage further investments across the hydrogen supply chain—from fuel production to storage and transport.

For the first time, UK air passengers say they care more about punctual flights than cutting emissions.

According to the 2025 NATS Aviation Index, 63% of respondents now rank on-time performance as the industry’s top priority, overtaking reducing carbon emissions (56%) for the first time in the survey’s history.

While environmental concerns remain important, they have declined from their pandemic-era peak.

In 2020, 70% of passengers said cutting emissions was their number one priority. Today, however, passengers are more focused on improvements they can feel—like arriving on time—than those they can’t immediately see.

Air passengers are concerned, but won’t reduce flying

When asked which climate solutions the industry should pursue, the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) ranked highest, prioritised by 39% of respondents. This puts SAF ahead of airspace modernisation (21%) and carbon offsetting as the most popular route to lower emissions.

Despite this support for greener technology, only 17% of passengers say environmental concerns actively deter them from flying. In contrast, ticket cost remains crucial, with 89% citing price as the primary influence on travel decisions.

Public perceptions around responsibility for aviation’s climate impact remain skewed toward institutions rather than individuals:

30% place the burden primarily on government

26% on airlines

23% on industry bodies like NATS and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)

Just 4% believe individual passengers should take the lead

This disconnect is reflected in personal behaviour: one-third of respondents admit they’ve done nothing to reduce their own flight-related emissions, despite growing awareness and concern.

Support for green taxes is growing—but not for limits on flying

In a surprising shift, 50% of respondents now support a frequent flyer tax, up from previous years. However, enthusiasm drops when it comes to more direct restrictions: just 36% would support hard limits on the number of flights individuals can take within a given timeframe.

While this indicates growing public openness to policy interventions, it’s unclear how sentiment might shift if such proposals became real government policy.

Although travel habits have stabilised post-pandemic—with 52% flying internationally and 32% domestically in the past year—the balance between sustainability and affordability is still tilted firmly toward cost.

Looking ahead, 26% expect to fly more over the next 12 months, particularly younger and ethnically diverse passengers. But cost remains the biggest constraint to that growth.

Airspace reform and innovation are gaining ground

Public support for airspace modernisation is rising. Awareness of UK efforts to redesign flight paths jumped from 11% to 19% in a year, and 52% support changes to enable more efficient routing.

Support for airport expansion remains stable at 53%, but 69% say any capacity growth must be underpinned by airspace reform.

Passengers are also warming to innovation. Support for flying taxis rose from 34% to 40%, while drones for emergency services (86%) and infrastructure inspection (81%) received overwhelming support.

Attitudes to artificial intelligence are mixed: 68% support AI in baggage screening and 50% approve of its use in air traffic control, but 49% express concerns about misuse and cybersecurity risks.

The NATS Aviation Index makes clear that UK passengers still value aviation’s social and economic benefits, but punctuality, affordability, and convenience are winning out over sustainability.

While support for SAF, airspace reform and even green taxes is growing, public expectations remain firmly grounded in the here and now: getting where they want, on time, at the right price.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/British-Airways-aircraft-with-palm-trees.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 06:56:17.312352

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on July 31 unveiled a national development roadmap targeting a 35% share of renewable energy in power generation by 2030. The plan also includes interconnecting power grids between Peninsular Malaysia and Sarawak to expand green electricity exports, and the revival of the country’s nuclear power ambitions as part of its low-carbon energy transition.

13MP sets out reforms for renewable growth

The 13th Malaysia Plan (13MP), as the blueprint is known, lays out the government’s strategic direction for the next five years. Anchored on three core themes and nine strategic thrusts, the plan includes an investment of 430 billion ringgit (about USD 100 billion) to position Malaysia among Asia’s leading economies and within the world’s top 30.

On the renewable front, the plan sets a target of increasing installed capacity from renewables to 35%, up six percentage points from 2024. Sarawak already exceeds its target with a 62% share. The blueprint also mentions plans to enhance the interconnection between East and West Malaysia, potentially strengthening ASEAN Power Grid (APG) integration and facilitating cross-border electricity trade, though no further details were provided.

Presenting the plan to Parliament, Anwar emphasized Malaysia’s transition toward a cost-reflective power market, where electricity pricing would better reflect generation, transmission, and renewable integration costs. This shift is intended to enhance system efficiency and attract more investments.

Nuclear power revival planned for 2031 launch

13MP also supports the continuation of renewable energy schemes, such as the Community Renewable Energy Acculturation Mechanism (CREAM) and the Corporate Green Energy Supply Program (CRESS), which are designed to encourage public and private participation in the green electricity market. These initiatives will be supported by the National Energy Transition Fund (NETF), which will use blended financing to stimulate the development of low-carbon and decarbonization industries.

The plan also targets raising the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blend to 5% by 2030. In Hulu Terengganu, the government aims to scale up floating solar PV, hydropower, and green hydrogen production hubs.

CVR Energy Inc. on July 30 reported its renewables segment achieved increased throughput during the second quarter despite unplanned downtime, but reported a net loss of $11 million. The company expects to retroactively claim the 45Z clean fuel production credit for volumes produced.

CVR Energy’s renewable segments includes operations of the renewable diesel unit and renewable feedstock pretreater at its refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.

The renewables segment reported a second quarter net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million, unchanged when compared to the net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4 million, compared to $2 million.

Total vegetable oil throughput for the second quarter of 2025 was approximately 155,000 gallons per day, up from 127,000 gallons per day during the same period of 2024. The 155,000 gallons per day of throughput equates to approximately 14 million gallons for the full quarter.

Renewables margin was $5 million, or 38 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5 million, or 43 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2024. Factors contributing to the company’s second quarter 2025 renewables margin were higher net sales of $13 million resulting from increased production and sales volumes, increased renewable diesel yield due to improved catalyst performance, and increased biomass-based diesel renewable identification number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices in the current period, partially offset by the loss of the blenders tax credit (BTC) in the current period and a decrease in average CARB ULSD prices of 24 cents per gallon. Higher net sales were partially offset by higher cost of sales of $12 million due to an increase in throughput and production volumes.

During a second quarter earnings call held July 31, CVR Energy President and CEO David Lamp noted the company did not recognize any 45Z credit benefit during the quarter as it continues to wait for the IRS to issue final regulations. Lamp also noted the company believes it will have the ability to retroactively claim the credit once regulations are finalized.

According to Lamp, the renewables segment has been operating at near breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis year-to-date, with the loss of the BTC and increase in soybean oil pricing mostly being offset by increased RIN prices. CVR currently assumes the 45Z credit will boost adjusted EBITDA for the renewables segment by $6 million for the first half of 2025.

Regarding operations at Wynnewood, Lamp said the company has ordered its next load of renewable diesel catalyst and currently plans to remain in renewable diesel production as it awaits 45Z guidance and other potentially positive changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill. “We’ll also continue to weigh all options for the future of our renewable business,” he said, reiterating comments made earlier this year that the company remains fully willing to participate in the renewables space, but cannot invest additional time or capital without further assurances from the government it will support the business it created.

Lamp’s comments are in reference to plans the company was previously considering to convert Wynnewood to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and potentially add SAF and renewable diesel capacity to its Coffeyville refinery in Kansas. In February, Lamp announced CVR would pause those plans pending clarity on the availability and durability of government subsidies.

Moving into the third quarter, CVR Energy Chief Financial Officer Dan Newmann said the company expects total renewables throughput to be in the range of 16 to 20 million gallons.

Heathrow Airport has revealed details of its plan to expand and modernise the airport at a cost of £49bn.

Thomas Woldbye, CEO of Heathrow Airport, said expansion was ""urgent"" as the airport was currently working at capacity, ""to the detriment of trade and connectivity"". The work would be funded by private finance.

The government has backed plans for a third runway, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves saying it would ""make Britain the world's best connected place to do business"".

However, the plans face opposition from environmental groups, politicians, and locals. London's mayor Sir Sadiq Khan said it would have a ""severe impact on noise, air pollution and meeting our climate change targets"".

The plans come a day after the deadline set by the government for parties to submit proposals.

Heathrow's plans, which it estimates would be completed within a decade, include:

Creation of a third runway, called the ""North-Western Runway"", which would be up to 3,500m (11,500 ft) long. Heathrow bosses say this will increase capacity to 756,000 flights and 150m passengers a year - it currently serves about 84m

A new terminal called T5X, expanding Terminal 2 and three new satellite terminals. It would close Terminal 3

Enhancement of local rail connections, plus walking and cycling routes

Diversion of the M25, which would involve a new road tunnel under the airport, and widening the motorway between junctions 14-15

Creation of two new Heathrow parkways

Improvements to Heathrow's bus and coach stations

Heathrow said it would cost £21bn to build the third runway, which includes procuring the land, changing the M25 and other associated infrastructure costs while building the new terminal would be £12bn and modernising the current airport's infrastructure £15bn. Due to rounding, it will total £49bn.

A spokesperson added the plans would grow the UK economy by 0.43% GDP.

'Unlock billions'

The plans revealed by Heathrow were welcomed by business groups and airline companies.

A joint statement from the Confederation of British Industry, British Chambers of Commerce, MakeUK, Federation of Small Businesses and Institute of Directors, said it was ""an investment in the nation's future"".

It added: ""The benefits are clear: for exporters, it opens up vital access to major and emerging markets; for visitors, it enhances global and domestic connectivity; and for businesses, it unlocks billions in private investment, strengthening supply chains, creating jobs, and driving skills across the country.""

John Dickie, chief executive of BusinessLDN, said as the airport was currently operating at full capacity, the expansion would give businesses ""better connectivity to overseas markets and support Britain's growth"".

He added it would also help achieve the government's target of 50 million international visitors per year to the UK.

Environmental damage

Mr Woldbye said Heathrow's submission was in line with the aviation industry's target to be net zero by 2050.

He added that Heathrow was ""the airport in the world with the highest uptake of Sustainable Aviation Fuel"", and that planning permission would not be granted by government unless legal limits of emissions were adhered to.

However, the plans were heavily criticised by groups who called the environmental justifications for the plans as ""hopeful marketing spin"".

Dr Douglas Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said the government had ""decided yet again to prioritise more leisure opportunities for a comparatively small group of frequent fliers, whilst the rest of us have to live with the consequences of their disproportionate polluting"".

He suggested a ""frequent flier levy"", and said no expansion should take place until there was a solution to the ""pollution problem"".

His concerns were echoed by politicians including Sir Sadiq who said he remained ""unconvinced"" that hundreds of thousands of additional flights each year would not have a ""hugely detrimental"" impact.

He added City Hall would ""carefully scrutinise"" the impact the extension would have on people living in the area and the ""huge knock-on effects for our transport infrastructure, which would require a comprehensive and costed plan to manage"".

A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""Heathrow is already the single largest polluter in the UK, and the Climate Change Committee itself has said expansion would put the UK's climate goals at risk.

""It's also clear we can't rely on the silver bullet of Sustainable Aviation Fuels to save the day,"" they added.

The Green Party deputy leader, Zack Polankski, said the plans were being delivered ""regardless"" of the environmental impact.

""If Labour's environmental commitments were worth the paper they're written on, these proposals would never have seen the light of day,"" he said.

Local residents living in Harmondsworth, near the airport, told the BBC earlier this year a third of the village would be destroyed if a third runway was to go ahead.

Rival plans

Heathrow's plans follow the publication of a rival proposal by the Arora Group, which has outlined a way to expand the airport without needing to redirect the M25.

Owner of the group, hotel tycoon Surinder Arora, said the creation of a third runway and a new terminal, under his plans, had a cost estimate of under £25bn, not including the redevelopment of the airport's existing central area.

The proposal crucially does not involve an expensive alteration to the M25, as the group said it was possible to build a 2,800-metre (9,200 ft) third runway instead of the full-length 3,500-metre (11,500 ft) runway planned by the airport.

Arora Group said its plan, called Heathrow West, could have a new runway fully operational by 2035, while a new terminal would open in two phases, in 2036 and 2040.

Moving the M25

When asked about the added expense of altering the M25 to accommodate a new, third runway, Heathrow's CEO said: ""The whole conversation about the M25 has been slightly exaggerated"", and that disruption to drivers would be minimal.

""We will build a new and much better M25, 100m (330 ft) to the west of the current one. It will be wider and it will be safer and it will have more capacity,"" Mr Woldbye added.

He said plans to create a much shorter runway to avoid moving the M25 - like the one proposed by The Aurora Group - would ""not provide the capacity that we and the airlines need"", but said the airport would be open to a discussion with airlines about building a shorter runway if it could deliver the same benefits.

Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said the two proposals were a ""significant step towards unlocking growth, creating jobs, and delivering vital national infrastructure"".

""We'll consider the proposals carefully over the summer so that we can begin a review of the Airports National Policy Statement later this year,"" she added.

'Half the battle'

The extended subsidies aim to provide additional support for large-scale biomass power producers that aim to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) capacity.
Pellet production hit a new record during the six-month period and was up more than 5% when compared to the first half of last year.
This, together with existing sales to third parties, primarily in Asia, provides a good underpin to the current level of earnings from pellet production, the company said.
EBITDA from biomass power generation was down 16% during the first half of 2025.","Drax Group plc on July 31 confirmed it expects to sign a final agreement with the government before the end of the year establishing a low-carbon dispatchable contract for difference (CfD) to support transitional operations at Drax Power Station.

""Drax is the leading dispatchable renewable power company in the U.K., delivering 5% of the U.K.'s power and significantly more when the system needs it,” said Will Gardiner, CEO of Drax. “Thousands of our colleagues at Drax and in our supply chain work tirelessly to ensure our assets continue to help keep the lights on for millions of this country's households and countless businesses, no matter the weather.

""During the first half of the year, we made significant progress towards ensuring we continue to play an important role in U.K. energy security through this decade and beyond, reaching a heads of terms with the U.K. Government on a low-carbon dispatchable CfD,” Gardiner added. “We expect to sign a final agreement later this year and look forward to continuing to play a critical role in the U.K. system into the future.”

The U.K. government in February announced it would move forward with a short-term support mechanism for large-scale biomass power generators. The country’s current biomass power subsidies are set to end in 2027. The extended subsidies aim to provide additional support for large-scale biomass power producers that aim to develop bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) capacity. The transitional subsidies, wich also aim to support the U.K.’s energy security, are expected to be in place from April 2027 through March 2031.

According to Drax, the U.K. Houses of Parliament in June voted to approve legislation required to enable the government to enter agreements for these transitional subsidies, which are to be offered in the form of low-carbon dispatchable CfD agreements. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority completed a review of the planned subsidies in July, and negotiations on the precise details of the final contract for Drax Power Station are currently ongoing.

Under the proposed agreement the CfD scheme will apply to up to c.6TWh of power annually from Drax Power Stqation, paid against a season ahead reference price (as per the current CfD scheme). Drax will then seek to maximize generation from its four biomass units at times of high demand and reduce generation at times of low demand, using the station's flexibility to support U.K. energy security. The proposed agreement also allows for system support and ancillary services, according to Drax.

Drax’s pellet business reported a 14% increase in EBITDA for the first half of 2025, which the company said reflects an increase in production, including the benefit from an expansion at the Aliceville pellet plant. Pellet production hit a new record during the six-month period and was up more than 5% when compared to the first half of last year.

As part of the company’s post-2027 targets, Drax said the proposed low-carbon dispatchable CfD agreement at Drax Power Station is expected to utilize 2 million metric tons of own-use pellets from the U.S. South in addition to third-party volumes. This, together with existing sales to third parties, primarily in Asia, provides a good underpin to the current level of earnings from pellet production, the company said.

In order to support long-term earnings growth and maximize the value of pellet production, Drax is continuing to assess operations for own-use and third-party sales, from existing and new markets, including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which the company said could represent a major growth market opportunity for biomass pellets.

Drax also confirmed it is continuing its engagement with Pathway Energy LLC, which is developing a SAF project in Port Arthur, Texas. As part of its process with Pathway, Drax has agreed heads of terms on a multi-year agreement that could see Drax supply 1 million tons per year of sustainable biomass for the production of SAF. The company said the project could be an attractive home market for Drax’s U.S. pellet production, which pricing expected to be consistent with the company’s target for post-2027 adjusted EBITDA.

EBITDA from biomass power generation was down 16% during the first half of 2025. Drax said the reduction reflects a combination of lower forward contracted prices, partially offset by a continued high level of generation, demand for system support services and value from renewables.

Between April 2024 and March 2025, Drax generated more than 5% of the U.K.’s electricity and 11% of its renewable power. During this period, it produced on average 19% of the UK's renewable power at times of peak demand and on certain days over 50%.

CVR Energy Inc. on July 30 reported its renewables segment achieved increased throughput during the second quarter despite unplanned downtime, but reported a net loss of $11 million. The company expects to retroactively claim the 45Z clean fuel production credit for volumes produced.

CVR Energy’s renewable segments includes operations of the renewable diesel unit and renewable feedstock pretreater at its refinery in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.

The renewables segment reported a second quarter net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million, unchanged when compared to the net loss of $11 million and EBITDA loss of $5 million reported for the same period of last year. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $4 million, compared to $2 million.

Total vegetable oil throughput for the second quarter of 2025 was approximately 155,000 gallons per day, up from 127,000 gallons per day during the same period of 2024. The 155,000 gallons per day of throughput equates to approximately 14 million gallons for the full quarter.

Renewables margin was $5 million, or 38 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2025 compared to $5 million, or 43 cents per vegetable oil throughput gallon, for the second quarter of 2024. Factors contributing to the company’s second quarter 2025 renewables margin were higher net sales of $13 million resulting from increased production and sales volumes, increased renewable diesel yield due to improved catalyst performance, and increased biomass-based diesel renewable identification number (RIN) and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credit prices in the current period, partially offset by the loss of the blenders tax credit (BTC) in the current period and a decrease in average CARB ULSD prices of 24 cents per gallon. Higher net sales were partially offset by higher cost of sales of $12 million due to an increase in throughput and production volumes.

During a second quarter earnings call held July 31, CVR Energy President and CEO David Lamp noted the company did not recognize any 45Z credit benefit during the quarter as it continues to wait for the IRS to issue final regulations. Lamp also noted the company believes it will have the ability to retroactively claim the credit once regulations are finalized.

According to Lamp, the renewables segment has been operating at near breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis year-to-date, with the loss of the BTC and increase in soybean oil pricing mostly being offset by increased RIN prices. CVR currently assumes the 45Z credit will boost adjusted EBITDA for the renewables segment by $6 million for the first half of 2025.

Regarding operations at Wynnewood, Lamp said the company has ordered its next load of renewable diesel catalyst and currently plans to remain in renewable diesel production as it awaits 45Z guidance and other potentially positive changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill. “We’ll also continue to eight all options for the future of our renewable business,” he said, reiterating comments made earlier this year that the company remains fully willing to participate in the renewables space, but cannot invest additional time or capital without further assurances from the government it will support the business it created.

Lamp’s comments are in reference to plans the company was previously considering to convert Coffeyville to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and potentially add SAF and renewable diesel capacity to its Coffeyville refinery in Kansas. In February, Lamp announced CVR would pause those plans pending clarity on the availability and durability of government subsidies.

Moving into the third quarter, CVR Energy Chief Financial Officer Dan Newmann said the company expects total renewables throughput to be in the range of 16 to 20 million gallons.

Rollins today announced the U.S. Forest Service is investing $106 million to support state and landowner efforts to conserve private working forestlands across the country. Funded through the Forest Legacy Program, these projects will protect forests vital to the economic and social fabric of local communities – ensuring they remain productive, working forests for Americans and tourists to use and enjoy.

“Just like our farms and ranches, working forests are part of the backbone of rural America – providing jobs, timber, clean water, and places for families to hunt, fish, camp, hike and make lifelong memories,” said Secretary Brooke Rollins. “For too long our forests have been left idle, only to burn and devastate communities. President Trump has made it a priority to properly manage our forests, empowering USDA and our state partners to protect and unleash the full potential of their forestlands to help their communities grow and thrive.”

In total, the Forest Service will fund 10 projects across 177,000 acres of state- and privately owned forestlands in Arkansas, Hawaii, Iowa, Michigan, Mississippi, New York, Oregon and South Carolina. The investments advance President Trump’s Executive Order on Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production by safeguarding forests that supply critical wood products and outdoor recreation opportunities—both of which fuel rural prosperity by creating jobs and supporting rural economies.

The Forest Legacy Program is authorized by the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act Of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2103c) and operates through voluntary partnerships with states and landowners with the goal of conserving these lands while balancing other local uses and goals. Projects are selected through competitive state and national processes and carried out through conservation easements or fee-simple acquisitions. Lands conserved through the program either remain in private ownership with long-term protections or become new public lands managed by state or local governments.

Privately owned forests represent 60% of the nation’s 704 million forested acres. These lands are essential to the social, economic, cultural, and ecological fabric of local communities and play a critical role in national timber production, supplying 88% of all domestic timber.

To date, the Forest Legacy Program has conserved more than 3.1 million acres of forestland nationwide. To learn more or to view the full list of 2025 projects, visit the Forest Legacy Program webpage.

What are some of the emerging trends in the aerospace, engineering, and manufacturing industries in Palm Beach County and South Florida?

Most people are familiar with RTX’s Pratt & Whitney business, a global leader in the design, manufacture, and service of aircraft engines for both commercial and military markets. We’re seeing growth in both of those segments. One significant trend we’re noticing locally is the increasing retirement rate among baby boomers, particularly in skilled trades. Palm Beach County has long been known for its aerospace presence, with major players like Pratt & Whitney, Lockheed Martin, and L3Harris operating here.

So, a key focus right now is skilled labor — recruiting and developing the right talent. We’re actively working with institutions like Palm Beach State College, Florida Atlantic University, and local aviation maintenance technician schools, given the competition for skilled labor and the high demand across companies in the region. Internally, we support workforce development through our robust RTX Employee Scholar Program, which allows employees to pursue two-year and four-year degrees while working here. For example, Airframe and Powerplant (A&P) mechanics can come in with an 18-month certification and later move into other career paths within the company. I’ve participated in many discussions focused on developing the next generation of aerospace engineers and mechanics. It’s a critical issue not just in South Florida, but across the state.

Can you elaborate on any specific initiatives Pratt & Whitney has in place to support workforce development?

We’re involved with several local initiatives, including programs at the high school level. For instance, we’ve partnered with Forest Hill High School to offer summer internships for juniors and seniors. In fact, some students just started their internships this summer, giving them early exposure to the industry before deciding whether to pursue college or trade school.

Beyond high school, we collaborate with Palm Beach State College to develop specialized programs focused on electronics and data recording — key areas since we collect and analyze significant amounts of data from jet engines. We also work with Florida Atlantic University, the University of Florida, and Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. One of our recent collaborations with Embry-Riddle was the development of a new bachelor’s program in safety management systems.

Hiring locally is also a priority. People who grow up here tend to want to stay, which makes them highly committed to the community. While we also recruit from outside of Florida, there’s real value in cultivating local talent.

What makes Palm Beach County such a strong hub for the aerospace industry?

Pratt & Whitney was founded in 1925 in Hartford, Connecticut, and we expanded to South Florida in 1958. The reasons for the move were strategic: Florida offered attractive costs, and we secured 7,000 acres along the Beeline Highway for engine testing and development.

Even back then, the area had strong educational institutions. We’ve long drawn talent from Florida as well as nearby states like Georgia and Alabama. The late 1950s also marked the beginning of the space race, with Cape Canaveral ramping up. So, the region, stretching from the Space Coast to Palm Beach, became a hub for both aerospace and space-related development. We were involved in both sectors. Our space division eventually was sold and became part of Aerojet Rocketdyne, but our roots in Palm Beach County go deep.

The availability of land, proximity to major airports like Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach International, and access to a skilled workforce all contribute to making this an ideal location for our operations.

What products or services are driving growth, demand, and profitability for Pratt & Whitney?

Our two biggest product lines are the GTF and F135 engines. The GTF powers the A320neo aircraft and has seen strong demand from airlines thanks to its industry-leading noise reduction and fuel efficiency. Here in West Palm Beach, we handle the overhaul of these engines. For example, Spirit Airlines’ GTF engines are regularly serviced here and then returned to Fort Lauderdale.

The F135 engine, which powers the F-35 Lightning II fighter jet operated by the United States and 19 allied nations, is another key product. We manufacture some of those engines here in Florida as well as at our facility in Middletown, Connecticut. In addition, our West Palm Beach site is engaged in extensive R&D for future military engine applications.

How do you see alternative fuels and hydrogen-powered aircraft shaping the industry?

We’ve done a lot of local testing on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and alternative fuels, and the engines perform well with them. The main barriers right now are cost and availability. If an airline wanted to fly with a higher percentage of SAF, the cost would currently be prohibitive, and supply is limited. But the technology itself is sound.

Hydrogen is another area of interest. It’s worth noting that when this facility was established in 1958, one of the first engines we worked on was hydrogen-powered. It worked successfully, but the world wasn’t quite ready for it. That early hydrogen technology eventually led to the development of rocket engines, which today are produced by Aerojet Rocketdyne as part of NASA’s Artemis program. So, while we can demonstrate these technologies, getting them into widespread commercial use requires overcoming significant hurdles.

How is Pratt & Whitney leveraging technology to streamline operations and improve turnaround times?

We use a proprietary operating system called CORE, which drives continuous improvement across all processes, from engine assembly to testing and disassembly. We’re heavily focused on making these processes faster, more repeatable, and of higher quality.

This includes incorporating automation and robotics, as well as extensive data monitoring. Compared to 30 or 40 years ago, the time required to build a jet engine has been significantly reduced. We scrutinize every step, from how many bolts we use to how we ensure the engine performs consistently, always aiming for more efficient and reliable methods.

What specific steps is Pratt & Whitney taking to reduce emissions and improve sustainability?

Environmental responsibility is embedded in our DNA. Beyond engine emissions, we track and aim to reduce our facilities’ greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and waste streams. What’s notable is that we don’t normalize the data based on growth, we set absolute targets. For example, even if production increases, we still aim to reduce facility emissions by 20% over five years.

Locally, we’ve partnered with FPL to integrate solar power into our operations, which has significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions. We’re also implementing water conservation initiatives and working to eliminate waste streams. We share a border with the JW Corbett Wildlife Refuge, so being strong environmental stewards is non-negotiable.

What are the primary challenges facing the aerospace engineering and manufacturing industry, and how is Pratt & Whitney addressing them?

Beyond the common issues — supply chain disruptions, inflation, tariffs — we’re really focused on recruiting and retaining top talent. Despite advances in automation and AI, it still takes skilled people to design and build jet engines. It’s a competitive market, and everyone is vying for top talent.

This is a long-term industry — designing a new aircraft engine can take a decade. That’s why we’re investing in automation, infrastructure, and, most importantly, our people. Pratt & Whitney is celebrating its centennial this year and, after a century in business, we’ve learned that success comes from listening to our customers and delivering what they need: greater fuel efficiency, range, lower noise, and reduced emissions. That approach has served us well on both the commercial and military sides of the business.

What are the company’s key priorities in the region going forward?

On the commercial side, we’re in the middle of ramping up production for the GTF engine and preparing to launch the next version, the GTF Advantage, which we anticipate will enter service next year. On the military side, we continue to work on the F135 Engine Core Upgrade, focusing on design maturation, aircraft integration and mobilizing the supply base to prepare for production.

These are evolutionary upgrades. For more revolutionary changes, like an engine for a new single-aisle aircraft platform from Boeing or Airbus, you’re looking at a five-to-15-year timeline. But behind the scenes, a lot of groundwork is already being laid to prepare for those long-term shifts.

Already responsible for 2% to 3% of global carbon emissions, aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. Without intervention, emissions from air travel are expected to more than double over the next two decades. That reality has spurred global momentum toward one clear solution: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Aviation’s growing emissions and the push to decarbonize

The challenge is simple. Most of aviation’s emissions come from burning fossil-based jet fuel. While engine efficiency improvements and operational optimizations offer some progress, they are not nearly enough. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), 317 member airlines from over 120 countries have pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To get there, SAF must replace a significant share of traditional jet fuel in the decades ahead.

Global mandates and airline commitments

Governments are beginning to mandate action. The European Union and the United Kingdom have already introduced mandates that require airlines to blend a small percentage of SAF with conventional jet fuel. These mandates start at just 2% in 2025 but scale up rapidly. The EU’s targets call for a 70% SAF blend by 2050, with 35% of that coming from so-called e-fuels. Airlines are also stepping up. For example, Air France has committed to reaching a 10% SAF blend by 2030, well ahead of the regulatory curve.

Despite this progress, the production gap is significant. Only 1 million tonne of SAF were produced globally in 2024 — far short of the 5 million tonne needed by 2030 to meet current blending mandates, signaling a need for major investment and innovation in the next few years.

Why SAF is a game-changer for aviation

Unlike hydrogen or electric aircraft, which are still in early development and not viable for long-haul flights, SAF is compatible with today’s jet engines and airport infrastructure. This drop-in compatibility lets airlines decarbonize without needing to overhaul their fleets. More importantly, SAF can reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, making it one of the most powerful tools available for immediate emissions reductions.

What is SAF?

“Sustainable aviation fuel” is a broad term that refers to nonpetroleum-based jet fuels made from renewable or waste-based feedstocks. SAF is chemically similar to traditional kerosene, which means it can be blended with fossil jet fuel and used in existing aircraft without modifications. The fuels must meet strict ASTM standards to ensure safety and performance.

A look at the four main SAF pathways

The SAF landscape is built around four primary production pathways, each with its own strengths, challenges, and level of commercial readiness:

Bio-oil to SAF

This method uses waste oils, such as used cooking oil and animal fats, or vegetable oils as feedstock. These oils are processed through hydrotreatment and hydrocracking to produce jet fuel in a technology known as hydrotreated esters and fatty acids, or HEFA. Companies like Neste have scaled this technology at biorefineries in Singapore and the Netherlands. While bio-oil to SAF is proven and scalable, its long-term growth is constrained by limited availability of sustainable waste oil feedstock. Regulatory restrictions also prohibit the use of food-based oils in many regions, further tightening supply.

Biomass to SAF

This process converts solid biomass, including forestry residue and agricultural waste, into jet fuel. The most advanced approach involves gasifying the biomass into synthesis gas and converting it through the Fischer-Tropsch process. Another method under development is pyrolysis, which liquefies the biomass into a biocrude that can then be upgraded. Although biomass is an abundant and sustainable feedstock, the technology is still in development. Fulcrum BioEnergy’s demonstration plant in the United States was a step forward but ultimately shut down due to technical complications, highlighting the challenges of scaling this pathway.

Ethanol to SAF

In this process, ethanol is converted into jet fuel through a series of catalytic steps, including dehydration, oligomerization, and hydrogenation. LanzaJet is leading the field with a demonstration plant launched in 2024. However, this pathway faces a complex regulatory landscape. In the EU and the U.K., first-generation ethanol made from food crops is not allowed, requiring the use of second-generation cellulosic ethanol instead. Unfortunately, cellulosic ethanol production is still underdeveloped and limited in scale, making this pathway more viable in regions like the U.S. and Brazil where first-generation ethanol is permitted.

CO2 to SAF

Also known as e-fuel, this method involves capturing CO2 from the air or industrial sources and combining it with green hydrogen to create synthetic fuel. The most common technologies use reverse water-gas shift reactions followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or convert CO2 into methanol, which is then refined into jet fuel. While this approach offers abundant and sustainable feedstock, the cost is prohibitively high. Producing SAF from direct air capture of CO2 and electrolysis can be five to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Despite this, several companies, including Infinium and Johnson Matthey, are pushing forward with pilot projects.

The benefits of SAF

SAF offers numerous environmental and strategic advantages. It can cut life cycle emissions by up to 80%, helping the aviation industry align with global net-zero targets. SAF can be produced from a wide variety of feedstocks, offering regional flexibility. It also enhances energy security by reducing dependence on fossil fuels and opens opportunities for rural economic development through the use of agricultural and forestry residues.

From an operational standpoint, SAF’s compatibility with existing aircraft and fueling infrastructure makes it uniquely positioned for near-term deployment. Airlines can adopt SAF without waiting for new aircraft technologies or major infrastructure upgrades.

The challenges of SAF

Despite its promise, SAF faces significant challenges. The most pressing is cost. In a best-case scenario, SAF made from bio-oil still costs about 30% more than fossil jet fuel. Other pathways, such as biomass to jet and e-fuels, can be two to six times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. These price premiums create real financial strain for airlines, especially on long-haul international routes.

Feedstock availability is another concern. HEFA production is constrained by the global supply of waste oil, and advanced feedstocks like cellulosic biomass and CO2 are either expensive or technologically immature. The lack of proven, scalable technology for many SAF pathways further complicates the path to market.

Policy support is also a mixed bag. While mandates help drive demand, they do little to reduce the high cost of production. Without subsidies, tax incentives, or carbon pricing mechanisms, SAF may remain financially out of reach for many airlines.

Looking ahead: Trends shaping the SAF landscape

The next five years will be critical for scaling SAF production. We can expect increased investment in demonstration projects for ethanol, biomass, and CO2-based fuels. As green hydrogen and carbon capture technologies improve, e-fuels may become more cost competitive.

In the U.S., policy flexibility around feedstock use is likely to support the growth of HEFA and ethanol-to-jet fuels. In contrast, the EU’s stricter feedstock regulations and aggressive SAF targets may drive innovation in biomass and CO2-based pathways, albeit at a higher cost.

Corporate partnerships will also shape the future. Oil majors, airlines, and technology developers are increasingly joining forces to de-risk SAF projects and accelerate commercialization. The space is also seeing greater involvement from startups focused on unlocking new feedstocks and improving conversion technologies.",https://luxresearchinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Social-Sharing_Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel_-Technologies-Benefits-and-Challenges.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 20:56:08.127582

U.S. tariffs and geopolitical destabilization have spurred an overdue appetite for industrial policy in Canada. Decades of economic development led by the private sector has created deep vulnerabilities in the Canadian economy, and public leadership will be necessary to reassert independence and ensure long-term prosperity in a rapidly changing world.

It’s an argument well-made in a major new report published by the Transition Accelerator, The Right Move at the Right Time, which calls this a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the Canadian economy. The paper argues that Canada needs a central authority to identify priority sectors and to facilitate coordination between industry and government in those sectors. Crucially, those sectors need to be aligned with a net-zero economy over the long term not only to reduce emissions but also to take advantage of emerging opportunities in a decarbonizing global economy. A separate report from the Transition Accelerator this month, The Productivity Benefits of High-Value, Low-Carbon Investment, highlights mass timber, sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles as opportunity areas.

These recommendations generally align with the CCPA’s own work on industrial policy, including the Alternative Federal Budget and our 2022 citizen’s guide to green industrial policy. Our work emphasizes a stronger voice for workers in industrial policy as well as a more grassroots approach to determining industrial priorities, especially at the regional level. We’d like to see more aggressive use of Crown corporations to drive new technologies and markets, and we’d prefer a focus on truly zero-emission industries rather than biofuels and the like. But we fully agree on the core project of leveraging the state to accelerate long-term, strategic industrial development in the public interest.

The new federal government is using much of the same language. The Liberal election platform and the PM’s mandate letter talk about industrial policy priorities, and the government’s signature Building Canada Act is couched in terms of accelerating industrial projects in the “national interest.” Unfortunately, there are several major issues with the government’s approach so far.

First, weakening Indigenous rights and environmental protections, which the Conservative-backed Building Canada Act is designed to do, is clearly not in the public interest, whether or not a project is deemed to be in the “national interest.” Industrial development should be done in service of Indigenous reconciliation, decarbonization and other social and environmental priorities, not in spite of them.

Second, the federal government’s industrial priorities include defence spending and fossil fuel infrastructure, neither of which is consistent with a cleaner and healthier economy. Indeed, they are counterproductive to much of the green industrial work we ought to be doing.

Third, there is a big difference between nation-building projects and a nation-building strategy. One-off initiatives are flashy, but facilitating an industrial transformation takes more systematic and sustained effort. This is a major focus of the Transition Accelerator report. In the absence of a big picture vision—popularized by economist Mariana Mazzucato as a mission-oriented industrial strategy—and a long-term commitment to specific technologies and supply chains, industrial policy efforts are much more likely to fail.

It’s not too late for the federal government to articulate a clear and productive industrial vision—one that is consistent with long-term sustainability and inclusive prosperity. But it’s clear we have a lot of work to do.

Lots of research to dive into this month before the summer lull, so let’s get into it.

Storm surge: this month’s key reads

Landmark report lays the groundwork for Indigenous-led climate policy

Indigenous Climate Action has released Land Back is Climate Policy, the final installment of its ambitious Decolonizing Climate Policy research project. It builds on the findings of a previous report, featured in this newsletter back in 2023, that focused on barriers to Indigenous climate leadership in Canada—especially the role of settler climate policy in perpetuating colonialism.

The new report is a tour de force of good ideas grounded in extensive interviews with Indigenous youth and communities. It documents all of the many ways Indigenous Peoples are already leading on climate policy, and the ways in which Indigenous worldviews can transform climate action for the better.

There is a clear message for Indigenous allies in the climate policy space: stop getting in the way by defending colonial institutions, and start actively supporting Indigenous sovereignty. Self-determination is the central theme of the work, including the necessity of free, prior and informed consent for projects on Indigenous land. It’s precisely the opposite approach to the one being taken by the federal government right now.

Large-scale worker training an essential input for decarbonization

One of the most underappreciated barriers to decarbonizing the Canadian economy is an insufficient skilled workforce. Despite rising unemployment, there are already large skill shortages in some sectors, such as the building trades, that are projected to rise significantly as an aging workforce retires. Canada is on track for more than a million skilled trade job openings in the next decade alone.

A new report from the Pembina Institute, Recruit, Train, Retain, explores these trends and the need for more proactive workforce development to realize Canada’s climate commitments. Our grand infrastructure dreams will grind to a halt without enough skilled workers in every region of the country.

Incidentally, workforce development is a big part of industrial strategy. Coordinating the training pipeline with projected labour needs in strategic sectors is a key role of government. Historically, government training programs have deferred to market demand, but that approach is insufficient in a context where public leadership is driving a particular economic trajectory. Given the long timelines associated with apprenticeships, in particular, we need to start training new workers ten years before they’re needed.

Among the Pembina report’s recommendations is the necessity of increasing public spending on post-secondary institutions. Colleges and universities are being squeezed at precisely the moment we need more capacity, not less.

UK releases business-first industrial strategy

Keeping on with our industrial strategy theme this month, the government of the UK published its much-anticipated Modern Industrial Strategy, which checks many of the boxes described above. It is comprehensive, mission-oriented and consistent with a net-zero economy. Decarbonization is a central theme of the strategy, and the eight industrial priority areas identified in the plan, such as advanced manufacturing, life sciences and the creative industry, are generally consistent with that goal (the main exceptions being the defence industry and carbon capture in the energy industry).

The biggest red flag is the strategy’s capitulation to the private sector. Two of the plan’s four major pillars are explicitly focused on making it easier to do business, in part through deregulation, and creating “enduring partnerships” with business (i.e., P3s). In matters of investment, the plan sets out “a strategic course that allows business to make long-term decisions” with no institutionalized input from communities or workers. And while the plan creates some new public institutions, such as an Industrial Strategy Council, they are mainly relegated to advisory roles.

The published strategy is only the first step for the UK. The government has promised additional sectoral strategies, and it will need to budget for the new spending it has promised or implied. Despite its limitations, this is a useful example for Canada to consider in the development of our own industrial strategy.

Research radar: the latest developments in work and climate

Indigenous-led development a path forward for critical minerals. The Canadian Climate Institute released Critical Path, which explores how Canada can benefit economically from booming demand for critical minerals without compromising on Indigenous rights or environmental protection. It’s a fine line to walk, but I appreciate CCI’s recommendation that Indigenous communities should have ownership stakes and a degree of control over any projects on their territories. The report also emphasizes that trying to rush projects through—like the government is attempting to do with the Building Canada Act—is ultimately counterproductive. Rushed projects attract legal challenges and are prone to costly errors down the line.

Canada’s big bet on LNG a recipe for economic failure. The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis finds in a new analysis that the purported economic benefits of liquified natural gas for Canada are likely transient due to growing competition and a looming supply glut. Despite federal and provincial governments banking on LNG as an industry of the future, in the long term these projects will likely worsen affordability, environmental quality and economic stability in their communities.

Federal adaptation plan too weak given rising climate impacts. The Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable Development has found once again that a federal climate plan is too vague and unambitious to meet a major challenge. This time, it is the National Adaptation Strategy that comes under fire for failing to prioritize the greatest climate risks, to allocate sufficient resources or to develop a framework for measuring results. Climate adaptation is vital, but a piecemeal approach won’t insulate us from the growing impacts of extreme weather.

Disadvantaged communities are being cut out of the EV transition. A study published in Nature Communications finds that disadvantaged communities in the U.S.—defined by low socioeconomic status and a high dependence on fossil fuels—have access to half as many electric vehicle charging stations as other communities. It’s not an especially surprising finding given the North American EV market’s focus on luxury vehicles and at-home charging, but it reinforces the risk of transition policies exacerbating inequality.

UK must leave oil in the ground to meet emissions goals… Researchers at University College London published The Climate Implications of New Oil and Gas Fields in the UK, which makes it very clear that the UK cannot develop any additional fossil fuel projects without endangering domestic and global climate commitments. The recognition that most fossil fuels need to go unburned has been established for a long time, but governments around the world continue to entertain expansion plans.

…while scaling up offshore wind in its place. The UK’s Energy Transition Unit published Striking the Balance, which models different scenarios for the future of the UK’s offshore energy workforce. While offshore oil and gas jobs are slated to decline in the coming decades in most scenarios, they can be more than offset through an expansion of offshore wind power. It’s a prime opportunity for a just transition but only if the public sector can mobilize the requisite investment.

Ireland publishes first official just transition report. Kudos to the Just Transition Commission of Ireland for releasing its introductory report this month. This newsletter is a big fan of the Scottish Just Transition Commission, and the new Irish commission has a similar mandate. The initial report focuses on the big picture for Ireland, recommending a comprehensive just transition strategy and the institutional framework necessary to support it. Hopefully, the commission will follow in the footsteps of their Scottish counterparts by engaging directly with workers and communities in future work.

RBC remains the biggest climate villain in the Canadian banking sector. The 2025 edition of the Banking on Climate Chaos report by a coalition of global ENGOs lists RBC as the 8th largest fossil fuel financier in the world, increasing its financing to the fossil fuel industry by US$34.3 billion over last year. Every major Canadian bank is overinvested in fossil fuels relative to its international peers. The report calls out the Coastal GasLink pipeline project, which is being pushed through Wetʼsuwetʼen territory in the face of significant opposition, as a particularly egregious project. Collectively, the global banking sector committed US$429 billion toward fossil fuel expansion projects last year.

Global climate investment falling short by half or more. Speaking of finance, a new report from Oil Change International, Private Fantasies, Public Realities, finds that the world is only spending 38 per cent of what is necessary to achieve a just transition to a net-zero global economy. A similar finding is buried in the International Energy Agency’s latest World Energy Investment report, which concludes that clean energy investment needs to double or triple to meet climate goals. According to OCI, the main issue is deference to the private sector and the hope that the market will voluntarily shift its investment dollars from dirty to clean sectors. The report calls for stronger green industrial policy as a solution.

South Africa a case study in why carbon tariffs work. The Net-Zero Tracker published Carbon Competitiveness, which describes the need for South Africa to decarbonize its exports to meet the demands of the EU and other economies that apply a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) to imports. In short, a CBAM applies the domestic carbon price to any good that was produced without facing a carbon price of its own. It’s a smart policy, now being entertained by Canada, to offset the competitiveness concerns of domestic carbon pricing systems. One of the big takeaways from this report, however, is that CBAMs are not only about domestic competitiveness—they also apply helpful pressure on other countries to improve their own climate policies.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/iStock-2150627382-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-08-01 01:56:11.521129

Some governing bodies like the EU have set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by incorporating alternatives to traditional jet fuel, including solar, but Mutrelle says that’s not enough.
“You also need to drive the costs of sustainable aviation fuel down,” she explained.
“And that requires subsidies.” Solar fuel is expensive, several times more per gallon than fossil fuel, because, unlike with petroleum, the infrastructure doesn’t exist yet.
So, even though it’s drop-in ready, solar fuel isn’t yet a viable commercial alternative.","The YouTube page of Synhelion has a series of videos that look kind of like a combination of a “Fast and Furious” movie and a Silicon Valley tech ad: cars, boats and motorcycles fueling up and going fast.

In the age of electric vehicles, it looks like something from another era. In fact, watching these videos without sound, one might not even realize that they’re advertising renewable energy.

Synhelion is a Swiss startup that produces so-called “solar fuel,” which is a bit of a misnomer, according to the company’s founder and CEO, Dr. Phillipp Furler. The product isn’t actually sunlight in a tank but a synthetic gas made by combining carbon dioxide and water at super high temperatures generated by solar power. Now, it’s being explored for use as a drop-in-ready alternative to traditional fossil fuels.

“We use solar heat to drive a thermochemical process,” Furler said. “Typically, we go to around 1,200 degrees (2,192 degrees Fahrenheit), and we operate the chemistry at around 900 degrees celsius (1,652 degrees Fahrenheit).”

Furler said the company uses a field of mirrors to harness power from the sun. That power is then transferred to a lab, where a thermochemical process is used to create the synthetic fuel, which can be used in the same way as traditional fossil fuels, such as gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Analysts say it’s an attractive option, because you don’t need to reinvent the wheel and build a new, zero-emission vehicle; you just need to plop in a different kind of gas at the pump.

“[It’s] not just a future hope. [It’s] a present solution,” said Camille Mutrelle, an aviation policy expert for Transport and Environment, a Brussels-based organization that advocates for clean energy transportation.

According to Mutrelle, synthetic fuels like Synhelion’s could play an essential role in decarbonizing the aviation sector, especially on long-haul flights. That’s because, unlike with cars, batteries for airplanes — especially those travelling far — can’t store enough energy. If they were big enough to do that, they’d be too heavy to fly.

“Unlike for short routes, where battery or hydrogen-powered planes might eventually be a viable solution, long-distance aviation simply cannot wait for those technologies to mature,” she said.

Some governing bodies like the EU have set ambitious targets to reduce emissions by incorporating alternatives to traditional jet fuel, including solar, but Mutrelle says that’s not enough.

“You also need to drive the costs of sustainable aviation fuel down,” she explained. “And that requires subsidies.”

Solar fuel is expensive, several times more per gallon than fossil fuel, because, unlike with petroleum, the infrastructure doesn’t exist yet. So, even though it’s drop-in ready, solar fuel isn’t yet a viable commercial alternative. Mutrelle said companies like Synhellion need support in order to scale up and make it cheaper.

“These fuels exist, and now the ball is definitely in the court of governments and whether they can provide the right support for these fuels to take off,” she said.

Synhelion, for its part, isn’t waiting around. Over the past few months the company has been testing its fuel on all sorts of vehicles — and of course, posting flashy videos of their tests online.

“So far, we powered a motorcycle, we powered a steamboat and we powered a historic race car,” said Synhelion’s Furler.

Notably absent from that list: an airplane. But fasten your seatbelts, because Furler said more tests are on the way.",https://media.pri.org/s3fs-public/uploads/2025/07/2025-07-31-solar-power-lede3.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 15:56:26.136898

The first time you see a rendering of blended wing-body aircraft, you can see the future of aviation taking shape. From the cockpit, the design curves out into a rounded triangle toward the wings, finishing in a trapezoid behind them. The engines pop out of the top like dorsal fins. It’s sleek, aerodynamic. Then you wonder what the inside looks like. Sadly, we don’t have real-life examples of what the flying experience will be like inside the blended wing-body aircraft, but the innovative designs promise more interior room while using less fuel. So, when will we see these planes in the skies?

A New Era in Aircraft Design

If all goes well with aerospace and aviation manufacturer JetZero’s Z4, the first blended wing-body flight could take place in 2027. The U.S. Air Force has invested $235 million in the craft’s development. United has an agreement in place to order up to 100 of the planes, with the option to order 100 more.

“United’s investment in our company signals the industry’s belief that new, innovative technology is needed in order to achieve the efficiency and cost savings that will be required to meet the continued growth in demand for air travel across the globe,” said Tom O’Leary, CEO and co-founder of JetZero. “JetZero is focused on one key technology – the airframe – that enables us to address all of the barriers to growth. This program is the only one in development today that promises efficiency and an elevated customer experience.”

The blended wing-body design can cut fuel consumption in half compared to similarly sized aircraft. The Z4’s engines will be compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel, offering the potential for even more emissions savings.

“If successful, JetZero has the potential to evolve our core mainline business by developing aircraft with a bigger, more comfortable cabin experience for our customers while increasing fuel efficiency across our network,” said Andrew Chang, head of United Airlines Ventures. “United Airlines Ventures was created to support our efforts to find innovative companies that can enhance the customer travel experience and help the airline lower its carbon footprint, and we believe JetZero reflects that philosophy.”

As for that customer travel experience, the blended wing-body design leaves more room for comfortable seating arrangements and a wider door for faster boarding and deplaning. The design will still be compatible with current runway and jetway layouts. With a goal of launching commercial flights in 2030, JetZero plans for the Z4 to be able to carry up to 250 passengers on a 5,000-nautical mile range, good enough for service on transatlantic routes.

Competing for a Cleaner Tomorrow

A little competition could be key to getting blended wing-body aircraft into the skies in the next few years. In addition to its deal with United, JetZero has also reached an agreement with Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab to design the interior of the commercial Z4 and help Delta along on its 2050 net zero goal.

“While Delta is focused on doing what we can today to address our carbon footprint, it’s critical we also work with a variety of partners to advance revolutionary technologies, like JetZero’s BWB aircraft, to solve for a significant portion of future aviation emissions,” Delta chief sustainability officer Amelia DeLuca said.

JetZero’s competition is another Southern California-based aviation company, Natilus, which is developing its Horizon blended wing-body aircraft to carry 200 passengers on intercontinental and transatlantic routes. With emission reductions of 50% and 40% more interior space than tube-and-wing airplanes, Horizon will be able to lower drag and weight, burning less fuel.

“We have about 30% more floor space than a traditional airplane,” Natilus CEO Aleksey Matyushev told CNN. “So, what I think a lot of our customers are thinking about is an elevated passenger experience. Could you bring back the lounge? Are there other spaces in the airplane that you could carve out for those long flights?”

Like JetZero, Natilus also hopes to have commercial blended wing-body aircraft enter service by 2030. Horizon will apply lessons learned from Kona, Natilus’ air freight product, which the company says will be able to carry a payload of 3.8 metric tons over a distance of 900 nautical miles. There are 400 orders for Kona planes, and Natilus hopes to have a model off the ground in 2026.

“There’s a lot of questions about how you build a blended body at full scale, because all we have is wind tunnel data right now and then scale prototypes, but nobody’s actually built one at full scale,” Matyushev told CNN.

The discoveries these aviation innovators make in the next couple of years could go a long way toward shaping the future of flight.",https://thebossmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Group-3073-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 15:56:36.809116

As it is structured, the concerns of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee are strictly focused on aviation fuels, including Def Stan 91-091.
The Aviation Fuel Committee within the MoD advises on technical changes, but only government officials can make binding updates.
In the UK, aviation fuel is typically transported directly from refineries to airports in a controlled fashion that preserves blend and source identity.
In the United States, jet fuel often travels through multi-product pipelines where it is commingled with jet fuel from multiple refineries, making traceability and segregation more difficult.","The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) has taken a major step forward in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption with a landmark update to its Defence Standard 91-091 (DS91-091)—the nation’s official specification for Jet A-1 fuel used across both military and civilian aircraft.

While ASTM D1655 remains the globally recognised benchmark for conventional jet fuel, the UK’s revised Def Stan introduces a notable divergence. As of May 2025, the standard now allows up to 30% renewable HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) to be co-processed into Jet A-1 fuel, up from the previous 5% cap. This change was spearheaded by a government-industry task force led by Air bp, the aviation division of bp, with input from the MoD, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), fuel producers and major airlines.

The move marks a significant shift in SAF policy, aiming to accelerate decarbonisation across the aviation sector. bp, which is already producing SAF via co-processing, has announced plans to increase its renewable feedstock volumes in line with the new standard.

The promise of co-processing

Co-processing refers to the practice of integrating renewable or waste-derived feedstocks—such as used cooking oil, tallow, and vegetable oils—into conventional fuel production processes. The appeal of co-processing lies in its ability to reduce carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions while leveraging existing refineries and distribution networks. It also provides an efficient route to manage hard-to-recycle waste materials by turning them into high-value, high-quality fuels.

Colonel Pete Skinsley, deputy head of Operations at the UK MoD’s Operational Energy Authority, heralded the change as a significant milestone for the industry. “Co-processing produces high-quality fuel that meets stringent aviation standards, while helping to increase the volume of SAF available to customers,” he says.

A key driver behind the UK MoD’s move is the UK government’s mandate, announced in 2024, that will require 2% of total UK jet fuel demand to be met with SAF in 2025, increasing to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040. The UK government also introduced a 10% cap on the contribution of HEFA feedstocks to the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). RTFO is a government policy that requires suppliers of transport fuel in the UK to ensure that a certain percentage of the fuel they supply comes from renewable and sustainable sources. As of 2025, suppliers must meet an increasing percentage target—set to reach up to 14.6% by energy in 2032.

This move was part of a broader strategy to encourage a more diverse and sustainable range of biofuel feedstocks, reduce over-reliance on HEFA—which is derived from waste oils and fats—and promote investment in advanced, waste-based, and non-food crop feedstocks such as cellulosic materials and e-fuels.

A significant change in concept

UK SAF volumes could technically be achieved through blending synthetic components certified under ASTM D7566 (which is recognised in DS91-091), says George R. Wilson, vice chair of ASTM D02.J, the Aviation Fuel Subcommittee. Wilson is also a member of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee.

ASTM D7566 defines the requirements for blending synthetic fuels with conventional Jet A or Jet A-1 to create drop-in aviation fuels that are safe and compatible with existing aircraft and infrastructure. However, co-processing integrates renewable feedstocks directly into existing fossil fuel refining processes, allowing all resulting Jet A-1 fuel—including the fossil portion—to qualify as renewable under certain regulatory frameworks.

A shift from 5% to 30% co-processing is a significant change in concept, says Wilson. The 5% limit fits within standard refinery operations, requiring no substantial modification. A 30% approach demands process adjustments to ensure a meaningful share of renewable content enters the jet fuel. Altering the process that generates jet kerosene can have potential effects on the production of lighter ends (such as gasoline) and heavier distillates (like diesel fuel), he says.

ASTM ballot to increase co-processing ballot fails

While ASTM D7566 governs the certification of SAF produced via dedicated synthetic pathways, co-processing is addressed under ASTM D1655. D1655 and DS 91-091 are traditionally harmonised. However, a recent ASTM ballot to increase the approved level of co-processing in Annex 1 from 5% to 30% failed within D02.J. The effort was led by an ASTM task force, which included industry stakeholders such as Air bp. Following the failed ballot, both the task force chair and vice chair resigned. As a result, the task force is currently in stasis.

Aviation is the most conservative sector when it comes to fuels — and with good reason. Innovation is welcomed, but only when it poses no operational risk. According to Wilson, the broader liquid fuel products community raised many questions, with the most significant being the lack of supporting data. The general sentiment is that there isn’t enough diverse data to make a broader case that this approach won’t negatively impact other fuels. Wilson noted that the lack of data may be overcome if, indeed, UK refiners start boosting the content of HEFA.

ASTM vs UK Def Stan standards

One of the fundamental differences between ASTM and Def Stan lies in their governance. ASTM is a voluntary, consensus-based standards body. The Aviation Fuel Subcommittee includes a balanced membership of users, producers and general interest parties. Any approved measure must be ratified by the overarching D02 Committee on Petroleum Products, Liquid Fuels, and Lubricants.

In contrast, Def Stan is a government-mandated specification, developed and enforced by the UK MoD. Final decisions rest with His Majesty’s Government. As it is structured, the concerns of the UK MoD Aviation Fuel Committee are strictly focused on aviation fuels, including Def Stan 91-091. The Aviation Fuel Committee within the MoD advises on technical changes, but only government officials can make binding updates. If there is input from non-aviation sources, it happens at the government level. The tension between the two specifications is driven by their different natures, says Wilson.

Another key difference between the specifications lies in how their home markets operate. In the UK, aviation fuel is typically transported directly from refineries to airports in a controlled fashion that preserves blend and source identity. In the United States, jet fuel often travels through multi-product pipelines where it is commingled with jet fuel from multiple refineries, making traceability and segregation more difficult. The same pipelines also carry automotive gasoline and diesel fuels separated only by the physics of the process. This method is called batching or sequential batch transport. For example, the UK specification was able to identify a single synthetic fuel manufacturer, Sasol, which would have been impossible for ASTM, says Wilson.

Ongoing efforts to broaden SAF integration

Although ASTM Subcommittee D02.J rejected the proposal to allow 30% co-processing, efforts to broaden SAF integration are ongoing. A parallel initiative—designated WK94882—aims to revise D1655 to permit generic co-processing of multiple non-conventional feedstocks at levels up to 5%, with a combined maximum of 10%. While synthetic fuels such as hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids – synthetic paraffinic kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Fischer-Tropsch synthetic paraffinic kerosene (FT-SPK) have undergone extensive testing over several years, co-processing novel or mixed feedstocks introduces new challenges. The proposal seeks to establish a framework that would allow any hydrocarbon source — up to 5% volume via a suitable hydroprocessed pathway — to be safely incorporated.

The first ballot on WK94882 was conducted at the subcommittee level. While it passed statistically, Wilson noted that there were too many negatives to reach consensus without additional data. He again reiterated the scrutiny coming from other liquid fuel sectors—such as gasoline and diesel fuel producers—who want to ensure that any controls introduced to guarantee a clean, usable jet fuel product will also safeguard the integrity of their fuels.

Despite these challenges, Wilson remains optimistic. He believes that if UK refiners move forward with producing Jet A-1 with 30% co-processing under Def Stan 91-091, the resulting operational data could build the case needed to revisit ASTM’s position. Over time, with additional data, both the 30% HEFA approach and more flexible co-processing proposals could be adopted under ASTM D1655, he believes.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2-UK-takes-bold-lead-with-30-SAF-co-processing-in-Jet-A-1-fuel.webp,N,,2025-07-31 17:56:41.351387

Under the agreement, GranBio will lead the proposed project to deploy its proprietary AVAP® technology to convert lignocellulosic biomass into second-generation ethanol, which will be upgraded into SAF for sale to an offtaker. The new facility would leverage RYAM's infrastructure at the Jesup plant, including feedstock, utilities, and logistics. The project will be partially financed through GranBio's $100 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.

In addition to advancing its strategic goal of maximizing value from existing assets, should the project proceed, RYAM would receive a license to GranBio's latest-generation Celer2L™ yeast and AVAP technologies for ethanol and sugar production at its own facility, in partnership with GranBio — a meaningful step in diversifying into high-growth biofuel and biochemical markets.

""This MoU aligns with our strategy to unlock new value from our core assets and expand into renewable markets where our infrastructure and technical capabilities create a competitive advantage,"" said De Lyle Bloomquist, President and CEO of RYAM. ""GranBio brings world-class technology to this partnership, and together we're exploring practical, scalable solutions to help decarbonize global aviation fuel markets.""

This first-of-its-kind project marks a major milestone in GranBio's strategic goal of systematically scaling up SAF production, with strong potential for replication.

The due diligence is expected to conclude later this year, at which point both parties will determine next steps. The MoU underscores both companies' commitment to sustainability, innovation, and the development of next-generation biomaterials and fuels.
