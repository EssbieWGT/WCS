Tim Walz highlights the state's ability to innovate in ag at Farmfest visit,"Michael Johnson, www.agweek.com, michael-johnson",,,,,https://www.agweek.com/news/policy/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-highlights-the-states-ability-to-innovate-in-ag-at-farmfest-visit,"MORGAN, Minn. — In a time of uncertainty, Minnesota Gov.
Tim Walz said one thing that remains certain is the resilience of Minnesota farmers.
How can we make sure that we are there to innovate around energy and make things work, and how do we keep rural areas thriving?” he said.
But uncertainty continues to rise to the top, including around trade deals, rural economies and health care for rural communities.
While uncertainty has been a word tossed around often in the last few years, Walz said there are things happening in Minnesota to help.","MORGAN, Minn. — In a time of uncertainty, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said one thing that remains certain is the resilience of Minnesota farmers.

“I think there is a deep understanding that, economically, culturally, in our position in the world, it’s incumbent on Minnesota to understand how do we continue to feed an ever-growing world? How can we make sure that we are there to innovate around energy and make things work, and how do we keep rural areas thriving?” he said.

He shared that message during a visit to Minnesota Farmfest on Wednesday, Aug. 6, where he addressed crowds prior to a talk on the future outlook of Minnesota’s agricultural higher education and workforce.

Walz said he’s heard of the depressed commodity prices. He knows the cattle producers are feeling good. But uncertainty continues to rise to the top, including around trade deals, rural economies and health care for rural communities.

“I think overall we’ve had a pretty good summer. I think crops are in pretty good shape; again, those commodity prices are too low, but it’s a resilient group of folks,” Walz said.

Grain marketers noted during the Farmfest event that a big crop in the fields is not helping the current price of commodities. Farmers also commented that, because of those low prices, they need every bushel they can squeeze out of their fields.

While uncertainty has been a word tossed around often in the last few years, Walz said there are things happening in Minnesota to help.

He said being able to come to the table and pass a bipartisan budget and agriculture bill is important in getting things done and funding necessary work. Another area is voluntary conservation programs that producers are jumping up to be involved in like the Ag Water Quality Certification Program .

Minnesota continues to be a leader in agricultural innovation, as it has for decades. He mentioned Norman Borlaug’s work to increase yields and solve world hunger issues in the early part of the 20th century, eventually being named the “father of the green revolution.”

He said Minnesota ag producers remain at the forefront of innovation today and must continue to be supported.

Globally, he mentioned the state government will continue to work to expand markets. He said they’ll make visits to Ireland, Switzerland and Germany soon.

But he said creating markets at home is also of chief importance.

“Ag Commissioner (Thom) Petersen is out a lot trying to establish those new markets. But I think more importantly here, trying to enhance our biofuels here in Minnesota with sustainable aviation fuel.”

Sustainable aviation fuel was a main topic of a Tuesday panel focused on sustainability in Midwest agriculture. While work is advancing in that area, it is one that is not likely to bring farmers relief from low commodity prices in the short-term. But it could be a major boost for those that can weather the current economic hardships and for those generations coming up the ladder.

Walz said Minnesota has an obligation to continue to support the next generation through such avenues as higher education so they can be as resilient as the generations that came before them.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/5a207b1/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x3024+0+0/resize/1421x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd6%2F7f%2Fe8484a544af2b021e4d677dcebbf%2Fwalzsoybean.JPG,N,,2025-08-06 18:56:24.949070

In 2021, in our response to the (first) SAF mandate consultation, we argued that crop based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonizing road transport.
A decline in renewable road fuel would increase biomass availability in the later 2020s.
Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies.
either HEFA or crop-based AtJ SAF made from UK bioethanol can be used to fulfil the HEFA cap.","The Renewable Transport Fuels Association calls for the U.K.’s SAF mandate to be amended, to make British bioethanol eligible. It should fall within the HEFA cap, i.e. allowing either HEFA or U.K. crop-based AtJ SAF to be used to fulfil the HEFA cap.

In 2021, in our response to the (first) SAF mandate consultation, we argued that crop based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonizing road transport.

We are now in this situation. UK produced bioethanol is no longer required for decarbonizing road transport. That is not because electrification has eroded demand, but as a consequence of the Tariff Free Quota carelessly and shockingly handed to the US in the US-UK Trade deal agreed on 8th May this year, and which became law on 30th June. As members will be aware, the TRQ covers 1.4bn liters bioethanol, a volume which corresponds to the demand required for supplying E10.

The previous Government was supportive of this position. In Targeting net zero – next steps for the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation: Government response, dated July 2021, it envisaged that a decline in requirements for road fuel would open up the opportunity for these fuels to be used for SAF production. To quote from page 20 of that document:

“We know we will need renewable fuel for aviation and freight. We need to encourage and support these sectors. We are working closely with industry on how to do this, in particular, on proposals for a sustainable aviation fuel mandate, and plan to publish a consultation on this soon. As a result of such a mandate, over time there will be a transition of the renewable road fuels market over to an aviation one. A decline in renewable road fuel would increase biomass availability in the later 2020s. Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies. This presents us, and UK industry, an opportunity to push forward the transition of feedstocks currently used for road fuel to other sectors.”

We are calling for the SAF Mandate to be amended, in order that British bioethanol is eligible for the SAF mandate, as an alternative to HEFA, i.e. either HEFA or crop-based AtJ SAF made from UK bioethanol can be used to fulfil the HEFA cap.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/RTFA_Logo_e37cd94c9e.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 17:56:32.351360

The Act includes the following significant transition provisions and other changes with respect to energy tax credits:

accelerates the phase-outs for solar and wind projects under the tech-neutral investment tax credits (ITCs) and production tax credits (PTCs), but retains the longer runway for non-wind and solar generation (e.g., storage, hydropower and geothermal);

modifies the advanced manufacturing PTCs (45X Credits) by curtailing wind-component eligibility, providing temporary credits for metallurgical coal, and revising rules for integrated producers;

extends the eligibility timeframe for clean fuel production tax credits (45Z Credits) and modifies the 45Z Credit values and computation methodology;

eliminates after 2025 tax credits for commercial and residential electric vehicles (with a phase-down depending on volume of cars sold), individual tax credits for residential solar systems and the tax credits for charging stations and energy efficient homes; and

adopts foreign entity of concern (FEOC) rules imposing certain foreign supply chain and ownership restrictions on taxpayers seeking certain tax credits, including ITCs and PTCs.

These changes are discussed in greater detail below. A quick reference chart and applicability roadmap are included at the end of this Alert.

Key Changes Affecting Energy Tax Credits

Sections 48E (Technology-Neutral ITC) and 45Y (Technology-Neutral PTC)

If a wind or solar facility does not begin construction within one year of the Act’s enactment (i.e., by July 4, 2026), then ITCs and PTCs are terminated unless the facility is placed in service on or before December 31, 2027. New “beginning of construction” guidance is expected to be issued pursuant to a recent executive order (discussed below).

The phase-out of the Section 48E ITC and Section 45Y PTC for all other qualified facilities — including energy storage facilities and fuel cells — begins in 2034. Facilities that begin construction in 2034 will be eligible for 75% of the full credit amount, dropping to 50% for construction beginning in 2035, and phasing out entirely for projects beginning in 2036 or later.

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the 48E ITC and 45Y PTC will no longer be available for investments in certain qualified properties under Section 25D — such as solar water heating or residential small wind energy systems — if the taxpayer rents or leases the property to a third party during the taxable year.

Executive Order Targeting Solar and Wind Credits

On July 7, 2025, the president issued an executive order (the EO) directly targeting ITCs and PTCs for solar and wind facilities. The EO directs Treasury to issue new “beginning of construction” guidance for purposes of Sections 45Y and 48E by August 18, 2025. According to the EO, this guidance will restrict “the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.” This guidance could significantly impact safe harbor strategies on which taxpayers have historically relied.

This EO signals the Trump administration’s intention to increase enforcement of the technical requirements for solar and wind energy tax credits. This additional scrutiny builds upon the Biden administration’s ramp-up in audits of taxpayers claiming green energy tax credits. Taxpayers should maintain detailed, contemporaneous documentation to support eligibility for any credits claimed.

Section 45X (Advanced Manufacturing)

The Act phases out or eliminates the Section 45X Credit at different rates depending on the component or critical mineral produced.

For critical minerals — excluding metallurgical coal, which is newly eligible but only through 2029 — the 45X Credit begins to phase out starting in 2031. Specifically, the credit is reduced to 75% for critical minerals produced in 2031, 50% in 2032, 25% in 2033 and fully eliminated for critical minerals produced in 2034 and beyond.

The current phase-out schedule for the 45X Credit for advanced manufacturing of solar and storage components remains unchanged. However, the credit is eliminated for wind components sold after December 31, 2027. Additionally, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, battery modules qualify for the credit only if they are “comprised of all other essential equipment needed for battery functionality, such as current collector assemblies and voltage sense harnesses, and other energy collection equipment.”

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, taxpayers are ineligible for the 45X Credit if they either receive material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity or are themselves classified as a prohibited foreign entity.

Finally, the Act introduces new requirements for vertically integrated producers that generate multiple 45X Credits by manufacturing more than one eligible component. For taxable years beginning after 2026, the credit will be available only if the “primary” eligible component is integrated into a “secondary” eligible component within the same facility and the secondary component is sold to an unrelated party. In addition, at least 65% of the secondary component’s direct material costs must be attributable to primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the U.S.

Section 45Z (Clean Fuels)

The Act extends the Section 45Z Credit for two years through December 31, 2029, but eliminates the $1.75 increased credit value that was previously available for sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) produced after 2025.

For clean fuels produced after 2025, the 45Z Credit is unavailable if any foreign feedstocks — that is, feedstocks that are not produced in the U.S., Mexico or Canada — are used in their production. And for clean fuels that can be used as feedstocks for other clean fuels (such as clean ethanol used to produce clean jet fuel), the definition of “transportation fuel” has been revised to require that the base fuel not be one for which a 45Z Credit is claimed.

When determining a fuel’s carbon intensity, the Act excludes emissions attributed to indirect land use change, which should in many cases reduce the carbon intensity and increase the credit’s value. For example, if a forest is cleared to grow crops for biofuels, the net emission increase associated with the land use change will be excluded from the lifecycle analysis, resulting in lower reported emissions. The Act also removes negative emissions rates — except for certain animal manure feedstocks — when calculating the value of the 45Z Credit.

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, the 45Z Credit is unavailable to any taxpayer that is either a specified foreign entity for taxable years after July 4, 2025, or a foreign-influenced entity (ignoring, for this purpose, any payments made to a specified foreign entity that provides the specified foreign entity with certain effective control over the taxpayer’s facility).

The SAF credit under Section 6426 is eliminated for any SAF (i) for which a 45Z Credit is claimed, if such SAF was sold or used after July 4, 2025, or (ii) sold or used after September 30, 2025.

The Act adds a new 20-cent-per-gallon small agri-biodiesel producer credit under Section 40A. The new credit — which can be stacked with the 45Z Credit and transferred under Section 6418 — is available for fuel produced after June 30, 2025, and sold or used before 2027.

Section 45Q (Carbon Capture and Sequestration)

The Act retains the Section 45Q Credit for qualified facilities that start construction before 2033. For equipment or qualified facilities placed in service after July 4, 2025, the amount of the 45Q Credit for enhanced oil recovery activities and carbon sequestration activities is the same. Beginning in 2027, the credit’s value is indexed for inflation.

Under the “FEOC Ownership Restrictions” described below, for taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the 45Z Credit is unavailable to any taxpayer that is either a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity (ignoring, for this purpose, any payments made to a specified foreign entity that provides the specified foreign entity with certain effective control over the taxpayer’s facility).

Section 45V (Clean Hydrogen)

The Act terminates the Section 45V clean hydrogen PTC for facilities that begin construction after 2027.

Publicly traded partnerships are allowed to treat income from the transportation or storage of liquified or compressed hydrogen as “qualifying” income.

Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) Rules

Historically, direct or indirect ownership by certain individuals and entities incorporated in or with a strong nexus to China, North Korea, Russia or Iran (each, a ""covered nation""), jeopardized eligibility for the clean vehicle and advanced microchip tax credits. However, using supply chains with components from a covered nation did not previously impact credit eligibility. The Act introduces new FEOC rules that expand these restrictions and include both ownership and supply chain involvement.

FEOC Ownership Restrictions

For taxable years beginning after July 4, 2025, the Act prohibits any taxpayer that is a “prohibited foreign entity” from claiming most ITCs and PTCs. Prohibited foreign entities include “specified foreign entities” and “foreign-influenced entities.”

A “specified foreign entity” is an FEOC or covered nation described in one of several lists maintained pursuant to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal years 2021 and 2024 or any “foreign-controlled entity.” A “foreign-controlled entity” includes a subnational government body, agency or instrumentality of a covered nation, as well any entity that is 50% or more owned by, or that is organized or has its principal place of business in, a covered nation (or a subnational body, agency or instrumentality thereof).

A “foreign-influenced entity” is any entity with respect to which one or more specified foreign entities:

can appoint directors, executives or equivalent officers;

hold an aggregate 40% or more of the equity (or 25% if held by a single specified foreign entity);

for publicly traded companies, hold an aggregate 15% or more of the debt; or

receive, in the prior taxable year, payments under a contractual arrangement giving a specified foreign entity (or an entity related thereto) specific authority over “key aspects” of, or intellectual property rights related to, a qualified facility or energy storage technology owned by the entity or an eligible component produced by the entity.

There is a limited exception for bona fide purchases or sales of intellectual property rights that do not confer “effective control” on a specified foreign entity. However, under the statutory language, it appears that entering or modifying an intellectual property licensing agreement with a specified foreign entity after July 4, 2025, generally is deemed to confer “effective control,” resulting in the licensee being treated as a “foreign-influenced entity” (and thus a prohibited foreign entity).

The determination of whether a taxpayer is a prohibited foreign entity is made on the first day of the first taxable year beginning after July 4, 2025 (i.e., January 1, 2026, for calendar-year taxpayers) and on the last day of the taxable year for all subsequent years (i.e., on December 31, 2027, and thereafter, for calendar-year taxpayers).

For the Section 48E ITC, the Act includes a 10-year recapture period if a taxpayer claiming the credit for any taxable year beginning after July 4, 2027, makes certain “applicable payments” during the recapture period. Applicable payments include those made to a specified foreign entity that result in such entity obtaining effective control over a qualified facility.

FEOC Supply Chain Restrictions

Projects that begin construction after 2025 — based on the now-codified solar and wind start-of-construction safe harbors1 — will be ineligible for ITCs and PTCs if they receive “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” This restricts eligibility for projects that rely heavily on components sourced from China or other covered nations. A limited transition safe harbor applies to products manufactured under contracts executed before June 16, 2025.

The Act uses a “material assistance cost ratio” to determine if a taxpayer received “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” If a project’s ratio is below the applicable threshold percentage, then the taxpayer is treated as having received material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity, rendering the project ineligible for ITCs and PTCs.

The material assistance cost ratio is computed by dividing (i) the direct costs of manufactured products (for qualified facilities or energy storage property, as defined in existing domestic content guidance) or direct material costs (ii) for eligible components not attributable to a prohibited foreign entity by the total direct material costs.

As shown below, the applicable threshold percentage — below which credit eligibility is lost — varies by facility, property or component type, and depends on the taxable year in which construction begins on the facility or property or the component is sold (starting in 2026).

48E Tech-Neutral ITCs and 45Y Tech-Neutral PTCs Begins Construction in: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 and after Qualified Facility (e.g., solar PV, wind) 40% 45% 50% 55% 60% EST 55% 60% 65% 70% 75% 45X Credits for Eligible Components Components Sold in: 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 and after Solar 50% 60% 70% 80% 85% Wind 85% 90% N/A N/A N/A Inverter 50% 55% 60% 65% 70% Battery Component 60% 65% 70% 80% 85% 45X Credits for Critical Minerals Components Sold in: 2026–2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 and after 0% 25% 30% 40% 50%

The Act also directs Treasury to publish “safe harbor tables” in future guidance, which taxpayers may rely on to determine the percentage of costs attributable to manufactured products or eligible components — provided they do not know the listed percentage is inaccurate. In the interim, taxpayers may rely on the tables included in IRS Notice 2025-08, issued under the existing domestic content rules.

Significant Treasury and IRS guidance will be needed to help taxpayers interpret and comply with these new FEOC supply chain restrictions.

Section 6418 (Transferability), Depreciation

The Act preserves transferability of renewable energy tax credits under Section 6418 for the full duration of the applicable credit period. However, it introduces an FEOC restriction that prohibits the transfer of any portion of the credits under Sections 45Q, 45X, 45Y, 45Z or 48E to any specified foreign entity.

In addition, the Act restores bonus depreciation (i.e., 100% expensing), including for energy properties. Qualified facilities eligible for ITCs and PTCs are also eligible for 5-year accelerated depreciation.

Many of the Act’s changes will require the IRS and Treasury to issue new guidance, which we will be monitoring closely. In the meantime, please reach out to any member of your Kirkland Tax team — including the authors listed below — with any questions or for further discussion.

Kushaagra Nandan is well versed in the gambit of green energies and is upbeat about India’s leadership role in lowering carbon emission. Here he speaks candidly about India’s quest for green energy — challenges, bottlenecks and solutions — that could take india forward towards green and clean future with India Business & Trade (IBT), in arrangement with The Pioneer. Here are the excerpts.

How is India placed for the global leader in biofuel technology?

India is uniquely positioned to become a global leader in biofuel technology — not just on cost, but through strategic strengths that foster innovation and scale. Our diverse agro-climatic zones demand adaptable, multi-feedstock technologies, which naturally drive R&D and innovation. Combined with India's excellence in engineering, this enables the development of scalable, affordable solutions tailored for both domestic and global markets. Another key advantage is the growing synergy between startups, academia, and policymakers in the clean energy space — creating a dynamic ecosystem for biofuel innovation. With a large and growing domestic market demand for alternate fuels, India is well placed to build and refine biofuel models that are globally relevant.

According to IEA, India is poised to become the fastest growing bioenergy market in the world by 2030, expected to contribute more than a third of global bioenergy demand growth.

Key initiatives like the National Bioenergy Programme, SATAT, GOBARdhan, and advancement in achieving E20 targets along with net-zero objectives through just energy transition reflect India's long-term commitment to clean energy.

At RED, we're contributing to this national mission through our four integrated verticals-T-EPC, project development, feedstock aggregation, and product manufacturing — covering the entire biofuel value chain. As part of our efforts toward India's goal of establishing 5,000 Compressed Biogas (CBG) plants by 2030 under SATAT, we've launched comprehensive engineering solutions for small-scale CBG plants. These solutions aim to bring innovation, quality, and affordability to the forefront of the CBG sector, reinforcing India's potential to export complete project solutions — from technology to financing frameworks.

With E20/E30 blending goals, is India's ecosystem truly ready?

India's E20 rollout marks a significant milestone, signalling strong policy intent and commendable progress by the industry along with the evolving ecosystem to support this transition at scale. However, Engine compatibility remains a key concern, particularly across older segments of the vehicle fleet. At the same time, upgrades are urgently needed across the fuel value chain — especially in storage, logistics, and the widespread availability of multi-grade dispensers. Equally critical is the need to strengthen quality control and monitoring frameworks to ensure fuel consistency and performance. Without this, even the best policy targets risk falling short in implementation. For the transition to be successful, it must be phased and regionally calibrated, with alignment from OEMs, awareness among consumers, and coordination across all stakeholders.

How can biofuel projects become more attractive?

To make biofuel projects more attractive to ESG and institutional investors, it must focus on reducing risk and increasing scalability. Long-term policy stability and clear regulatory frameworks are foundational — they create market confidence allowing certainty and long term visibility to investors.

Standardising key components like plant designs, feedstock contracts, and performance benchmarks will improve bankability and ease due diligence for financial institutions.

Equally important is the availability of blended finance tools-such as green bonds, viability gap funding, and partial risk guarantees — that can help de-risk early-stage investments and lower project costs.

Monetising carbon credits through verified MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) systems can unlock additional revenue streams and strengthen project viability. Most critically, we need transparent, ready-to-scale platforms — like the one we're building at RED — that offer integrated techno-financial solutions.

These platforms serve as bridges between clean energy projects and serious capital, enabling investment at scale and speed.

How can biofuel demand empower rural farmers?

Farmers need to be one of the key stakeholders in India's biofuel journey. With the right ecosystem in place, the growing demand for biofuels can transform agri-waste — such as crop residue, bamboo, and other biomass — into a consistent income stream for rural communities.

To make this a reality, we need structured procurement programs that ensure fair pricing and assured offtake.

It is also important to have access to shared infrastructure — like rental balers, mobile chippers, and transport-along with the establishment of village-level collection centres and pre-processing hubs. These measures will not only help monetise crop waste but also will significantly reduce stubble burning and related emissions. At RED, we've already begun enabling this shift. One of our four core verticals is feedstock aggregation, where we collect feedstocks like paddy straw, soya husk, and cane trash for biofuel production. Today, we operate more than 56 round balers making us the largest aggregation fleet operator and service provider in the country.

I strongly believe that by making farmers one of the primary stakeholders-not just suppliers — we can create a model where clean energy and rural prosperity go hand in hand.

Can digital technologies transform the biofuel value chain?

Yes, I believe digital technologies will play a pivotal role in transforming the biofuel value chain. AI can help in forecasting biomass availability by analysing weather patterns, cropping cycles, and market data-allowing for smarter planning. IoT sensors installed in digesters offer real-time insights into feedstock quality, system performance, and yield efficiency, enabling predictive maintenance and minimising downtime. Blockchain, too, is proving valuable by ensuring transparency and traceability in feedstock sourcing and carbon credit validation.

At RED, we're actively embracing this digital shift. We're deploying drone-based baling audits and digital plant dashboards that are streamlining operations, improving visibility, and driving better decision-making across the value chain.

Can India emerge as a global SAF supplier?

India has the potential, resources and market demand to become a major player in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market, but it will take coordinated, strategic action across policy, infrastructure, and innovation. A Deloitte India report highlights that India generates 230 tonnes of agricultural residue, a resource that can be channeled into SAF production. Combined with waste oils, this positions India strongly on the raw material front.

However, to match the momentum of regions like the US and EU — where robust mandates and incentives are already in place — India needs policy mandates for SAF blending in domestic aviation, along with investments in technology, refining capacity, certification mechanisms, and sustained R&D.

Public-private partnerships, access to enabling finance and export-friendly frameworks, will be key to unlocking India's role in the global SAF supply chain.

How can India ensure credibility in its biofuel sustainability claims?

Sustainability in biofuels must be transparent and led by science. Mandating lifecycle emission assessments, encouraging third-party certifications, and using non-edible, waste-based feedstocks are key. Further, investments in zero-liquid discharge and water recycling systems in manufacturing units will help reduce water usage. I believe that all sustainability initiatives undertaken should be verifiable, auditable and a core part of business operations.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.","The Minnesota Star Tribune reported last fall that the first sustainable aviation fuel, made from a Minnesota-grown crop called winter camelina, powered a Delta Air Lines flight from the Twin Cities to New York City. It marked the beginning of a plan by Minnesota SAF Hub—a coalition including Bank of America, Delta, Ecolab, and Xcel Energy—to eventually convert all Delta flights from MSP to bio-based jet fuels to reduce greenhouse gases.

You may think the sole star of the show here is sustainable aviation fuel. But, as a long-ago radio personality used to say, now for the rest of the story.

By tapping into the market for plant-based aviation fuel, University of Minnesota researchers at the Forever Green Initiative are commercializing two oil-producing plants—winter camelina and domesticated pennycress—that can give farmers a payday for planting winter cover crops that hold soil, take up excess nutrients, and help protect the quality of Minnesota’s streams and groundwater.

Mitch Hunter, associate director of the University’s Forever Green Initiative, says “What we’re trying to do is develop crops that make farmers money, and in the process, provide all those environmental benefits that we’ve been trying to get to for so long with very little success.”

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently awarded the University $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand project. It was selected as one of six projects working to “advance the production of low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops critical to accelerating a clean energy bioeconomy.

From Cover Crops to Jet Fuel

This story really begins with “the big brown spot”—the vast agriculture region of the upper Midwest that stands barren from October through April, with nothing growing to protect the soil. “You can see the brown of this uncovered landscape from space,” says Hunter.

That bare earth is prone to wind and water erosion. Runoff of nutrients, especially nitrogen, into streams and groundwater fertilizes lakes, pollutes sources of drinking water, and contributes to the “dead zone” at the end of the Mississippi River. Says Hunter, “When soil has nothing living on it, rain falls, filters through the soil, and draws those nutrients directly into our waterways. You have to have a plant living there to take up the nitrogen and the phosphorus.”

The solution—plant something, anything, to hold soil and take up excess nutrients until the next cash crop is planted. A recent report by Forever Green partners, including consultants Ecotone Analytics and Friends of the Mississippi River, estimated that widespread use of cover crops could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23 percent and soil erosion by 35 percent by 2050.

But folks have promoted cover crops for a long time. “They get a lot of buzz, and they’re adopted in Minnesota on 2 or 3 percent of the total cropland, despite years and years and years of education and investment and incentives,” says Hunter. “So that model isn’t working.”

The problem? Cover crops take both time and money.

The Many Contributions of the Forever Green Initiative

So about 30 years ago, the late Don Wyse, Forever Green cofounder and codirector, began working with farmers to grow a perennial rye grass that not only anchors soil, but can be sold for commercial grass seed. Says Hunter, “All of a sudden, you transformed the cropping systems in that region to have perennial cover for a large part of the rotation, and it was all because they developed a crop that actually made farmers money.”

Wyse and his colleagues went prospecting for other potentially profitable cover crops. Of 15 or so, two are pertinent to our story today. The first is winter camelina, an old crop from Europe related to cabbage, kale, broccoli, and canola. Like canola, it produces tiny seeds with an oil content as high as 35 percent. The other is pennycress, a new crop bred from a ubiquitous weed. Like camelina, it is rich in oil, exceptionally winter hardy, and even quicker to grow and mature.

Forever Green’s plan is to target the more than 2 million acres in Minnesota used to raise spring wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, and small grains—crops that are harvested in early fall. Then farmers can plant winter camelina or pennycress, let it grow through late fall, winter, and early spring, and harvest the oil seed crop in late spring before planting the next cash grain crop.

But how to market camelina or pennycress oil seeds to get a good price? Selling them for food-grade oil means competing with a lot of well-established oils like canola and sunflower. Sustainable diesel fuel is a possibility, but ground transportation seems to be moving toward electrification.

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially. Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global emission of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Like other fields of transportation, aviation seeks to reduce its fossil fuel use.

Trains, trucks, and automobiles have been able to replace internal combustion engines with electric motors and massive banks of batteries. Unfortunately, in the air, every ounce counts—so aviation has looked to fuels from renewable biological sources such as used cooking fat and dedicated energy crops.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.

Hunter adds that state incentives and private support will continue to further the development of sustainable fuels and environmentally beneficial farming practices

“That market is extremely hungry for oil,” says Hunter. “If we had a big supply right now, we could sell it.”

The Dutch and Belgian governments plan to exclude biofuels made from used cooking oil (UCO) and animal fats — listed under RED Annex IX Part B — from counting towards maritime fuel mandates. This contrasts with FuelEU Maritime, which rewards their use to cut shipping emissions. The divergence is expected to distort supply-demand dynamics and raise compliance costs for suppliers and shipowners.

Draft legislation in both countries obliges fuel suppliers to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across land, inland shipping and maritime sectors. Under the Dutch RED III draft, Annex IX Part B biofuels — including UCO and animal fats categories 1 and 2 — will count towards land and inland shipping mandates only, capped at 4.29pc and 11.07pc respectively. For international maritime shipping, the cap is set at zero. This means suppliers cannot claim emission reduction units (EREs) for Part B fuels used in maritime shipping, effectively disincentivising UCO-based biodiesel sales in the ARA region.

FuelEU Maritime, by contrast, mandates GHG cuts for maritime users starting at 2pc in 2025, rising to 80pc by 2050, and places no cap on Part B fuels. Like FuelEU Maritime, the Dutch RED III draft excludes crop-based biofuels from counting towards maritime GHG reduction targets. But unlike FuelEU, it also bars Annex IX Part B fuels — creating a sharper compliance gap for bunker suppliers.

This leaves used cooking oil methyl ester (Ucome) in a precarious position. Widely used in marine fuels due to its scale and compatibility with existing engines, Ucome-based blends will remain attractive to shipowners aiming to meet FuelEU Maritime targets. But ARA suppliers will need to sell Annex IX Part A fuels — such as bio-LNG or Advanced Fame 0 — to meet RED III targets or face penalties. This could push up Ucome prices, as suppliers seek to to offset non-compliance costs.

Advanced Fame 0-based marine biodiesel blends are currently attractive to buyers because marine mandates have not yet taken effect. Under the existing system, HBE-G renewable tickets — which will be replaced by EREs next year — can be deducted from the price of Part A fuels, but this may not be viable next year. Part B fuels from the marine sector do not currently generate HBEs.

Higher Ucome prices may inflate maritime-generated ERE values and boost demand for Part A fuels, raising overall biofuel costs and reducing ARA's competitiveness. Some shipowners may opt to bunker elsewhere. Many already source marine biodiesel from Asia, where prices are lower. Argus assessed B30 Ucome dob ARA at an average of $805.30/t during May–July, compared with $705.48/t in Singapore.

Prices for alternatives like RFNBOs and ammonia remain high, limiting near-term uptake. FuelEU abatement prices for Ucome-MGO and Ucome-VLSFO have been relatively flat this year, but could rise if Ucome prices firm.

Market reactions

Market participants are exploring ways to navigate the mandates. One option is blending small volumes of Advanced Fame 0 into bunker fuels, although this is logistically complex and could raise prices at ARA ports.

Another strategy involves sourcing marine-generated ERE tickets from over-compliant sellers. But supply may be tight, as only a limited share of inland and land-generated tickets can be transferred to the marine sector under the flexible credit allowance.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-08-06 13:56:44.899884

It is clear that more conversation and engagement are needed before the agency moves forward with application fee increases outlined in state rules.
A rule established in 2009 specifies that air and water permit application fees must be adjusted for inflation over time.
A water application fee that includes such infrastructure as feedlots in 2025 was $310 per point.
Likewise, the air application fee would have increased from $285 per point to $400.","ST. PAUL — A large increase to air and water permit fees rolled out on Friday, Aug. 1, by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has now been paused.

The announcement came after industry leaders and political leaders representing agriculture called the rollout untimely and unexpected .

On Tuesday morning, MPCA interim assistant communications director Dan Ruiter shared a statement from MPCA about the pause:

“The MPCA appreciates the feedback we received over the last week about the planned permit application fee increases. It is clear that more conversation and engagement are needed before the agency moves forward with application fee increases outlined in state rules. The MPCA will be pausing implementation of all air and water permit application fee increases while we schedule engagement sessions to hear additional feedback and plan thoughtful next steps. The agency values our shared work with permit holders to protect the environment and human health.""

Sen. Aric Putnam, DFL-St. Cloud, released a statement about the fee increase on Friday, Aug. 1. He shared that despite more than a dozen feedlot rulemaking meetings across the state in recent months, the increases were not previewed or communicated to the Department of Agriculture or Minnesota’s farmers and producers.

“I’m disappointed that these increases were not discussed in the many meetings that occurred in recent months surrounding feedlot permitting,"" Putnam said in a news release. ""I’ve talked to hundreds of farmers, and most aren’t opposed to updates to feedlot permitting. But they are rightly concerned about being shut out of the process — and that’s what happened today.""

When news of the pause was announced on the first day of Farmfest , on Tuesday, Aug. 5, Putnam was glad to hear that the MPCA would be hosting sessions to hear from the agriculture community.

He added that while increases to the fees were needed, that should be done in an approach that involves communicating with those it affects.

The fee increases stem from an attempt to adjust for inflation, and the fees have not been changed since 2009.

Prior to the pause, ag groups were made aware of the increase in an email on Thursday, July 31, from MPCA Feedlot Section manager Lisa Scheirer:

“On August 1, 2025, the MPCA is updating application fees for air and water permits. A rule established in 2009 specifies that air and water permit application fees must be adjusted for inflation over time. This update will align permit fees with the existing rule and help secure sufficient resources to protect Minnesota’s environment.”

The fees are to support the agency’s work “to protect Minnesota’s environment and public health by partially funding the technical review, analysis, implementation, compliance and enforcement that goes into every permit issued by the MPCA,” according to the MPCA website .

The original increases of 48% and 56% were not well received by ag groups, who quickly voiced their opposition to the way the changes were implemented without prior notice.

A water application fee that includes such infrastructure as feedlots in 2025 was $310 per point. That would have increased to $485 for fiscal years 2026-2027 under the original increase. Likewise, the air application fee would have increased from $285 per point to $400. Points are based on the permit action and work necessary to complete it, as well as other factors like the size of the project.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/7235caf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1788x886+0+0/resize/2151x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fcd%2Fb2%2Fed4eed5e43d0b1dc1cd7289dd0bf%2Ffeedlot-meeting.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 16:56:16.556628

Through this platform, companies can effectively trade the environmental benefits associated with their use of SAF, a key component in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.
With the first phase now complete, the project is moving into its second phase, which will see an expansion in the number of participating companies.
The project partners will use this next phase to refine the scheme and consider various approaches ahead of its full-scale social implementation.","A pioneering project to build a new scheme for trading Scope 3 environmental value to encourage the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has successfully completed its first phase of demonstration testing. The initiative, spearheaded by Japan Airlines Co., Ltd., ITOCHU Corporation, and a consortium of other key players in the Japanese industry, has confirmed the effectiveness of its innovative trading platform and is now set to expand.

The project, which launched in August 2024, is the first of its kind in the world. The initial demonstration test was conducted over eight months from August 2024 to March 2025. It involved a core group of companies including ENEOS Corporation, NIPPON EXPRESS HOLDINGS, INC., Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Mizuho Research & Technologies, Ltd., and NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CORPORATION.

The main objective of the first phase was to verify the efficacy of a new trading platform designed to facilitate the exchange of Scope 3 environmental value. This value is tied to the reduction of carbon emissions from a company's value chain, particularly those generated by air travel. Through this platform, companies can effectively trade the environmental benefits associated with their use of SAF, a key component in reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

During the demonstration period, the participating companies successfully registered trading information on the platform, leading to successful transactions through a matching process based on trading terms and the signing of bilateral contracts. The platform's ability to ensure transparency and appropriateness in its processes—from registration to matching and contracting—was also confirmed through an evaluation by a third-party organization, Nippon Kaiji Kyokai (ClassNK).

The successful outcomes of this initial phase are a significant step forward for the project partners. The demonstration test not only allowed the companies to gain valuable knowledge about Scope 3 environmental value trading but also helped them identify key issues and areas for improvement.

With the first phase now complete, the project is moving into its second phase, which will see an expansion in the number of participating companies. This expansion is designed to further boost awareness of Scope 3 environmental value and to ramp up trading volume. The project partners will use this next phase to refine the scheme and consider various approaches ahead of its full-scale social implementation. This forward-looking approach underscores a strong commitment to establishing a robust and transparent framework for SAF-related carbon trading, which could serve as a global model for aviation decarbonization.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-06 12:56:48.604410

Rodolfo Tellez-Schmill, Product Champion for the Petro-SIM process twin, commented: “Any miscalculation in product quality or properties directly impacts production planning, energy use, and profitability. In a volatile market, process optimisation is no longer optional.”

Petro-SIM v7.6 addresses this challenge by combining high-fidelity modelling with improved workflows that allow operators to explore new, low-carbon pathways. These improvements help operators reduce energy waste and production losses, which are key contributors to approximately 5000 million t of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions generated by oil and gas operations each year, as reported in the 2023 IEA World Energy Outlook Report. By simulating and optimising performance across traditional and emerging processes, Petro-SIM supports efficient and lower-emission operations in crude refining, renewable fuel production, and plastic waste-to-polymer circular processes.

Key features and benefits include:

FTR-SIM (Fischer-Tropsch reactor model) is a robust kinetic-based reactor model that simulates Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for SAF production. It enables users to optimise operations and model the integration with downstream hydroprocessing for a complete digital twin of sustainable fuel production.

New NOMAD solver for optimisation solves difficult blackbox optimisation problems to optimise energy efficiency while streamlining production planning and reducing emissions.

AI/ML integration and digitalisation combines AI/ML models with first-principals physics-based models to deliver smarter predictions, improved optimisations, and enhanced decision-making within scheduling and planning.

Advanced polymer modelling powered by Predici predicts polymer properties, optimises grade transitions, and monitors catalyst impacts to support dynamic production digital twins that minimise downtime and off-specification material.

Renewables and hydroprocessing enhancements improve kinetic modelling for renewable feedstocks. Enhancements in hydrotreating, isomerization, and hydrocracking simulations include upgrades to liquid recycling and external gas quenching processes that optimize reactor performance while reducing solving times by up to 30%.

As part of this initiative, CN Logistics has co-funded a batch of SAF with Finnair to help reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with its cargo shipments.
“This marks a significant step for CN Logistics to expand our efforts in driving CNL Green Solution’s Carbon Neutrality and CoCreate Green with Finnair.
We look forward to further develop the adoption of SAF and engage with more stakeholders to reduce the burden of airfreight carbon emissions on our planet,” he said.
For CN Logistics, the partnership is part of its commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainable logistics under its CNL Green Solution framework.","Finnair and CN Logistics International Holdings, a Hong Kong-based logistics company under DP World, have announced a new partnership to support the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in air cargo. As part of this initiative, CN Logistics has co-funded a batch of SAF with Finnair to help reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with its cargo shipments.

“This is an important step in our ongoing efforts to increase the use of sustainable aviation fuel, and we are excited to begin this collaboration with CN Logistics,” said Gabriela Hiitola, Senior Vice President, Finnair Cargo. “We look forward to expanding our SAF partnerships in the future and invite all our customers to join us in reducing carbon emissions in air freight.”

Tim Ngan, Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of CN Logistics, echoed the importance of the collaboration. “This marks a significant step for CN Logistics to expand our efforts in driving CNL Green Solution’s Carbon Neutrality and CoCreate Green with Finnair. We look forward to further develop the adoption of SAF and engage with more stakeholders to reduce the burden of airfreight carbon emissions on our planet,” he said.

This collaboration aligns with Finnair’s broader sustainability strategy, which includes a science-based target to reduce its carbon emissions intensity—measured as CO2e per revenue tonne kilometre (RTK)—by 34.5% by 2033 from a 2023 baseline. The target has been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and supports the airline’s long-term ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Finnair’s approach to emissions reduction includes expanding the use of SAF, investing in fuel-efficient flight operations, and operating a fleet of Airbus A350 aircraft on most long-haul routes. These aircraft use lightweight materials, next-generation engines, and adaptive wing-shape technology, making them 25% more fuel efficient than older A330 models. The airline also aims to lower operative aircraft weight and explore new technologies to improve energy efficiency.

Sustainability is integrated into Finnair’s infrastructure as well. The COOL Nordic Cargo Hub at Helsinki Airport, opened in 2018, was designed with long-term energy efficiency in mind. The terminal, certified by BREEAM, operates with support from nearly 3,000 solar panels that supply about 37% of the facility’s energy needs. Automated warehousing, guided truck yard systems, and waste management strategies further optimise the terminal’s environmental performance.

In addition to fuel and infrastructure improvements, Finnair has also committed to circular economy principles across its operations. The airline is working toward a company-wide target of 100% material management, ensuring that all waste ending at its Helsinki hub is either reused as energy, heat, biogas, manure, or material—completely avoiding landfills. Finnair has introduced measures to phase out single-use plastics, promote the recycling of packaging and cardboard, and explore reuse and recycling strategies for cargo nets, straps, and wood materials.

For CN Logistics, the partnership is part of its commitment to carbon neutrality and sustainable logistics under its CNL Green Solution framework. The collaboration with Finnair illustrates how freight forwarders and airlines can jointly take responsibility for climate impact and co-develop low-emission solutions for global trade",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2024/01/29/62026-finnair-now-operates-28-flights-a-week-connecting-helsinki-and-paris-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 12:57:18.583557

Despite facing persistent supply chain challenges, inflation and tariffs, the company reported a 50% increase in operating profits and secured a free cash flow of £1.6bn (US$2.13bn).

This financial success is tied to Rolls-Royce's commitment to improving efficiency and adopting low-carbon technologies, both of which bolster long-term resilience and sustainable operations.

Low-carbon energy solutions

Rolls-Royce's Small Modular Reactor (SMR) was recently selected for the UK's Great British Energy – Nuclear (GBEN) programme, with the company set to supply three SMR units by the mid-2030s.

The project is expected to generate positive cash flow post-2025, reaching full profitability by 2030.

Such initiatives are directly linked to enhancing supply chain adaptability within the clean energy sector.

Furthermore, the company's partnership with ČEZ Group extends its nuclear expertise, emphasising supply chain capacity in Europe. International interest, particularly from Vattenfall in Sweden, aligns with the increasing global demand for resilient and sustainable energy supply chains that support decarbonisation and grid stability.

Rolls-Royce's SMR programme holds potential to significantly reduce fossil fuel dependency, aligning supply chain strategies with national net-zero targets.

""Our multi-year transformation continues to deliver,"" says Tufan Erginbilgic, CEO of Rolls Royce. ""Our actions led to strong first half year results, despite the challenges of the supply chain and tariffs. We are continuing to expand the earnings and cash potential of Rolls-Royce.

""We also delivered continued strong operational and strategic progress in the first half of 2025. A strong start to the year gives us confidence to raise our guidance for 2025. We see these targets as a milestone, not a destination, with substantial growth prospects beyond the mid-term.""

Growth in battery storage and green tech

Rolls-Royce's expansion into battery energy storage systems (BESS) represents another substantial move improving its supply chain infrastructure.

With significant orders from Lithuania's Ignitis Group, the division is poised to bolster revenue across the Power Systems sector and achieve breakeven shortly.

Demand for digital infrastructure and energy resilience is fuelling annual growth, with an anticipated 20% increase in the power generation segment, driven by backup power needs for data centres.

The progression from hardware to integrated sustainability within product development is increasingly crucial. As Rolls-Royce advances new-technology engines offering lower emissions and superior fuel efficiency expected by 2028, the focus remains on minimising the environmental footprint throughout the supply chain.

Military engine advancements further underscore the commitment to energy efficiency and reducing environmental impact.

Supply chain sustainability

Rolls-Royce has established multiple initiatives aimed at optimising supply chain sustainability and operational efficiency.

The organisation has already achieved a 50% reduction in energy usage across its operations and facilities.

Furthermore, using 2019 as a baseline, it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions from operations, facilities and product testing by 46%, with a 2030 target set to reduce these emissions even further.

These initiatives highlight substantial progress in achieving metrics vital to sustainable supply chain performance, such as reducing waste and enhancing recycling processes.

Rolls-Royce's strategy from 2015, based on its 2014 performance, has been pivotal in mitigating risks, minimising emissions and cutting costs company-wide.

Aviation advancements

In the civil aerospace sector, Rolls-Royce has improved the fuel efficiency and durability of its engine designs, a critical step towards decarbonising aviation supply chains.

In 2023, the company verified the compatibility of 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) across all its civil aero engine models, fulfilling a 2021 pledge to eliminate engine-technology barriers related to SAF use.

Key achievements including enhanced engine lifespan and optimised fuel consumption through models like the Trent XWB-84EP and Trent 1000 TEN reflect data-informed advancements driven by digital engineering.

The ethanol plant will use approximately 1.2 million tons of corn annually, about 6% of Paraná’s corn output.
Construction of the ethanol plant is expected to begin in 2026, using the company’s own funds, and could be completed by the end of 2027.
Including the ethanol plant, Potential Group’s total investments since 2012 will reach around R$6 billion.
In addition to ethanol, corn processing produces DDG (dried distillers grains), a high-protein byproduct used in livestock feed.","Sao Paulo: The Potential Group has announced plans to invest R$2 billion in building a new corn ethanol plant in Lapa, Paraná, as part of its larger goal to create one of the world’s largest biofuel complexes. The announcement was made by company vice president Carlos Eduardo Hammerschmidt in an interview with Reuters, reports LNG.

The ethanol plant will use approximately 1.2 million tons of corn annually, about 6% of Paraná’s corn output. The state, Brazil’s second-largest corn producer, is on track to harvest a record 20 million tons in the 2024/25 season.

Construction of the ethanol plant is expected to begin in 2026, using the company’s own funds, and could be completed by the end of 2027.

The new facility will join an already expanding biodiesel plant and a soybean crushing facility currently under construction, scheduled for completion in the first half of 2026. The soybean unit will supply raw material to the biodiesel operation, which is being upgraded to increase capacity from 900 million to 1.62 billion liters per year. The soybean plant will have a crushing capacity of 1.2 million tons annually.

Looking ahead, the company also plans to build a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant at the same site. However, Hammerschmidt said that due to limited global demand and the high cost—estimated between R$3 billion and R$4 billion—the SAF plant is not part of the immediate investment plans.

“The goal is to build the largest biofuels complex in the world,” said Hammerschmidt, whose family founded the company in the 1950s. Including the ethanol plant, Potential Group’s total investments since 2012 will reach around R$6 billion.

The company’s expansion aligns with Brazil’s increasing need for biofuels, especially after the government raised the required blend of anhydrous ethanol in gasoline to over 30% from August 1. Paraná currently imports ethanol from other states, highlighting the local demand.

Hammerschmidt emphasized the advantages of corn ethanol in boosting farmer income and supporting food and fuel integration. “Corn is a smart option. The second corn crop, once used mainly to cover soybean harvest costs, is now becoming a major income source,” he said.

In addition to ethanol, corn processing produces DDG (dried distillers grains), a high-protein byproduct used in livestock feed. “Biofuels have helped Brazil’s meat industry grow,” Hammerschmidt added, noting that soybean meal, also used for animal feed, is a key product of the group’s biodiesel operations.

As part of the broader project, Potential Group will also invest R$200 million in building two pipelines—one for ethanol and one for biodiesel—connecting Araucária to the Lapa industrial complex. These pipelines are expected to serve other cities as well.

“We will supply both biodiesel and ethanol directly to the fuel distribution bases,” Hammerschmidt said, adding that the site’s proximity to the Petrobras refinery in Paraná will be a further advantage.

The company’s long-term vision includes continuing to expand its presence in bioenergy, agriculture, and logistics as demand for renewable fuels grows globally.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/EthanolCorn-BT.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 12:57:35.189722

The plant will produce low-carbon oil for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a regenerative biofertilizer, marking the company’s first large-scale deployment of its bioconversion technology, reports EnergyTech.

The project was officially launched at a signing ceremony held at the Palácio Piratini, where Cemvita signed an agreement with Invest RS, the state’s investment agency. The facility will manufacture two main products: FermOil, a renewable oil made from crude glycerol used as SAF feedstock, and FermNPK, a biofertilizer aimed at promoting regenerative farming practices.

State officials welcomed the initiative, calling it a step forward for both the economy and the environment. “This partnership with Cemvita strengthens our commitment to sustainability, encourages high-impact investments, and creates opportunities in renewable energy, agriculture, and industry,” said acting governor Gabriel Souza at the event.

Cemvita CEO Moji Karimi pointed to the region’s infrastructure, access to essential raw materials, and supportive policies as key factors behind the decision. “Brazil, and particularly Rio Grande do Sul, fits well with Cemvita’s goals,” he said.

The plant will be the first in the world to use Cemvita’s technology on an industrial scale. This process converts crude glycerol — a waste product from biodiesel production — into sustainable oil and agricultural inputs.

Rio Grande do Sul was chosen for the facility due to its established biodiesel industry, reliable transport network, and government backing for clean energy projects. Invest RS President Rafael Prikladnicki said the agency would support the project by helping with technical needs, supply chain development, and regulatory processes.

Cemvita had earlier partnered with local biofuel company Be8 to help strengthen the SAF supply chain in the region.

Leandro Evaldt, Deputy Secretary of Economic Development, said the project blends economic growth with sustainability. “It reflects our commitment to inclusive growth and highlights our supportive environment for businesses,” he said.

Sustainable aviation fuel was the central opportunity of discussion that had farmers hopeful for a new market and businesses like Delta Airlines hopeful for local access.
Charlotte Lollar, director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, agreed.
“Officials on the Japanese airline … that’s the first thing he said: ‘We want sustainable aviation fuel,'” Wertish said.
That's because determining the carbon index score of any crop does not have a standardized measuring tool, according to Julia Silvis, managing director of the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub.","MORGAN, Minn. — Farmers gathered inside the Farmfest grounds in Morgan on Tuesday, Aug. 5, said they needed something to improve the current negative margins they are seeing in major commodities. They also needed something that would get the next generation excited about farming.

Minnesota Farmers Union president Gary Wertish said farmers must look to emerging opportunities. Wertish was on a panel speaking to the topic of building sustainability in Midwest agriculture on Tuesday afternoon of Minnesota Farmfest’s three-day event in Morgan, Minnesota. Sustainable aviation fuel was the central opportunity of discussion that had farmers hopeful for a new market and businesses like Delta Airlines hopeful for local access.

Jerry Groskruetz, farm director of KDHL Radio, a Faribault, Minnesota, radio station, said one thing putting sustainable aviation fuel in a strong position is that it’s where ethanol was 30 years ago in the state, yet even before farmers are pushing for the industry to grow, a market already exists.

“We’re ahead of where we were 30 years ago,” Groskruetz said.

Charlotte Lollar, director of Sustainable Aviation Fuel at Delta Air Lines, agreed. She said not only does a market exist, but existing infrastructure can also be used to create the jet fuel that companies like Delta , and those around the world are looking for. Every commercial airline has a target of reaching some level of sustainability, she said.

“And that market is huge. Every year, we consume about 100 billion gallons collectively, globally, of conventional jet fuel,” Lollar said.

While Minnesota wants to lead in the area of SAF, the world also wants SAF. Wertish said this became clear on a trade tour to Japan.

“Officials on the Japanese airline … that’s the first thing he said: ‘We want sustainable aviation fuel,'” Wertish said.

Several factors are involved in getting Minnesota and the world, SAF, though.

Panel members shared that the SAF tax credit in Minnesota is helpful in pushing this industry forward. It offers tax credit to producers of sustainable fuels and those that blend it, both are areas that require expensive infrastructure. But there was discouragement that the 45Z credit at the federal level has not made it across the finish line. That credit is another tax incentive for those who produce sustainable fuels. Like getting anything else done, it requires looking beyond party lines, Wertish said.

The good news is that experts know how to make SAF, it is currently being used, and they know you can make it from a variety of crops, wood, oils and fats. On the infrastructure front, Minnesota is planning to complete construction of a SAF blending facility that would be the third in the country.

But there remains work to be done on the most sustainable way to make SAF.

It makes sense that corn would be in the crosshairs as it is already grown on about 8 million acres, or about a third of farm acres in the state, according to Minnesota Department of Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. But ask what the best crop is and you may get different answers. That's because determining the carbon index score of any crop does not have a standardized measuring tool, according to Julia Silvis, managing director of the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub. She said this is a key area that farmers need to share their input on because of competing methods of tracking carbon.

“Try to say to the people who are building these systems, we need it to be more standardized. We need to have it not be as burdensome to use or to understand, frankly,” she said. The public and banks need to be able to understand the method.

The SAF Hub has seen major movement since it started two years ago, including the first flight with SAF out of Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport last year. They announced that a blending facility is being built at the Pine Bend Refinery near Rosemount, Minnesota, and they worked to create a consortium of buyers of SAF.

This year they are focused on an opportunity to announce production of SAF in the state. The blending facility is expected to be operational this winter. She noted that there are headwinds they must face at the federal level, but that through coming together and building innovations, they will find a way forward.

“You know it’s good for energy and resilience,” Silvis said. “It’s good for rural communities. It’s good for the environment, it burns cleanly. And it fits in with sort of the domestic energy agenda that we are seeing develop from the Department of Energy.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/4c4e153/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3715x2814+0+0/resize/1407x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa0%2Fab%2Fc275372d484b9fb463174c05d13f%2Ffarmffestgather.JPG,N,,2025-08-06 07:56:15.997852

A joint Canadian-ASEAN research project conducted by the ASEAN Secretariat, GHD, Boeing, and Canadian Trade and Investment Facility for Development found that Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam could become net exporters by 2040, while Japan and South Korea emerge as major regional importers.

Rice straw has been identified as the feedstock group with the lowest carbon intensity score across multiple Southeast Asian countries, offering the most environmentally sustainable pathway for SAF production that can reduce aviation emissions by up to 80% over the fuel's lifecycle.

Deputy Secretary-General for the ASEAN Economic Community Satvinder Singh emphasized that this initiative marks a significant step in advancing ASEAN's commitment to sustainable aviation while driving economic growth and enhancing energy security.

The expansion of SAF feedstock supply is expected to stem from enhanced farming practices, mechanization, improved irrigation, and crop optimization rather than land expansion, ensuring sustainable growth without increasing deforestation while creating opportunities for job creation and workforce diversification across the region. ✈️

Meanwhile, internally, Yusen Logistics rolled-out a communications program, providing stakeholders at all levels with information on the new offering and its dynamics.","Yusen Logistics, a leading logistics group from Japan, partnered with AllChiefs to design and develop a new carbon insetting offering. Branded ‘Alternative Fuel’, the new offering brings together the best of both worlds for its clients – enhanced customer value and an improved footprint.

Companies around the world rely on Yusen Logistics for their logistics and supply chain demands. The Tokyo-headquartered company has offices in 437 cities in 46 countries, and operates 748 distribution centres and offices, supporting transport solutions by sea, air, and land.

Investing in a more sustainable footprint is a strategic objective for Yusen Logistics. Their mission is to become “a leader in sustainable logistics by 2030” and the “go-to sustainable logistics service provider” from Asia. To achieve this vision, the organisation is already taking concrete steps – setting internal emissions targets and adopting greener solutions, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

New carbon insetting solutions

In logistics, carbon insetting involves reducing emissions directly within a company’s own supply chain or industry – for example, by switching to biofuels or investing in electric trucks.

Part of Yusen Logistics’ broader and overarching sustainability agenda, the newly launched Alternative Fuel proposition was developed through a comprehensive strategic and new product development process. This process involved the input and collaboration between leaders from within the business, key experts, and general stakeholders.

Key design criteria of the offering include sustainability at its core and agility to meet an ever-changing business landscape. Another key goal is ensuring the offering is highly actionable – meaning that people understand how the solution works and how it contributes to sustainability goals.

Co-design sessions

To move from ambition to action, Yusen Logistics started with a joint ambition-setting session featuring senior management and the Corporate Sustainability team.

“Jointly, we mapped out what success would look like, not only in terms of carbon emissions, but also from the perspective of customer engagement, internal capabilities and commercial growth,” said Mitch Kobayashi, Head of the Corporate Sustainability Unit at Yusen Logistics. “We also clarified the key goals of the new Alternative Fuel offering and outlined what is needed for it to underpin our 2030 Strategy.”

In a next step, AllChiefs facilitated six design sessions across different departments to construct the offering and ensure alignment with the existing green solutions of Yusen Logistics.

“During the sessions, dynamic working groups collectively shaped the Alternative Fuel offering as a part of the wider green logistics ambition. The sessions were characterised by active collaboration, open and engaged discussions, and co-creation that led to new and innovative approaches,” said Bonne Goedhart, Co-Owner of AllChiefs.

Customer Insights

Well aware of the importance of the customers during this journey, the project team gathered insights from account managers and key accountant managers. This helped them understand customer feedback, previously requested solutions, needs, expectations, and other critical topics.

‘’These conversations revealed what our logistics clients need when it comes to sustainability, and how a service provider such as Yusen Logistics could stand out in a crowded landscape,” reflected Cedric ‘t Hart, Sustainability Lead at Yusen Logistics.

Data collected from customers included views on factors such as cost, service, compliance, and supply chain resilience, as well as data on emissions and SBTi targets. Bringing this input together, the project team ensured that customer demands drove the key design principles, and that prioritisation was aligned to what customers really need. It also fed into the strategy for go-to-market.

Rolling out the solution

In May, Yusen Logistics unveiled its new offering to clients. To support the uptake of the offering on the customer side, Yusen Logistics and AllChiefs developed a comprehensive ‘Green Solutions Guide’ to facilitate knowledge sharing among the organisation, and customer engagement materials.

Meanwhile, internally, Yusen Logistics rolled-out a communications program, providing stakeholders at all levels with information on the new offering and its dynamics.

The forum, titled ""Developing a Reliable Ag Policy Safety Net,"" was moderated by Mark Dorenkamp of Brownfield Ag News and was preceded by comments by Stephen Vaden, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. On the panel were Reps. Angie Craig, Brad Finstad, Michelle Fischbach and Pete Stauber.

The four representatives largely discussed the budget reconciliation — or ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" — act passed by Congress earlier this summer. The bill contained many components typically included in a farm bill.

Craig, the lone Democrat on the panel, is the ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee. Kicking off comments from the panel, she first listed things she liked in the bill, like crop insurance improvements, updated reference prices, and tax provisions like the 199(a) stepped-up basis . But she didn't hold back on what she saw as problems with the process used.

""The big problem that I have with the reconciliation package is, it should have been done in the farm bill,"" she said.

She noted the nutrition title of a traditional farm bill had been ""gutted"" by the package and that other priorities, like the farm loan program that will expire in September, access to the Rural Energy for America Program, specialty crop programs and more, couldn't be dealt with in the reconciliation bill and will have to be legislated separately, in what she and others on the panel dubbed a ""skinny farm bill.""

""All of that could have would have been done in a traditional farm bill,"" Craig said.

Her harshest comments were for how the bill cut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and Medicaid , saying the moves will hurt rural communities.

Finstad, Fischbach and Stauber generally agreed with the things Craig liked about the bill but also defended the things she disliked, most notably the SNAP cuts. They noted explosive growth in the funding put into SNAP in recent years, along with an error rate that adds up to billions of dollars that haven't gone to feeding people.

Finstad, a farmer, said the budget reconciliation rebalanced farm programs with the nutrition programs that have dominated past farm bills.

""We finally put the farmer back in the farm bill,"" Finstad.

Fischbach focused much of her time on the tax components of the bill, including the 199(a) provision for estate taxes and the expansion of the 168(k) provision on depreciation to include ag properties. She acknowledged that the bill wasn't perfect and that more needs to be done on the 45(z) provision on renewable fuels and on sustainable aviation fuel.

""The good in this bill is overwhelming,"" she said.

While the panel focused largely on the budget reconciliation bill, the representatives also discussed trade and tariffs, the Make America Healthy Again Commission, gray wolves, conservation, California's Proposition 12 law on animal welfare and its impacts on agriculture nationwide, and other points related to ag policy. On trade and tariffs, there was a general consensus that more attention is needed on trade and that recently announced trade deals were signs of optimism for agriculture. However, Craig noted the general ""chaos"" of the past six months and the impact of that on consumers and the markets.

The topic of the MAHA Commission and the work of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy brought perhaps the most agreement from the panel, with Craig and Finstad deriding Kennedy's methods as unscientific and harmful to agriculture.

""I don't want to listen to Robert Kennedy on anything,"" Craig said.

""We're in bizarre times when a Kennedy is disliked by Republicans and Democrats,"" Finstad said.

On the MAHA subject and others, Finstad repeatedly said agriculture needs to go ""on the offense"" to explain the industry's needs, priorities and successes.

""It's our opportunity to rise to the occasion,"" he said.

Before the panel began, Vaden discussed what's going on at USDA. He said the agency has paid out $1.46 billion to more than 255,000 farmers since July 10 as part of the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program, for weather disasters in 2023 and 2024. The agency also has paid out $8 billion to more than 571,000 farmers for the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program for economic assistance due to low commodity prices. Vaden said the simplified application process has helped expedite relief. He said his own brother reported getting money direct deposited into his account within three business days of signing his application at his local Farm Service Agency office.

Vaden lauded recent trade deals with the European Union, Indonesia, Japan, Phillipines and the United Kingdom and said agricultural trade is at the forefront of the discussions on trade. He also cheered the work of the Department of Justice on fighting back against California's Prop 12 and explained that the economics of living in Washington, D.C., was at the heart of a recent move to establish USDA hubs in Raleigh, North Carolina, Indianapolis, Fort Collins, Colorado, Salt Lake City and Kansas City, Missouri, rather than keep as many employees in Washington.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/2fdd2be/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1098x624+0+0/resize/1876x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fa8%2F07%2F3ce376a3451fb9b4d50a2820fda0%2Fsafety-net-forum-at-farmfest.png,N,,2025-08-06 05:56:16.639185

“First and foremost, we need to put the farm back in the Farm Bill to keep us whole.","GILFILLAN ESTATE — Federal politicians discussed agricultural policy with passion at times in front of a large Farmfest Forum crowd Tuesday.

Newly appointed U.S. Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Stephen Vaden talked glowingly about the Big Beautiful Bill Act signed into law July 4 containing tax and spending policies defining the core of President Donald Trump’s second-term agenda.

“It has big wins for American agriculture. It modernizes reference prices (benchmark prices set by government agencies or organizations to guide ag producers and stakeholders to help stabilize prices in volatile markets),” he said. “As you know, the cost of modern agriculture has skyrocketed the past few years. USDA reference prices have not kept up with it. This makes the farm safety net something that you can feel underneath you that will protect your operation for years to come. It keeps farmers in the field that might have been forced out.”

He said the other important thing the bill provides is tax certainty for U.S. agriculture.

“For too long, we just regarded our tax policy as a gimmick. We’d pass a tax cut that was favorable for agriculture that would last a few years and go away,” said Vaden. “That’s no way to run a business. You have to look further down the road than that. It also does away with the death tax for more than 99% of the people in this country. For far too long, farmers had to hire accountants, tax professionals and lawyers for the simple desire of passing their farmland on to the next generation. To me, it’s immoral to tax the transfer to farmland that has been in families for generations.”

He said some people think nobody pays death taxes.

“It was one of the first things I had to do after I buried my father so we could keep his farm,” said Vaden.

“Obviously, the farm economy is not where it should be due in no small part to natural disasters the past few years,” he said. “(Agriculture) Secretary (Brooke) Rollins and I hit the ground running with supplemental disaster relief programs and emergency assistance programs to put money in the hands of farmers for harms they suffered due to the weather in 2023 and 2024 so they can keep their operations going.”

He said producers with losses covered by crop insurance has been paid $1.46 billion to 255,000 farmers across the country since July 10. For the emergency economic assistance program, nearly $8 billion has been paid to more than 571,000 farmers in 49 states.

Vaden said his family members went to the county Farm Service Agency office, filled out a one-page form and sign it. He said funds were direct deposited in his account three days later.

“We need open markets to sell what we grow. For far too long, America’s farmers have suffered from other countries putting unfair trade barriers to keep them from selling their products,” he said. “What you see on Truth Social and Twitter is what is going on behind the scenes. For the first time ever, Japan is buying rice from the United States. The United Kingdom will buy more ethanol and livestock from us. The Trump Administration is dedicated to bringing trade barriers down.”

Eighth District Congressman Pete Stauber said he was very excited to vote the for Big Beautiful Bill.

“No bill is perfect. The welfare to work requirement gives us an opportunity to work together. Small, family farms built this country,” he said. “We’ve secured our borders. Bringing steel production back to this country is about national security. When we move together, we lead the world. It starts with family farms and small communities.”

U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Amy Klobuchar voiced concerns about tariffs drying up agriculture markets, losing 15,000 USDA employees and SNAP cuts causing an $85 million cost shift to Minnesota counties.

“None of the 10 states with the highest SNAP fraud rates was in the Midwest,” she said.

“We need funding for things like precision agriculture and sustainable aviation fuel that has great potential for Minnesota,” said Klobuchar. “Canada is our biggest trading partner. The Canadians are mad about tariffs and its affecting Minnesota. Let’s keep our spirits up, keep farming and ranching and get a Farm Bill.”

Second District Congresswoman Angie Craig said federal cuts gutted the Farm Bill and Medicaid cuts will hurt rural America.

“First and foremost, we need to put the farm back in the Farm Bill to keep us whole. The agricultural trade deficit we have is hard to believe. It’s bizarre to me we can’t solve this. We need to improve crop insurance. We need to get rid of SNAP waste, fraud and abuse,” said First District Congressman Brad Finstad of New Ulm.

Seventh District Congresswoman Michelle Fischbach said if states decide to shift costs (from federal cuts) to counties, that’s their decision.

In the relentless global pursuit of decarbonised air travel, sustainable aviation fuel has earned its position as a critical pathway toward net zero. Yet for all its promise, SAF uptake remains encumbered by slow procurement cycles, inconsistent information, and limited visibility across the value chain.

Enter the newly launched SAF Matchmaker platform by the International Air Transport Association, a digital infrastructure quietly poised to unlock the next phase of SAF deployment. This platform does not just connect airlines and SAF suppliers. It restructures the very dynamics of how sustainable aviation fuel is discovered, accessed, and adopted across the global aviation sector.

A Neutral Space for Commercial Discovery

Traditionally, SAF procurement has depended heavily on personal relationships, local agreements, and isolated offtake negotiations. While these methods served the early years of SAF development, they are increasingly outpaced by global climate targets and growing demand from airlines under pressure to show measurable progress on carbon reduction.

The SAF Matchmaker provides a digital alternative. By hosting a centralised space where airlines can post their SAF needs and suppliers can share available or upcoming volumes, the platform offers transactional clarity without taking over the transaction. Deals are not executed within the platform. Instead, it helps both sides identify matches before taking negotiations offline. This ensures commercial flexibility while enabling much-needed visibility across the ecosystem.

Making SAF Procurement More Efficient by Design

Efficiency in this context is about more than speed. It is about eliminating friction. With no third-party fees or platform commissions, SAF Matchmaker strips away the typical costs and complications that come with intermediary-led procurement.

This model serves not only large international carriers but also regional airlines and new market entrants that may lack the internal infrastructure to scout SAF partners across multiple jurisdictions. The platform shortens that path from interest to action—without overwhelming the user with complexity.

By simplifying the interface while maintaining critical detail, it enables even small sustainability teams within airlines to move forward with strategic SAF engagements that once required extensive resources.

Elevating Visibility and Credibility with Data

Perhaps the most underappreciated strength of the Matchmaker is its role in demystifying SAF attributes. Users can view essential data on feedstock type, production location, volume, delivery timing, and the technology used to produce the fuel. Equally important, the system discloses whether the SAF complies with key frameworks such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation or the European Union Renewable Energy Directive.

This level of upfront detail is more than helpful; it is mission-critical. As climate reporting requirements become more stringent, airlines must show not only that they are purchasing SAF, but that the SAF meets appropriate thresholds for lifecycle emissions, traceability, and compliance.

Providing this transparency from the outset empowers buyers to make informed, strategic choices that align with their long-term decarbonisation and reputational goals.

Supporting Flexible Contracting: Spot Buys and Offtakes

The SAF Matchmaker accommodates a range of procurement behaviors. Whether an airline seeks a one-off purchase to bridge a compliance gap or a multi-year offtake agreement to guarantee supply stability, the platform provides the space to initiate both.

This flexibility mirrors the reality of the market. While some airlines are ready to lock in long-term volumes, others may still be testing operational integration or exploring feedstock performance across different aircraft models.

What this tool enables is a tailored procurement journey, scalable with each organisation’s SAF maturity level.

Building the Conditions for a Liquid SAF Market

As the SAF industry matures, the need for a liquid market becomes clear. A liquid market is one in which supply and demand signals flow freely, discovery is fast, and trust is built into the architecture.

Until now, SAF procurement has remained relatively illiquid, limited to a handful of major producers and early-adopter carriers, with little price transparency or volume flexibility. The Matchmaker introduces foundational conditions for liquidity by reducing search costs, increasing supplier visibility, and enabling alignment on shared data standards.

This early liquidity will be critical in attracting the next wave of capital investments in SAF production, especially those based on emerging feedstocks or next-generation conversion technologies.

Unlocking Future Synergies Beyond Aviation

While the initial rollout is limited to airlines and SAF suppliers, there are signals that other buyers—particularly from the corporate sector- will soon be able to participate. This expansion would be transformational.

Multinational corporations increasingly view Scope 3 aviation emissions as a reputational and climate risk. Access to verifiable SAF volumes through a neutral digital platform offers them a pathway to offset these emissions credibly, without intermediaries or opaque credit schemes.

In the long term, such participation could encourage cross-sector partnerships, diversified financing models, and broader pressure to scale infrastructure in regions that are SAF constrained.

Embedded Within a Broader Digital Energy Ecosystem

The Matchmaker is not a standalone tool. It lives within the Aviation Energy Hub, a wider digital environment designed to support aviation energy management. This context matters. It signals a move toward integrated platforms where sustainability, energy procurement, and operational strategy can converge.

This architectural choice reflects a shift in how the aviation sector views digital tools, not as optional add-ons, but as core infrastructure. As airlines face escalating ESG requirements and investor scrutiny, centralised digital spaces like the Aviation Energy Hub will become crucial in supporting evidence-based decision making.

Procurement as an Instrument of Climate Performance

This platform repositions procurement as a climate lever, not just a cost function. For too long, sustainability and procurement teams have worked in parallel, often disconnected by organisational silos or competing priorities.

Tools like the SAF Matchmaker collapse that divide. They offer sustainability leaders the chance to initiate commercially sound, environmentally ambitious fuel transitions, without having to build entire procurement ecosystems from scratch.

In doing so, they enable operational leaders to meet both financial and emissions targets simultaneously.

Conclusion: A Quiet but Strategic Leap Toward SAF Mainstreaming

While not designed for headline drama, the SAF Matchmaker may quietly prove to be one of the most strategic infrastructure moves the industry has made. It addresses not just the “what” of SAF, but the “how” of scaling it.

Through its focus on transparency, simplicity, and neutrality, it lays the groundwork for what every stakeholder wants: a future where SAF is not an exception, but a norm.

And as the global transition to sustainable aviation deepens, tools like these remind us that transformation does not always begin with invention. Sometimes, it begins with connection.

The aviation sector is standing at the crossroads of innovation and sustainability. With rising global air travel and intensifying climate concerns, the call for clean, scalable, and impactful energy solutions has never been louder. In response, a transformative initiative has taken root in Ghana that may just redefine what is possible for both waste management and sustainable aviation fuel.

F&B Bio Recyclage Ltd, an emerging project developer based in Ghana, has announced the development of a municipal solid waste-to-sustainable aviation fuel project. This announcement carries significant weight not only because of its technical ambition but also due to its geographical relevance. Sub-Saharan Africa is uniquely positioned to champion decentralized sustainable solutions that blend infrastructure development with climate action.

Beyond Traditional Recycling: Turning Waste Into Flight

The new project is no ordinary recycling scheme. It proposes a circular ecosystem where non-recyclable municipal solid waste is converted into sustainable aviation fuel. Using a combination of gasification and Fischer Tropsch technology, the project will produce SAF that can directly substitute conventional jet fuel, offering a cleaner combustion profile and lower lifecycle emissions.

The vision here goes beyond waste reduction. This initiative is a direct answer to two pressing global challenges—unsustainable fuel dependency and unprocessed municipal waste. By treating one problem as a solution to another, this project demonstrates the strategic depth that climate mitigation now demands.

Strategic Phasing: A Measured Path to Impact

The implementation of this initiative is being undertaken in a phased and strategic manner. The project begins with a standardized pre-FEED (Front-End Engineering Design) study. This crucial step will evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of the proposed technology stack, followed by a full FEED phase to secure investment confidence and prepare for construction.

This methodical planning reflects a maturing trend within emerging-market cleantech projects, where robust groundwork increasingly precedes capital deployment. Such diligence is a positive signal to international investors and technology providers seeking credible projects with long-term returns.

Triple Bottom Line: Environmental, Economic, and Social Gains

This is not merely a climate initiative. It is a blueprint for multi-dimensional sustainability.

Environmental Gain

By diverting waste from landfills and converting it into fuel, the project reduces both methane emissions from waste decomposition and carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion. In doing so, it fosters a dual carbon benefit rarely seen in single interventions.

Economic Opportunity

By investing in advanced waste processing and clean fuel production, the project unlocks a new industrial ecosystem. This includes job creation in engineering, operations, logistics, and local manufacturing. Such opportunities have a knock-on effect across sectors and stimulate inclusive economic growth.

Social Responsibility

In regions where waste management is often informal and fragmented, structured facilities can offer dignified employment and improved public health outcomes. The project also sets a precedent for technology transfer and workforce upskilling in high-value sectors.

Regional Innovation with Global Implications

Ghana may be the physical location of this initiative, but the implications extend far beyond national borders. If successful, this model can be replicated across other countries grappling with similar infrastructure and climate challenges. The West African region, in particular, stands to benefit from localized SAF production, which could reduce reliance on imports and make regional air travel more sustainable.

What makes this project globally relevant is its marriage of high-efficiency fuel production with low-value waste inputs a combination rarely utilized at this scale in emerging markets. Its progress will be closely watched by stakeholders in sustainable transport, municipal governance, and aviation alike.

Embedded Partnerships: A Model for Cross-Sector Collaboration

Central to the project’s success is its multi-stakeholder approach. Partnerships with waste management agencies, aviation partners, and technology providers create an ecosystem of shared value. These relationships will be vital in scaling production, integrating with airport fuel systems, and ensuring regulatory alignment with international aviation standards.

In today’s complex sustainability landscape, no single actor can deliver systemic change alone. This initiative exemplifies the collaborative model that future transport decarbonization efforts must increasingly embrace.

A Moment for Reflection in the Transport Sustainability Movement

This project represents the type of positive disruption that the global transport sector needs to adopt more widely. Its structure is particularly noteworthy for transport sustainability professionals because it offers a glimpse into how innovation can emerge from local contexts without the need for global multinationals to take the lead.

It also prompts an essential question for all working in this space: Are we doing enough to look beyond incremental upgrades to seek solutions that address multiple challenges in one stroke?

Conclusion: A Future Where Planes Fly on Purposeful Fuel

This announcement from Ghana is more than a press release. It is a signal. A signal that meaningful aviation decarbonization is not confined to the laboratories and boardrooms of industrialized economies. Real breakthroughs can, and must, come from regions that have the most to gain from sustainable development.

As the project moves from study to construction, it will be important for the wider sustainability community to remain engaged not only to draw lessons but to build a coalition of support that ensures the scalability of such bold interventions.

The world needs more stories like this. Stories that shift the narrative from problem to possibility. Stories that remind us that sustainability is not just a challenge, it is an invitation to build something profoundly better.

He explains that Airbus is pursuing every possible avenue to see what works, from large hydrogen- fuelled aircraft to small battery-powered demonstrators.","Imagine boarding your zero-carbon emissions commercial flight of the future. Is it a curvaceous wide-body jet powered by hydrogen fuel cells? A helicopter-like craft with several rotors fuelled by advanced batteries and piloted by a computer? An airship filled with gas, like it’s 1922 once again? It could be any or all of these. Or none. The truth is that very few people have truly grasped what emission- free flying might look like, let alone how to make it commercially viable enough for it to be an alternative to what we have now. What almost everyone agrees on, however, is that it’s vital to figure it out – and soon.

While there are all manner of promising developments and innovations in the sector, with hundreds of companies large and small working on answering this question, one sticky issue remains: the energy density of jet fuel – the amount of energy held in a given volume – is many times greater than just about everything else we can currently come up with. That is, at least among fuels we can hope to produce and deliver to aircraft, store and use safely. So far there have been lots of lofty promises but not much to show for them.

“It’s not around the corner,” says Henrik Littorin, programme manager at electric aviation development project Elis in the north of Sweden, when we ask about when zero-emissions commercial aircraft will be up and flying. “It’s obvious that the industry is struggling. Existing aviation systems and regulations were developed over many, many years and now you have to do that all over again. And you have to make sure that everything is super safe. That’s on top of the challenges of battery technology and sourcing clean energy. When you start developing something new, such as an electric aircraft, when you start to build and develop it, that’s when you really discover the challenges.”

Littorin says that there is still optimism in the industry but it comes with a sense that expectations will need to be managed. This means a revolution for the entire sector, from the aircraft themselves and the infrastructure to the politics and regulatory frameworks. Everything needs to change. That is disruptive, of course, but there are opportunities too. And for any of this to be viable in the kind of time frames being talked about, every stakeholder needs to be working in concert, pursuing the same goals with the kind of efficiency and co-ordination that is rare on the scale that is needed here.

Yet outfits such as Elis are not waiting for all of that to come together. It has partnered with manufacturer ZeroAvia, the airline Braathens, flight school Green Flight Academy and power company Skellefteå Kraft to launch a demonstrator project to not only fly an aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells but also showcase that this can be done within an entirely “green” ecosystem. This means producing so-called green hydrogen, transporting it to the airport and storing it, fuelling an aircraft and flying it to another airport and back. The idea is to show that it’s all possible, even if at a small scale for now.

If you want to look at just about every possible technology we might end up with, it makes sense to look at manufacturers such as Airbus, which has gone all in on figuring out the sustainable aircraft of the future. The company knows that this is an existential question, and with its size and resources it can afford to pursue a number of avenues at once, even if some end up as dead ends.

Until recently, the aviation industry has been on a steady path of incremental improvements in efficiency. Manufacturers point to the fact that since 1990, co2 emissions have been reduced by 50 per cent per passenger. This has been achieved by reducing aircraft weight, improving aerodynamics and boosting engine efficiency. However, because the number of flights has continued to grow, total emission figures remain high. “Today, these three parameters are not sufficient,” says Karim Mokaddem, vice-president Airbus Group Hybrid & Electric Strategy. “If we continue like this, we’re pretty sure we won’t reach the 2050 [net-zero] target.We need another parameter in the game – and that’s the fuel.”

Mokaddem explains that there are two ways to do this: either use electrons as the fuel, stored in batteries or hydrogen fuel cells, or use a different form of fuel, which right now means sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from non-petroleum feedstocks.

Batteries are comparatively simple, delivering electricity to engines. But they are heavy and their energy density is low. Hydrogen has a high energy density and zero emissions when used as a fuel but it comes with several complications. It can be very energy-intensive to produce and that production process can create emissions. Hydrogen could either be used directly as a fuel to run aircraft engines or in hydrogen fuel cells, which then produce electricity to run the motor.

“For the moment, we don’t know what will be a viable technology in terms of maturity and the ecosystem,” says Mokaddem. “There’s no silver bullet. Speaking as an engineer, what we have today are only problems. Nothing is really working. We have difficulty finding the right electric motor. There’s no battery that can fulfil what we need.” Increasingly, it looks like different technologies might suit different segments of aircraft, so it makes sense to work on multiple avenues to achieve emissions- free flight. For instance, the current battery technology can be used viably on aircraft that have up to nine seats. That’s not a lot of capacity so it ends up being mostly the domain of “urban air mobility” or evtol aircraft (electric vertical take-off and landing).

As a result, manufacturers are turning to hybrid aircraft models for the regional aircraft segment, which can carry 20-plus people. One example is Heart Aerospace, which is developing a 30-seater aircraft capable of flying 400km. Jet fuel-powered turbo generators charge the batteries that power the engines. It has purchase commitments from major airlines such as Air Canada and United, but for the moment, these commitments are mostly a matter of PR. Its first flight isn’t scheduled until 2026 and that date could well slip.

Some remain optimistic about putting an all-electric aircraft into service using existing technology. Cosmic Aerospace is working on the Skylark, a 24-seater electric plane that can fly 1,000km emissions-free thanks to an ultra- efficient wing, a lightweight structure and other refinements. The company hasn’t waited for a breakthrough in battery technology and says that it can have the plane in service for 2029. “Nothing has changed for us,” says its founder, Christopher Chahine, when asked whether the firm has faced setbacks. He believes that battery-powered aircraft have an advantage because of the inefficiencies and potential emissions of power sources.

“Full-system energy efficiency, from generation to usage, is crucial to ensure that the overall energy needs stay within reasonable limits,” he says. “Hydrogen and SAF generation requires many energy conversion steps, each introducing losses and additional costs. This all adds up to an inefficient use of energy overall. Battery-powered electric systems have a much higher energy efficiency, so there is less valuable energy lost between generation and usage. Energy needs directly translate to operating costs and ticket prices. If flying is to remain affordable and accessible for most people, efficient energy usage will be paramount for as long as clean energy isn’t abundantly available.”

The availability of clean energy is a critical point and is often left out of the discussion. Even once these aircraft are designed and proven to be airworthy and economical, one burning question is where all that clean energy to power them will be sourced. Elan Head, who covers the sector for industry news website The Air Current, points to a recent research paper, which estimated that 9 per cent of the world’s renewable electricity and 30 per cent of “sustainably available biomass” would be required for aviation to meet its net zero targets in 2050.

“Some have proposed that airports should be rethought to become energy farms,” says Head. “If you have an industry that requires massive amounts of renewable energy, then maybe the industry should be responsible for providing some of that energy.”

That leads to another intriguing question: what will the airport of the future look like? Large airports might find that they need to provide multiple fuel sources at the same time, including hydrogen in gas and liquid form, sustainable aviation fuels and megawatt chargers for battery-powered aircraft. How will all these fuels be efficiently delivered to the aircraft that need them? Where will they be generated and stored? The answers are unclear, but these questions will no doubt reshape how we think of building and running airports in the decades to come.

Then there are the wilder ideas for aircraft development. Magpie Aviation is working on a system for enabling longer-range, emissions- free flights without having to invent a more efficient fuel source. According to its vision, a hybrid electric aircraft takes off under its own power and then hooks up to a second or more aircraft with their batteries fully loaded, which tow the passenger aircraft towards its destination. This means that its range can be extended to well beyond 1,500km. The company says that it sees this as the only way to replace commercial flights without advances in technology that we have yet to make.

The general attitude in the industry seems to be that, for now, any and all ideas are welcome. “Working together is the way to get past this,” says Mokaddem. He explains that Airbus is pursuing every possible avenue to see what works, from large hydrogen- fuelled aircraft to small battery-powered demonstrators. And it’s doing this by working not only across the whole Airbus group but also with key players across all transportation industries, from French aerospace giant Safran to automobile company Renault. “For the first time we are not alone,” he says. “Today there are synergies across different transport industries. It took a century for the auto industry to enter into electric mobility. We are willing to do it in less than 20 years.” In the end, Henrik Littorin puts it best. For now, he says, “it’s just really important to get things up in the air”.",https://monocle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/plane-illustration-e1754394254579.jpg,N,,2025-08-06 04:56:22.863292

This initial phase focused on pilot testing a digital trading platform for Scope 3 emission reductions associated with SAF use.

The pilot project began in August 2024 and ran for eight months at Narita Airport. It brought together a broad coalition of stakeholders, including fuel suppliers, airlines, banks, and airport operators. The objective was to establish a platform for trading CO2 reduction credits generated through SAF consumption, a potentially transformative approach to managing aviation’s environmental impact.

During the pilot, participants registered offers, matched trades, executed contracts, and transferred verified credits. All transactions were subject to third-party audits, which confirmed the platform’s transparency, accuracy, and operational integrity, as well as the absence of double counting.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Current Targets

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a type of aviation fuel derived from non-fossil, renewable, or waste-based feedstocks (such as used cooking oil or agricultural residues). Chemically similar to conventional jet fuel, SAF can be blended up to approved limits without requiring engine modifications. Functionally, SAF performs equivalently to traditional Jet-A fuel.

The use of SAF can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. However, SAF remains two to four times more costly, posing a significant barrier to large-scale adoption. In 2023, the aviation sector was responsible for emitting 950 million tonnes of CO2, representing approximately 2.5% of global emissions. With electrification facing technological and scalability constraints, particularly for long-haul flights, scaling SAF production and use has become a critical strategy for achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

Currently, SAF use is primarily driven by voluntary initiatives, often aligned with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) objectives, rather than regulatory mandates. However, mandatory SAF blending requirements are beginning to emerge globally. While overall volumes remain low, several jurisdictions have introduced initial targets to enable long-term scaling.

Notable policy milestones include:

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which mandates a 2% SAF blend in aviation fuel starting in 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030.

The United Kingdom’s SAF mandate begins at 2% in 2025 and rises to 10% by 2030.

Japan has committed to a 10% SAF target by 2030, leading adoption in Asia, while Singapore and India have also announced targets of up to 5% by 2030.

SAF Trading Platform

The trading platform was launched to facilitate the exchange of Scope 3 emission reductions generated from SAF usage. Phase 1 ran from August 24, 2024, to March 25, 2025, and was hosted and operated by Narita International Airport, Japan’s second-busiest airport.

The platform engaged eight participating entities. Japan Airlines, ENEOS, and ITOCHU acted as SAF suppliers and providers of associated Scope 3 environmental value. Nippon Express and Narita International Airport served as buyers of these credits. Mizuho Bank and Mizuho Research & Technologies offered operational support and helped validate the trading system’s integrity. ClassNK conducted independent verification to ensure transparency and confirm the absence of double counting.

The platform enabled sellers to list SAF-linked emission credits, while buyers submitted bids based on their preferred price, volume, and contractual terms. Matching occurred monthly, followed by bilateral contract execution and credit transfers. Post-trade audits were conducted to confirm each transaction’s validity.

This model allowed sellers to access external markets beyond internal offsetting, while buyers could tailor their credit purchases to align with specific environmental and ESG objectives.

Lessons and Next Steps

Although a formal launch date has not yet been announced, Phase 2 is expected to expand participation beyond the initial group. The next phase will aim to include additional airlines, marine carriers, fuel suppliers, and corporate buyers. Anticipated platform enhancements include accelerated matching processes and improved user experience.

One key challenge identified in Phase 1 was the limited buyer participation. Phase 2 will focus on building buyer awareness and articulating the strategic value of Scope 3 environmental credit procurement.

As transaction volumes grow, further systematization and scalability of the platform will be essential. Close collaboration with the Japanese government—or an equivalent regulatory authority—will be vital. Such engagement is considered critical for enabling broader social adoption and institutional integration of the trading scheme.

A Global First

The platform is especially notable because trading Scope 3 emission reductions offers a mechanism to redistribute SAF-related costs, helping address one of the major barriers to SAF uptake, its high price premium. Its importance is further underscored by Japan’s increasing SAF production capacity, including Cosmo Oil’s development of the country’s first large-scale domestic SAF facility.

As SAF adoption continues to advance through domestic and international policy support, this JAL-led pilot marks a world-first breakthrough in linking SAF use to a digital Scope 3 emissions trading system. The platform’s robust audit controls and safeguards against double counting enhance market confidence and demonstrate the potential for a credible, scalable framework for emissions trading in aviation.",https://www.clearbluemarkets.com/hubfs/Blog%20images/3.png,N,,2025-08-05 22:56:17.017489

As trade between African nations increases, the demand for efficient transportation, particularly air travel, will grow.","The aviation industry in Africa presents both significant opportunities and challenges, with the potential for remarkable growth driven by economic development, rising demand for air travel, and the need for better connectivity across the continent, writes WOLE SHADARE

The continent’s aviation industry is poised for growth, due to a rising middle class, increasing international business, and tourism.

Countries with higher Gross Domestic Products (GDPs), such as South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Egypt, lead the aviation sector, supported by established infrastructure and growing demand for air travel.

Same old story

Africa, as a region, has experienced a growing demand for air travel, driven by a rising middle class, expanding international business relationships, and the increasing importance of tourism.

Despite these favourable factors, the aviation industry in Africa has faced numerous hurdles, including insufficient infrastructure, safety concerns, regulatory inefficiencies, and fragmented air travel networks that often limit intra-African connectivity.

Africa has shown strong recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, with seat capacity across the continent up year-on-year every week since late March 2021.

The region exceeded pre-pandemic numbers during 2023, and there has been continued growth during 2024.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), air transport supports over 7 million jobs across the African continent and contributes around $60 billion to Africa’s GDP.

However, despite these contributions, its aviation market remains underdeveloped compared to other regions such as Asia and Europe.

The African Union (AU) and various regional organisations have made strides to improve the situation.

For example, the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) and the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM) is intended to open up the skies and promote cross-border travel and trade. Yet, the full potential of these initiatives has to be realised.

Economic indicators across continental markets

The economic development of a country is one of the most critical drivers for the aviation sector, as a higher GDP typically correlates with greater disposable income, higher demand for air travel, and a more developed infrastructure to support aviation.

The strongest aviation markets in Africa are generally those with the highest GDP and those that have taken steps to improve aviation infrastructure and connectivity.

The weakest markets highlight the vast differences across national borders.

Ethiopia, standout performer

The African aviation landscape is never dull, and 2024 was no different, as the continent experienced an eclectic blend of highs and lows. But once again, it was in Ethiopia that stood out from the crowd, thanks to the continued strong performance of its national carrier, Ethiopian Airlines.

The airline’s network currently consists of 143 destinations, including 22 within Ethiopia and 67 across Africa, according to data from CAPA – Centre for Aviation and OAG for the week commencing February 10, 2025.

The airline’s achievements during the year are too numerous to mention, but highlights include the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Boeing for the purchase of up to 20 Boeing 777Xs; the signing of a sustainable aviation fuel production and acquisition agreement with Satarem; the entry of its first A350-1000 into service, and the announcement of plans to construct Africa’s largest airport at Abusera.

In May 2024, Ethiopian Airlines CEO Mesfin Tasew called for the elimination of government interference in African airlines, stating, “Governments must remove their hands from the airlines if they want to see their airlines become successful, independent, self-sufficient in financing, and the like”.

It might be an ambitious wish, but the success of Ethiopian Airlines in contrast to many of its regional competitors is proof that it is a goal worth striving for.

South Africa’s developed aviation sector

South Africa, as the second-largest economy, is home to major international airports like OR Tambo International Airport (Johannesburg) and Cape Town International Airport – but it has been put in the shadow because of the rise.

The country has a highly developed aviation sector, with significant capacity in both international and domestic air travel.

According to the World Bank, South Africa’s GDP was $419 billion in 2023, and the country is a regional hub for air traffic.

Additionally, the airline industry benefits from global airlines and local operators like South African Airways. With continued investment in airports and modern aircraft, South Africa remains the key leader in African aviation.

Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy by GDP

Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy by GDP, standing at approximately $520 billion in 2023.

Nigeria’s aviation sector is experiencing substantial growth, driven by its burgeoning population, expanding middle class, and a strong oil-based economy.

Lagos’ Murtala Muhammed International Airport is a key hub, and there is potential for increased connectivity within the continent.

However, infrastructure issues, fuel supply challenges, and regulatory inefficiencies remain significant barriers to growth.

Kenya, trade and tourism growth

Kenya, with a GDP of around $120 billion, has experienced steady growth in air traffic.

Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport is one of Africa’s busiest airports, with an expanding role as a regional hub for both passengers and cargo.

Kenya Airways, the national carrier, plays a pivotal role in connecting East Africa to the rest of the world.

The rise in regional trade and tourism is expected to continue driving the growth of Kenya’s aviation sector.

Egypt’s most robust aviation sectors

Egypt, with a GDP of $400 billion in 2023, has one of the most robust aviation sectors in North Africa.

Cairo International Airport is a major regional hub, with strong demand from the tourism sector, as well as international trade.

The expansion of EgyptAir’s network and investment in infrastructure projects, like the new terminal at Cairo Airport, indicate that the country has the potential to expand its aviation market significantly.

Chad, one of Africa’s smallest economies

Chad is one of Africa’s smallest economies, with a GDP of approximately $12 billion in 2023.

The aviation sector here is underdeveloped, largely due to limited infrastructure, political instability, and a lack of investment.

Although the country is geographically important for regional connectivity, it has not experienced the level of growth in air travel compared to its larger neighbours.

Mozambique faces significant challenges aviation sector

With a GDP of around $20 billion, Mozambique faces significant challenges in its aviation sector.

The country’s airports are limited in capacity, and air travel is constrained by underdeveloped domestic infrastructure and a reliance on a few international flights.

While there is potential for growth in the tourism and cargo sectors, investments in infrastructure and regional connectivity in Mozambique are crucial.

Sierra Leone’s political instability, national airline absence

Sierra Leone is among the smaller economies in Africa, with a GDP of approximately $5 billion in 2023.

The country’s aviation sector is underdeveloped, with limited domestic services and minimal regional connectivity.

Political instability, underdeveloped airports, and the absence of a national airline contribute to the challenges.

Opportunities for growth

The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), which came into force in 2021, is one of the most significant drivers for the growth of aviation across the continent. This agreement aims to reduce trade barriers and promote the free movement of goods and services within Africa.

As trade between African nations increases, the demand for efficient transportation, particularly air travel, will grow. Airlines operating in Africa stand to benefit greatly from a more integrated and unified market.

A critical opportunity for the development of aviation in Africa also lies in the modernisation and expansion of airport infrastructure.

Major cities, such as Addis Ababa, Nairobi, Johannesburg, Cairo, and Lagos, are experiencing airport expansions, but many other regions remain underserved.

Last line

As the African economy continues to grow and integrate, aviation will undoubtedly play an increasingly important role in promoting economic development and enhancing connectivity across the continent. How big a role will remain dependent on how the industry embraces its need to change?

“If business as usual continues, plastic production will triple by 2060,” said Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall.
They say the treaty should focus on improving waste systems and recycling, not on limiting production.
A spokesperson for the US Government said the treaty should “respect national sovereignty” and not place “onerous restrictions on producers”.
WWF and others said the treaty could be signed first by a smaller group of countries, with others free to join later.","Countries from around the world are meeting in Geneva to try to agree on a global treaty to reduce plastic pollution.

Some environmental groups said they have waited long enough and were ready to move ahead, without the US if needed.

“Political cowardice is not an option,” Belgian Renew MEP Yvan Verougstraete said in a statement sent to Brussels Signal on August 5.

“This treaty is the wall standing between us and ecological disaster. If it collapses under lobby pressure, we will all pay the price. We must choose: A future buried in plastic, or a future worth living.”

The summit started on August 5, hosted by the United Nations, is the sixth round of talks since 2022. The goal is to create a legally-binding global agreement that reduces plastic pollution across its entire life cycle, from production to disposal.

The urgency was accentuated by recent UN figures that showed the scale of the problem: Global plastic production now exceeded 400 million tonnes each year but only 12 per cent was incinerated and just 9 per cent recycled.

The rest often ended up polluting the environment, especially oceans, rivers, and food chains.

The European Commission, which is attending the talks, said it was seeking an “ambitious global agreement” that reduced plastic waste, banned harmful chemicals and phased out the most damaging products.

“If business as usual continues, plastic production will triple by 2060,” said Environment Commissioner Jessika Roswall. “We need to agree on global rules that benefit both people and the planet.”

Countries remain deeply divided over what kind of treaty the world needed, though.

A group of 95 nations, backed by major environmental groups including the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA), has demanded firm limits on how much new plastic is produced.

They also called for bans on certain chemicals and rules to make products easier to reuse or recycle.

Their position is that plastic pollution cannot be solved just by collecting more waste, it has to be prevented at the source.

“Binding rules are key,” said the WWF. “Without them, the treaty won’t deliver the change needed.”

Opposing them is a smaller group of oil-producing and plastic-manufacturing countries, led by Saudi Arabia.

They say the treaty should focus on improving waste systems and recycling, not on limiting production. At previous talks, this group has been accused of dragging out discussions and trying to divide countries pushing for tougher action.

The US has taken a similar line, Bloomberg reported on August 5.

A spokesperson for the US Government said the treaty should “respect national sovereignty” and not place “onerous restrictions on producers”.

The US has rejected production caps and was now taking part under US President Donald Trump’s administration, which has pulled back from several international agreements in the past.

“I do see that division persisting,” said Erin Simon, head of plastics at WWF. She said the change in US leadership, with Trump coming in for a second term, had only made it harder to find common ground.

His policies supported expanding fossil fuel production and oil was the main ingredient in most plastic, Simon pointed out.

For some campaigners, the solution was now to move forward without the US, although that also brought the risk that one of the main producers of plastic waste would remain excluded from discussions on the matter.

WWF and others said the treaty could be signed first by a smaller group of countries, with others free to join later. That kind of step-by-step deal has worked before in global climate and trade negotiations.

Meanwhile, officials have spent months refining the treaty’s wording to save time during this round. But hopes generally remain low. When the last talks collapsed in South Korea, many blamed the Saudi-led group for blocking progress.

In Busan in 2024, the last time countries met, talks broke down in part because the “like-minded” coalition was accused of stalling and trying to divide the high-ambition group.

The current talks in Geneva were scheduled to run until 14 August.","https://brusselssignal.eu/content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-2149712110-1.jpg?fit=crop&crop=faces&q=75&auto=compress,format&w=594&h=396",N,,2025-08-05 22:56:22.856218

In a statement issued on Aug. 4, the RTFA said UK-produced ethanol -- now displaced from the road fuel market due to a new trade deal with the US -- should be permitted for use in SAF production via the alcohol-to-jet pathway, as part of the existing cap on SAF made using hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids.

""Crop-based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonising road transport. We are now in this situation,"" RTFA Chief Executive Gaynor Hartnell said. ""We're calling for the mandate to be amended to allow either HEFA or UK crop-based AtJ SAF to meet the HEFA cap.""

Trade deal undermines ethanol sector

The call comes in the wake of the UK-US trade agreement, which came into effect on June 30 and includes a duty-free quota for 1.4 billion liters of US ethanol roughly equal to the UK's entire domestic market.

As a result, UK producers such as Ensus and Vivergo Fuels are facing severe losses and potential closures.

Both companies have been sounding the alarm for months, warning that the tariff-free access granted to US ethanol has rendered British production economically unviable.

Vivergo's 420 million liter-per-year plant in Hull has already received its final wheat delivery, with plans to shut down operations by Sept. 13 if no government support materializes.

Mandate fit for the moment?

The UK introduced a 2% SAF mandate this year, with a cap on SAF derived from HEFA mainly made from waste fats and oils, intended to drive investment into alternative production pathways due to global feedstock limitations.

The RTFA argued that domestic ethanol should be recognized as one such alternative.

A 2021 government strategy paper hinted at this direction, stating that a decline in road fuel demand would free up feedstocks like ethanol for aviation fuel production -- a shift the RTFA now says must be codified in policy.

""This presents us, and UK industry, an opportunity to push forward the transition of feedstocks currently used for road fuel to other sectors,"" the document said.

Industry on the brink

The UK's two major ethanol producers are both under intense pressure.

Vivergo Fuels, owned by AB Foods, has set a closure deadline of mid-September, citing losses of $3 million per month and a lack of feedstock purchases since June.

Ensus, owned by CropEnergies, is also considering closure and has been up for sale since December 2024 after reporting a GBP19.86 million loss in 2024.

Both companies have engaged in ongoing crisis talks with the UK government, requesting GBP150 million in short-term aid and policy changes, including SAF mandate reform to salvage their operations.

The looming closures threaten more than just ethanol output.

Both plants are key suppliers of byproducts such as animal feed and CO2, the latter of which has faced nationwide shortages in recent years. The knock-on effects could ripple across the UK food, agriculture, and industrial sectors.

SAF ambitions at risk

Market experts said the SAF mandate is not just about environmental targets, it is increasingly linked to industrial policy and energy security.

The closure of domestic ethanol plants could also jeopardise future SAF projects, such as the GBP1.25 billion Meld Energy SAF plant planned for Saltend Chemical Park, adjacent to Vivergo's facility.

Meanwhile, international projects are progressing. US-based LanzaJet, which recently launched the world's first commercial-scale AtJ SAF plant, has received planning approval for a 100 million liter/year facility in Wales, although that project has yet to reach a final investment decision.

""The department's July 24 memorandum begins to deliver on this promise and does so in a way that right-sizes the USDA footprint, eliminates unnecessary management layers, consolidates redundant or duplicative functions, and, most importantly, allows USDA to deliver on its mission to the American people within the bounds of its available financial resources.""

The reorganization proposal reflects President Trump’s commitment to relocate federal agencies beyond the national capital region, reduce bureaucracy, and strengthen USDA’s presence in key agricultural regions across the country. As part of the plan, USDA will consolidate operations, close the South Building, and relocate approximately 2,600 Washington-based positions to five regional hubs: Raleigh, NC; Kansas City, MO; Indianapolis, IN; Fort Collins, CO; and Salt Lake City, UT.

USDA is conducting the reorganization under its authority established in the Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1953 (5 U.S.C. app.; 7 U.S.C. 2201 note) and The Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103-354). The secretarial memorandum delegates authority to the Deputy Secretary and underscores USDA’s focus on efficiency, geographic diversity, and long-term sustainability.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/USDA_July25_ab31c1341a.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 21:56:44.772245

There are four focal points for travel data – those on cost control, compliance, wellbeing and sustainability.
This approach can also lead to a more agile and responsive travel programme.
The EU’s directive on corporate sustainability reporting (CSRD) and similar regulatory requirements have further ramped demand for this information.
“Travel data should be used to tell a relevant, clear and actionable story.","Making sense of a multifaceted travel programme can be daunting. This is where data, particularly the numbers that travel management companies (TMCs) provide, can be incredibly powerful, helping make sense of travel spend, the ROI of trips and ESG goals, as well as flagging out-of-policy bookings.

These days, businesses and suppliers are awash with data points as they digitally transform. There are four focal points for travel data – those on cost control, compliance, wellbeing and sustainability. However, as the travel industry evolves and becomes more data-led, there are more challenges.

“Fragmentation of booking channels across TMCs, other agencies or direct suppliers can drive complexity in aggregating data sets. This often requires more advanced analysis in order to join large, disparate pools of data,” explains Sara Andell, Director of Consulting Strategy, American Express GBT.

“TMCs also act as intermediaries to other systems including GDS. And it is common that core data provision comes in a relatively raw format. It’s important to understand what data transformation, cleaning, validating and structuring is undertaken by the TMC.”

It doesn’t help that corporates often engage multiple TMCs for different business divisions or regions, have significant travel policy leakage, or substantial expense programmes that run alongside their travel programme.

This is why taking an active rather than a passive approach to data analytics is crucial. This involves not only querying the data on offer but where and how it’s generated. Buyers must not settle for off-the-shelf reporting.

“Travel managers should ask their TMC what technology they are using and which reporting and analytics providers they are working with to consolidate their data. Is the technology provider pulling data from every content source – including GDS and non-GDS data, NDC, ground transport or carbon emissions? How are they processing and standardising that data? More importantly, don’t accept poor data if you know something is wrong,” advises David Chappell, Chief Product Officer, TripStax.

Eye on the prize

Real-time analysis and regular reporting, rather than quarterly reviews, can help flag some of these issues. This approach can also lead to a more agile and responsive travel programme. More importantly, having a data strategy is key.

“TMCs will have insights from multiple clients, allowing you to compare your performance and identify areas for enhancement”

“Data is most powerful if it drives action. When aligned with internal or business goals, it becomes a real game changer. It’s therefore important to understand the ‘why’ behind data trends and champion a data-driven culture internally,” advises Sam Davies, ATPI’s Director of Corporate Partnerships.

He adds: “Starting with the ‘why’ and ‘what’ is crucial, especially if a travel manager is trying to reduce costs or carbon emissions, boost online adoption or enhance the traveller experience. When objectives are clear, data becomes a powerful decision-making tool. Travel managers should also use data as a storytelling device, not just to report on the past, but to shape future strategy.”

Changing behaviour

Using data to monitor buying patterns has always been a hot topic. Late bookings result in higher costs since airlines around the globe have invested heavily in yield management. Analytics can show why flights are clicked on last minute and flag savings, while data relating to out-of-policy bookings can help travel managers drive compliance. Data on wellbeing, whether information on travel frequency, trip length or rest periods, is increasingly important too, since travel managers are now more able to quantify duty of care.

In all these use cases, turning random data into actionable insight is dependent on benchmarking a travel programme against industry standards and best practices.

“TMCs will have insights from multiple clients, allowing you to compare your performance and identify areas for enhancement,” states Logan LaBonne, Director, Product Management, Data & Analytics, CWT.

Carbon control

Data is essential to build an effective ESG-focused travel strategy. With sustainability continuing to be high on the corporate agenda, buyers are seeking greater visibility on their carbon emissions, broken down by route, traveller or supplier. The EU’s directive on corporate sustainability reporting (CSRD) and similar regulatory requirements have further ramped demand for this information.

This data can also be useful in supporting strategies on reducing Scope 3 emissions. Putting a price on carbon and marrying that with other data allows companies to create funds for decarbonisation projects, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or electric vehicles.

“In the last couple of years, ESG is an area where the demand for data has increased significantly. We see a convergence of opinion that sustainability and value often come from the same buying decision. There are anomalies, but on the whole, being cost conscious leads to better sustainability outcomes,” states Chris Truss, Global Sustainability Director, Reed & Mackay.

A different story

Companies can now strike a more calibrated and holistic approach to cost, sustainability and employee wellbeing by adopting a data-driven approach. Data consolidation across all parts of the travel spend lifecycle from pre-trip to on-trip and post-trip is a critical part of this process. Utilising dashboards to visualise data, as well as tracking key performance indicators (KPIs), can also help to analyse trends, allowing targeted action.

“Travel data should be used to tell a relevant, clear and actionable story. It generally takes an experienced consultant with a deep understanding of the travel industry, trends, company policy and underlying data sources to interpret this information. However, we’ve recently found some success in utilising AI to turn even casual users into analyst storytellers,” observes CWT’s Logan LaBonne.

“Anyone can now interact with data using natural language queries and generative AI. For instance, HR, finance, security, and sales people can easily access and interpret travel information without requiring specialised analytical skills or familiarity with corporate travel jargon.”

“The amount of data available can be overwhelming. It is therefore important to focus on specific behaviours and data that can impact your programme”

It is likely that generative AI will help stretched travel managers. For instance, in a survey by BCD Travel, only 36% of travel managers reported that they interact with their data daily, while 10% do so quarterly or less. The main reason, cited by 44% of respondents, was lack of time.

“The amount of data available can be overwhelming. It is therefore important to focus on specific behaviours and data that can impact your programme. Don’t ignore outliers, as this can highlight important trends,” points out Heather Wright, Vice President for Global Product Marketing at BCD Travel. “It is also important to share your insights with other key players in your company, including finance, risk management, IT and security.”

In fact, data could hold the key to elevating the future role of the travel manager. “We’re talking about connecting the dots between travel and things like project spend. I’ve found that bringing this to life means moving beyond spreadsheets. It’s about using dynamic reporting to visualise the data, telling stories around both successes and challenges, and using case studies to show tangible impact,” concludes Stuart Birkin, General Manager for CTM Europe.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/TMC-DATA.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 19:56:22.207084

The legislation would help expand forest product research and build new markets by formally establishing an Office of Technology Transfer at the United States Forest Service (USFS) and authorize $5 million in appropriations. By expanding product research, this legislation will help create new jobs in rural Georgia.

The Officer of Technology Transfer's mission shall be to expand the commercial impact of the research investments of the Forest Service and to provide for the commercialization of technologies that support the mission of the Forest Service.

The Forest Bioeconomy Act would also establish a new Mass Timber Science and Education program at colleges and universities across the country to respond to emerging research needs of architects, developers, and the forest products industry. Senator Warnock has cosponsored legislation in 2023 aimed at modernizing and improving the U.S. Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program to ensure the continued availability of reliable data and analyses.

With this new bill, the Secretary of Agriculture, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, shall expand research relating to the use of wood by:

Facilitating the establishment of new markets, including nontraditional markets, for material produced from forest management projects that typically has little or no commercial value.

Increasing the economic viability of manufacturing products using material described in [the above bullet point].

Feedstock for the production of renewable fuel, including sustainable aviation fuel.

“Georgia’s forestry industry is vital to our state’s economy and I’m proud to work with my colleagues to find a bipartisan solution to invest in the future success of this sector,” said Senator Warnock. Georgia’s forestry industry is beneficial for the state, injecting $41.3 billion in economic impact in 2021.

“To protect our communities from increasingly catastrophic wildfires, we need to make forest management more effective and scalable,” said Senator Heinrich. “By expanding technology transfer at the Forest Service and turning small-diameter trees into marketable wood products, we can create new revenue streams, scale up fuels reduction, and accelerate the work needed to reduce wildfire risk.”

“In West Virginia, we know the value of our forests and the importance of managing them wisely—not just for the beauty and recreation they offer, but also for the jobs and strengthening our economy,” said Senator Justice. “This bipartisan bill supports our rural economies, protects our communities from wildfires, and make the most of what our land gives us. It’s a win for the economy, environment and for our people.”

“70 percent of Montana’s forests are federally owned, and we need to be doing all we can to ensure we’re good stewards of these lands,” said Senator Daines. “I’m proud to co-lead this bipartisan bill that will support proper forest management and create new markets for low value woody biomass.”

Senator Warnock has long fought for federal funding for communities, farmers, and forest landowners in Georgia. After Hurricane Helene, Senator Warnock remained on the frontlines of response efforts and pushed to deliver additional disaster assistance to Georgians, particularly Georgia’s hard-hit agricultural communities.

But in aviation, pilots know that altitude isn’t enough. Attitude — the orientation of the aircraft, the crew’s mindset, the instruments in front of them — determines whether you’re really on a safe, stable glidepath.

That’s where the SAF sector is today: not just climbing but aligning, stabilizing its flight path, and making deliberate adjustments to reach net‑zero on schedule. The industry’s newest announcements — from XCF Global’s billion‑dollar build‑out to Sheffield’s NextGen‑SAF integration project — show a market that’s learning how to fly in formation, balancing ambition with navigational precision.

DIGEST HAZARD INDEX: Current SAF sector signal: Stable, Glidepath Confirmed. Hazard readings show no disruptive spikes; low narrative volatility; steady systemic integration.

Gauge readings

Gauge 1: Hazard Index — Our TCAS for Markets

In aviation, the Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) warns pilots when they’re on a dangerous trajectory. The Hazard Index does the same for markets: it’s our narrative‑driven early‑warning system for systemic stress, helping us see turbulence long before traditional indicators like the VIX.

In backtests, the Hazard Index gave an early “pull‑up” warning for the 2008 financial crisis (August 2008 reading: 0.82, spiking well before Lehman’s collapse). During COVID’s onset in early 2020, the Index jumped to 0.69 as headlines whipsawed between lockdowns, fuel demand collapse, and bailout rumors — a classic case of narrative turbulence.

Current reading for SAF: 0.14 — low‑risk glidepath. By comparison, anything below 0.20 is typically calm cruising airspace. Right now, the SAF sector shows smooth narrative flow, low speculative froth, and strong structural follow‑through — a sector on instruments, not flying blind.

If that reading begins to climb, the instrument would be flagging turbulence — think sudden feedstock price spikes, unexpected policy reversals, or technology scale‑up delays. Those are the market’s equivalent of wind shear: rare, but when they appear, you want to see them early.

Gauge 2: GTESI Vectors — Your Predictive Wind Shear System

If the Hazard Index is our TCAS, GTESI acts like a Predictive Wind Shear System, showing how a sector is adjusting to invisible currents. GTESI — the General Theory of Evolutionary Systems & Information — tracks how persistent a system is in resisting entropy.

We measure this with four “vectors”:

IPR (Inverse Persistence Ratio): Gap between narrative hype and structural execution.

SCD (Systemic Compression & Differentiation): How efficiently systems integrate and specialize.

TRFI (Trust, Risk, Feedback & Information): Network stability and resilience.

EED (Energy & Entropy Directionality): How well energy inputs are directed toward productive, persistent outputs.

Current SAF readout: IPR is narrowing (narrative finally matched by build‑outs), SCD is high (multi‑tech integration like MCFC + AFT), TRFI is strengthening (state‑private partnerships expand trust networks), and EED is improving(refinery conversions redirect energy toward higher‑value bioproducts).

Together, these gauges — like real cockpit instruments — help us distinguish between a safe, stable glidepath and hidden turbulence. Right now, the readings say: attitude aligned, course steady.

But as the sector nears cruising altitude, what new instruments will be needed? Will the next phase require sharper price‑tracking gauges, or more robust cross‑sector partnerships? Readers should watch for new policy frameworks, off‑take agreements, and actual gallons delivered — those are the true indicators of whether this glidepath holds.

Waypoint 1: XCF Global Lines Up for the Long Haul

The clearest signal of stability? XCF Global’s $1 billion investment to expand its SAF and renewable fuels platform, with three new U.S. sites — New Rise Reno 2 (by 2027), Fort Myers, FL, and Wilson, NC (by 2028). Each is targeting 40 million gallons per year, bringing total output to ~160 million gallons annually.

This is more than a takeoff roll — it’s setting the cruise configuration for a market that needs reliable supply to match airlines’ 2030 decarbonization commitments.

GTESI VECTOR READOUT – XCF GLOBAL

IPR: Narrowing — symbolic persistence (narrative) now matched by structural commitments (plants, capital).

TRFI: Strengthening — expanded trust network across regions; multi‑site execution improves feedback loops.

Waypoint 2: Sheffield Integrates Innovation

In the UK, the University of Sheffield’s NextGen‑SAF project is pushing integration as the sector’s next discipline. Backed by government funding, the project combines Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) — for generating hydrogen and capturing CO₂ — with an Advanced Fischer‑Tropsch (AFT) reactor to synthesize hydrocarbons for SAF. Airbus and Boeing are backing the consortium, signaling market confidence in the system’s operability and scalability.

This isn’t just another demo. It’s a proof‑of‑concept for convergent tech pathways that cut costs, compress complexity, and de‑risk future builds.

GTESI VECTOR READOUT – NEXTGEN‑SAF

SCD: High — combining MCFC + AFT compresses systems and creates differentiated, defensible IP.

EED: Optimized — multiple energy inputs captured and directed toward a unified output stream.

Waypoint 3: Asia Locks In Supply Resilience

In China, CNAF (China National Aviation Fuel Group) has invested $36.4 million for a 10% stake in Lianyungang Jiaao Enprotech, the first company on the country’s official SAF “Export Whitelist.” Pilot SAF programs at four major airports are now in motion, with routine bio‑jet fueling planned by 2025.

Vietnam is also aligning on the glidepath: Petrolimex and Keppel Group have signed an MoI to assess SAF production technologies and feasibility, targeting Vietnam’s first domestic SAF facility in line with net‑zero by 2050.

GTESI VECTOR READOUT – CNAF & VIETNAM INITIATIVES

TRFI: Strengthening — state‑backed capital and cross‑border partnerships build multi‑layer trust. These expanded trust networks aren’t abstract. They lower financing risk for private investors, cut red tape for cross‑border projects, and accelerate deployment timelines — turning state support into real market resilience.

IPR: Balanced — narrative ambition (COP26 pledges) now matched by real investments. A few years ago, SAF headlines often ran ahead of reality — projects announced without funding, volumes promised but not delivered. Today, with XCF Global committing $1 billion to bricks‑and‑mortar plants, the gap between narrative and execution has narrowed dramatically

Waypoint 4: Novel Feedstocks & Retrofits

The sector is also correcting course toward cost efficiency and resource abundance:

In the Netherlands, SeaO2 (with TU Delft, University of Twente, and NERA) is developing e‑SAF from seawater, extracting CO₂ and ultrapure water for hydrogen formation. Funded with $1.9 million, it’s a decentralized, resource‑efficient approach.

In Italy, the European Investment Bank is backing Eni’s $578 million refinery conversion in Livorno, transforming legacy assets into hydrogenated biofuel and SAF production hubs.

In Ghana, F&B Bio Recyclage is tackling two problems at once: turning municipal solid waste into SAF.

In Korea, LG Chem and Enilive are building the country’s first HVO & SAF plant, processing 400,000 tons/year of renewable feedstock by 2027, with Enilive’s biorefining capacity targeting 5 million tons by 2030.

GTESI VECTOR READOUT – FEEDSTOCK & RETROFIT PROJECTS

SCD: Rising — integrating waste, seawater, and refinery retrofits creates modular, low‑cost production pathways. his integration matters because it compresses complexity — capturing hydrogen and CO₂ in one step, then converting them to hydrocarbons without separate, siloed processes. The result: fewer moving parts, faster scale‑up, and intellectual property that competitors can’t easily replicate.

EED: Improving — legacy infrastructure re‑channeled for new, high‑entropy‑exporting fuels.

Waypoint 5: Instruments Set — Policy & Standardization

Policy is keeping the industry on course. The UK government de‑risked NextGen‑SAF, and Netherlands’ TKI program funded SeaO2. That UK funding didn’t just validate Sheffield’s concept — it unlocked matching private investment and cut project lead times by reducing permitting and financing risk.

Thailand’s adoption of ASTM D7566 means new SAF producers can plug into existing global supply chains without extra certification hurdles, speeding adoption by airlines and simplifying logistics

These aren’t symbolic gestures. They’re instrument checks: aligning regulatory frameworks with operational reality so the sector can keep its glidepath steady.

Sustainability Progress-- The company achieved 11 of 12 environmental goals from 2018 through 2024, reaching its 2025 target a year early. Scope 1 emissions were reduced by 32% from 2018 through 2024, Scope 2 emissions were reduced by 36% from 2018 through 2024, and emission intensity for both Scope 1 and 2 on a per unit basis was reduced by over 50% from 2018 through 2024, while 66% of new products developed over the past five years have a sustainable profile.

Q3 2025 Outlook-- Sales are projected between $525 million and $535 million for Q3 2025, operating income is targeted at approximately $75 million for Q3 2025, and a stable demand environment anticipated, with higher tariffs and customer maintenance outages as potential headwinds.

SUMMARY

Minerals Technologies (MTX 2.35%) management is investing substantially in high-growth areas such as sustainable aviation fuel, animal health, and international pet care, positioning for accelerating margin expansion as these initiatives scale. Demand in the US steel and foundry markets remains solid, supporting refractories and engineered solutions, while European steel and construction markets continue to lag with no sign of imminent recovery. Strategic consolidation and upgrades of manufacturing facilities are expected to improve both productivity and cost position for key product lines, with new capacity in Asia and India targeted for second-half operational rollout. The company maintains conservative capital stewardship, enabling flexibility for potential acquisitions, while ongoing competitive activity and pricing pressure in the pet care business may weigh on near-term Consumer & Specialties segment margins.

Dietrich noted, ""Every year, we extract over 1.1 million metric tons of waste CO2 from our customers and our own exhaust stacks and sequester those emissions in used into consumer products.""

Brett Argirakis reported U.S. steel capacity utilization in the high 70% to 78% range during Q2 2025 and service center inventory has declined to around 55 days in the US steel market, offering stability for steel-related product demand in North America.

Seventeen MINscan or ScanControl units have now been installed globally, including the first European contract in Austria slated for next year, indicating broader adoption of automated refractory technology.

Dietrich stated, regarding talc litigation developments, the reserve remains sufficient, and recent May hearings led to ""referred a key factual question in the case to a federal district court.""

Promotional activity and increased discounting in North American cat litter markets are being managed via private label brand support, with management expecting these conditions to return to ""more normal levels.""

Full Conference Call Transcript

Doug Dietrich: Thanks, Lydia. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today. I'll start the call by giving you an overview of our second quarter, followed by a review of our current market conditions across our product lines, as well as an update on our near-term growth initiatives. Erik will then take you through the detailed financials and provide an outlook for the third quarter. I'm going to close our prepared remarks with a quick review of our seventeenth annual sustainability report, which we just released earlier this week before opening the call to questions. Let me start with our Q2 numbers.

It is a strong quarter for us, both on a standalone and historical basis, with EPS coming in at $1.55, up 36% from Q1 and at a level only behind the second quarter of last year, when market conditions were relatively stronger. Our ability to generate these results amid the recent global economic backdrop is an example of the strong operating culture of this company. As we shared on our last call, we started to see a significant uptick in sales at the end of the first quarter, and our sales rate expanded through the second quarter and resulted in $529 million, up 8% sequentially. Operating income came in at $79 million, up 25% sequentially.

And operating margin was 14.9%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter and reverting to our natural level of 15%. It's important to put this performance into context given the challenges presented by changing tariffs, and the ongoing uncertainties they continue to put on our end markets. Our results are a testament to MTI's strong fundamentals, including our operational agility, prudent cost and expense control, and our team's ability to take quick action and make necessary adjustments. I'd like to highlight that we delivered strong cash conversion this quarter, in line with our historical average of around 7% of sales. A level that we expect to continue.

We also returned $22 million to shareholders this quarter, reflecting our ongoing commitment to steer capital back to investors. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition giving us a strong foundation with the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to drive growth in sales, earnings, and cash flow. Now let me talk a bit about what we're seeing with market conditions and give you some insight into projects that we have coming online to drive both growth and margin expansion. Let's start with the Consumer and Specialties business segment, which comprises our household and personal care and specialty additives product lines. In household and personal care, we're seeing mixed conditions across these consumer end markets.

The North America cat litter market has been slower this year compared to recent years. And these conditions have created more competitive dynamics. We are navigating this with increased promotional activity with our customers, and are seeing momentum building in our order books as a result. We continue to see positive long-term growth dynamics across global pet litter markets. To support this growing demand, we've been retooling our facilities in North America and Europe with new process and packaging equipment. These upgrades are designed not only to produce higher quality products, but also to improve efficiency and reduce production costs.

In addition, we are opening a new pet litter packaging facility in Asia late in the third quarter, to support the demand growth we are seeing there. In our other consumer-oriented products, we are seeing significant increased demand for renewable fuel purification, animal health solutions, and fabric care. This is being driven by regulation changes for more sustainable aviation fuel, the continued trend toward natural livestock feed additives, and the growing demand for more sustainable laundry detergents. We have several capacity expansion projects underway for these product lines as well. In the Specialty Additives product line, market conditions remain mixed. The paper market in North America is relatively flat and Europe remains weak.

However, we continue to penetrate the paper and packaging market in Asia, with strong customer pull for our packaging solutions and sustainable products like NewYield. Three new satellite facilities, two of which are for packaging applications, and one packaging and one capacity expansion set to come online within the next seven to eight months. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of additional opportunities across the paper and packaging market further down the road. In other areas, the automotive market has been relatively flat this year, while residential construction markets vary for us by region. With stronger demand on the US West Coast and continued softness on the East Coast. Meanwhile, our food and pharmaceutical markets remain robust.

Now let me turn to our engineered solutions segment, which includes our high temperature technologies and environmental and infrastructure product lines. In high temperature technologies, we continue to see strong demand in North America for our automated MIN scan systems and for our newest steel refractory formulations. The North America steel market remains relatively stable, and at a production level that provides good volumes for us. In Europe, the steel market remains weak, we expect these conditions to continue for the remainder of the year.

Lydia Kopylova: A bright spot in Europe,

Doug Dietrich: is that we've secured our first Minscan LSC sale there, opening a new market for our technology. We're pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, helping our customers reduce costs and improve safety through high-tech automated refractory application and measuring systems. We expect to generate additional Minscan sales moving forward as other customers become comfortable with and adopt our new technology. The US foundry market has generated solid demand for our greensand bonds, through the first half from stable auto demand and despite the softer heavy truck and ag equipment markets. The China foundry market has remained resilient, despite the introduction of increased tariffs.

Our volumes of greensand bonds in China remain strong, as foundry customers quickly adapt to the changing market conditions, and seek the cost savings and productivity value that our products provide. On the environmental infrastructure side, the commercial construction and environmental lining markets have stabilized, but we have not yet seen the initiation of several planned large projects where we are specified. We expect commercial construction markets to remain relatively soft as long as interest rates remain higher. However, we are seeing strong pull for our infrastructure drilling products, water remediation solutions, offshore energy services, and PFAS remediation through Floresort.

As an overall market summary, we see similar market conditions to the second quarter continuing into the back half of the year. However, I would not characterize these conditions as robust by historical standards. As I just mentioned, we are executing on several initiatives to support the strong near-term demand we are seeing in multiple product lines. These initiatives include new capacity, and plant expansions to support demand for sustainable aviation fuel, animal health, fabric care, and pet care. These specific projects will support $100 million in revenue growth for products that will drive the margin profile of the company higher.

Lydia Kopylova: This is just a subset of our growth initiatives.

Doug Dietrich: Other projects, such as geographic expansion initiatives, and new product introductions, can be supported by our existing capacity. Now let me let Erik take you through some additional details of our financial results as well as the third quarter outlook. Erik?

Erik Aldag: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by providing an overview of our second quarter results, followed by a review of the performance of our segment and I'll wrap up with our outlook for the third quarter. Following my remarks, I'll turn the call back over to Doug to cover the highlights from our 2024 sustainability report. Let's review our second quarter results. Overall, we delivered a strong performance in the second quarter. Across our end markets, conditions played out mostly as we expected, with sales continuing to show improvement from the levels we saw in the first quarter. Sales of $529 million were up 8% sequentially, driven by higher volumes in both segments.

Customer order patterns continued to normalize through the quarter, not quite to prior year levels, but a significant improvement from what we experienced in the beginning of the year. You can see from the bridge on the top right, that higher volume drove $30 million of the $37 million sequential improvement in sales. With the balance of the increase coming from favorable pricing and foreign exchange. Consumer and specialty sales increased by $9 million sequentially. And in engineered solutions, sales were up by $28 million. Operating income increased by $16 million or 25% sequentially to $79 million matching the second highest operating income quarter for the company.

And that was despite the current macro challenges weighing on some of our end markets. In the sequential operating income bridge, you can see that higher volume drove a $9 million improvement to income, which is a typical incremental margin for us on $30 million of volume. In addition to favorable pricing and foreign exchange, we also benefited from $4 million of lower cost driven by improved productivity, and the ramp up of our cost savings program. As a result, operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 14.9% of sales.

It's worth noting that we incurred about a half a million dollars in incremental tariff costs in the second quarter, which our team has done a nice job mitigating through supply chain and commercial actions. As Doug mentioned, we are working on several projects to expand capacity for high growth products and optimize our footprint for continued margin expansion. In the second quarter, we executed on some efficiency opportunities in engineered solutions by consolidating two facilities in the US, which will result in direct cost savings as well as productivity and improvement. In addition, we made adjustments to the layout of another facility in the US to accommodate future capacity expansion for Fluorozorb, our PFAS remediation technology.

We recorded special charges in the quarter associated with these actions, which were mostly offset by a gain on the final installment for the sale of refractory manufacturing assets in China. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding these special items, $1.55 up 36% sequentially. Now let's turn to a review of our segments beginning with consumer and specialty. Second quarter sales in the Consumer and Specialty segment were $278 million up 4% sequentially as customer order patterns stabilized throughout the quarter. Sales in our Household and Personal Care product line were $127 million up slightly from prior year and up 3% sequentially. As Doug mentioned, we've got a lot of exciting initiatives in household and personal care.

Some of these specialty applications, like natural oil purification and animal health, are growing at double-digit rates with incremental margins above the company average. The growth of these products will continue to drive the margin profile of the company higher. And we are supporting this growth with capital investment to ensure our facilities can keep up with demand. In our specialty additives product line, sales of $150 million were 5% below prior year driven by softer demand conditions. Primarily in paper production in North America and Europe. On a sequential basis, sales in the product line were up 4% primarily driven by seasonally higher sales into residential construction applications. The team remains focused on driving operational efficiency.

While also supporting our growth opportunity. This segment delivered a much stronger operating performance in the second quarter, Operating income was $37 million up 24% sequentially and operating margin increased by 220 basis points to 13.4% of sales. Margins were lower than last year, due to volume leverage, and some higher raw material and energy costs that we are working to pass through. We're also in the process of making significant upgrades to one of our cat litter facilities in the US. This is resulting in temporarily higher freight costs as we've shifted production around our network to accommodate the work at this facility.

Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales in the Household and Personal Care product line to increase sequentially driven by an improving demand outlook and the ramp up of our growth initiatives. And in specialty additives, we expect a similar quarter sequentially. Now let's turn to the Engineered Solutions segment. Second quarter sales in the Engineered Solutions segment were $251 million up 12% sequentially. In our High Temperature Technologies product line, sales were $178 million three percent below prior year, but up 5% sequentially. Global sales to foundry customers were similar to prior year. Demand in North America is holding relatively stable apart from some ongoing softness for castings going into the agricultural equipment and heavy truck market.

And in Asia, we continue to deliver year over year volume growth including in China, despite lingering tariff uncertainties. Second quarter sales to steel customers were mixed. We saw a modest sequential improvement in sales to European steel customers after significant destocking in the first quarter However, that market remains softer than last year. Meanwhile, The US steel market has been solid. And our team is doing an excellent job executing on growth initiatives. Second quarter sales to steel customers in North America were higher than last year and up sequentially as well.

In the environmental and infrastructure product line, second quarter sales were $73 million 1% higher than the prior year and 35% higher than the first quarter as we entered the seasonally stronger period for this product line. Demand conditions across the product line have stabilized although overall project activity is still lower than historical levels. The segment overall delivered another strong operating performance. Operating income was $44 million operating margin improved by 200 basis points sequentially 17.4% of sales. Matching last year's record performance. Turning to the third quarter, we expect end market conditions to remain stable for the segment and overall sales to be similar sequentially.

Now let me turn to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We delivered a solid cash flow performance in the second quarter. With free cash flow of $34 million Looking ahead, we expect cash flow to continue to build through the second half. As we've mentioned, we're making several key investments across the company that support the progress we've made on our strategic growth initiative. In the second quarter, CapEx was $29 million as activity on several projects picked up.

And for the full year, we're projecting capital of approximately $100 million This figure includes the ramp up of several growth investments that Doug referred to in his remarks, will add $100 million of annual revenue at above average margins. These investments total about $50 million of CapEx that we'll be executing on over the next twelve months. We're expecting to generate significant free cash flow in the second half. At this point, we expect full year free cash flow in the 6% of sales range, which factors in the slower start to the year the higher level of investment, and a very strong second half of cash flow generation.

We also returned $22 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter, and we've returned $73 million to shareholders over the last four quarters maintaining our balanced approach to capital deployment. Turning to the balance sheet. Total liquidity at the end of the second quarter stood at nearly $700 million which is $150 million higher than the last year. And our net leverage ratio is 1.7 times EBITDA. Below our target of two times EBITDA. The company's strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow generation provide the financial strength to navigate periods of uncertainty, while also enabling significant flexibility to pursue growth and return cash to shareholders. Now I'll summarize our outlook for the third quarter.

Doug Dietrich: We're

Erik Aldag: expecting a largely similar quarter sequentially for sales and income. With a balance of potential upsides and some ongoing macro uncertainty. Overall, we're expecting sales of between $525 million and $535 million In Consumer and Specialties, we're expecting higher sales from continued growth across the household and personal care product line, including natural oil purification, personal care, and animal health products to name a few examples. And in engineered solutions, we see a similar level of sales sequentially as our stable market outlook is balanced by seasonal customer maintenance outages in high temperature technologies. Our operating income guidance of approximately $75 million reflects the midpoint of our sales range and represents a balanced view.

With potential upsides well as the potential for macro uncertainty around trade and tariffs to continue to impact our customers and end markets. And while our direct exposure to tariffs is relatively low, we are facing a higher tariff cost in the third quarter of $1.5 million We're confident we'll be able to mitigate this tariff impact through our ongoing supply chain and commercial efforts. In summary, we feel confident that the second half will be stronger than the first half and we are excited about the progress we are making on several key initiatives will contribute to long-term growth and continued margin expansion.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Doug for some remarks on our annual sustainability report. Doug?

Doug Dietrich: Thanks, Erik. Wanna close the call with a quick overview of our sustainability report. Which we just released earlier this week. This is the seventeenth year that we've published this report, and it reflects the tremendous amount of ongoing activity across our company. Enhance what we do and how we do it in order to drive value for our customers, employees, communities, and investors. Sustainability is not new to MTI. It's always been explicitly included in our values and how we run the company. We're committed to being responsible stewards of the environment good neighbors, and the places in which we work, and dependable, supportable, supportive and inclusive colleagues who are laser focused on keeping each other safe.

This isn't just talk. We put this commitment into action as you can see from the highlights in our report. Let me give you a few of them. Through 2024, we've achieved 11 out of 12 of the environmental goals we set for ourselves back in 2018. And we achieved them one year ahead of our 2025 target. The progress we've made since 2018 is quite remarkable. We've reduced our overall Scope one emissions by 32%, scope two emissions by 36%, and reduced emission intensity for both scope one and two on a per unit basis by over 50%. We've reduced our airborne pollutant emissions by 70% cut our processed water usage in half, reduced processed waste disposal by 44%.

Every year, we extract over 1,100,000 metric tons of waste CO2 from our customers and our own exhaust stacks and sequester those emissions in used into consumer products. We operate at a world-class safety level and consistently look for ways to make our work environment safer. Though, we will never be satisfied until we reach and maintain zero injuries as a company. We support our customers in achieving their sustainability goals, with 66% of our new products which we define as products developed over the last five years, having a sustainable profile. These products range from natural solutions to emissions and waste reduction products that support pollution prevention, filtration, and energy savings.

You'll also see several examples of how we engage within our communities. By supporting education, installing systems to bring clean waters to areas in need, and working alongside our neighbors in a variety of local initiatives. This is only a sample of what you'll see in this year's report, and I encourage you take a deep dive into it. I'm extremely proud of what we've achieved thus far, but there's so much more to do for us and for our industry.

Erik Aldag: We intend

Doug Dietrich: to outline this next chapter when we publish our new long-term goals in next year's report. With that, let me turn the call over to questions.

Operator: We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, If you are using a speakerphone, please up your handset before pressing the keys. Our first question today comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Mike Harrison: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.

Doug Dietrich: Hi, Mike.

Mike Harrison: Was hoping that we could talk a little bit in start out here with the Household and Personal Care segment. There was some improvement sequentially but we're still not back to the kinds of growth rates we'd like to see there. I know you mentioned that kind of the underlying pet care market is still not fantastic. But can you give us maybe some additional color on what you're seeing in that HPC product line? And in terms of volume trends And when you might expect to get back to stronger growth rates? Sure, Mike. Let me start off and then I'll hand it over to D.J. Monagle to give you a little bit more detail.

Look, think the product line several of the products as we mentioned in this are doing quite well. We've got some of the smaller products like our aviation natural oil, fuel purification, animal health, personal care. These are growing at kind of double-digit and high double-digit kind of rates. So they're doing very well. They're smaller piece of the profile. As I mentioned, we're investing in them, and I think as they grow, they're going to be continued to drive the growth profile of this product line much higher.

They are also the higher margin products in the company, some of our newest technologies, And, they, as I mentioned, will drive the margin profile of the company higher as they grow. Pet care is the largest product in that product line. And, yeah, this year, it's been a bit of a slower year for the market in total, and I think you'll see that across any of the producers or with that commentary. And I think that's driven some higher competitive activity some discounting that's been going on that we've been working our way through. So with that, what I'll I've answered the other products.

D.J., why don't you take us to the pet care and give us a little idea of the dynamics going on there? Yeah. Sure. Glad to. For the question, Mike.

D.J. Monagle: So let's kinda peel back the onion a little bit on what we're seeing in the pet care market. Little surprised to see the sequential drop that we saw in the quarter. It's not uncommon for the second quarter to be a little bit lighter than the first, but we saw a 2% drop in that market, and it particularly hit private label sector. Doug was mentioned some discounts and just give you a flavor of the discounts that we're seeing, done by the major brands, in a normal year, you're seeing, you know, 15 to 20% of those major brands sell on deal. This year, they're still up in the 20 to 30%.

We're starting to see some mitigation on that So we're expecting the shift to private label to start improving a little bit. But the market has still been down. And against that down, we've kind of held our own, not bragging about it, but just that gives you some perspective on that. So let's talk about then what's what's going on in that context. On the pet side, our you know, we enable our private label partners to execute their strategy. And what we're doing lately with them is quite a bit of brand refresh and promotions.

So that brand refresh can be as simple as new placements increased volumes that our partners wanna put and display differently in the shelves, but they also could be as complicated as product refreshes, which could just be a label change but could also be a reinvigoration of the of the whole product line. That would include some things like new products, which would be, in our case, it's what we're promoting is some lightweight litter products and some other things that have to do with the kind of a under the clean hygiene theme. So those promotions are ongoing now. We expect to see a some better growth in that pet care market going forward.

And then I guess, on top of that, as Doug was mentioning, the capital investments that we're doing, towards the beginning of the fourth quarter, a little bit in the third quarter, you're gonna start seeing an increase in China as we bring that new facility online for us. So that's that's the backdrop for pet care that we've got going on. The other element that Erik had mentioned We did a major rework, a major optimization of our footprint in The US And we also made some refinements to our Netherlands facility.

These changes will allow us to improve the productivity, better enabling us to meet some promotions, but it also expands our capability to meet some requests we've got for customers in different channels on new grades, new products. So we're pretty enthused about that. That's the pet care story, and I guess I just wanna I guess, pile on to the other side of the equation. In that household personal care line

Doug Dietrich: Big investment

D.J. Monagle: coming online early in 2026 to meet to continue to meet. The demands of this fast growing bleaching earth product that is helping purify the plant-based fuels and plant-based oils that include sustainable aviation. Sustainable aviation is the primary pull that we're seeing from there. We also have got some really good projects going on, especially in the Fabric Care line, where we're introducing some new products to help the macro trends of better washing, in a cold water environment with those folks So overall, we feel really good about the that part of the product line within the segment.

Still think pet care is on track to be a $500 million plus business feeling really good about the specialties growth trajectory, especially as embodied by

Operator: bleaching our

D.J. Monagle: animal health Fabric Care, and the personal care products. Hope that helps.

Mike Harrison: Oh, very helpful. Thanks for all that additional color. I wanted to switch over to engineered solutions. The operating income you guys had kind of given a range there. In terms of guidance for the second quarter, and it looks like you came in pretty nicely ahead of those expectations. So can you talk about some of the key drivers of that better operating income performance in Q2? And I guess just looking at your overall guidance, seems like even though you expect a similar quarter in Q3, the op income guide is a little bit lower. So is that is that an engineered solutions step back that we should be expecting in operating income?

Erik Aldag: Yeah. Mike, This is Erik. Thanks for the question. So yeah, I think from an engineered solutions perspective, they performed very well in the second quarter. Productivities were very strong. The supply chain teams, in particular, have done a really nice job managing input costs for us. Know, we mentioned that tariffs a huge direct impact for us. But the supply chain team in engineered solutions in particular has done a really nice job mitigating that impact for us. So margins, probably a little bit better than we guided to the second quarter in that segment. I think in terms of what we're looking at for the third quarter guidance, as I mentioned, we have upside to that number.

I think what you're hearing from us is there is still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what's going on with macro end markets. And potential impacts on our customers. But I would say you know, things continue to play out and continue to be relatively stable. We can do a similar level of margin performance in the third quarter. We are facing some slightly higher tariff costs in the third quarter, but we are confident that we're gonna be able to mitigate that what I would give you in terms of the color for the third quarter. Yeah, Mike. The only thing I would add is with this

Doug Dietrich: this product line, this segment's performing really well. I think they're doing as Erik mentioned, all the things they've got. This is where the tariffs sit mostly in the company, and I and they are, you know, having to navigate that. They have a heavier load in the third quarter, which we're confident we'll do. So there's some there's some uncertainty there. But know, this is these margins are not you know, they've been moving this direction for a while now and it's it is it is part of the strategy. It's these it's our higher tech, you know, green sand bond solutions It's growing the business in underserved regions.

These Minscan units, which then come with kind of contracts for refractories, but then also there are new formulations that we're using that have, you know, good performance, which help us with a higher margin capture. So there's a number of different things that are going on. And, yeah, the steel market in Europe is pretty weak right now. We got this tariff load. So think we're being a little bit middle of the road here. But, yes, I think there's some upside and I think even further margin expansion in this business long term. Alright. Sounds good. Last question for me. The balance sheet's in pretty good

Lydia Kopylova: shape.

Doug Dietrich: It was 2021 when you guys last did a more

Mike Harrison: sizable acquisition. I was hoping you could talk about your capacity and your appetite for a larger or more transformative deal given that there are some potential targets out there, including some targets that you may have looked at in the past?

Doug Dietrich: Well, M and A has always been a piece of the growth strategy for the company. You know, we've executed fairly regularly on acquisitions over the past five years. I think we've done four of them. The balance sheet's in good shape. Liquidity position's in good shape. I think you know, we have a nice portfolio of things that we're looking at. Mike. I think they are you know, there's some larger things that we would consider and I think there's also some bolt ons that give us a faster penetration in regions or they bolt on to some of these higher margin products. In the consumer space. So I think there's a number of things that

Mike Harrison: that we would

Doug Dietrich: that we would consider. I think, you know, we look at these things obviously very carefully. We model them with the appropriate level of risk and concern and we make sure that we know exactly what we're going to do with it if we were to get it. And so, we take a very measured approach to it. But I think the balance sheet's in good shape if, if something were to become actionable. That's what I can give you.

Mike Harrison: Alright. Thanks very much. The next question is from Dan Moore with

Operator: CJS Securities. Please go ahead.

Will: Hey. This is Will on for Dan.

Erik Aldag: Can you add some more color to the schedule for new PCC satellites, including new yield? Coming online in, the second half and into 2026.

Doug Dietrich: Sure. We'll outline that for you. D.J., do you wanna some details? Had what I mentioned, Will, was we have three new satellites and one expansion coming online in the next seven to eight months. Two of those two of those satellites are for packaging. In Asia. One of them is a is a kind of what we call our base PCC paper. Then another expansion, and D.J. can give you more details on what they are and where they are.

D.J. Monagle: Yeah. Well, so just as a baseline for you, we're we're gonna be we started a plan earlier this year to the in the neighborhood of 60,000 tons. We're still seeing that to ramp up a little bit. That's that's not quite at full capacity yet. In the third quarter, we'll be seeing two more satellites come on. One of them is the expansion to which Doug was referring. That's in India. And that'll come online pretty quickly. The other one is a new yield facility in China. So that'll be coming on, and we'll seeing the impact of that towards the second half of this year.

As we go into next year, we've got another packaging facility that will actually have a combination of products. One is NewYield, but the other one is our satellite GCC. It's a new to MTI technology. That we've been getting a lot of market pull for. So that'll be coming on towards the end of the first quarter as well as a another site that we've got in China that'll be coming on in and that would be a printing and writing site that'll be coming on in China towards the end of that first quarter. So and that one is it's about 60,000 ton sort of ballpark. Thank you. That's super helpful. And then looking at refractories,

Erik Aldag: could you add some more color to the outlook for steel production for the remainder of the year?

Doug Dietrich: And then secondly, where are we in terms of penetration of mini can Miniscan systems, The US and Europe. Sure. Brett Rodriguez, wanna take that one? Sure. Sure, Doug. Thanks, Will. The US steel penetration the second quarter actually saw capacity utilization rates reached the highest level since Q3 of twenty four. So it's that high 70, 78% range. Steel prices seem to be stable. Flat rolls over $900 a ton. So pretty stable

Brett Argirakis: market right now in North America. The service center's inventory has come down to around fifty five days. That's a pretty that usually when you get into the mid fifties, it seems like it keeps a pretty consistent steel production. So overall, US is doing really well. That it's benefiting our refractory business. From the European side, of course, as Doug mentioned, the European market is it still remains really, really low Their efforts converting to green steel technology has slowed. That means going from integrated steel or basic oxygen furnace to electric furnace. That's slowed. Just because of the market.

And the Turkey and Middle East market, which we as part of we work as part of our European group is it has also slowed. So from a market standpoint, pretty really good market for us in North America. And much suppressed market in Europe. So overall, it's it's pretty it's stable for our business. As far as the MIN scans go, you know, as Doug also mentioned, these MIN scans provide us with a really custom application for our customers. It improves safety, and it improves the efficiencies their operation and allows their furnaces to run longer. By extending the refractory life. In 2025 for this year, we signed eight agreements. We installed one in the first half.

The remaining will be in the second half. Possibly into the first quarter, but our target is to get the rest of them tied in. This year. Over the past few years, we've had 17 MIN scans or scan controls which include the laser and the camera. Installed to date. Two of those were in Turkey, and the remaining were in North America. And we're happy to say that we signed our first agreement in Austria that'll go in sometime in the first quarter of next year. So we're excited about that, moving that technology to Europe. So there is there's still a very sufficient runway to add more of these units. There's plenty of electric furnaces out there.

Both in North America and Europe So we're not gonna give up. We're gonna continue to pursue them. Both North America, Europe, and Japan as well. So I hope that helps.

Will: Thank you.

Operator: The next question is from Pete Osterland with SunTrust. Please go ahead.

Pete Osterland: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just wanted to ask one on the Pet Care business. Just given the increased competitive activity you've referenced, are you having to lower prices there in order to increase momentum in your order book? And is that a potential source of margin pressure in CNS in the second half until you know, you see a more meaningful pickup for demand?

Doug Dietrich: Yeah. I think there's, you know, promotional activity is you know, generally a pricing issue. It's either, you know, similar prices, higher sizes, or more weight. Two for ones, those types of things. What we're doing is working with, as D.J. we're working with our customer. You know, they own the brand and so it's their decision as to how they wanna put it on the shelf and price it. But we're helping them with you know, those packaging solutions, the labeling, yes, we could help them with some pricing actions a little bit in this quarter to with that promotional activity.

What that does is that, you know, make sure that we maintain and help them maintain that value proposition and that value gap between the branded product and the private label. And ensure that there is that value seen on the shelf, and that tends to pull more pull more of their product, I e, our product off the shelf. So yes, we're working on all of those, and there has been some pricing. That's been through that. But as D.J. mentioned, we expect that some of this promotional activity in the market marketplace in general to go back to more normal levels. We make sure that we keep our private label kind of value proposition.

I think longer term, we see that private label is gonna continue to grow. It's not just in North America and in Europe, but also in Asia. We see, you know, positive fundamentals for the pet litter market in general. Globally. We're investing in that growth. As we mentioned, with investing in our expanding of facility in a new facility actually in Asia, that's going to double the size of our business. In Asia. And I think that's just the beginning because that is a much higher growth rate area. So as we start there, you're going to see that adding to the growth rate of the business. Long term.

So hopefully that helps you with both short term kind of actions and long term dynamics.

Pete Osterland: Peter. Yes. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then wanted to ask one on talc as well. I guess, is there anything you can share on the time frame for a final resolution or any meaningful upcoming dates to be aware of and just kind of as a follow on question to that, is there a timeframe within which it needs to be resolved in order for the reserve that you've established to be sufficient?

Doug Dietrich: Well, first I can't give you know, solid answer on the timing. These are it's quite dynamic and it's determined by a number of different items in terms of courts and court dates. Regarding the reserve, it's sufficient. It is a sufficient reserve and it's we find it sufficient. There's no timestamp on that. We find that is the liability that we see for resolving this. Look, I think you know, what I can give you in terms of over the past ninety days that's happened, a couple of significant items, There's a hearing in the May, about May 14, where the bankruptcy court referred had a hearing and referred a key factual question in the case.

To a federal district court, and that was, you know, to determine whether BMI old co, Calc contained asbestos. You know, that's a relative positive development for us because we've always maintained that BMI old co has always maintained that its talc was safe and free of asbestos. And so there is a forum by which, you know, that can be determined. At the same time, we're still BMI is waiting for that kind of next steps in that hearing. And while we wait, you know, we're waiting on clarity. We're still working and hope that a consensual plan can be developed.

We're we're working through we've always been open to a plan, and we feel that the reserve is sufficient to that end. But, you know, there's two steps here. One through the district court and showing that our TELC has been BMI's TELC has been free of asbestos and then also working on developing a consensual plan. So that's gonna take some time. We're open to both avenues, but I can't give you a time frame when that'll be concluded.

Pete Osterland: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, Doug.

Doug Dietrich: Yep.

Operator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug Dietrich for any closing remarks.

Doug Dietrich: Well, everyone, really appreciate you joining the call today. Again, thank you for the questions. Hopefully, it was informative and we look forward to talking to you after the third quarter in October. Alright? Take care till then.",https://cdn.content.foolcdn.com/images/1umn9qeh/production/b4204f36ed605fc54d4ba32e2cb31d1dd892afd6-800x450.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 16:56:16.176480

Eastman Chemical is evaluating its options after the Department of Energy (DOE) removed financial support for its planned polyethylene terephthalate recycling plant in Longview, Texas, earlier this year. The plant would be the firm’s second to use its methanolysis process to break down the polymer into its raw materials, dimethyl terephthalate and ethylene glycol. The first one started up in Kingsport, Tennessee, in 2024. In May, the DOE announced that it was pulling its $375 million in awards for the project originally granted during the Joe Biden administration. On Aug. 1, Eastman CEO Mark Costa told analysts that his company is engaging with DOE to reinstate the grants. However, Eastman is also looking at changing the scope of the project, originally estimated to cost $1.2 billion, as well as evaluating alternative locations. The firm also says that it has identified improvement projects that can expand the existing Kingsport plant by about 30% or more.

Chemours, DuPont, Corteva settle PFAS claims with New Jersey

The chemical makers Chemours, DuPont, and Corteva have agreed to pay $875 million over 25 years to settle all claims by the state of New Jersey related to contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). DuPont developed or made many products in the state that contained PFAS, including nonstick and waterproof coatings, lubricants, and firefighting foams. The company spun off Chemours, which currently runs its former PFAS business, in 2015. Corteva, which includes agricultural assets from DuPont and Dow, took on some of DuPont’s liabilities when it was formed in 2019. Under the terms of a 2021 agreement between the three firms, Chemours will pay half the settlement, DuPont 35.5%, and Corteva 14.5%. Most of the settlement relates to contamination at four current or former DuPont sites in New Jersey: Chambers Works, Parlin, Pompton Lakes, and Repauno. The companies have also agreed to clean up contamination at the sites, bringing the total value of the agreement to more than $2 billion, according to New Jersey’s department of law and public safety. Previous settlements by the three companies include a 2024 deal with water utilities for about $1.2 billion, a 2023 agreement with Ohio for $110 million, and a 2021 pact with Delaware for $50 million.—MICHAEL MCCOY

Bayer aims to register new herbicide

Bayer has submitted applications in Brazil, the European Union, Canada, and the US for the approval of a new herbicide, icafolin-methyl. Bayer says the chemical offersthe first new mode of action for postemergent weed control for broadacre crops in over 30 years. Bayer expects icafolin-methyl to become available in 2028, first in Brazil and then in other markets. Bayer says the product will kill weeds at a low dose, making it suitable for targeted applications and reducing its environmental impacts. The company expects farmers to use icafolin-methyl in combination with existing herbicides to combat the growing problem of herbicide resistance. The molecule will be used on soy, cereals, pulses, and oil seed crops, and some specialty crops. Instead of completely eliminating weeds, icafolin-methyl freezes their growth, and the dead weeds remain in the field afterward. In 2021, FMC introduced tetflupyrolimet, an herbicide with a new mode of action for rice crops.—MATT BLOIS

Fertiglobe delays low-carbon ammonia in UAE

Fertiglobe, the nitrogen fertilizer arm of Abu Dhabi National Oil, is delaying a low-carbon ammonia project that it has been planning for the United Arab Emirates. The company intended to make a final investment decision this year for Project Rabdan, which would make 1 million metric tons per year of ammonia from hydrogen produced from natural gas in an autothermal reformer. The carbon dioxide emissions would then be captured and stored. “The global low-carbon ammonia market remains in the early stages of development, with regulatory frameworks and demand signals continuing to evolve,” the company says in its most recent earnings report.—ALEX TULLO

Solidec raises cash for low-carbon chemical production

The Houston-based start-up Solidec has raised $2 million in preseed funding to advance its approach to producing chemicals using water, electricity, and carbon sources such as captured carbon dioxide. Investors include the venture capital firm New Climate Ventures and Chevron Technology Ventures. Solidec was spun off last year from the lab of Rice University chemical and biomolecular engineering professor Haotian Wang, who developed the porous solid electrolyte reactors that are at the firm’s core. The company says its first product will be hydrogen peroxide, though its technology can also be used to make ethylene, acetic acid, and formic acid. One feature of the technology, Solidec says, is the ability to eliminate energy-intensive post-processing separation steps.—MICHAEL MCCOY

As a further cost-cutting measure, Haltermann will shut its administrative office in the UK.—AAYUSHI PRATAP

Trump pressures drug companies over pricing

President Donald J. Trump is leaning on Big Pharma firms to implement a new drug-pricing policy he put forward in May. Trump sent letters to 17 major manufacturers, including AbbVie, Bristol Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, and Sanofi, pressuring them to bring their medication costs in line with prices paid in other high-income countries by Sept. 29. If they do not, the US “will deploy every tool in our arsenal to protect American families from continued abusive drug pricing practices,” the letters read. Leerink Partners stock analysts wrote in a July 31 research note that the demands were “unachievable.”—ROWAN WALRATH

A year later, this goal was reaffirmed by the 2,500 delegates from 184 member states and 57 organizations of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
These included introducing new technologies that would enter service in the 2035-2040 timeframe, making operational and infrastructure improvements, warranting market-based offsets leveraging other sectors, and relying more on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF.
But it will be up to consumers to influence government mandates, support environmental issues and, in the end, pay for the transition to a cleaner aviation future.
The 2050 target was established to accelerate the technology to support the aviation sustainability transition, but even if it isn’t met that year, the transition to a cleaner aviation future is clear.","The aviation industry is making progress toward its goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, but there are growing concerns it will fall behind as the political winds shift.

At the 2021 annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association, IATA member airlines passed a resolution committing them to the goal. At the time, the industry noted that achieving net-zero would require the coordinated efforts of the entire industry — from airlines to airports to air navigation service providers and manufacturers — as well as significant government policy and financial support. A year later, this goal was reaffirmed by the 2,500 delegates from 184 member states and 57 organizations of the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The Waypoint 2050 report, published by the Air Transport Action Group in 2021, laid out paths to reach net-zero by 2050 with a combination of measures. These included introducing new technologies that would enter service in the 2035-2040 timeframe, making operational and infrastructure improvements, warranting market-based offsets leveraging other sectors, and relying more on sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Since publication, the industry has added replacement of the fleet with more fuel-efficient airliners as a fifth measure.

But this flagship goal is now in peril due to climate-skeptic policies, including those of U.S. President Donald Trump. The election of leaders favoring fossil fuels and recent regulatory rollbacks is “obviously a setback” and “does imperil success on the 2050 horizon,” Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president for sustainability, said in June at IATA’s industry conference in India.

“But I don’t think it’s going to halt or reverse progress. I think it will just slow progress,” she added.

IATA has also warned that the industry is falling behind on a nearer-term goal related to the net-zero target: The European Commission decreed a mandatory usage of 6% SAF for airlines operating in the European Union by 2030, but IATA says that is now unreachable.

A huge issue is that SAF producers are not ramping up production to meet the scale of the industry’s demand, producing only about 1% of global jet fuel demand today. At these rates, SAF is significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and major oil companies haven’t invested sufficiently in SAF production facilities, hindering market growth and keeping SAF prices uncompetitive. For example, oil giant BP announced in February that it would be join Shell and other energy companies by investing less in renewables. CEO Murray Auchincloss said the company had gone “too far, too fast” in transitioning away from fossil fuels, BBC reported, and called the faith in green energy “misplaced.”

At the government level, Trump’s signature legislative package signed last month took aim at assistance and rebates for renewable energy projects. However, the law also extended the Clean Fuel Production Credit through 2031. Known as 45Z, this credit applies to SAF and non-SAF biofuels and provides a per-gallon tax credit dependent upon the emissions factor of the fuel. The financial competitor to SAF remains the low cost of oil, which would need to top $80 a barrel for SAF to remain cost competitive.

Despite these challenges, there have also been signs of progress toward the decarbonization goal. Delta Air Lines increased its capacity by 5% last year compared to 2019 but used less jet fuel, a first for the airline. It saved 44 million gallons of jet fuel and roughly $110 million. Delta credited that to flight improvements, including more efficient routes.

Also on the operations side, a new air traffic control system announced by the FAA is meant to simplify routing and modernize the airspace to provide more efficient flights. Airports are also moving to bolster sustainability. Los Angeles International Airport exceeded its 2025 goal to have a 15% reduction in energy use per passenger and met the 2023 aim to have a 20% zero emissions bus fleet. Also, Denver International Airport is home to one of the largest and most diversified solar energy programs of any airport in the world.

Fleet renewal is an integral part of many airlines’ sustainability and economic plans. Newer aircraft models are designed with more advanced technology, which directly translates to reduced fuel consumption and lower carbon emissions. For example, the Airbus A320neo is estimated to be 15-20% more fuel-efficient than its predecessor, while the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Airbus A350 can offer up to 25% better fuel efficiency than previous models.

Fuel is a major operating expense for airlines, so transitioning to these newer, more fuel-efficient designs can help reduce their operating costs, making them more financially and environmentally sustainable. American Airlines, for example, operates the youngest mainline fleet in the U.S. and has improved fuel efficiency by 9.8% compared with 2013, based on fuel burn per available seat mile, avoiding 22.9 million metric tons of CO2.

There is also progress on the technology front. Several entities are continuing to pursue electrification, new engine configurations, investigations of hydrogen as a fuel, and unconventional aircraft configurations. For instance, California startup JetZero, in conjunction with the U.S. Air Force, is developing a blended-wing cargo demonstrator that the company also intends to market as an efficient airliner, while ZeroAvia has signed agreements with multiple airlines to retrofit their existing aircraft with the company’s hydrogen-electric engines. Pratt & Whitney, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy, last year tested its Hydrogen Steam Injected Intercooled Turbine Engine concept, which reduces NOx emissions normally associated with burning carbon-free hydrogen in a turbine engine.

Yet, these new technologies will not be making any significant impact on carbon emissions early enough to impact the 2050 goals. And technology projects that were slated to be in service by 2035 have seen recent setbacks. Airbus has revised the timeline for its ZEROe hydrogen aircraft, which would have contributed to meeting the total emissions target. The airframer is also working on an A320 family short-to-medium-range replacement but has deferred service entry to the second half of the next decade. Boeing in April announced it was pausing work on the X-66A transonic truss-braced wing demonstrator it was developing with NASA and industry. The French-Italian manufacturer ATR has delayed the launch of a hybrid-electric version of its ATR 72 turboprops, known as EVO, by at least five years. Alexis Vidal, ATR’s senior vice president commercial, told Flight Global in February that the work with its engine partners led the airframer to conclude that “with the maturity of the technologies we cannot commit to an imminent launch decision. We have to adapt and face reality about what’s feasible and what’s not.”

Such delays may be discouraging to net-zero proponents. Even so, short-term economics will drive efficiencies and development of lower-cost substitutions over the next decades. But it will be up to consumers to influence government mandates, support environmental issues and, in the end, pay for the transition to a cleaner aviation future.

In just over a decade, it has significantly expanded its renewable energy capacity to reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Today, over 98 percent of Uruguay’s electricity is generated from hydro, wind, solar, and biomass. This was driven by focused public policy, the attraction of private capital, and a consistent commitment to long-term energy security. With this foundation in place, Uruguay is now taking steps toward deeper decarbonization through smart grid modernization and the buildout of a green hydrogen and e-fuels economy. Moreover, in the next five years, Uruguay is expected to receive historic investment in offshore oil and gas exploration, including seismic studies and exploratory drilling, as part of a broader effort to assess the country’s deepwater hydrocarbon potential.

ELECTRICITY MATRIX & GRID INFRASTRUCTURE

Uruguay’s electrical grid is centrally managed by UTE, the state-owned electric utility. The system is fully interconnected nationwide and equipped with smart grid features, including advanced metering and fiber-optic communications. Hydropower from major dams—Salto Grande (shared with Argentina), Rincón del Bonete, and Baygorria—provides reliable, on-demand power. These natural storage systems reduce the urgency of deploying large-scale battery storage, though complementary technologies are being explored for industrial and residential use.

Uruguay’s modern grid infrastructure, supported by over 90% broadband penetration and extensive fiber-optic deployment, creates strong potential for smart grid technologies, predictive maintenance, and real-time grid optimization. Projects involving intelligent metering, automation, and data analytics are underway and receiving support from multilateral financing institutions such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).

At the same time, Uruguay faces a growing need to increase and modernize its high-voltage transmission infrastructure. As large-scale hydrogen and e-fuels projects are announced—many in remote areas with limited existing grid capacity—reinforcing and expanding the electricity transmission lines becomes critical. Strengthening the transmission network will be essential to evacuate new generation capacity efficiently, ensure grid reliability, and unlock the full potential of upcoming green hydrogen and e-fuels initiatives.

BATTERY STORAGE & SMART GRID

Battery and smart grid solutions are gaining traction as Uruguay moves toward full decarbonization. While hydropower reduces immediate needs, the growing scale of renewable power and e-fuels initiatives are pushing investment in flexible storage. Tax incentives under Uruguay’s Investment Promotion Law are drawing interest in smart infrastructure and energy storage when integrated with clean generation projects.

HYDROGEN and E-FUELS INITIATIVES

Due to its highly decarbonized energy sector with strong wind and solar capacity, Uruguay is expected to become a leading country in the region in the development of e-fuels – synthetic fuels that are produced using renewable energy. The country’s Green Hydrogen Roadmap, led by the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining (MIEM), targets 20 GW of additional renewable generation and 10 GW of electrolyzers by 2040. Major hydrogen initiatives are moving forward. The H2U Offshore Project, spearheaded by ANCAP, is preparing to auction up to 16 offshore blocks for wind-to-hydrogen production. The HIF Global facility in Paysandú, a $6 billion investment, aims to produce 256 million liters of e-fuels annually while adding 2,000 MW of new wind and solar. Northern Uruguay will host the Tambor Hub, a hybrid plant producing hydrogen and methanol for export, developed by Germany’s Enertrag and local firm SEG Ingeniería. A pilot-scale station—H24U—is also advancing with public support and private capital. Meanwhile, Kahirós, a fully private venture, will supply hydrogen fuel for industrial transport in Fray Bentos, targeting a production of 75.8 tons of hydrogen per year. The U.S. company Syzygy Plasmonics has announced a pioneering project in Uruguay to develop one of the world’s first fully electrified biogas-to-sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plants. Powered entirely by renewable electricity, the facility will convert cow manure and captured CO₂ into jet fuel. This first-of-its-kind deployment combines circular feedstocks, cutting-edge light-driven catalyst technology, and an ultra-low carbon footprint, positioning Uruguay at the forefront of next-generation clean fuel innovation.

The path ahead is not without obstacles. The capital intensity of electrolyzers and storage systems, environmental constraints, an evolving regulatory landscape, and the cost-competitiveness gap between hydrogen and fossil fuels all require attention. However, the opportunities are clear. Uruguay is positioned to become a regional supplier of green hydrogen and synthetic fuels. Its modern, digitally enabled grid supports this ambition. A growing domestic market for hydrogen mobility and favorable tax treatment under the country’s investment framework are also accelerating development.

U.S. companies have a competitive edge in this market. Providers of smart grid hardware and software, residential and industrial battery systems, electrolyzer technologies, and hydrogen logistics services will find demand. Opportunities also exist for project developers and engineering firms in wind and solar infrastructure.

OIL & GAS

Uruguay is actively pursuing offshore oil exploration. The discovery of oil and gas in Namibia in early 2022 renewed the interest of international companies in Uruguay’s territorial waters due to their geological similarities. The state-owned energy company ANCAP has awarded seven contracts to major international energy firms for oil and gas prospecting in all 120,000 square kilometers of Uruguay’s offshore waters, generating over $200 million in investments. Seismic data acquisition commenced in 2025, with exploratory drilling operations planned for 2026. The exploration period is expected to span four years and could be extended by an additional two or four years, depending on each company’s fulfillment of its commitments.

Nevertheless, the Mexico–Colombia trade relationship remains a strategic pillar of regional economic integration.","Mexico and Colombia share a longstanding and strategic trade relationship that has evolved significantly over the past three decades. As two of the largest and most dynamic economies in Latin America, both countries have leveraged shared values, institutional frameworks, and regional integration efforts to deepen economic cooperation. Their trade relationship is not only bilateral but also embedded in broader frameworks such as the Pacific Alliance, a regional bloc that includes Chile and Peru and promotes free trade and economic integration among its members.

At the core of the Mexico–Colombia trade relationship is the Mexico–Colombia Free Trade Agreement, originally signed in 1994 under the umbrella of the G3 agreement (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela). After Venezuela’s withdrawal in 2006, the agreement continued as a bilateral treaty, covering trade in goods and services, investment protection, and dispute resolution mechanisms. This agreement laid the groundwork for tariff elimination and regulatory harmonization, fostering a steady increase in trade flows.

Trade between the two countries is balanced and complementary, reflecting the structure of their economies. Mexico exports industrial and manufactured goods to Colombia, including vehicles, electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals, and plastics. In return, Colombia exports commodities and processed goods to Mexico, such as coal, coffee, crude oil, flowers, and textiles. This complementary exchange has allowed both countries to benefit from comparative advantages and to strengthen supply chains across sectors.

Similar Economies

Colombia is the fourth-largest economy in Latin America by gross domestic product and the third-largest in South America. In 2023, its top exports were predominantly commodity-based, including crude petroleum, coal briquettes, gold, coffee, and refined petroleum. Although Colombia has seen notable growth in modern industries such as electronics, shipbuilding, tourism, and construction since the early 2000s, its export portfolio remains highly concentrated in primary goods. As Latin America's second-largest producer of domestically made electronics and appliances, following Mexico, Colombia has demonstrated industrial potential, though further diversification remains a key policy priority.

The country has upheld macroeconomic stability through robust institutions, including an inflation-targeting regime, flexible exchange rates, and prudent fiscal rules. However, Colombia's economic performance has been constrained by stagnant productivity growth over the past two decades, limiting its convergence with advanced economies and perpetuating geographic and social inequalities. Key structural barriers include limited global trade integration, infrastructure deficits, and a need for a more equitable and investment-friendly tax system.

Economic growth rebounded modestly in 2024 to 1.7%, after a weaker performance of 0.7% in 2023, driven by consumption and easing inflation. Poverty declined slightly to 31.3%, though regional disparities remain stark. Looking ahead, Colombia’s economy is projected to grow by 2.4% in 2025 and potentially reach a 2.9% growth rate by 2027. Realizing this outlook will depend on greater investment, policy clarity, and a gradual but fiscally responsible shift toward a diversified, climate-resilient economy.

Bilateral trade

In 2024, Mexico’s top exports to Colombia were monitors and projectors totaling US$310 million. These exports primarily originated from Mexico City (US$754 million), the State of Mexico (US$414 million), and Baja California (US$279 million). In April 2025 alone, Mexico continued to export monitors and projectors as the leading product, amounting to US$28.3 million. During the same month, the main sources of exports to Colombia were Mexico City (US$62.3 million), the State of Mexico (US$33.7 million), and Jalisco (US$19 million).

Mexico’s main imports from Colombia in 2024 were coal products, briquettes, ovoids, and similar solid fuels made from coal, reaching US$611 million. The leading destinations for these imports were Mexico City (US$1.44 billion), the State of Mexico (US$314 million), and Nuevo Leon (US$135 million).

Foreign direct investment (FDI) from Colombia to Mexico totaled US$88.9 million in 2024, composed of profit reinvestments (US$61.5 million), intercompany accounts (US$18.5 million), and new investments (US$8.86 million). From January 1999 to December 2024, cumulative FDI from Colombia reached US$2.35 billion, distributed among new investments (US$1.57 billion), profit reinvestments (US$443 million), and intercompany accounts (US$338 million).

In 2024, the states receiving the largest share of Colombian FDI were Mexico City (US$39.4 million), the State of Mexico (US$13.9 million), and Nuevo Leon (US$13.3 million). Historically, these three states have also attracted the highest levels of Colombian investment since 1999: Mexico City (US$1.4 billion), the State of Mexico (US$242 million), and Nuevo Leon (US$105 million).

In recent years, Mexico has become one of Colombia’s top trading partners in Latin America. Mexican foreign direct investment (FDI) in Colombia has also increased steadily, with major Mexican firms such as Bimbo, Cemex, Grupo Salinas, América Móvil, and Gruma establishing operations in Colombia across sectors such as telecommunications, food processing, construction materials, and finance. Conversely, Colombian companies like Grupo Éxito and Alpina have invested in Mexico, particularly in retail and consumer goods.

Regional Cooperation

Both countries are committed to strengthening institutional and regulatory cooperation through the Pacific Alliance, a platform that facilitates not only trade liberalization but also the mobility of capital and people. The Alliance has allowed for the accumulation of origin, simplified customs procedures, and greater coordination in areas such as innovation, education, and climate policy.

Despite this positive trajectory, there are challenges. Non-tariff barriers, bureaucratic obstacles, and asymmetric access to financing continue to affect trade flows, especially for SMEs. Moreover, shifting political dynamics, especially related to trade protectionism or domestic industrial policy, can introduce uncertainty into bilateral relations.

Nevertheless, the Mexico–Colombia trade relationship remains a strategic pillar of regional economic integration. As both countries navigate global shifts, such as nearshoring, energy transition, and the digital economy, there is significant room to deepen economic ties through innovation, infrastructure development, and joint ventures in strategic sectors. Enhanced cooperation in sectors like clean energy, fintech, and agribusiness could further position Mexico and Colombia as complementary partners within a more integrated and competitive Latin American market.

The recent high-level meeting between Foreign Ministers Juan Ramón de la Fuente and Laura Sarabia signals a renewed commitment to strategic collaboration across multiple fronts, from economic development and migration policy to environmental protection and regional integration. Their agreement to modernize the Memorandum of Understanding and convene the IV Meeting of the Strategic Relationship Council underscores a proactive agenda aimed at addressing contemporary challenges such as inequality, transnational crime, and climate change through joint action.

The expansion of Mexico’s social programs into Colombia, along with Colombia’s interest in replicating Mexican infrastructure strategies, demonstrates how bilateral ties are deepening not only through trade and investment but also through social and institutional exchange. Furthermore, both countries are aligning diplomatically within multilateral frameworks like CELAC and the Pacific Alliance, reinforcing their leadership in the region.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/colombia-flag-pins-and-red-thread-for-traveling-an-2025-03-09-21-32-21-utc%20%281%29.jpg?h=8e4ab5ce&itok=ueaZdJNJ,N,,2025-08-05 19:56:32.848304

During a quarterly earnings call on August 4, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard mentioned an anticipated vote on a new RFS and its potential impact its use of corn or soybeans in poultry feed. Howard said it was her understanding that the proposed RSF that is focused on biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel “could be very meaningful,” in that it could lead to increased corn prices, but a decrease in soybean meal prices.

With that in mind, Howard asked if Tyson would be “able to significantly shift the mix of feed into soybean meal to take advantage of that over the next couple of years, or is it a fairly fixed ratio?

“It’s a fairly fixed ratio in terms of trying to get the carbs and the protein in,” said King.

“We’ve used different carb sources at times, but we’re looking at the entire caloric intake, per ton, and I don’t see any significant change in that.”

King added that at the present time, Tyson Foods is expecting grain prices to remain “very steady,” and that there is a potentially strong corn crop about to get underway in the United States.

“So, all the thought processes around why you might make a substitution, I don’t think will come into play at this point,” said King.

The question concerning poultry feed formulation came during the same earnings call in which King announced a strong performance for its chicken business segment.

For the most recent quarter, which ended on June 28, Tyson Foods reported an operating income of $367 million for its chicken segment, which was a meaningful improvement from the $244 million reported for the same period one year ago.

DEFENDING REORGANIZATION PLANS Vaden vigorously defended the Trump administration's reorganization plan that includes closing the South Building, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and two other facilities.
President Trump, he noted, promised to move the bureaucracy out of Washington and USDA is fulfilling that promise.
Vaden urged the sugar industry to take an active role in the Brazil investigation.
Vaden noted the International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on Brazil in September and urged the sugar growers to show up in person at that hearing.","TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (DTN) -- The top officials who run the U.S. sugar program will stay in Washington after the Trump administration reorganizes the Agriculture Department, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden told DTN on Monday.

After giving a speech to the American Sugar Alliance's International Sweetener Symposium in Traverse City, Michigan, Vaden said in a brief interview top officials would stay in Washington but officials who implement the program may be in the five hubs where USDA intends to move 2,600 of the 4,600 positions now in the Washington area.

He pointed out 2,000 USDA employees will remain in the Washington area and said farmers who come to Washington fly-ins will have plenty of officials to meet.

During the speech, Vaden said, ""USDA remains committed to operating our sugar program at no cost to the taxpayers, and we're focused on preventing forfeitures at all costs.""

""And that's why every action that we're taking is within the 'America first' and 'farmers first' philosophy.

""You saw a taste of that a little earlier, when the department announced that we were going to set the tariff rate quota for specialty sugar at the minimum required by our trade agreements, and not one gram more.""

DEFENDING REORGANIZATION PLANS

Vaden vigorously defended the Trump administration's reorganization plan that includes closing the South Building, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and two other facilities.

He repeated previous statements that the facilities to be closed in the Washington area have backlogs of maintenance and it makes no sense for the taxpayers to maintain them. The South Building, he noted, was constructed in the 1930s and has ""nice"" architecture, but it does not fit with USDA's needs today. President Trump, he noted, promised to move the bureaucracy out of Washington and USDA is fulfilling that promise.

Vaden repeated previous statements that the five USDA hubs -- Raleigh, North Carolina; Kansas City, Missouri; Indianapolis, Indiana; Fort Collins, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah -- were chosen because the cost of living is low in those cities, which will allow USDA to attract a younger workforce.

Scientists have complained for years about working conditions at the Beltsville center, he noted, but he added those facilities will be closed over a number of years. No facility engaged in research on cane or beet sugar will be closed, he said.

In a wide-ranging speech, Vaden praised the reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, particularly for making certain tax provisions permanent, including the estate tax.

45Z TAX CREDIT DEBATE

Vaden also praised a provision in the bill that in 2026 restricts the use of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production tax credits to producers from North America.

""It blew my mind when I was a federal judge listening to Secretary Rollins' predecessor explaining why subsidizing Chinese oil producers was a good idea,"" he said.

Former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, he said, ""was the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, not the commissar for the People's Republic of China.""

Vaden seemed to be referring to a speech that Vilsack gave at a Growth Energy Biofuels Summit in September 2024 in which he noted the Chinese had reduced their imports of American agricultural products and conversations about banning imported feedstocks should take into consideration what the reaction might be.

Vilsack told DTN in an email that Vaden's characterization was ""not an accurate description of what I said.""

""Nobody was more supportive of 45Z for American farmers than I was and am,"" Vilsack said.

Vilsack instead asked, ""What is the current status of 45Z and the interim rule we got through the system before I left at USDA and where is the Treasury Guidance on the use of that interim rule to enable our farmers to benefit from SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel)?

""Rather than wasting time and energy taking shots at a prior administration, would it be better for our farmers and producers and the airline industry to use that time to advocate for the Treasury Department to finish the guidance on 45Z?"" Vilsack said.

TARIFFS AND BRAZIL

While some farm leaders have expressed concerns the tariffs President Trump has imposed on other countries will lead them to retaliate by reducing U.S. farm imports, Vaden said Trump's use of tariffs has brought other countries to the negotiating table and the administration also asks what these countries are going to do for American farmers.

Vaden said ""some of the smarter"" countries come to Washington with proposals to buy U.S. farm products.

He noted that, while some of Trump's tariffs have been subject to court challenges because they are based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the administration has launched an unfair trade practices investigation of Brazil under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which is legally secure.

Vaden urged the sugar industry to take an active role in the Brazil investigation.

""I don't have to tell you that when Brazil expands its agricultural footprint, it always comes at the expense of the Amazon rainforest,"" Vaden said.

If harm is found, tariffs do not need to be the only remedy so ""if there are other actions that you and our other friends in the agricultural community believe might be more helpful than tariffs, it is not only entirely appropriate, but it is the time for you to tell us now, when you submit your comments to the Trade Representative's Office of additional remedies that you think could be helpful in regard to our relations with Brazil,"" he said.

Vaden noted the International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on Brazil in September and urged the sugar growers to show up in person at that hearing.

MAHA AND SUGAR

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who chairs the Make America Healthy Again Commission, has called sugar ""poison,"" but Vaden said the update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans ""will focus primarily on protein-rich foods, fruits and vegetables, whole grains.""

He said, ""Added sugars have long been a part of the conversation, but this industry, from the grower to your nutrition teams, have done a phenomenal job in sharing the facts with the necessary policy makers. I want you to keep at what you do.""

e of the things that it's important to keep in mind, is that for everything this administration does, no harm must come to America's farm and rural communities,"" Vaden said.

""The best way that we can ensure Americans are healthy and well taken care of is to ensure that as much as possible of what they eat is grown here in the United States of America. We have the most efficient, the most sustainable, and the safest food supply the world has ever seen.""

Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies.","NOW is the Time to Allow Crop-Based British Bioethanol in the SAF Mandate

by Gaynor Hartnell (Renewable Transport Fuel Association) RTFA calls for the UK’s SAF Mandate to be amended, to make British bioethanol eligible. It should fall within the HEFA cap, i.e. allowing either HEFA or UK crop-based AtJ SAF to be used to fulfil the HEFA cap.

In 2021, in our response to the (first) SAF mandate consultation, we argued that crop based ethanol should become eligible for the SAF mandate when it is no longer required for decarbonising road transport.

We are now in this situation. UK produced bioethanol is no longer required for decarbonising road transport. That is not because electrification has eroded demand, but as a consequence of the Tariff Free Quota carelessly and shockingly handed to the US in the US-UK Trade deal agreed on 8th May this year, and which became law on 30th June. As members will be aware, the TRQ covers 1.4bn litres bioethanol, a volume which corresponds to the demand required for supplying E10.

The previous Government was supportive of this position. In Targeting net zero – next steps for the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation: Government response, dated July 2021, it envisaged that a decline in requirements for road fuel would open up the opportunity for these fuels to be used for SAF production. To quote from page 20 of that document:

“We know we will need renewable fuel for aviation and freight. We need to encourage and support these sectors. We are working closely with industry on how to do this, in particular, on proposals for a sustainable aviation fuel mandate, and plan to publish a consultation on this soon. As a result of such a mandate, over time there will be a transition of the renewable road fuels market over to an aviation one. A decline in renewable road fuel would increase biomass availability in the later 2020s. Both the waste-derived biodiesel feedstocks and the ethanol feedstocks can be used to create aviation fuel, with the appropriate processing technologies. This presents us, and UK industry, an opportunity to push forward the transition of feedstocks currently used for road fuel to other sectors.”",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 13:57:17.806430

The deal involves H2G’s subsidiary, Green Energy Investment Holding Private Limited (GEIH), and A*STAR’s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE).

GEIH specializes in producing green hydrogen and high-value materials by transforming waste biomass. The partnership aims to commercialize a proprietary process developed by A*STAR IMRE to purify biochar into high-quality hard carbon. This material is mainly used as anodes in sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, which are vital for energy storage, electric vehicles, and electronics.

Following the agreement, GEIH and A*STAR will scale up the biochar purification process to produce hard carbon for sodium-ion batteries. Sodium-ion batteries are considered more sustainable than lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium and their potential for grid storage and electric mobility.

Mr. Sydney Kwan, CEO of GEIH, expressed gratitude for A*STAR’s support. “Our collaboration is helping turn Singapore into a hub for sustainable technologies and green energy,” he said.

Research indicates that GEIH’s hard carbon outperforms existing options because of its high graphite content, making it particularly suitable for battery anodes. The process also converts biomass into hydrogen, biochar, bio-oil (for sustainable aviation fuel), and wood vinegar. It emphasizes circularity, with biochar helping sequester carbon and support various industries such as data centers, agriculture, etc.

Mr. Pek Hak Bin, CEO of H2G, highlighted hydrogen’s role in Singapore’s low-carbon future. “Our innovative, cost-effective hydrogen process is less carbon-intensive than electrolysis,” he stated. “Our hard carbon materials will enable industries to reduce environmental impact and promote sustainable growth.”",https://worldbiomarketinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/H2G-Green-and-ASTAR-collaborate-on-sustainable-biochar-and-green-hydrogen-tech-scaled-e1754410932484.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 12:56:17.668981

This agreement precedes the August 1st tariff deadline, preventing a scheduled 25% tariff increase on Japanese products. The deal includes substantial Japanese investments in the U.S.

Trade talks intensified in July after a temporary tariff pause ended and a 25% tariff on imported Japanese cars was reapplied. After negotiations with the U.S. in early July, Japan has agreed to a large investment package intended to reduce stress and ensure a more stable long-term trade relationship.

According to the agreement, Japan will invest about $550 billion in the U.S. This investment involves ordering 100 Boeing jets, investing in infrastructure and clean energy, and increasing cooperation in semiconductors and important minerals. U.S. negotiators state that 90% of the profits from these investments will go to the U.S.

In return, the U.S. will decrease tariffs on Japanese cars to 15%. Japan will also receive lower tariffs on important exports like semiconductors and pharmaceuticals. Japanese officials say these terms are among the best the U.S. has ever given to a trade partner.

Japan agreed for greater ingress of American agricultural products in its economy, raising U.S. rice imports by 75%, and committed to investing $8 billion into U.S. products, such as corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. This is a significant investment, given Japan is the second most significant importer of U.S. corn in the marketing year 2023–24 and is a major export market for U.S. rice. Nonetheless, Japan reiterated its commitment to protect its own agriculture sector, and negotiators say this topic will be revisited.

While the agreement douses any immediate sparks in trade tension, some crucial issues still remain to be solved. There was no discussion about enforcement mechanisms, time frames, or dispute resolution. Significant negotiations are still needed to arrive at the full implementation of the agreement. Trade officials on both sides will continue talking over the next months to arrive at a fully enforceable agreement.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16144_1624.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 12:56:21.898486

Currently planned for British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec, the facilities are expected to generate a combined 90 million litres of renewable diesel fuel per year, a drop-in fuel for the transportation sector.

Chalk River, Ont.-based Canadian Nuclear Laboratories (CNL) unveiled the partnership with waste-to-clean-fuel company Expander Energy, U.S. firm FuelCell Energy, Toronto-headquartered St Marys Cement, and Kincardine, Ont.-based startup Nuclear Promise X.

The announcement of the location selection follows the completion of a feasibility study that resulted in the five partners being awarded $4.9 million by Natural Resources Canada’s Clean Fuels Fund in 2024. The study focused on producing low-carbon synthetic diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

Synthetic transportation fuels “provide an immediate opportunity for the country to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, with the additional benefit of leveraging waste, such as wood, that may otherwise go to waste,” Stephen Bushby, CNL’s vice-president of science and technology, said in the announcement on Friday.

Sustainable Biz Canada has reached out to Expander for comment.

CNL, Expander's BETL

The technology developed by CNL and Expander is named Biomass Electrolysis to Liquids (BETL). It is based on Expander’s biomass gasification, bio-synthetic fuel production and electrolysis technology which outputs low-carbon diesel or aviation fuel.

The fuel is expected to have a “very low life cycle carbon intensity,” according to CNL. Natural Resources Canada says biodiesel has the potential to reduce life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by over 80 per cent compared to diesel.

Fuel produced by BETL is economically competitive with similar technologies that treat fats and oils, Expander’s president and CEO Gord Crawford said.

Front-end engineering design at the three locations is to be complete by the fall. The design phase will be based on using 240 tonnes of forestry wood waste per day, producing approximately 30 million litres of renewable diesel per year at each facility.

Factors such as the distance to utilities and accessibility to major roads and key resources like biomass were the main reasons for the selections.

CNL says the facility design could be an example for future sites either in Canada or internationally, under a build, own and operate model.

Further site-specific details will be announced in the “near future,” in coordination with local partners, such as government and Indigenous nations and organizations. Investors, including major off-takers, have voiced interest in participating in future projects, CNL adds.

Expander and CNL expect to install an electrolyzer at the planned Expander Carseland Alberta Gasifier project in Alberta to de-risk potential investment in the three sites, Crawford added.

From July 30 to August 12, JAL is hosting a sustainability-themed sale at Yokohama Takashimaya. Items include fuselage skin tags, life vest keychains, stools, and bags crafted from upcycled seat covers. All were sourced from the 777’s decommissioned interiors.

This marks the fourth year of JAL’s upcycling initiative and reflects the airline’s broader effort to pair aviation heritage with sustainable design. JAL Engineering, the group’s maintenance arm, oversees production of each collectible.

Simultaneously, Japan Airlines has confirmed the completion of phase one in a pioneering Scope 3 environmental value trading project. Together with firms like ENEOS and ITOCHU, JAL helped pilot a digital trading system that assigns carbon reduction value to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage. The system was validated by ClassNK and is now expanding to a wider network.

While the upcycled items celebrate the past, JAL’s SAF initiative signals a forward-facing push toward decarbonized flight."".",Not Available,https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/v/t39.30808-6/528359182_122241652292064089_5298853810939394975_n.jpg?stp=c216.0.648.648a_dst-jpg_e35_s640x640_tt6&_nc_cat=109&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=18de74&_nc_ohc=CjQ8sUN_m34Q7kNvwHGxTFx&_nc_oc=Adk7VODsLxhAVcwQbRL2fxBvw1jI34g-_kjryHY93o6qNj3LlCgu0oP_cD8uVRVobZ97B8c5Ew42p19abMW47J4M&_nc_zt=23&_nc_ht=scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com&_nc_gid=7xdX2Yonyv-jIOstW_U9Bw&oh=00_AfWNUfMFw3twrjQFnYI-zs6124OOTs6kbUtDjLvUO-EZKA&oe=68985E6C,N,,2025-08-05 16:56:19.549538

“Brazil, and especially Rio Grande do Sul, aligns ... with Cemvita’s strategic vision,” Karimi said.
The plant will be the first of its kind globally to operate at scale using this particular waste-to-value process, which converts crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, into sustainable oil and agricultural inputs.
Earlier this year, Cemvita also partnered with Be8, a Rio Grande do Sul-based biofuel company, to strengthen the region’s SAF value chain.","U.S.-based biotechnology firm Cemvita has formalized plans to build a new facility in Brazil’s southern state of Rio Grande do Sul that will produce low-carbon oil for use in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and a regenerative biofertilizer. The project, officially announced at a signing ceremony at the Palácio Piratini, marks the first industrial-scale deployment of Cemvita’s bioconversion technology.

The agreement, signed with state investment agency Invest RS, outlines the development of a facility that will manufacture two products: FermOil, a renewable oil made from crude glycerol that serves as a SAF feedstock, and FermNPK, a biofertilizer aimed at supporting regenerative agriculture.

State officials said the project aligns with Rio Grande do Sul’s economic and environmental goals by advancing its position in the global bioeconomy and energy transition.

“This partnership with Cemvita reinforces our commitment to sustainability, the attraction of high-impact investments, and the creation of opportunities in strategic sectors such as renewable energy, agriculture, and industry,” said acting governor Gabriel Souza during the announcement.

Cemvita’s CEO, Moji Karimi, noted that the region’s infrastructure, availability of key feedstocks, and policy support made it a suitable location. “Brazil, and especially Rio Grande do Sul, aligns ... with Cemvita’s strategic vision,” Karimi said.

The plant will be the first of its kind globally to operate at scale using this particular waste-to-value process, which converts crude glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel production, into sustainable oil and agricultural inputs.

The state’s selection for the facility was influenced by its existing biodiesel industry, strong logistics network, and government incentives for low-carbon technologies. According to Invest RS President Rafael Prikladnicki, the agency will provide technical support, value chain mapping, and assistance with regulatory and tax processes.

Earlier this year, Cemvita also partnered with Be8, a Rio Grande do Sul-based biofuel company, to strengthen the region’s SAF value chain.

State leaders view the project as a significant step in transforming Rio Grande do Sul into a global innovation hub for circular bioeconomy solutions, integrating industrial biotechnology with renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.

Their research shows that when a zinc (Zn) single-atom catalyst is part of an electrochemical reaction called the furfural reduction reaction (FRR), it can selectively produce a precursor to aviation fuels. Their findings highlight an efficient method that uses an abundant, renewable biomass to ultimately create environmentally-friendly fuels.

The FRR can create hydrofuroin, which has been a point of interest in recent research due to its versatility and ability to form key components of aviation fuels. However, while it may be easy to use, it's not as easy to produce.

""You need just the right conditions to produce hydrofuroin,"" remarks Professor Hao Li (Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR)), ""An efficient catalyst, as well as the right pH level, ion concentration and operation potential are crucial. Furthermore, there are a lot of possible reactions that cause environmental and safety concerns.""

Since the entire point is converting a readily available biomass to produce fuels in a way that's kind to the environment, harmful byproducts defeat the purpose. Seeing the need for a greener reaction process, researchers at Tohoku University's WPI-AIMR investigated how they could make this a reality.

The FRR was chosen, as it can run on renewable energy (as opposed to fossil fuels) and water (as opposed to hydrogen gas). After careful theoretical thermodynamic calculations and microkinetic modeling analysis, they determined that a single-atom active site on Zn would be ideal - allowing for the selective hydrogenation for furfural without other unwanted reactions.

They tested this in the lab, finding that a catalyst made by depositing zinc phthalocyanine on purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes was highly efficient (HF faradaic efficiency over 95%). This efficiency was maintained under a wide potential window. Some key points for achieving this success were carefully balancing the furfural and electrolyte concentrations.

""Our results reveal an exciting way to help take action against climate change,"" says Li.

The findings were published in EES Catalysis on June 23, 2025.

Surprisingly, there is also evidence in these polar waters of coccolithophores, a type of marine microalgae with elaborate calcium carbonate shells that plays a critical role in the global carbon cycle.

The study helps answer a longstanding mystery for satellite oceanographers as to what microbes dominate in this part of the ocean that's proven largely inaccessible, illuminating how the plankton community shifts in response to changing seawater temperature and chemistry. That, in turn, has important implications for the cycling of carbon in the Southern Ocean and the remote sensing tools scientists use to study it.

""This work takes a broad brush to understand the biological and geochemical dynamics of this far-flung body of water in ways that haven't been previously possible,"" said the study's lead author Barney Balch, a senior research scientist emeritus at Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences.

The study was published this week in the journal Global Biogeochemical Cycles.

In the early 2000s, Balch and colleagues identified a swath of seawater encircling Antarctica, that became known as the Great Calcite Belt. This area is marked by unusually high levels of particulate inorganic carbon, like calcium carbonate and limestone, that reflects light back to satellites. Scientists eventually confirmed that this was due to the shiny calcium carbonate shells of vast blooms of coccolithophores.

At the same time, though, they identified an area well south of the calcite belt that also appeared unusually bright in satellite images, even though the water was considered too cold for coccolithophores. This mystery has been harder to explain with heavy cloud cover, icebergs, and rough seas making it challenging to monitor this far south with either ships or satellites. Until now.

Researchers sailed aboard the R/V Roger Revelle from Hawaii, down to 60 degrees latitude, taking a brief easterly detour to monitor where water from further south appears to be pinched up into several eddies. Along the transect, the team measured ocean color; calcification and photosynthesis rates; and concentrations of inorganic carbon and silica, two minerals that reflect light and are critical for helping sequester organic carbon in the deep ocean.

""Satellites only see the top several meters of the ocean, but we were able to drill down with multiple measurements at multiple depths,"" Balch said. ""We've never had such a complete suite of integrated measurements through the water column in this part of the ocean.""

The multi-tiered approach—combining biogeochemical measurements, optical data, and even visual counts of microbes with microscopy—enabled the scientists to observe how the plankton community shifts moving south: from dinoflagellates in the warmer, stratified waters of the subtropics, to coccolithophores in the calcite belt, and finally to diatoms in the silica-rich, colder waters south of the Polar Front.

This combination of complementary methods provides a ""smoking gun,"" Balch said, that the high levels of reflectance scientists have observed in satellite images south of the calcite belt can be explained by frustules. These silica-based structures that diatoms build, resembling microscopic pillboxes, reflect light in much the same way as coccolithophore shells (it takes far more frustules to produce the same optical effect as coccolithophores, though—a testament to how dense their concentration is).

Surprisingly, though, the team also observed small concentrations of inorganic carbon, some amount of calcification happening—a first—and visual evidence of coccolithophores in the far southern waters. This, Balch said, suggests that coccolithophores can survive in colder waters than expected. Perhaps, he said, the eddies coming up from the south even serve as ""seed populations,"" providing a small but consistent stream of coccolithophores into the Great Calcite Belt.

The presence of coccolithophores across a wider geographic range than expected could influence how carbon moves through the Southern Ocean, which is considered one of the planet's most critical sinks for atmospheric carbon. Meanwhile, the dominance of diatoms south of the Polar Front highlights the need to improve the algorithms scientists use to translate satellite data into meaningful predictions of ocean biology. That means potentially combining measurements of other satellite-derived variables to help distinguish between diatoms and coccolithophores in satellite images.

""We're expanding our view of where coccolithophores live and finally beginning to understand the patterns we see in satellite images of this part of the ocean we rarely get to go to,"" Balch said. ""There's nothing like measuring something multiple ways to tell a more complete story.""

Vaden noted that the International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on Brazil in September and urged the sugar growers to show up in person at that hearing.","TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. — The top officials who run the U.S. sugar program will stay in Washington after the Trump administration reorganizes the Agriculture Department, Agriculture Deputy Secretary Stephen Vaden told The Hagstrom Report today.

After giving a speech to the American Sugar Alliance’s International Sweetener Symposium here, Vaden said in a brief interview that the top officials would stay in Washington but that officials who implement the program may be in the five hubs where USDA intends to move 2,600 of the 4,600 positions now in the Washington area.

He pointed out that 2,000 USDA employees will remain in the Washington area and said that farmers who come to Washington fly-ins will have plenty of officials to meet.

During the speech, Vaden said, “USDA remains committed to operating our sugar program at no cost to the taxpayers, and we’re focused on preventing forfeitures at all costs.”

“And that’s why every action that we’re taking is within the ‘America first’ and ‘farmers first’ philosophy.

Vaden vigorously defended the Trump administration’s reorganization plan that includes closing the South Building, the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center and two other facilities.

He repeated previous statements that the facilities that will be closed in the Washington area have backlogs of maintenance and that it makes no sense for the taxpayers to maintain them. The South Building, he noted, was constructed in the 1930s and has “nice” architecture, but it does not fit with USDA’s needs today. President Trump, he noted, promised to move the bureaucracy out of Washington and USDA is fulfilling that promise.

Vaden repeated previous statements that the five USDA hubs — Raleigh, N.C., Kansas City, Mo., Indianapolis, Ind., Fort Collins, Colo. and Salt Lake City, Utah — were chosen because the cost of living is low in those cities, which will allow USDA to attract a younger workforce.

Scientists have complained for years about working conditions at the Beltsville center, he noted, but he added that those facilities will be closed over a number of years. No facility engaged in research on cane or beet sugar will be closed, he said.

In a wide ranging speech, Vaden praised the reconciliation bill known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, particularly for making certain tax provisions permanent, including the estate tax.

Vaden also praised a provision in that bill that in 2026 restricts the use of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production tax credits to producers from North America.

“It blew my mind when I was a federal judge listening to Secretary Rollins’ predecessor explaining why subsidizing Chinese oil producers was a good idea,” he said.

Former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, he said, “was the U.S. secretary of agriculture, not the commissar for the People’s Republic of China.”

Vaden seemed to be referring to a speech that Vilsack gave at a Growth Energy Biofuels Summit in September 2024 in which he noted that the Chinese had reduced their imports of American agricultural products and that conversations about banning imported feedstocks should take into consideration what the reaction might be.

Vilsack told The Hagstrom Report in an email today that Vaden’s characterization was “not an accurate description of what I said.”

“Nobody was more supportive of 45Z for American farmers than I was and am,” Vilsack said.

He instead asked “what is the current status of 45Z and the interim rule we got through the system before I left at USDA and where is the Treasury Guidance on the use of that interim rule to enable our farmers to benefit from SAF [sustainable aviation fuel]?”

“Rather than wasting time and energy taking shots at a prior administration, would it be better for our farmers and producers and the airline industry to use that time to advocate for the Treasury Department to finish the guidance on 45Z?,” Vilsack said.

While some farm leaders have expressed concerns that the tariffs President Trump has imposed on other countries will lead them to retaliate by reducing U.S. farm imports, Vaden said that Trump’s use of tariffs has brought other countries to the negotiating table and that the administration also asks what these countries are going to do for American farmers.

Vaden said that “some of the smarter” countries come to Washington with proposals to buy U.S. farm products.

He noted that, while some of Trump’s tariffs have been subject to court challenges because they are based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the administration has launched an unfair trade practices investigation of Brazil under Section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act, which is legally secure.

Vaden urged the sugar industry to take an active role in the Brazil investigation.

“I don’t have to tell you that when Brazil expands its agricultural footprint, it always comes at the expense of the Amazon rainforest,” Vaden said.

If harm is found, tariffs do not need to be the only remedy so “if there are other actions that you and our other friends in the agricultural community believe might be more helpful than tariffs, it is not only entirely appropriate, but it is the time for you to tell us now, when you submit your comments to the Trade Representative’s Office of additional remedies that you think could be helpful in regard to our relations with Brazil,” he said.

Vaden noted that the International Trade Commission will hold a hearing on Brazil in September and urged the sugar growers to show up in person at that hearing.

Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who chairs the Make America Healthy Again Commission, has called sugar “poison,” but Vaden said the update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans “will focus primarily on protein-rich foods, fruits and vegetables, whole grains.”

He said, “Added sugars have long been a part of the conversation, but this industry, from the grower to your nutrition teams, have done a phenomenal job in sharing the facts with the necessary policy makers. I want you to keep at what you do.”

“One of the things that it’s important to keep in mind, is that for everything this administration does, no harm must come to America’s farm and rural communities,” Vaden said.

“The best way that we can ensure Americans are healthy and well taken care of is to ensure that as much as possible of what they eat is grown here in the United States of America. We have the most efficient, the most sustainable, and the safest food supply the world has ever seen.”

Vaden declined to comment on the departure of USDA Communications Director Seth Christensen after only four months on the job.

Butterflies are the most commonly counted insects and the butterfly is a likely poster species for how other insects and animals crucial to ecosystems are faring.","While analyzing the mountains of data harvested from three decades of butterfly counting in the Midwest, a Michigan State University Ph.D. candidate had seen enough studies to be braced for bad news.

""We expected to find that at least some species had done well over the past 32 years,"" she said.

Leuenberger and colleagues report the results after they combined more than 4.3 million observations in the U.S. Midwest from 1992–2023 to characterize changes in butterfly biodiversity. The results: 59 of the 136 species declined in abundance over the study. That means for every 10 species and 100 individuals present at a county at the beginning of the study period, there are now only nine species and 60 individuals.

Both common and rare butterflies are waning.

""You would have such a different experience taking a walk to look at butterflies in 1992 as compared to 2023,"" said Leuenberger, who is in the MSU Zipkin Quantitative Ecology Lab in the department of integrative biology.

""While most of the common species like monarchs and cabbage whites are still present, you wouldn't see nearly as many of them as in 1992. You're less likely to spot rare species as well. These are all changes that have occurred during my lifetime, which is humbling.""

The publication comes on the heels of another big data analysis published in March in Science, which documented a national butterfly decline across the United States from 2000 to 2020.

This latest study includes more butterfly surveys by going back a decade further, most collected by volunteers working more than 90,000 hours. Although the team did not evaluate the drivers of decline, the time frame is parallel to the widespread use of the insecticide class of neonicotinoids, which were introduced in 1994 and rapidly increased in use after 2003. The last several decades have also seen changes in key weather variables because of global climate change.

The level of detail in the analysis will be crucial to understanding the best ways to conserve butterflies, which fall into different trait groups—including monarchs, swallowtails and skippers. Some migrate vast distances while others stay put. Some are abundant and found in a variety of habitats, while others can only live in a few specific places or in small numbers. They have different strategies to overwinter—as eggs, caterpillars or adults.

""Traits affect how resilient butterflies are to change,"" Leuenberger said. ""For instance, ones that only have a single generation a year don't do as well as multi-generational butterflies.""

This diversity is why it's important to have a detailed understanding about how each type of butterfly is faring. Knowing specifically how a species is changing—or not—is the first step in creating effective conservation plans.

""We are lucky to be working in the midwestern U.S., an area with the highest density of butterfly surveys of anywhere in North America,"" said the study's senior author, Elise Zipkin, Red Cedar Distinguished Professor and director of MSU's Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior Program.

""Volunteer scientists use the same protocols week after week and year after year. Without their invaluable efforts, we would not know how butterflies are faring and what we can do to reverse declines.""

Butterflies are the most commonly counted insects and the butterfly is a likely poster species for how other insects and animals crucial to ecosystems are faring. As caterpillars, butterflies are the primary food for many fledgling birds. Butterflies and other insects are also important pollinators for plants and crops.

""Humans rely on insects more than we realize,"" says Leuenberger. ""We need to figure out how we can protect them before it's too late.""",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/midwestern-butterfly-c.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 15:57:11.974020

Essar Energy Transition (EET) plans to establish a Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ) production centre capable of producing 200,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of advanced SAF.

It would use around 550,000tpa of renewable e-methanol and bio-methanol sourced domestically in the UK and internationally, including from EET’s sister company Essar Future Energies, which is developing an e-methanol project in the Indian state of Gujarat.

Advanced SAF produced at the hub will use EET’s established UK jet export infrastructure, including the Manchester Jet, Midlands and UKOP oil pipeline systems, as well as existing road and marine distribution routes, allowing supply to regions across the UK.

This infrastructure already supplies 10 UK airports, including Manchester International Airport.

EET completed a feasability study earlier this year and is targeting the completion of pre-front-end engineering design by March 2026, with a final investment decision expected by the end of 2027.

The project will support the UK’s Jet Zero Strategy, which has set a target to achieve net zero aviation emissions by 2050.

By 2024, 22% of total jet fuel demand must be SAF, up from 2% currently.

Tony Fountain, Managing Director at EET said: “We welcome the UK Government’s support, which enables us to carry out a detailed pre-front-end engineering design process and accelerate this flagship UK advanced sustainable aviation fuels project towards final investment decision.

“At Stanlow, we have major decarbonisation ambitions, aiming to become a leading energy transition hub and home to the world’s first low carbon process refinery. Domestic advanced SAF production is central to our long term vision and a key catalyst for decarbonising aviation. With SAF still making up only a tiny fraction of global jet fuel use, our MtJ plant will play a critical role in closing that gap and helping the UK meet its Jet Zero targets.”",https://www.energylivenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20240813-EET-Fuels-Stanlow-Refinery-copy.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 11:58:02.682013

Their findings, published in the journal EES Catalysis, highlight an efficient method that uses an abundant, renewable biomass to ultimately create environmentally-friendly fuels.

The FRR can create hydrofuroin, which has been a point of interest in recent research due to its versatility and ability to form key components of aviation fuels. However, while it may be easy to use, it's not as easy to produce.

""You need just the right conditions to produce hydrofuroin,"" remarks Professor Hao Li (Advanced Institute for Materials Research, WPI-AIMR). ""An efficient catalyst, as well as the right pH level, ion concentration and operation potential are crucial. Furthermore, there are a lot of possible reactions that cause environmental and safety concerns.""

Since the entire point is converting a readily available biomass to produce fuels in a way that's kind to the environment, harmful byproducts defeat the purpose. Seeing the need for a greener reaction process, researchers at Tohoku University's WPI-AIMR investigated how they could make this a reality.

The FRR was chosen, as it can run on renewable energy (as opposed to fossil fuels) and water (as opposed to hydrogen gas). After careful theoretical thermodynamic calculations and microkinetic modeling analysis, they determined that a single-atom active site on Zn would be ideal—allowing for the selective hydrogenation for furfural without other unwanted reactions.

They tested this in the lab, finding that a catalyst made by depositing zinc phthalocyanine on purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes was highly efficient (HF faradaic efficiency over 95%). This efficiency was maintained under a wide potential window. Some key points for achieving this success were carefully balancing the furfural and electrolyte concentrations.",https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/producing-sustainable.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 11:58:06.891954

Abstract

Hydrotreated ester and fatty acids to jet (HEFA-tJ) is presently the most developed and economically attractive pathway to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). An ongoing systematic study of the critical variables of different pathways to SAF has revealed significantly lower greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential for the HEFA-tJ pathway compared to competing markets using the same resources for road diesel production. Moderate yield variations between air and road pathways lead to several hundred thousand tons less GHG reduction per project, which is generally not evaluated thoroughly in standard environmental assessments. This work demonstrates that, although the HEFA-tJ market seems to have more attractive features than biodiesel/renewable diesel, considerable viability risks might manifest as HEFA-tJ fuel market integration rises. The need for more transparent data and effort in this regard, before envisaging making decisions regarding the volume of HEFA-tJ production, is emphasized. Overall, reducing the carbon intensity of road diesel appears to be less capital-intensive, less risky, and several times more efficient in reducing GHG emissions.

SAO PAULO, Aug 5 (Reuters) - Brazil's Grupo Potencial will invest 2 billion reais ($392.9 million) to build a corn ethanol plant in Lapa, Parana state, as part of a plan to develop the world's largest biofuels complex, Vice President Carlos Eduardo Hammerschmidt said.

The group is already in advanced stages of constructing a soybean crushing facility at the site, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2026.

The plant will supply raw material to Potencial's expanding biodiesel factory, Hammerschmidt said in an interview with Reuters on Monday, while future plans include building a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facility.

""Our goal is to build the largest biofuels complex in the world,"" said Hammerschmidt, a co-owner of the family-run company.

The corn ethanol plant will require 1.2 million metric tons of corn each year, equivalent to 6% of Parana's output. The state, Brazil's second-largest corn producer, is forecast to harvest a record 20 million tons in the 2024/25 season.

Construction of the ethanol plant is scheduled to begin in 2026, using the company's own funds, and may be completed by late 2027, Hammerschmidt said.

Corn ethanol production in Brazil's center-south region is expected to grow more than 30% in 2024/25, driven by rising fuel demand and a new rule, effective since the start of August, which mandates that gasoline must include 30% anhydrous ethanol.

Once the biodiesel plant expansion is completed by the end of 2026, Potencial will boost its annual production capacity from 900 million liters to 1.62 billion liters, Hammerschmidt added.

The soybean crusher in Lapa will be able to process 1.2 million tons per year, he said.

The ethanol plant investment is part of a broader strategy that includes building two pipelines — one for ethanol and one for biodiesel — connecting the nearby city of Araucaria to the Lapa complex, with potential to serve other cities.

The company expects to invest 200 million reais in the pipelines, Hammerschmidt said.

""We'll deliver both biodiesel and ethanol directly to fuel distribution hubs,"" Hammerschmidt said, noting the complex's proximity to an oil refinery in Parana owned by state energy giant, Petrobras PETR4.SA.

Boom Supersonic Overture Aircraft Overview

Founded by American tech entrepreneur Blake Scholl in 2014, Boom Supersonic is headquartered in Denver, Colorado, in the U.S. The company is engineering a future where passengers can cross oceans in half the time as conventional airliners.

The Overture, its first and flagship aircraft, is built for transoceanic routes, with planned flights such as New York-London and Tokyo-Seattle.

Designed to fly at speeds of up to Mach 1.7 with a range of 4,250 nautical miles, the Overture has a targeted capacity of 60 to 80 passengers – all paying premium fares for the experience.

Powered by the still-in-development Symphony turbofan engines, the Overture focuses on efficiency, along with environmental responsibility and passenger comfort.

The aerospace company’s stated mission is to deliver not just speed but a viable and scalable model for commercial supersonic aviation.

Boom Supersonic XB-1 Demonstrator

The American aerospace company secured over USD 600 million in funding and a strategic grant from the U.S. Air Force. Boom follows a methodical approach, starting with the XB-1, a one-third-scale demonstrator that first achieved supersonic flight on 28 January 2025.

These test flights, conducted out of Mojave Air & Space Port (MHV), provide vital aerodynamic and performance data for the full-scale Overture aircraft.

The XB-1 test-bed has completed over a dozen experimental flights thus far, validating Boom’s fuselage shaping, laminar airflow, and material and structural strength at high speed.

NASA has backed the daring program with visual documentation using Schlieren photography, confirming the presence of well-defined shock waves.

Using the XB-1, NASA has also supported the research into “boomless cruise” flight. The valuable data gathered during these test flights has enabled Boom to achieve Mach Cutoff – a phenomenon where sonic booms are refracted in the atmosphere without reaching the ground.

Advanced Technology Aids Boom Overture Supersonic Flight

Advanced technology aids Boom Overture supersonic flights, combining a delta-gull wing design, cutting-edge carbon-composite structure, and four newly-developed Symphony medium-bypass turbofan engines.

Developed alongside Florida Turbine Technologies, StandardAero, and GE Additive, the Symphony turbofan engines promise 35,000 pounds of thrust and are optimised for supersonic cruise without afterburners.

These state-of-the-art powerplants represent a marked departure from traditional turbofan engines powering today’s subsonic airliners. Operating on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the Boom Overture’s Symphony engines are designed to be environmentally friendly.

According to the company’s official website, the Boom Overture will cruise at Mach 1.3, with a capability to achieve speeds of Mach 1.7. The Overture’s cruising altitude is 60,000 feet, and its maximum range is a claimed 4,250 nautical miles.

The supersonic aircraft is engineered to meet ICAO Chapter 14 noise standards, with limited sonic impact and compatibility with major airports globally.

Apart from modern flight control systems and avionics, the Overture’s advanced cameras provide visibility during take-off and landing, unlike Concorde’s mechanical but clunky droop-nose.

Boom Supersonic Airliner

The Boom Overture has received confirmed orders from major international carriers. American Airlines (AA) has ordered 20 aircraft, with options for 40 more. United Airlines (UA) has placed 15 orders, with options for 35 more.

This is followed by Japan Airlines (JL), which has shown keen interest in the Overture – placing pre-orders for 20 aircraft. The Japanese carrier could operate the Boom Overture on routes like Tokyo to Seattle or Tokyo to Singapore.

Likely routes for United Airlines include New York to London and New York to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, American Airlines could operate the Boom Overture on its Miami to Barcelona and New York to Paris routes.

Boom Supersonic has further partnered with the American aerospace giant, Northrop Grumman. A possible venture between the two could result in a military version of the Overture.

Providing strategic supply-chain partnership for the ambitious Overture project are Collins Aerospace, Honeywell, and Safran Landing Systems.

Supersonic Airliner of the Future

The aviation community and the flying public have responded with both excitement and caution. While support for the Boom Supersonic Overture remains strong, questions regarding certification, funding stability, and realistic timelines highlight expected scepticism.

Boom Supersonic has been lauded for showcasing transparency, providing consistent progress updates, and posting credible test achievements.

Could this supersonic aircraft be the new airliner of the future? Possibly, but there are considerable obstacles that Boom must overcome.

Some of the challenges include engine development sans a traditional OEM, plus navigating regulatory restrictions on sonic booms. However, the company’s success has reignited serious interest in commercial supersonic flight across the industry.

Future of Commercial Supersonic Flight

Boom Supersonic aims to commence testing of the Symphony engine in 2026, followed by the Overture flight tests in 2027. Considering smooth proceedings, commercial operations with paying passengers could start by 2030.

Certification efforts with the FAA and EASA will be critical to the fruition of these plans in the coming years.

Meanwhile, competitors like NASA and Lockheed Martin are advancing their own quiet supersonic aircraft, reflecting a renewed global interest in high-speed aviation.

Boom’s goal extends beyond just performance on paper. The goal is to make commercial supersonic flight sustainable, safe, and scalable in the modern aviation landscape.

Final Verdict: Act Now, Reap Later Willis Lease Finance's Q2 2025 results are a masterclass in strategic execution and forward-looking innovation.","In the ever-evolving aviation and industrial leasing markets, few companies have demonstrated the kind of strategic agility and operational excellence as Willis Lease Finance Corporation (WLFC). The recent Q2 2025 earnings report has cemented its position as a standout performer, delivering a record-breaking quarter that defies market skepticism and sets a new benchmark for the sector. For investors seeking a high-conviction buy, WLFC's combination of outstanding financial execution, asset management prowess, and forward-looking sustainability initiatives creates a compelling case for immediate action.

Record Earnings Beat: A Masterclass in Execution

Willis Lease Finance's Q2 2025 results were nothing short of extraordinary. The company reported $2.26 billion in revenue, with net income surging 134% year-over-year to $332 million. Adjusted diluted EPS hit $2.86, a 20% increase from the prior year, driven by disciplined cost management, operational leverage, and strategic asset optimization. These figures far outpace industry benchmarks and underscore WLFC's ability to thrive in a challenging macroeconomic environment.

Key drivers included:

- Organic Revenue Growth: Despite a flat nominal revenue figure, WLFC achieved 5% organic growth by focusing on high-margin leasing and maintenance services.

- Margin Expansion: Operating margins jumped to 16.3%, up 690 basis points YoY, while adjusted margins reached 18.5%, reflecting superior cost control and pricing power.

- Strategic Asset Sales: The $43 million gain from selling its UK consultancy arm (BAML) and the $27.6 million from asset disposals (engines, airframes) added non-recurring tailwinds without compromising core operations.

The Risk & Broking segment, in particular, shines as a growth engine, with 7% revenue growth driven by global client retention and new business wins. Meanwhile, the Health, Wealth & Career segment—despite a 6% decline due to the TRANZACT sale—showed double-digit organic growth in non-North American markets, highlighting WLFC's global diversification.

Strategic Asset Management: The Engine of Long-Term Value

WLFC's strength lies in its ability to optimize its $2.83 billion lease portfolio, which includes 348 engines, 15 aircraft, and a marine vessel. Portfolio utilization improved to 88.3% in Q2 2025 from 76.7% at year-end 2024, a testament to its active asset deployment strategy. This metric is critical for leasing companies, as higher utilization directly correlates with revenue generation and asset returns.

The company's $217 million in free cash flow (despite a $500 million share repurchase program) further demonstrates its financial discipline. By prioritizing shareholder returns and maintaining a robust balance sheet, WLFC is positioning itself to capitalize on expansion opportunities. For example, its recent ConstantThrust agreement with Air India Express and the purchase of 30 LEAP engines signal a long-term commitment to securing high-demand assets in a post-pandemic aviation landscape.

Sustainable Aviation: Pioneering the Future of Clean Energy

While short-term financials are impressive, WLFC's $4.721 million grant-backed SAF facility in Teesside, UK, is where the company is building its legacy. Through its subsidiary Willis Sustainable Fuels, the company is developing advanced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from biomethane, targeting 80% lower emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. This project, supported by partnerships with Johnson Matthey, Axens, and McDermott, is set to begin operations in 2028 and aligns with global decarbonization goals.

The strategic significance here cannot be overstated. As governments and airlines ramp up ESG commitments, WLFC is not just adapting—it's leading the charge. The UK government's Advanced Fuels Fund grant underscores the project's importance, and WLFC's exploration of global SAF expansion positions it to capture a growing $100+ billion market.

Why This Is a High-Conviction Buy

The case for WLFC is built on three pillars:

1. Financial Outperformance: A 20%+ adjusted EPS growth and 134% net income surge validate its operational resilience.

2. Strategic Leverage: Strong asset utilization, disciplined capital allocation, and global diversification create a durable competitive moat.

3. Sustainability Leadership: Its SAF initiative is a long-term value driver, aligning with regulatory tailwinds and investor demand for ESG-aligned assets.

For investors, the risks are minimal. The aviation leasing sector is cyclical, but WLFC's diversified portfolio, recurring revenue streams, and ESG focus mitigate downside. The stock's post-earnings dip (despite a 35.84% EPS beat) presents an opportunistic entry point, particularly as the market reprices its long-term potential.

Final Verdict: Act Now, Reap Later

Willis Lease Finance's Q2 2025 results are a masterclass in strategic execution and forward-looking innovation. With a $2.26 billion revenue base, a $2.83 billion asset portfolio, and a $4.721 million grant-backed SAF facility, WLFC is uniquely positioned to outperform in both the near and long term.

A Growing Wave of Greenwashing Claims The convergence of regulatory scrutiny, investor activism and consumer awareness means that greenwashing claims are likely to increase – not just in banking, but across all sectors.","Greenwashing is not a single act but a spectrum of misleading behaviours. The most common types include:

Greencrowding – hiding behind group initiatives or alliances to avoid individual accountability;

Greenlighting – spotlighting a small green feature to distract from broader unsustainable practices;

Greenshifting – blaming consumers for environmental issues rather than addressing corporate responsibility;

Greenlabelling – using eco-friendly language or imagery without substantiation;

Greenrinsing – frequently changing sustainability targets before they are achieved; and

Greenhushing – deliberately underreporting sustainability efforts to avoid scrutiny or accountability.

These tactics can mislead stakeholders and regulators alike and are increasingly being called out by watchdogs and civil society.

CSRD and the Temptation to Overstate Sustainability

The EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) may be the long-awaited turning point. It will either improve transparency and provide the previously missing set of harmonised standards for companies to adhere to when measuring their ESG performance against set benchmarks, or it will influence, perhaps unwittingly, further greenwashing. The CSRD mandates detailed ESG disclosures using standardised European Sustainability Reporting Standards.

Companies must report on:

environmental impacts and climate risks;

due diligence processes;

taxonomy alignment; and

substantiation of sustainability claims.

The granularity of CSRD reporting, covering everything from emissions data to supply chain practices, raises the bar for transparency. However, it also creates a temptation for companies to inflate their sustainability performance to meet stakeholder expectations or avoid reputational damage. The CSRD is complemented by other frameworks such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (“SFDR”), the EU Taxonomy (“EUT”) and the Empowering Consumers for the Green Transition Directive (“ECD”) all of which aim to combat greenwashing by enforcing verifiable, science-based disclosures. The ECD will apply from September 2026 and introduces significant changes to environmental advertising including a prohibition on vague environmental claims which cannot be substantiated, a prohibition on using or creating unreliable sustainability labels and a prohibition on false claims about the sustainability of an asset. ECD bans the use of generic environmental advertising claims such as “natural”, “environmentally friendly” or “biodegradable” without adequate substantiation. It also restricts the use of sustainability labels to those based on official certification schemes or established by public authorities, bans distinct types of environmental claims reliant on carbon offsets and introduces harmonised labels and requirements around durability and repairability of products. Increased enforcement against greenwashing claims across EU member states will continue to evolve even without the Green Claims Directive pursuant to ECD and pursuant to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (“UCPD”) which is undergoing implementation across the EU.

The ECD will amend the UCPD. This contains Annex I which will be expanded to include a new set of blacklisted practices specifically targeting greenwashing. These include the use of vague environmental claims such as “eco-friendly” or “climate neutral” without robust substantiation, the use of sustainability labels not based on official certification schemes or public authorities, and the omission of information about product durability or reparability. Also prohibited are claims about future environmental performance that lack clear, verifiable commitments and independent monitoring. These additions aim to harmonise enforcement across the EU and provide greater legal certainty for both consumers and businesses.

In the UK, the CMA’s GCC provides a non-binding but influential framework for businesses to ensure their environmental messaging is accurate and not misleading. Whilst the GCC itself is not legally binding, the CMA has made clear that it will use it as a benchmark for enforcement under consumer protection law. Businesses should therefore treat the GCC as de facto regulation and ensure their marketing practices are fully aligned.

Implications for Banks: Reputational Risk and Regulatory Pressure

Greenwashing is increasing in the banking sector, where financial institutions face mounting scrutiny over the credibility of their sustainability claims. Whilst there is no specific legislation that directly penalises banks for greenwashing, they are not immune to its consequences. Financial institutions face intense scrutiny from investors, regulators, and society to align their portfolios with climate goals. The Rainforest Action Network, a US-based environmental advocacy group, is known for its influential Banking on Climate Chaos reports. These reports expose how major banks continue financing fossil fuels and deforestation despite public commitments to sustainability.

Key pressures include:

reputational risk: as seen in the HSBC and Lloyds cases, misleading sustainability claims can lead to public backlash and regulatory censure;

investor expectations: initiatives like the and the Net-Zero Banking Alliance push banks to decarbonise their lending and investment portfolios; and

regulatory alignment: banks must comply with ESG disclosure rules under the EUT, CSRD, SFDR and Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, even if these do not explicitly target greenwashing.

To mitigate the risks associated with greenwashing, banks are increasingly encouraged to adopt comprehensive and proactive strategies. This includes establishing robust greenwashing risk frameworks that integrate ESG considerations into their core operations. Utilising verified ESG data is essential to ensure the accuracy and credibility of sustainability claims, whilst thorough due diligence on clients helps identify and manage potential reputational and compliance risks. Additionally, banks should regularly audit their marketing materials to ensure consistency between their public messaging and actual practices. Equally important is the training of staff on ESG principles, equipping them with the knowledge and awareness needed to uphold ethical standards and avoid misleading representations. Together, these measures form a strong foundation for responsible and transparent banking practices in an increasingly scrutinised regulatory environment.

In the UK, legal exposure is also increasing. The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, particularly sections 90 and 90A (now consolidated under Schedule 10A), provides a potential basis for future litigation against companies that make misleading sustainability disclosures. If investors suffer losses due to false or exaggerated ESG claims, these provisions could be invoked to hold issuers accountable, further raising the stakes for financial institutions.

The Role of Green Loans: Catalyst or Complication?

Green loans, financing tied to environmental performance, are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they incentivise borrowers to meet sustainability targets. On the other, they can be misused as a form of greenwashing if the criteria are vague or poorly enforced. For example, a company might secure a green loan for a renewable energy project while continuing to invest heavily in fossil fuels elsewhere. Without rigorous monitoring and third-party verification, such loans risk becoming a tool for reputational laundering rather than genuine environmental progress. To prevent this, lenders must (i) set clear, science-based eligibility criteria; (ii) require regular reporting and third-party audits; and (iii) align loan terms with credible taxonomies (e.g. EUT).

Sustainability-Linked Loans: A Growing Credibility Gap

Sustainability-linked loans (“SLL”) have come under increasing scrutiny in 2025, with critics highlighting their lack of enforceable environmental standards, transparency and measurable targets. These financial instruments, which are intended to incentivise corporate sustainability through favourable lending terms, have instead been accused of enabling greenwashing. In April 2025, the Royal Bank of Canada publicly abandoned its sustainable finance goals, citing the absence of clear definitions and accountability mechanisms within the SLL framework. This move underscored growing concerns about the credibility of such loans in driving genuine environmental progress. Further controversy emerged when companies like Shell and Drax were revealed to have secured SLLs whilst continuing high-pollution activities, with loan terms linked to vague or non-binding sustainability metrics. These cases have intensified calls for regulatory reform and greater scrutiny of sustainability claims in financial markets.

A Growing Wave of Greenwashing Claims

The convergence of regulatory scrutiny, investor activism and consumer awareness means that greenwashing claims are likely to increase – not just in banking, but across all sectors. As frameworks like the EUT, CSRD, GCD, and Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive reach full implementation and wider span, companies will face higher standards for substantiating their environmental claims. For financial institutions, the challenge is twofold: (i) ensuring their own disclosures are accurate; and (ii) scrutinising the ESG credentials of their clients and investments. Whilst the legal landscape may not yet impose direct penalties for greenwashing in finance, the reputational and financial risks are real and growing. Ultimately, the path forward lies in transparency, accountability, and a commitment to genuine sustainability; not just the appearance of it.",https://www.wfw.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Environment-Sustainability-shutterstock_1826398901.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 08:57:37.012221

This commonsense order ensures our nation is stronger, our land use is optimised and the American people are properly informed.”","The US Government has announced an order to “rein in environmentally damaging” solar and wind projects to “more efficiently manage” the country’s energy resources.

Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum has signed a new Secretarial Order, which suggests “massive, unreliable, energy projects”, such as wind and solar, are “inefficient uses of federal lands” when compared to other energy sources “with much smaller footprints like nuclear, gas and coal”.

The Interior Department will now consider a proposed energy project’s capacity density when assessing its potential energy benefits to the US and impacts to the environment and wildlife.

The Order directs the Department to only permit energy projects “that are most appropriate use” of federal land and resources.

It may no longer issue permits for wind or solar projects on federal lands unless they generate as much energy per acre as a coal, gas or nuclear power plant

Citing data from the US Energy Information Administration, the Department suggests one advanced nuclear plant produces 33.17MW per acre while one offshore wind farm produces around 0.006MW per acre – which is approximately 5,500 times less efficient than one nuclear plant.

Therefore, the Department states wind and solar projects may “unnecessarily and unduly degrade” federal lands when there are “reasonable alternatives” that can generate the same amount of or more energy on far less land.

Mr Burgum said: “Gargantuan, unreliable, intermittent energy projects hold America back from achieving US energy dominance while weighing heavily on the American taxpayer and environment.

“By considering energy generation optimisation, the Department will be able to better manage our federal lands, minimise environmental impact and maximise energy development to further President Donald Trump’s energy goals.

Their research shows that when a zinc (Zn) single-atom catalyst is part of an electrochemical reaction called the furfural reduction reaction (FRR), it can selectively produce a precursor to aviation fuels. Their findings highlight an efficient method that uses an abundant, renewable biomass to ultimately create environmentally-friendly fuels.

The FRR can create hydrofuroin, which has been a point of interest in recent research due to its versatility and ability to form key components of aviation fuels. However, while it may be easy to use, it’s not as easy to produce.

“You need just the right conditions to produce hydrofuroin,” remarks Professor Hao Li (Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR)), “An efficient catalyst, as well as the right pH level, ion concentration and operation potential are crucial. Furthermore, there are a lot of possible reactions that cause environmental and safety concerns.”

Since the entire point is converting a readily available biomass to produce fuels in a way that’s kind to the environment, harmful byproducts defeat the purpose. Seeing the need for a greener reaction process, researchers at Tohoku University’s WPI-AIMR investigated how they could make this a reality.

The FRR was chosen, as it can run on renewable energy (as opposed to fossil fuels) and water (as opposed to hydrogen gas). After careful theoretical thermodynamic calculations and microkinetic modeling analysis, they determined that a single-atom active site on Zn would be ideal – allowing for the selective hydrogenation for furfural without other unwanted reactions.

They tested this in the lab, finding that a catalyst made by depositing zinc phthalocyanine on purified multi-walled carbon nanotubes was highly efficient (HF faradaic efficiency over 95%). This efficiency was maintained under a wide potential window. Some key points for achieving this success were carefully balancing the furfural and electrolyte concentrations.

“Our results reveal an exciting way to help take action against climate change,” says Li.

The findings were published in EES Catalysis on June 23, 2025.

SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a critical pathway for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation.","Thailand is on track to complete its national specification for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by early 2026, as rising international demand accelerates the shift toward greener air travel. The Department of Energy Business (DOEB), under the Ministry of Energy, is leading the drafting process, which aims to align with global benchmarks such as ASTM D7566, according to the Bangkok Post.

The standard, once finalised, will enable the certification and commercial rollout of SAF for both domestic and international use. ASTM D7566, developed by ASTM International, is the globally recognised specification that governs blending SAF with conventional jet fuel. It is already in use in major markets such as the United States and Europe.

ASTM D7566 – Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons defines the requirements for synthetic blending components produced from non-petroleum sources that can be mixed with conventional jet fuel to create drop-in fuels compatible with existing aircraft engines and infrastructure. Once blended, the final product is recertified as Jet A or Jet A-1 under ASTM D1655 for commercial aviation use.

The specification currently includes eight approved synthetic pathways: Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK), FT-SPK with Aromatics (FT-SPK/A), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK), Synthesized Iso-Paraffins (SIP), Alcohol-to-Jet SPK (ATJ-SPK), Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet (CHJ), Hydroprocessed Fermented Sugars to Synthetic Kerosene (HFS-SK), and Aromatics derived via Catalytic Synthesis (AAD). Each pathway has strict criteria for composition and performance to ensure safety and compatibility in aviation applications.

According to Sarawut Kaewtathip, director-general of the DOEB, the department is currently studying the inclusion of palm oil and used cooking oil (UCO) as feedstocks for SAF production in Thailand. UCO, already used extensively in SAF production globally, is under consideration due to its similar properties to that of internationally accepted feedstocks.

The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand previously announced plans to mandate the use of SAF, starting with a 1% blending requirement in 2026. This percentage is expected to gradually increase to 3–5% in the following years. However, the rollout will initially focus on international flights due to certification variances across airlines and aircraft types.

Thailand’s flagship energy firms are actively supporting the transition. Bangchak Corporation is already producing SAF at its Bangkok refinery, while PTT Oil and Retail Business (OR) and Bangchak subsidiary BBGI are developing production capacities targeting 1 million litres of SAF annually. PTT is also pursuing a demonstration project at its Rayong site, in collaboration with PTT Global Chemical and Airbus.

Bangkok Airways began using SAF for its international flights from Suvarnabhumi Airport on July 1, as part of a pilot project in partnership with PTT Oil and Retail Business Plc (OR). The airline and OR signed a letter of intent to procure and utilize SAF, marking the first initiative of its kind in Thailand.

OR supplies SAF derived from used cooking oil, produced by PTT Global Chemical (GC), the petrochemical arm of PTT Plc. GC has an estimated production capacity of 6 million liters per year in its initial phase.

SAF can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel, offering a critical pathway for the aviation sector’s decarbonisation. The anticipated national standard is expected to create new opportunities for SAF producers, while encouraging foreign airlines to adopt Thai-made SAF for refuelling in Bangkok and beyond.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Thailand-to-finalise-sustainable-aviation-fuel-standard-by-2026.webp,N,,2025-08-05 04:56:15.454500

By tapping into its abundant natural resources, the region is making impressive strides towards a cleaner, more sustainable aviation future.

Why Southeast Asia Is Leading the Charge

Southeast Asia stands out due to its rich natural resources that provide an ideal base for producing SAF. Countries such as Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam are home to a variety of materials, including rice straw, cassava pulp, and used cooking oil (UCO), all of which can be transformed into SAF. Palm oil waste and municipal solid waste also present viable feedstocks for SAF production, contributing to the region’s competitive advantage in this growing field.

In fact, a study from ASEAN, Boeing, CTIF, and GHD, funded by Global Affairs Canada, suggests that Southeast Asia could account for up to 12% of the world’s SAF production by 2050. Notably, by 2040, the region’s largest players, including Indonesia and the Philippines, are expected to become net exporters of SAF.

Cutting-Edge SAF Production Technologies

Advancements are being made on all fronts in relation to Sustainable Aviation Fuel SAF production. The most common method used to produce this fuel is Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA). Both Fischer Tropsch (FT) and Alcohol to Jet (ATJ) processes are gaining popularity in the region. These more modern technologies are more aligned with local feedstocks, leading to a SAF production ecosystem that is more diverse and efficient.

Indonesia’s Pertamina and Singapore’s Neste have already set up SAF production facilities, marking the beginning of a regional transformation towards a cleaner aviation future.

Challenges and Opportunities

Although the area’s expanding SAF industry is very promising, it still faces a number of issues. Take palm oil, for instance. It has received a lot of attention as a feedstock because of its possible connections to deforestation. Still, SAF producers are looking into used cooking oil (UCO) and agricultural waste to reduce their carbon footprint.

Despite these challenges, the potential benefits for the region’s economy are enormous. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers more than just environmental benefits; it is set to create thousands of jobs and boost skills development across the region. Local farmers could also benefit, particularly in countries like Vietnam, where rice straw can be utilized to produce SAF, offering a low-carbon intensity feedstock without expanding land use.

Government and Industry Commitments

Governments across Southeast Asia are taking concrete steps to support the SAF sector. Singapore is leading the way with a mandate requiring all departing flights to use a 1% SAF blend starting in 2026, with a target to increase this to 3-5% by 2030.

Indonesia has also outlined an ambitious roadmap that targets 30% SAF usage by 2050, signaling a long-term commitment to aviation decarbonization. Thailand and Malaysia have introduced similar plans to reduce their aviation sector’s carbon footprint. As a result, major airlines in the region are following suit.

Singapore Airlines and Scoot are targeting 5% SAF usage by 2030, while Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Cebu Pacific, and Vietnam Airlines have already completed their inaugural SAF flights, signaling an industry-wide shift towards sustainable aviation.

Economic and Social Impacts of SAF

The advantages of SAF go well beyond environmental benefits. Economically, the expanding SAF industry has the potential to unlock enormous economic value, including the creation of new jobs, as well as the development of skills training programs in the renewable energy and aviation fields. Moreover, SAF is advancing important social goals such as equality of gender and the inclusion of people in the clean energy supply chain from socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

For example, rice straw—one of the most sustainable feedstocks—provides an opportunity for local farmers to participate in the clean energy transition without altering land use or contributing to deforestation. This creates a pathway for inclusive growth, directly benefiting rural communities and fostering regional economic development.

Moving Forward: A Collaborative Approach

Southeast Asia’s shift towards SAF production represents a critical phase in the region’s transition to a greener aviation ecosystem. The “Promoting the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels from Agricultural Waste in the ASEAN Region” project is a crucial step in strengthening regional cooperation, developing technical expertise, and mobilizing investments.

With production potentially exceeding domestic demand, Southeast Asia is well positioned to export SAF to other aviation markets, including Japan and South Korea, helping to meet global SAF demand.

The Road Ahead: A Green Aviation Future

With the world looking to SAF as a priority, Southeast Asia is primed to emerge as a major contender in this field. To fully realize these goals, sustained partnership amongst governments, the private sector, and investors will be needed.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Production-1.jpg,N,,2025-08-05 00:56:14.028454

The engagement agreement, signed with Invest RS, outlines Cemvita’s intention to establish a facility to produce FermOil™, a sustainable oil crucial for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), and FermNPK™, an innovative biofertilizer designed to support regenerative agriculture.

Acting governor Gabriel Souza emphasized the strategic importance of this collaboration, stating, “Rio Grande do Sul takes another important step toward becoming a global reference in innovation and bioeconomy. This partnership with Cemvita reinforces our commitment to sustainability, the attraction of high-impact investments, and the creation of opportunities for the people of Rio Grande do Sul in strategic sectors such as renewable energy, agriculture, and industry.” His remarks underscore the state's proactive approach to fostering a sustainable and innovation-driven economy.

The upcoming facility will be groundbreaking as the first industrial-scale plant globally to utilize Cemvita’s unique bioconversion technology. This technology will transform crude glycerol, a readily available byproduct, into low-carbon oil, which will then serve as a vital feedstock for SAF production. Simultaneously, the plant will produce the biofertilizer, FermNPK™, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices. This dual production model highlights a holistic approach to waste valorization and resource efficiency.

This strategic move by Cemvita is further strengthened by an existing partnership with Be8, a prominent biofuel pioneer also based in Rio Grande do Sul. This collaboration aims to fortify the entire SAF value chain, aligning with Be8’s long-term vision of becoming a leading provider of sustainable biofuel solutions. Such synergies are crucial for building a robust and resilient green energy ecosystem.

Rafael Prikladnicki, President of Invest RS, highlighted the pivotal role his organization played in facilitating this agreement: “The signing of this engagement agreement with Cemvita marks a strategic milestone for Rio Grande do Sul and reinforces our leadership in innovation and technology. Invest RS’s role is precisely to enable projects like this, connecting companies with our state and offering technical support and tailored solutions.” Invest RS offers comprehensive support, including specialized technical assistance, institutional coordination, value chain mapping, identification of suitable industrial areas, and assistance in securing economic and tax incentives.

Rio Grande do Sul was chosen strategically for this pioneering project due to its robust infrastructure, the ample availability of crude glycerol – a key raw material for Cemvita’s process – and its commendable track record in implementing low-carbon public policies.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-08-04 15:56:35.698507

Gallego cited volatility following the announcement of tariffs for North American points of sale. For that region, BA's corporate revenue in the second quarter was down 3 percent compared with a year prior, with a ""huge impact in April,"" but mainly because Easter this year was in the second quarter, he said.

""In terms of revenues, we are 8 percent ahead of last year and 38 percent in the first half compared to 2019.""

Despite the lower Q2 results, at least for British Airways, the company maintains its ""target to improve the business revenue for this year, even driven by North Atlantic that we see is recovering,"" Gallego said.

IAG Q2 Metrics

IAG reported second-quarter passenger revenue of nearly €7.8 billion, an increase of 4.9 percent year over year. Total revenue for the group was about €8.9 billion, up 6.8 percent from a year prior. Net income before taxes was €1.5 billion, up from more than €1.1 billion reported in Q2 2024. Second-quarter capacity increased 2.2 percent year over year, while load factor fell 1.3 percentage points to 85.4 percent.

British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia each posted year-over-year profit increases. Vueling's profit, however, fell €2 million to €95 million. BA recorded a £269 million uptick in profit to £824 million, driven by a 2.1 percent increase in capacity. This is despite the March 21 shutdown of its London Heathrow hub, which had an estimated adverse effect of £40 million.

The group said it will continue to invest in its core markets, namely the North Atlantic and Latin American markets, despite some ""weakness"" in U.S. point-of-sale economy leisure demand in the second quarter.

IAG secured more than 200,000 metric tons of sustainable aviation fuel in the year’s first half, marking a 25 percent year-over-year increase, according to its earnings presentation. It also inked a deal with Microsoft to reduce the latter's Scope 3 emissions from business travel.

The group’s full-year outlook includes projected capacity growth of 2.5 percent year over year, down from the 3 percent growth previously estimated, due to geopolitical uncertainties.

Fastmarkets assessed the export price for tallow, max 15% ffa, fob Santos unchanged week on week at $1,040-1,080 per tonne on Thursday.
“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.
That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.
Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.","An US executive order issued late on Wednesday exempted a list of Brazilian products and confirmed the 50% tariff on tallow, effective for products shipped from August 5. The news prompted speculation among market participants, but there was no immediate price reaction.

Fastmarkets assessed the export price for tallow, max 15% ffa, fob Santos unchanged week on week at $1,040-1,080 per tonne on Thursday.

No export deals were heard for September deliveries, but trading talks were held and lower bids from exporters for origination were reported before the executive order was signed.

Market participants noted that tanks at Santos and Rio Grande ports continued to receive tallow in the week, partly to accomplish contracts scheduled for August.

Fastmarkets heard a week earlier that three Brazilian companies sold 36,000 tonnes to US sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers using the US’s duty drawback system, which allows them to get back most of the tariff paid, as long as the finished product is exported.

“Previously agreed deliveries and contracts that had not been suspended in hopes the tariff would be eased will potentially keep the tallow market firm in August,” one source said.

It was uncertain whether new deals would be reached with the US under the 50% tariff or whether unsold volumes could be delivered to other destinations. Some exporters were still trying to find ways to offer the feedstock to Europe, sources said.

Some speculated on potential shipments to Argentina’s hygiene and oleochemical market, considering the country could export more tallow to the US if trading flows from Brazil decrease permanently.

The tallow market is one of the most affected by the tariff against Brazil, as nearly 97% of the exported volume has been sent to the US in 2025, customs data showed.

Domestic prices

Fastmarkets assessed the price for bleachable fancy tallow, max 3.5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) unchanged week on week at 6.20-6.50 Reais ($1.11-1.16) per kg.

Meanwhile, the main reference for Brazil’s biodiesel sector, bleachable fancy tallow, max 5% ffa, cif Sao Paulo (inclusive of 12% tax) was assessed at 6.10-6.30 Reais per kg, up from 6.00-6.20 Reais per kg a week earlier.

Sources told Fastmarkets that despite a recent decline in cattle slaughter in July following the US tariff announcement, production levels remained historically high.

That said, tallow supply in the domestic market remained reportedly tight, but not due to a real shortage, a source said.

“It seems more like a strategy by tallow producers to hold back supply in order to avoid sharp price declines,” the source told Fastmarkets.

Participants in the biodiesel sector said tallow prices were still paired with exports, which made it less competitive in the domestic market compared with soyoil.

The market expects increased demand for domestic feedstocks such as tallow and soyoil after the increase in the mandatory biodiesel blend in diesel from 14% to 15% (B15), which takes effect on August 1.

A source said the B15 blending mandate should not be expected to be felt in prices before October, as biodiesel producers currently have inventories.

“Since it takes about 40 days for the demand increase to take effect, that impact would likely not be seen in August and September,” they said.",https://www.fastmarkets.com/tachyon/2024/10/Ag_AnimalFats_BeefTallowBlock_AdobeStock_869070057-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-08-04 14:56:31.231833

Nanterre, 4 August 2025

VINCI wins major contract for innovative biofuel plant in Spain

Electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works for a major second-generation biofuel plant

A strategic project for the energy transition in Spain

Moeve and Apical have awarded Grupo Cobra and Masa - both subsidiaries of Cobra IS – the electrical, piping and industrial mechanical works of the largest second-generation (2G) biofuel plant in Spain.

Located in Palos de la Frontera (Huelva province), this plant, with an estimated total cost of €1.2 billion, will benefit from the synergies being located beside Moeve’s La Rábida Energy Park.

The new plant will have an annual production capacity of 500,000 tonnes of sustainable fuels, including SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) and HVO100 (renewable diesel). It will use agricultural waste and used cooking oils as raw materials.

Its design incorporates cutting-edge technologies to minimise environmental impact. In particular, it will rely exclusively on recylced water and will reduce CO₂ emissions by 75% compared to traditional plants, thereby avoiding the emission of nearly 3 million tonnes of CO₂ per year.

This ambitious and innovative project will consolidate Spain’s position as a leading player in clean energy. It reinforces Cobra IS’s commitment to the decarbonisation of transport in Europe.

In 2024, the VINCI Group generated a total revenue of €3.8 billion in Spain including €3.2 billion for Cobra IS, €0.3 billion for VINCI Energies and €0.3 billion for VINCI Construction.

A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney models four future scenarios for the industry.

These explore how geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, sustainability efforts and digitalization will shape the travel and tourism sector.

In the late 1950s, Frank Sinatra invited his beloved to “Come fly with me”. It evoked the faraway places burgeoning global air travel could take you to – something we all came to take for granted over the next seven decades. Until 2020, at least.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, travel and tourism became one of the hardest-hit sectors, but it is now back on track, with 7% growth in spending expected over the next decade. In the first quarter of 2025, international tourist arrivals grew by 5% compared to the previous year, led by travel to Asia Pacific and Africa.

Despite the rebound, the travel and tourism (T&T) industry now exists in a very different, more volatile world, shaped by a mix of geopolitical tensions, economic challenges, the move to more sustainable tourism and digitalization. A new white paper from the World Economic Forum and Kearney has modelled the interplay of these factors in four future scenarios.

Scenario 1: A thousand islands world

This scenario portrays a world characterized by geopolitical fragmentation and escalating global tensions that split it into “a thousand islands”.

Here, tourism spending will be curtailed by declining global trade, protectionist travel restrictions, stalling economic growth and reduced disposable incomes. Low-income destinations will feel the impact of these trends most acutely.

A drop in global air travel will help reduce aviation emissions. However, a shift to more regionalized travel between countries with harmonized and simplified entry requirements will drive up emissions from regional travel, including road and rail.

With less international travel, employment in areas such as aviation and cross-border services is predicted to drop off, making way for greater automation, while new jobs could emerge in regional travel.

Scenario 2: Harmonious horizons

The diametrical opposite of the “thousand islands” concept. This scenario is characterized by strong multilateral cooperation, trade liberalization and sustained GDP growth.

Visa liberalization and higher disposable incomes are expected to contribute to a nearly one-third (29%) surge in international tourist arrivals by 2030. Highlighting the potential for equitable growth, close to two-thirds of these (58%) will be from Global South economies, with significant contributions from India, Indonesia and Nigeria.

Tourism recruitment is expected to rise by nearly a third (29% compared to 2022), although labour shortages are likely to persist.

However, the surge in tourism will see aviation emissions rising, as adoption rates of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) remain too low to cover increased fuel demand.

Alongside, the risk of overtourism will increase, and measures like dynamic pricing will be needed to prevent environmental degradation.

Scenario 3: Green ascent

Here, the Forum maps out a world driven by decarbonization, stringent environmental regulation and environmentally-aware travellers looking for low-impact destinations and travel modes.

Substantial investments in low-carbon technologies and increased use of SAF will contribute to the success of this model, as will “high-value, low volume” experiences that reduce overtourism in popular holiday spots.

At the same time, regenerative tourism at eco-certified destinations becomes the preferred choice of more than two-thirds of tourists (68%). This preference also drives a shift to low-emission transport such as high-speed rail.

The scenario forecasts significant economic benefits such as green tourism jobs. However, it also warns of new trade-offs between sustainability and growth, for example the loss of tropical rainforest to the production of SAF.

Scenario 4: Tech turbulence

The final scenario juxtaposes hyper-accelerated technology adoption and fragmented economic recovery with uneven growth.

While the adoption of generative AI in T&T is expected to reach 78% by 2030, with advanced mobile networks covering most urban areas, a substantial digital divide will remain between regions.

Hybrid working using augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and virtual tourism are expected to grow. While driving down travel emissions, this trend will increase energy consumption from the underlying technology platforms.

Alongside, tourism will become polarized between high-end luxury travellers and mid-market tourists for whom dynamic pricing will increasingly threaten affordability.

Rapid technology adoption will also transform or automate 45% of T&T jobs, mainly routine tasks. However, automation will also create more than two million unfilled vacancies by 2030, making re-skilling in AI and AR/VR a priority across the sector.

Developing tailored strategies for travel and tourism

Each of the four scenarios will require tailored strategies to mitigate the associated risks, from overtourism and labour shortages to environmental degradation.

To navigate these four scenarios and shape a future that works for all, T&T leaders need to prioritize improved governance, workforce upskilling and innovative financing to meet investment needs. Public-private partnerships are crucial for funding, regenerative practices and digital transformation, making T&T resilient and a catalyst for equitable prosperity.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/2qQLBtA4hu1XXivJktP46OwLhuaSwtOyMJQF8U6xdys.png,N,,2025-08-04 11:56:25.813849

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially.
Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.","The Minnesota Star Tribune reported last fall that the first sustainable aviation fuel, made from a Minnesota-grown crop called winter camelina, powered a Delta Air Lines flight from the Twin Cities to New York City. It marked the beginning of a plan by Minnesota SAF Hub—a coalition including Bank of America, Delta, Ecolab, and Xcel Energy—to eventually convert all Delta flights from MSP to bio-based jet fuels to reduce greenhouse gases.

You may think the sole star of the show here is sustainable aviation fuel. But, as a long-ago radio personality used to say, now for the rest of the story.

By tapping into the market for plant-based aviation fuel, University of Minnesota researchers at the Forever Green Initiative are commercializing two oil-producing plants—winter camelina and domesticated pennycress—that can give farmers a payday for planting winter cover crops that hold soil, take up excess nutrients, and help protect the quality of Minnesota’s streams and groundwater.

Mitch Hunter, associate director of the University’s Forever Green Initiative, says “What we’re trying to do is develop crops that make farmers money, and in the process, provide all those environmental benefits that we’ve been trying to get to for so long with very little success.”

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) also recently awarded the University $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand project. It was selected as one of six projects working to “advance the production of low carbon intensity, purpose-grown energy crops critical to accelerating a clean energy bioeconomy.

From cover crops to jet fuel

This story really begins with “the big brown spot”—the vast agriculture region of the upper Midwest that stands barren from October through April, with nothing growing to protect the soil. “You can see the brown of this uncovered landscape from space,” says Hunter.

That bare earth is prone to wind and water erosion. Runoff of nutrients, especially nitrogen, into streams and groundwater fertilizes lakes, pollutes sources of drinking water, and contributes to the “dead zone” at the end of the Mississippi River. Says Hunter, “When soil has nothing living on it, rain falls, filters through the soil, and draws those nutrients directly into our waterways. You have to have a plant living there to take up the nitrogen and the phosphorus.”

The solution—plant something, anything, to hold soil and take up excess nutrients until the next cash crop is planted. A recent report by Forever Green partners, including consultants Ecotone Analytics and Friends of the Mississippi River, estimated that widespread use of cover crops could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23 percent and soil erosion by 35 percent by 2050.

But folks have promoted cover crops for a long time. “They get a lot of buzz, and they’re adopted in Minnesota on 2 or 3 percent of the total cropland, despite years and years and years of education and investment and incentives,” says Hunter. “So that model isn’t working.”

The problem? Cover crops take both time and money.

The many contributions of the Forever Green Initiative

So about 30 years ago, the late Don Wyse, Forever Green cofounder and codirector, began working with farmers to grow a perennial rye grass that not only anchors soil, but can be sold for commercial grass seed. Says Hunter, “All of a sudden, you transformed the cropping systems in that region to have perennial cover for a large part of the rotation, and it was all because they developed a crop that actually made farmers money.”

Wyse and his colleagues went prospecting for other potentially profitable cover crops. Of 15 or so, two are pertinent to our story today. The first is winter camelina, an old crop from Europe related to cabbage, kale, broccoli, and canola. Like canola, it produces tiny seeds with an oil content as high as 35 percent. The other is pennycress, a new crop bred from a ubiquitous weed. Like camelina, it is rich in oil, exceptionally winter hardy, and even quicker to grow and mature.

Forever Green’s plan is to target the more than 2 million acres in Minnesota used to raise spring wheat, corn silage, alfalfa, and small grains—crops that are harvested in early fall. Then farmers can plant winter camelina or pennycress, let it grow through late fall, winter, and early spring, and harvest the oil seed crop in late spring before planting the next cash grain crop.

But how to market camelina or pennycress oil seeds to get a good price? Selling them for food-grade oil means competing with a lot of well-established oils like canola and sunflower. Sustainable diesel fuel is a possibility, but ground transportation seems to be moving toward electrification.

Enter sustainable aviation fuel, a use that’s growing exponentially. Aviation accounts for about 2 percent of global emission of the carbon dioxide that drives climate change, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Like other fields of transportation, aviation seeks to reduce its fossil fuel use.

Trains, trucks, and automobiles have been able to replace internal combustion engines with electric motors and massive banks of batteries. Unfortunately, in the air, every ounce counts—so aviation has looked to fuels from renewable biological sources such as used cooking fat and dedicated energy crops.

Sustainable aviation fuel makes up only about 0.1 percent of total jet fuel burned today, but the hope is to meet much more of the country’s aviation fuel needs with sustainable products in the future.

Hunter adds that state incentives and private support will continue to further the development of sustainable fuels and environmentally beneficial farming practices.",https://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/jet-fuel-crops.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:15.388548

The commercial aviation industry is experiencing notable growth due to various factors such as the expansion of global trade, economic advancement, and enhanced connectivity. This growth directly leads to an increased need for fuel systems in commercial aircraft.

Furthermore, airlines are enlarging their fleets globally in response to the growing demand for air travel. For instance, in May 2023, Ryanair, a budget carrier based in Ireland, announced its intention to purchase an additional 300 new Boeing 737 Max aircraft. This strategic decision is part of the objective of Ryanair to reach an annual passenger count of 300 million. The agreement with Boeing initially involves an order for 150 aircraft, with the option to acquire an additional 150 aircraft in the future. By operating approximately 3,000 flights daily throughout Europe, this expansion is projected to further solidify the position of Ryanair within the aviation industry. These expansions necessitate the procurement of aircraft fuel systems.

Based on region, Asia-Pacific held the highest market share in terms of revenue in 2021, accounting for nearly one-third of the global aircraft fuel systems market revenue. Also, the same region is expected to witness the fastest CAGR of 7.2% from 2022 to 2031 and is likely to dominate the market during the forecast period. This is owing to the huge population of Asia-Pacific and the percentage of the population that has enough disposable income to make air travel a viable proposition.

This means we now operate up to 11 flights per week to Dallas, five times a week to Los Angeles, five times a week to Seattle, and daily services to Chicago and New York, JFK. The strategic rationale is straightforward: we see an opportunity to capture a larger share of the market, particularly given our unique geographical position and operational strengths.

GSW: How much of a factor is Finland's geographical location to Finnair Cargo's opportunities and challenges?

Kirchner: Historically, Finland offered the shortest route from Europe to Asia by flying over Russia. However, the pandemic hit first, followed by the closure of Russian airspace. This presented a double crisis for us. Being only 200 kilometers from St. Petersburg and sharing a 1,300-kilometer border with Russia, this closure significantly impacted our direct routes.

Despite not being the largest carrier globally - we operate around 80 aircraft - we consider ourselves a niche carrier that's incredibly fast and agile in adapting our strategy. We've continued to fly to Asia by either taking a southern route or, more uniquely, a North Pole route back, flying over Alaska. This requires significant operational adaptation based on demand and geopolitical realities. While other Western and European carriers face similar challenges, our proximity to Russia means the extended flight times affect us more acutely.

GSW: What defines Finnair's niche in the air cargo market?

Kirchner: Our niche is specialized cargo, particularly in the cool chain. We are one of the largest transporters of salmon, shipping over 100,000 kilos of seafood daily, primarily from northern Norway, trucked down to Helsinki, and then flown to Asia and the US. Our entire operation is built around maintaining the cool chain. Our state-of-the-art cool terminal, opened in 2018, combines automation with human expertise and latest technology.

Our focus is on being a premium carrier. We don't aim to be the cheapest; instead, we prioritize quality and reliability. Our customers consistently acknowledge us as a premium product, trusting us to handle their shipments, especially sensitive cargo like pharmaceuticals, with the utmost care. This commitment to quality and specialization truly defines our niche.

GSW: Maintaining a successful cool chain operation involves significant technological and logistical integration. What do you see as the recipe for achieving this effectively?

Kirchner: A majority of our success stems from our technology supported hub and handling team in Helsinki. The technology within our COOL terminal is cutting-edge. However, the location of Helsinki itself plays a crucial role; it's a non-congested hub. Unlike mega-hubs in Europe such as Amsterdam or Frankfurt, which can experience bottlenecks for smaller shipments, our automation and lower congestion ensure smoother, more efficient handling, regardless of shipment size.

GSW: How do Finnish societal values and government policies inform Finnair's philosophy, particularly regarding employee welfare and operational efficiency?

Kirchner: Our government has a 55.8% ownership stake in the company, and this influence is evident in how we operate. We prioritize work-life balance for our employees; for instance, performance reviews begin by asking about work-life balance. Our regular working week is approximately 37 hours and we encourage rest to maintain energy.

A key Finnish trait reflected at Finnair is decentralized decision-making. We empower employees at various levels to make decisions, which allows us to react quickly to business opportunities. This ""one voice"" approach means everyone is accountable for their decisions, fostering a sense of ownership and agility.

Our longevity as one of the oldest carriers, established in 1923, is also a testament to this resilient and forward-thinking spirit. We've navigated challenges like the pandemic and airspace closure by constantly adapting and innovating. This cultural foundation contributes significantly to our positive and productive work environment.

GSW: Finnair appears to be very progressive in terms of gender equality and employee support. How do these principles manifest within the company, especially concerning family leave and career development?

Kirchner: It stems from a long-standing cultural ethos in Finland, where equal opportunity is a fundamental principle. For example, Finnish law allows for up to three years of maternity leave with job security, and free daycare facilities are strategically located near homes or workplaces to ease the transition back to work for mothers.

Crucially, this isn't just about women; it's about equal opportunity for all. We have male colleagues who take extended paternity leave, demonstrating a truly egalitarian approach. Our internal job rotation program is another example. We encourage employees to experience different departments, like moving from operations to revenue management or sales. This provides a 360-degree view of the business, fostering a deeper understanding and better collaboration, which ultimately benefits our cargo operations.

GSW: As an employer, how significant is Finnair within Finland, and what contributes to the strong loyalty among its employees?

Kirchner: Finnair is a very large employer in Finland, with around 6,000 employees. While this might not seem huge by American standards, for a country of 5.5 million people, it's substantial. We are consistently ranked among the top five most favorite employers in Finland, reflecting a strong brand and deep employee pride.

Employee loyalty is remarkable. I have colleagues who have been with the company for 20+ years. Many have received lucrative offers from other carriers, including those in the Middle East, but they choose to stay. This loyalty is attributed to a strong ""Finnair DNA"" - a positive, supportive, and empowering work environment that makes people feel valued and connected to the company's mission.

Q: How does Finnair balance technology and human expertise to maintain its premium service, especially with the increasing adoption of AI in the industry?

Kirchner: It's a balance of both. While we leverage technology extensively, including AI-supported forecasting for staffing and resource allocation, the cornerstone is our modern terminal that combines automation with the know-how of our cargo experts. The technology is only as good as the people operating it, which makes our human expertise critical.

We actively promote internal rotation among our cargo teams. For instance, someone from operations might spend a year in revenue management or sales. This cross-functional experience gives our team members a holistic understanding of the entire cargo

ecosystem, enabling them to connect the dots and anticipate needs more effectively. This unique approach, while less common in other companies, is something we actively encourage, fostering a highly knowledgeable and adaptable workforce that complements our technological capabilities.

GSW: Sustainability is a critical focus for the aviation industry. What initiatives is Finnair undertaking in this area, particularly within its cargo operations?

Kirchner: Sustainability is a significant priority, and Finnair is committed to advancing sustainable development in the industry. We have a dedicated sustainability manager for cargo and we work on various initiatives:

Waste Reduction: We are investigating processes to repair and re-audit cargo straps and nets used for cargo handling, preventing them from being discarded prematurely. While not cheaper, it significantly reduces waste.

Renewable Energy: Our COOL terminal in Helsinki is equipped with 2,990 solar panels, making it the second-largest solar panel field in Finland. These panels supply 37% of our electricity needs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): In Europe, a 2% SAF mandate is in place, meaning we're obligated to use this blend. We're actively partnering with fuel suppliers like Neste (headquartered in Finland) and freight forwarders, such as our recent important deal with DB Schenker, where they voluntarily purchased SAF with us. This helps both us and our partners meet their emission reduction targets (Scope 3).

We view sustainability not as a distant goal but as an urgent reality. We're actively collaborating with other airlines and forwarders to achieve the industry goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, emphasizing education and collective action.

GSW: Looking ahead, what do you envision for the future of Finnair Cargo, in terms of opportunities and overarching goals for the organization?

Kirchner: We anticipate organic growth for Finnair. We are still integrating additional A350 aircraft, which are excellent for cargo and contribute to our sustainability goals. Our immediate focus is on fine-tuning our current flight network. The geopolitical situation remains a key factor that will shape future developments.

The air cargo industry is inherently dynamic - when it goes up, it goes up significantly, and when it goes down, it goes down significantly; there's rarely a ""normal."" This dynamism makes it incredibly interesting. At Finnair, our smaller, agile organization allows us to react quickly to market changes and seize opportunities. We are confident in our ability to adapt and continue our positive organic growth, making it an exciting time to be in this industry with Finnair.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/07/68810933cb3994a5848529fb-annakirchner_1.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-08-04 10:56:27.228886

Since the beginning of the 7th Administration, South Africa embarked on a process to stabilise and enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations with the US. The aim has been to address long-standing bilateral issues of concern for both sides in ways that move the trade relations forward. South Africa has been engaging the US at various levels with a view to ensure predictability in trade. However, even with these efforts, the US decided to impose a 30% unilateral tariff on South Africa. It is unfortunate that this government’s efforts in resetting the relationship with the US has been undermined by some actors within South African society.

The unilateral tariffs have been implemented notwithstanding, South Africa’s submission of a comprehensive and ambitious Framework Deal in May 2025 aimed at addressing the US trade deficit, address tariffs, promote digital trade, enhance commercial relations, promote investment and eliminate non-tariff barriers to enhance mutually beneficial trade relations with the United States.

The 30% unilateral tariffs on foreign imports apply to various US trading partners which will be implemented from 12:01 am on 8 August 2025. The Executive order published by the United States clarifies that goods loaded onto a vessel at the port of loading and in transit on the final mode of transit before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time 8 August 2025, and entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, before 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 5, 2025, shall not be subject to such additional duty and shall instead remain subject to the 10% tariff.

The US is South Africa’s third biggest trading partner, with the European Union and China being the first and second largest trading partners. The US accounts for 7.5% of our global exports. Thus, we will continue to engage the US with a view to conclude a deal that advances the interests of both countries. South Africa seeks to conclude deals that promote value addition and industrialisation, rather than extractive relations that deprive the country of the ability to beneficiate our mineral wealth by mimicking extractive colonial era trade relations.

South Africa’s minimal 0.25% share of total US imports makes the 30% tariff on our country are inscrutable, especially when these same tariffs have been applied indiscriminately to all US trading partners globally. Moreover, South Africa poses no trade threat to the US economy nor its national security. The calculation of US-SA “trade deficit” ignores the substantial US trade surplus in services, as well as the complementary nature of the bilateral trade and investment relations between the two countries.

South African exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry. On the contrary, our exports are crucial inputs that support America’s own industrial base. Our agriculture exports are even counter-seasonal, meaning they fill gaps in the US market, not replace domestic products.

South Africa isn’t just a trading partner—we’re a major investor in the US, with our companies sustaining American jobs. Similarly, over 600 US companies in South Africa contribute to our industrial growth and create employment. Our goal is to preserve and grow these mutually beneficial relationships.

Impact of the tariffs

The uncertainty of the new tariff line is already incorporated into economic projections. For example, various economists estimated that it may shave off 0,2% of South Africa’s economic growth. The reduction in growth from the 30% tariff depends on a number of factors, including our ability to find alternative markets. It should be noted, however, that 35% of SA exports remain exempted from the tariffs. All applicable exceptions covered in the previous US Executive Order are set to remain in force and these exceptions covers products such as copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, stainless steel scrap and energy and energy products.

Importantly, due to South Africa not enjoying a country exemption for Section 232 duties on steel and aluminium, South African companies have already adjusted to the Section 232 duties since 2018. However, the heightened policy uncertainty creates instability in trade and may have an impact on exports.

The new tariff regime implemented by the United States is a significant departure from a low-tariff environment. This policy shift, which affects not only South Africa but the entire world, has already led to higher tariffs than before, changing the landscape of global trade as we know it.

Response measures

Continuation of negotiations with the US

South Africa is committed to a principled approach, and we will continue to use all available diplomatic channels to negotiate a mutually beneficial trade deal with the United States one that respects our national interests while advancing our long-standing partnership. Such a deal will be pursued in a pragmatic manner that preserves regional integration and the SACU common external tariff, noting that SACU accounts for 9% of our global exports and must be preserved.

The South African Government is working with industry to consider aspects of the Framework Deal that can be modified, in a manner that promotes predictability in trade.

Implement an Economic Response Package which includes:

a.) The establishment of an Export Support Desk, which will serve as a direct point of contact for companies affected by the US tariff hike. The aim of this support measure is to support the diversification of export markets for increased resilience and facilitate the entry into alternative markets for affected exporters. The Desk will provide updates on developments and tailored advisory services to exporters on alternative destinations, guidance on market entry processes, insights into compliance requirements and linkages to South African Embassies and High Commissions abroad. The contact details of the Export Support Desk have been published on the dtic website.

b.) Measures to assist companies to absorb the tariff and facilitate long-term resilience and growth strategies to protect jobs and productive capacity in South Africa. The details of these are being finalised and will be communicated shortly.

c.) Localisation Fund Support (LSF) stands ready to contribute to the national effort to support South African companies impacted by the imposition of 30% import tariffs by the United States. In collaboration with the dtic, IDC and other agencies – LSF will issue an open call from firms operating in affected value chains, with the aim of providing targeted competitiveness and efficiency support.

d.) To build resilience, we are working on an Export and Competitiveness Support Programme (ECSP), which will include a working capital facility and plant and equipment facility to address short to medium term needs across all industries.

e.) We are also working with the Department of Labour on measures to mitigate potential job losses, using existing instruments such as the UIF that can be adjusted to respond to the current challenges.

Block exemption for exporters

The diversification of markets that will be required following the introduction of additional tariffs on South African goods may require exporters to coordinate their activities in relation to developing joint infrastructure for exports, sharing of market information and coordination of activities to achieve economies of scale and efficiencies that enable them to be competitive.

These activities may contravene the provision of the Competition Act. The Minister has following consultations with the Competition Commission, introduced a Block Exemption for Exporters to enable collaboration and coordination by competitors. The Block Exemption details the scope of application. A draft Block Exemption will be published by the end of the week so that the process can be concluded expeditiously.

Diversification of markets

We have been strengthening trade and investment partnerships with various trade partners. These efforts are bearing fruits, targeting markets across Africa, as well as in Asia, Europe, Middle East, and Americas.

Our announcement on the Clean Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union in March has unlocked a R90 Billion Investment Package that has been initially committed. This Clean Trade and Investment Partnership also aims to unlock new market access opportunities for South Africa, including the export of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by Sasol and the exports of hybrids and Electric Vehicles.

While facing global trade challenges, South Africa is proactively building a more resilient agricultural sector. We’ve made significant progress in opening up vast new markets like China and Thailand, securing vital protocols for products like citrus and others. With China alone being a $200 billion market, we are confidently expanding our reach and creating new opportunities for our agricultural producers.

Our government has not been idle; we are proactively and collaboratively diversifying our trade portfolio. Under the coordinated leadership of the Presidency, DIRCO, and the dtic, we’re making significant inroads into new, high-growth markets across Asia and the Middle East, including the UAE, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These efforts are not only opening doors to new opportunities but also reinforcing our commitment to retaining the vital markets we already have. South Africa’s economic future is resilient, and we are working tirelessly to secure it.

We have also developed a number of Trade and Investment Packages with a number of countries, including Japan that aim to unlock new market access opportunities.

While the current measures present challenges, it also presents opportunities to build and accelerate the implementation of the AfCFTA and to develop new partnerships in markets that have remained untapped, including ASEAN and Türkiye.

Under this plan, which has been heavily backed by the incumbent Labour government, Heathrow could see its capacity expand to 756,000 flights per year. That is up from its current limit of 480,000 flights.

But the push for a third runway is not new, and has been the target of serious and disruptive opposition from pressure groups in the past. With shifting approaches towards climate action, and greater prominence of ‘sustainable’ aviation solutions, what pressure landscape will Heathrow face this time around?

Pressure on Aviation is growing globally

Since 2024, the volume of global pressure campaigns targeting the Aviation & Aerospace industry have been approaching levels not seen since the COVID pandemic.

Climate change, air pollution, and opposition to development remain the top issues driving pressure on the industry.

Concerns around weapons exports have also dogged aerospace manufacturers in recent years.

Attitudes towards Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Heathrow’s ‘shovel-ready plan’ includes a provision to reduce carbon emissions, and reach net zero by 2050, through its use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Pressure narratives around Sustainable Aviation Fuel began in 2020, and debates on the proposed solution are growing. H1 2025 saw more SAF-focused campaigns than all 12 months of 2024.

The role of SAF in aviation decarbonisation is polarizing among pressure campaigners. A narrative analysis of SIGWATCH data reveals that:

Such a split in attitudes in pressure campaigns is unusual, particularly when many tech-focused climate solutions are deemed to be ‘false solutions’ and ‘distractions’ by environmental groups.

What does this mean for Heathrow & the Aviation industry?

This new proposal for Heathrow’s expansion is being released into a dramatically different pressure ecosystem than previous attempts.

Scrutiny of the industry is up, but the types of campaigns likely to be provoked by this announcement will look different to the Extinction Rebellion-style direct action that we would have seen several years ago.

Split views around solutions such as SAF indicate more space for pragmatism, but opposition will likely continue through different stakeholder channels.

With European climate policymakers eyeing aviation taxation as a lucrative and underused tool, a fierce debate has reignited between environmental campaigners and the airline industry over how to fund decarbonisation fairly and effectively.

A new policy briefing from Carbon Market Watch (CMW) claims that a full expansion of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) to cover all departing and arriving flights, private jets, and aviation’s non-CO₂ climate impacts could raise nearly €500 billion between now and 2040. That figure is nearly five times the revenue expected under the EU-ETS’s currently limited scope.

The environmental NGO says these reforms are not only overdue, but also have strong public backing. Citing Eurobarometer polling and other research, CMW notes that over 75% of EU citizens support ending fossil fuel subsidies, including for kerosene. Most believe public funds should be directed to clean energy, and view the current exemption of aviation from fuel taxes as unfair.

“It is scandalous that the aviation industry has skirted paying for its climate impacts for so long,” says Bastien Bonnet-Cantalloube, CMW’s policy expert on the decarbonisation of aviation. “The upcoming EU-ETS review can set aviation on a decarbonisation flightpath and generate greater revenue to fund the bloc’s climate policies.”

Aviation taxation: Proposals on the table

CMW’s recommendations, backed by research from consultancy Carbone 4, include:

Extending the EU ETS to all flights departing and arriving in the EEA

Including non-CO₂ effects (such as contrail-induced warming and NOx emissions), with a proposed multiplier of 2x

Applying a 4x carbon multiplier to private jet emissions, reflecting their disproportionately high emissions per passenger

Doubling support for e-kerosene development, funded through auctioned allowances

The report estimates that, under an expanded scope, the ETS could cover 130 million tonnes of CO₂ emissions annually by 2030, compared to just 54 million today.

That would not only help bridge Europe’s €8 billion annual clean aviation investment gap, but also contribute substantially to international climate finance and rail infrastructure improvements.

IATA pushes back on unfair aviation taxation

However, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has pushed back, arguing that additional taxes on aviation, including those targeting business class or private jets, could undermine the sector’s ability to invest in long-term decarbonisation.

The association spoke out against the Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLTF), which has proposed a broad menu of 16 potential levies to raise around $90 billion annually. This includes a premium air travel levy, a fuel levy for private aircraft and a frequent flyer tax.

IATA warned that such taxes “do not reduce emissions” and risk “diverting funds away from the technologies and solutions that will.” The organisation continues to back CORSIA, the global carbon offsetting scheme developed by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), as the appropriate international mechanism.

“The airline industry is an economic catalyst, not a cash cow,” says Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General. “Yet governments casually suggest a tax on flyers that is three times the airline industry’s annual profit without considering the real-world side effects for an industry that is a lifeline for remote communities, invigorates tourism markets and links local products to global markets.”

IATA argues that regional schemes like the ETS, especially if significantly expanded or duplicated by new levies, could fragment climate governance and erode international consensus.

“Airlines are not evading doing their part to mitigate the impacts of climate change. The industry is doing everything possible to achieve net-zero carbon emissions,” continues Walsh. “The last thing these efforts need is a USD90 billion gut punch of a tax.”

The future of the EU-ETS

The EU is preparing for a 2026 revision of the ETS Directive, which will revisit scope, pricing, and revenue allocation rules. In parallel, member states are working on the bloc’s 2028–2034 budget, including possible new own-resource revenues.

At the heart of the debate is not just how to price emissions, but how to spend the proceeds. Carbon Market Watch proposes that a portion of ETS revenue should be ringfenced for:

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, with a strict focus on e-kerosene

Rail infrastructure upgrades to replace short-haul flights

Transition support for aviation workers and the least developed countries

The group argues that expanding aviation carbon pricing could generate ten times the revenue needed to fund SAF development alone.

Whether that vision wins political support remains to be seen. But with mounting climate commitments, lagging airline emissions reductions, and a patchwork of global policy tools, the EU may be running out of reasons, and time, not to act.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/viktor-forgacs-hBJIdtTOmeE-unsplash-1024x674.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:40.890833

The plant is located within LG Chem’s Daesan Chemical Complex in Seosan, Chungcheongnam-do, approximately 80km south-west of capital Seoul.

The joint venture, LG-Eni BioRefining, is overseeing the project, which aims for completion by 2027. Upon completion, the facility will process around 400,000 tons (t) of renewable bio-feedstock annually.

The demand for HVO and SAF is anticipated to increase due to global renewable fuel mandates. The fuels are produced by hydrogenating sustainable vegetable oils such as used cooking oil and other waste residues, using Ecofining technology developed by Eni in collaboration with Honeywell UOP.

Compared to traditional fossil fuels, HVO and SAF significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the entire product value chain.

LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol said: “LG Chem is transforming its portfolio to build a low-carbon foundation that ensures both a progressively more sustainable growth and profitability.

“By advancing innovation in renewable fuels and biobased feedstocks like HVO, we aim to strengthen our global competitiveness and meet our customers’ evolving needs efficiently.”

The establishment of this facility marks a significant move for LG Chem in the renewable energy sector. By integrating HVO into its supply chain, the company aims to broaden its range of International Sustainability and Carbon Certification PLUS-certified products.

These products target applications in various sectors, including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for electronics and cars, ethylene-vinyl acetate for sporting goods, and superabsorbent polymers for hygiene products.

Enilive CEO Stefano Ballista said: “The Seosan biorefinery breaking ground reaffirms Enilive’s strategy in offering increasingly sustainable products and our company’s position as a leader in biofuels production.

“Together with the plants that are already operational in Italy and in the US, and with new biorefining plants under construction in Italy and Malaysia, the upcoming biorefining plant in Daesan will contribute to reach our 2030 target to increase our biorefining capacity to over five million tons per year, with the potential to produce more than two million tons per year of SAF.”",https://live-b2b-gdm-figaro1.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/sites/26/2025/08/LG-Chem.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 10:56:51.080105

In a press release published Monday, LeGrand said that the new name was also selected to capitalize on opportunities in the energy sector and reflect the organization’s work in both the grains and ethanol markets, while also preserving existing brand recognition.

“We're working in the SAF space, sustainable aviation fuel,” LeGrand said. “And then sustainable marine fuel is one that's starting to pop up on a lot of people's radars.”

Bioproducts encompass more than just ethanol, LeGrand said, adding that the new name should reflect the group’s work on the latest and future biofuels and, therefore, have staying power.

“It's a name that we're thinking will hold for another 30 years,” LeGrand said. “We looked at a lot of different options. And really landed on this one that we don't feel boxes us in to just one or two products.""

The name change is the culmination of a two-year process, LeGrand said, which included market research firms testing reactions to a name change.

The organization has been known as the U.S. Grains Council since 1998 – when it changed its name from the U.S. Feed Grains Council. That change was to expand the organization’s work to include coarse grains and co-products, the organization says.

The council was originally established in 1960 and has expanded to offer programs promoting exports across more than 50 countries and the European Union, with offices in nine countries.

Among the council’s victories have been its contribution to the establishment of Vietnam as a prominent U.S. export destination for U.S. grain. The council led one of the first farmer trade missions to the country in 1998, according to the organization’s website.

The council was also quick to capitalize on China’s economic opening in the 1970s, opening a cooperator office with the American Soybean Association and U.S. Wheat Associates.",https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/2023/51368441274_c5754a7bfe_k-(1).jpg?height=635&t=1754312695&width=1200,N,,2025-08-04 13:56:33.060763

The recent announcement from SAS is one of those moments.

Their decision to bring the E195-E2 into their fleet is a strong endorsement of what the E2 family represents: performance, efficiency, and a clear path toward more sustainable operations. But it also speaks to something bigger — the growing momentum behind Embraer’s vision for the future of aviation.

One of the reasons airlines are turning to the E2 is its smart commonality. The E190-E2 and E195-E2 share 100% of parts, and both maintain 30% commonality with the first-generation E-Jets. That means less complexity, faster crew training, and lower maintenance costs — all without compromising performance.

And when it comes to sustainability, the E2, the most efficient small narrowbody, sets a new standard. Compared to the previous generation, it delivers up to 29% lower fuel burn and up to 68% less noise — real, measurable gains that are already making a difference. The aircraft has also been successfully tested with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and full certification is on the horizon. This isn’t just about meeting targets, it’s about leading responsibly, in ways that are being recognized by airlines and industry leaders around the world.

With Copenhagen Airport (CPH) serving as a strategic connectivity hub for SAS, the introduction of the E195-E2 not only enhances the airline’s ability to efficiently link Scandinavia and its international network but also unlocks future growth opportunities.

Lower gas prices. More energy independence. Stronger farms. Cleaner air. What’s not to like? These results are the proven outcomes of a groundbreaking bipartisan energy policy established twenty years ago, which continues to deliver benefits today.

Friday, Aug. 8 marks the 20th anniversary of the Renewable Fuel Standard, and we’re proud of RFA’s long history of developing, supporting, and resolutely defending this successful landmark policy. Created to promote U.S. energy independence, the RFS requires transportation fuel sold in the U.S. to contain annually increasing volumes of renewable fuels like ethanol and biomass-based diesel.

Click here for RFA’s new report summarizing the successes of the Renewable Fuel Standard.

The effects of this policy speak for themselves. It has helped lower fuel prices for American families, reduced our dependence on foreign oil, revitalized farm economies, and cut greenhouse gas emissions and tailpipe pollution—all while building a domestic energy sector that is cleaner and more competitive, diverse and resilient.

Like any major public policy, the RFS has certainly faced challenges, including fluctuating market dynamics, regulatory uncertainty, and evolving political and environmental priorities. But the core value proposition remains clear: By expanding the availability of American-made renewable fuels, the RFS supports our national interests economically and environmentally.

As the United States continues to chart a course toward a more secure and diversified energy future, the RFS can serve as a foundational model of a policy that bridges economic development and environmental responsibility. Far from being a relic of early-2000s energy policy, as some opponents like to claim, the RFS is a living example of how thoughtful, bipartisan legislation can deliver long-term, multi-dimensional benefits.

In celebrating two decades of the RFS, we also look ahead—to new innovations in production methods and fuel technologies that will continue to lower emissions, support farmers and deliver value to everyday Americans.

Heathrow’s proposed third runway remains one of the UK’s most high-profile and controversial infrastructure projects, with ongoing debate over its environmental and economic impacts.","Following Heathrow Airport’s submission of ‘shovel-ready’ plans for a third runway, trade union Unite has called on the UK government to move beyond verbal support and ensure construction starts without delay.

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham welcomed the proposals and the government’s continued endorsement of the expansion but stressed that ministers must now “put their words into action.”

Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said:

Unite welcomes Heathrow’s plans and is pleased that the government continues to support building a third runway. Now ministers must put their words into action and ensure that construction begins as quickly as possible.

A third runway must be about more than just improving infrastructure – it must provide real material benefits to the thousands of workers who will build and run it. That means ensuring that the jobs created are well-paid and unionised.

Heathrow’s commitment to using UK produced steel is also welcome and must not be watered down. All national infrastructure projects should be using UK steel - no ifs, no buts.

Graham also highlighted the opportunity for Heathrow’s expansion to align with broader industrial and environmental strategies, particularly in the aviation sector’s transition to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

She criticised the lack of plans to convert the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland to SAF production, describing it as “outrageous” given the potential to preserve jobs and strengthen the UK’s industrial base.

Graham added:

As well as providing much needed support to our steel industry, the expansion at Heathrow must be accompanied by joined up thinking when it comes to the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) planes must soon start using.

Scotland’s Grangemouth refinery is ideally suited to transition to SAF production and it is frankly outrageous that there currently are no plans for this to happen when it would safeguard hundreds of jobs and bolster UK industry.

Heathrow’s proposed third runway remains one of the UK’s most high-profile and controversial infrastructure projects, with ongoing debate over its environmental and economic impacts.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province.
It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.
LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth.
“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.","LG Chem has begun construction on Korea’s first hydrotreated vegetable oil production facility, furthering the company’s strategy to bring the supply of eco-friendly raw materials in-house amid rising global demand for sustainable alternatives.

The company announced Monday that construction has started on the HVO plant in Seosan, South Chungcheong Province. Once completed in 2027, the facility is expected to produce 300,000 tons of HVO annually.

HVO, sometimes called green diesel, is produced by using hydrogen to break down vegetable oils, particularly used cooking oil, into smaller molecules. The concept is similar to biodiesel but the different chemistry of the resulting fuel means it is more stable and performs better at low temperatures.

While HVO has around 10 percent lower energy density than petroleum diesel, its proponents claim it can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90 percent. It is used in various applications, including sustainable aviation fuel, car fuel and bio-naphtha — a versatile feedstock in the chemical industry.

LG Chem plans to utilize HVO not only for biofuel production but also to expand its eco-friendly plastics business, which it sees as a core driver of future growth. The company aims to convert bio-naphtha into high-performance plastics used in home appliances, automobiles, sporting goods and hygiene products.

“LG Chem is transforming its business portfolio toward low-carbon models, aiming for both sustainable growth and improved profitability,” said LG Chem CEO Shin Hak-cheol.

“We will continue to drive technological innovation and commercialization in eco-friendly fuel and bio-resources, including HVO, to strengthen our global competitiveness and respond proactively to customer demand.”

The Seosan facility is being developed through a 50:50 joint venture with Italian energy firm Eni, which currently produces 2 million tons of HVO annually at its facilities in Italy and has an extensive global supply network.

An LG Chem official said the new facility will provide the company with more affordable access to bio-based feedstocks for its chemical manufacturing operations, which until now have largely relied on imports from global suppliers.

Competition to secure sustainable raw materials is intensifying worldwide, as companies seek to meet growing customer expectations and regulatory requirements.

According to Fortune Business Insights, the global HVO market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of around 8.2 percent, expanding from approximately $21.36 billion in 2025 to $36.86 billion by 2032.

Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.","Minahasa Selatan, Sulut, ruangenergi.com-Transisi energi di Indonesia tidak bisa hanya ditopang oleh satu pilar. Jika kita ingin mencapai target emisi nol bersih (net zero emission) pada 2060, maka strategi nasional harus ditopang oleh dua kaki utama: elektrifikasi berbasis energi terbarukan dan penguatan energi alternatif non-listrik seperti bioenergi, hidrogen, amonia, hingga carbon capture.

Sejauh ini, sektor elektrifikasi melalui PLN dan proyek-proyek berbasis EBT (Energi Baru Terbarukan) memang telah berjalan cukup progresif. Program 5 GW energi hijau dari PLN tiap tahun—dengan nilai investasi mencapai 6–7 miliar dolar AS—adalah langkah besar. Namun, kaki kedua, yakni sektor bioenergi, biofuel, bioetanol, green ammonia, hingga sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), masih belum mendapatkan ruang regulasi dan dukungan yang memadai.

Padahal, sektor non-listrik ini adalah kekuatan besar Indonesia. Pertamina, misalnya, memiliki kompetensi dan infrastruktur kuat dalam ekosistem biofuel dan energi molekular lainnya. Bioetanol, biodiesel, hingga green hydrogen bukan lagi sekadar opsi, tapi merupakan fondasi percepatan transisi energi di sektor transportasi, industri, dan maritim.

Direktur Proyek dan Operasi PT Pertamina NRE, Norman Ginting, menekankan pentingnya keseimbangan strategi nasional.

“Transisi energi harus dijalankan dengan pendekatan dua kaki. Elektrifikasi memang penting, tapi pengembangan bioenergi dan teknologi molekular tak kalah krusial untuk dekarbonisasi sektor-sektor yang tidak bisa dialiri listrik langsung,” ujar Norman kepada ruangenergi.com di sela-sela kunjungan ke PLTP Lahendong , Kamis(31/07/2025), di Sulawesi Utara.

Sayangnya, proses regulasi dan perencanaan energi nasional saat ini masih cenderung berat sebelah. Banyak potensi bioenergi belum tergarap secara optimal. Negara-negara produsen minyak seperti Brasil dan Arab Saudi bahkan telah bergerak lebih cepat melalui penguatan bioekonomi dan pengembangan SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Dua Lokomotif, Satu Tujuan

Norman bercerita, transisi energi tidak akan stabil jika hanya ditarik oleh satu lokomotif. PLN dan Pertamina harus menjadi dua mesin penggerak utama. Keduanya mewakili dua sisi strategi besar: elektrifikasi dan dekarbonisasi molekular. Pemerintah perlu menjamin bahwa kolaborasi antara keduanya berlangsung harmonis dan berimbang.

Namun dua kaki ini saja tidak cukup. Diperlukan peran aktif dari sektor swasta sebagai inovator, akselerator, sekaligus penyandang modal. Sayangnya, belum ada ekosistem kolaboratif yang benar-benar inklusif. Sektor swasta masih minim keterlibatannya dalam desain besar transisi energi nasional.

Regulasi Harus Dipercepat

Salah satu kunci utama adalah percepatan regulasi. Menurut Norman, dukungan terhadap bioenergi, green fuel, dan teknologi non-listrik seperti carbon capture dan green ammonia harus dituangkan ke dalam kebijakan yang jelas, insentif yang menarik, serta roadmap yang terukur dan realistis.

Regulasi yang kuat juga akan menjadi sinyal positif bagi para investor. Tanpa kepastian hukum dan kebijakan, baik investor lokal maupun global akan ragu untuk masuk. Transisi energi tidak boleh menjadi domain eksklusif BUMN saja—ini adalah proyek nasional yang harus melibatkan semua pihak.

Kesimpulan: Transisi Energi Butuh Akselerator, Kolaborator, dan Keseimbangan

Indonesia tidak bisa bertumpu pada satu kaki saja. Transisi energi akan goyah jika hanya berfokus pada elektrifikasi, tanpa memperkuat pilar bioenergi dan inovasi molekular lainnya. PLN dan Pertamina harus bergerak bersama sebagai dua lokomotif utama. Pemerintah harus menjadi akselerator, fasilitator, dan penyambung antar pelaku.

Dan yang paling penting: swasta harus dilibatkan secara penuh. Hanya dengan kolaborasi menyeluruh dan dukungan regulasi yang kuat, transisi energi Indonesia dapat berjalan stabil, cepat, dan inklusif menuju masa depan yang lebih hijau.",https://www.ruangenergi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/norman1.jpg,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:54.899321

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry.","The recent 180% surge in Thai Airways International's (THAI) share price following its trading resumption on August 4, 2025, is not merely a short-term rally but a reflection of a meticulously executed corporate transformation. This resurgence, however, must be contextualized within the broader dynamics of a post-pandemic aviation sector that is navigating both headwinds and tailwinds. For investors, the question is whether THAI's revival is a fleeting rebound or a durable repositioning for long-term growth.

Catalysts for the Surge: Restructuring, Resilience, and Reimagining

Thai Airways' journey from insolvency to recovery is a case study in strategic restructuring. By 2020, the airline had accumulated over 400 billion baht in debt, forcing it into bankruptcy protection. Yet, through a combination of debt-to-equity conversion, cost-cutting, and operational streamlining, THAI reduced its liabilities to 95 billion baht by Q1 2025. Shareholders' equity turned positive at 55 billion baht, and the company now holds 125 billion baht in cash—a stark contrast to its near-delisting status in 2021. The Central Bankruptcy Court's June 2025 termination of its rehabilitation plan marked the culmination of this effort, restoring investor confidence and triggering the stock's meteoric rise.

Analysts from Tisco and Yuanta Securities have underscored THAI's improved balance sheet and aggressive growth plans. With a 26.5% EBIT margin in Q1 2025—the highest among Asia-Pacific full-service carriers—and a projected EBITDA CAGR of 8.6% through 2027, the airline's financial health is no longer a liability but an asset. Strategic partnerships, including a Joint Business Agreement with Turkish Airlines and collaborations with Airports of Thailand (AOT), further strengthen its regional and global connectivity.

The Aviation Sector's Post-Pandemic Renaissance

The broader aviation industry is experiencing a nuanced recovery. Global passenger demand has not only rebounded to pre-pandemic levels but has surpassed them, with IATA forecasting 5.2 billion travelers in 2025—a 6.7% increase over 2024. This growth is fueled by pent-up demand, falling airfares (down 44% in real terms since 2014), and a shift toward leisure travel. However, airlines face challenges: fuel remains a 26.4% cost burden in 2025, and regulatory pressures, such as CORSIA compliance and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandates, add complexity.

THAI's position in this landscape is unique. Unlike budget carriers, which operate on razor-thin margins, THAI's focus on full-service operations allows it to leverage premium revenue streams while maintaining cost discipline. Its fleet modernization—45 Boeing 787s and 32 Airbus A321neos—enhances fuel efficiency and passenger experience, aligning with trends toward sustainability and comfort. Moreover, its 22% market share at Suvarnabhumi Airport positions it as a critical player in Thailand's ambition to become a regional aviation hub.

Long-Term Potential: A Structural Shift in Aviation

Investors must consider structural shifts in the industry. Airline profitability is increasingly tied to digital transformation and AI-driven revenue management. THAI's digital initiatives—enhanced booking platforms, “Cash + Miles” loyalty programs, and SCB credit card partnerships—position it to capture a larger share of the digital-first traveler market. Additionally, its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2065 and partnerships with PTT Global Chemical to integrate SAF align with global ESG trends, which are becoming non-negotiable for long-term capital.

The airline's expansion plans are equally compelling. By 2033, THAI aims to double its fleet from 78 to 150 aircraft, supported by strategic acquisitions and leases. This growth is not speculative: it is underpinned by a 12.3% year-on-year revenue increase in Q1 2025 and a 3%–13% revenue growth projection for 2025–2027. The airline's ability to balance capacity with demand—raising ASK by 21.1% in Q1 2025 while maintaining an 83.4% load factor—demonstrates operational agility.

Risks and Realities

No investment is without risk. Fuel prices, though currently favorable, remain volatile, and a spike could erode margins. Regulatory compliance costs, particularly for CORSIA and SAF, could also strain profitability. Additionally, the competitive landscape is intensifying, with low-cost carriers and regional players vying for market share. However, THAI's debt reduction, liquidity, and strategic partnerships mitigate these risks. The airline's debt-to-equity ratio of 4.37—a sharp decline from 20.66 in 2020—provides a buffer against external shocks.

Investment Thesis

For investors with a long-term horizon, THAI presents a compelling opportunity. The airline's financial restructuring has created a resilient foundation, while its strategic bets on fleet modernization, digital innovation, and sustainability align with global trends. Analysts' consensus target price of 10.40–10.70 baht suggests a 10–15% upside from current levels, but the broader recovery of the aviation sector could unlock even greater value.

However, patience is key. The stock's volatility reflects both optimism and uncertainty. Investors should monitor THAI's ability to execute its expansion plans, maintain cost discipline, and navigate regulatory challenges. Those who can stomach short-term fluctuations may find themselves positioned for a substantial payoff as the airline reclaims its role as a leader in the Asia-Pacific aviation ecosystem.

In a world where industries are being reshaped by technology, sustainability, and shifting consumer behavior, Thai Airways' revival is more than a story of survival—it is a blueprint for reinvention. For investors, the question is not whether the airline will recover, but how much further it can go.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:56:59.329102

In an era of shifting geopolitical alliances and rising multipolarity, Indonesia’s formal entry into BRICS in January 2025 marks more than just a diplomatic milestone. It signals a new strategic direction for Southeast Asia’s largest economy, particularly in its approach to global norms, alternative development finance, and sectoral cooperation, including civil aviation. After being officially declared a full member in January 2025, Indonesia was immediately accepted as the 10th member of BRICS. BRICS originally consisted of five countries — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — but has since expanded to include Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Ethiopia, Iran, and Indonesia. This expanded group now represents over 45% of the world’s population and a significant share of global GDP. For Indonesia, its participation opens doors to enhanced economic, technological, and diplomatic networks that go beyond the traditional Western-led institutional framework.

Aviation Diplomacy in the BRICS Context

Aviation has long symbolized and facilitated sovereignty, mobility, and integration. For Indonesia — a vast archipelagic nation with over 17,000 islands — aviation is not a luxury but a lifeline. However, the sector faces persistent challenges: uneven infrastructure, reliance on foreign technology, skill gaps, and vulnerability to external economic shocks. By joining BRICS, Indonesia gains an alternative platform for forming partnerships and technical cooperation in aviation. This includes potential collaborations in areas such as air traffic management, satellite-based navigation systems, airport development, safety oversight, and personnel training. Indonesia’s diplomacy within BRICS can now focus on advocating for more inclusive global aviation governance — particularly within the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), where BRICS countries are increasingly coordinating their positions. With India and China already active in ICAO’s Council and technical panels, Indonesia could now join this emerging bloc to balance the influence of traditional powers.

Technology Transfer and Diversified Aviation Supply Chains

One of the key benefits of increased BRICS involvement is the potential for technology transfer and diversification of the supply chain. Indonesia currently imports much of its aviation technology — from radar systems to ground-based navigational aids — from Europe and the United States. While these systems are technically advanced, they come with restrictions: complex procurement standards, intellectual property limitations, and vendor lock-in, which can limit Indonesia’s independence. Through BRICS, Indonesia can access collaborative R&D programs with countries like China, India, and Russia, which are actively developing satellite navigation systems (e.g., Beidou, GAGAN, GLONASS), indigenous aircraft manufacturing initiatives, and airport infrastructure technologies suited to emerging markets. These countries are also more open to co-production, local assembly, and licensing agreements. Indonesia’s aerospace industry — led by PT Dirgantara Indonesia — can benefit from exposure to different design approaches and compatible standards. Such cooperation could lessen reliance on a few Western OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and establish a diverse supply network for both civilian and military aviation needs.

Infrastructure and Alternative Financing Opportunities

One of the persistent bottlenecks in Indonesia’s aviation sector has been infrastructure development, especially in remote and underdeveloped regions known as the 3T (Terdepan, Terpencil, dan Tertinggal).

Traditional financing routes — dominated by Bretton Woods institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank — often impose strict conditionalities related to governance, environmental impact, and fiscal prudence. While these safeguards are important, they can delay or disqualify projects that fail to meet rigid procedural benchmarks.

In contrast, BRICS’ New Development Bank (NDB) provides a more flexible financing mechanism. Although still maintaining safeguards, the NDB emphasizes local ownership, quicker disbursement timelines, and more adaptable terms of credit. This could be a game-changer for Indonesia’s efforts to fund regional airports, satellite-based air navigation systems, weather radar, and search and rescue (SAR) operations.

Moreover, access to NDB financing could allow Indonesia to pilot next-generation air mobility programs, including seaplane bases, unmanned aircraft corridors, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) infrastructure — all within frameworks better suited to national development priorities.

Civil-Military Integration and Airspace Sovereignty

Another strategic dimension is the management of Indonesian airspace and Flight Information Regions (FIRs). Indonesia has long aspired to regain full control over several FIRs currently delegated to neighbouring states. Yet progress has been gradual, constrained by technical readiness, diplomatic complexity, and military-civil coordination challenges.

BRICS participation offers new avenues to learn from countries that have achieved FIR sovereignty under contested circumstances, such as India and China. Additionally, joint exercises, simulation training, and technology-sharing initiatives could support Indonesia’s push for integrated air surveillance and radar fusion systems, critical for both safety and national security.

Beyond FIRs, the issue of cybersecurity and data sovereignty in aviation is increasingly important. Partnering with BRICS countries could help Indonesia secure its aviation databases, aircraft tracking infrastructure, and communications networks from foreign interception or unilateral dependencies.

Challenges: Geopolitics, Standards, and Perception

Despite its many potential benefits, Indonesia’s BRICS participation is not without challenges, particularly in the aviation sector.

First, geopolitical alignments within BRICS can complicate consensus-building. For instance, the interests of Russia and China may not always align with those of Brazil, India, or South Africa, let alone Indonesia. In aviation diplomacy, where regulatory alignment is key, diverging priorities could slow progress on standard-setting and interoperability.

Second, while BRICS promotes alternative standards, the global aviation system remains anchored in frameworks defined by ICAO, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and other legacy institutions. Integrating BRICS-based practices into this system requires careful navigation to avoid misalignment or duplication.

Third, there is the challenge of international perception. Indonesia must reassure its traditional aviation partners, including the US, EU, and Japan, that BRICS participation complements rather than contradicts existing commitments. Diplomatically, Indonesia must uphold its “independent and active” foreign policy while navigating the optics of deeper ties with Russia or China, especially amid ongoing geopolitical tensions.

Recommendations: Strategic Steps Forward

To maximize the aviation-related gains from BRICS membership, Indonesia should consider the following steps:

Establish a BRICS Aviation Cooperation Desk within the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to coordinate sectoral initiatives and track joint programs.

Leverage NDB for pilot projects, especially in outer island airports, disaster response aviation systems, and satellite navigation services.

Forge technical partnerships with Indian and Chinese air navigation service providers to accelerate domestic capacity-building in air traffic control and aeronautical data services.

Promote joint ventures involving PT Dirgantara Indonesia and BRICS aerospace firms for component manufacturing and aircraft retrofitting.

Develop a long-term aviation diplomacy roadmap that aligns BRICS priorities with Indonesia’s ICAO and ASEAN obligations.

Maintain transparency and multilateral balance to prevent over-dependence on any one bloc or funding source.

Champion inclusive aviation governance, using BRICS as a platform to advocate for fairer global rules on carbon markets, passenger rights, and safety oversight.

A Broader Strategic Vision

Indonesia’s entry into BRICS is a reminder that global governance is evolving. For too long, the developing world’s aviation needs have been addressed through a top-down model dominated by the Global North. With BRICS, Indonesia can help rewrite this narrative — not through confrontation, but through constructive collaboration.

In a world where connectivity is currency, aviation becomes both a tool of influence and an index of inclusion. Indonesia must now rise to the challenge of transforming this new diplomatic opportunity into tangible progress for its skies and its citizens.",https://geotimes.id/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/geotimes-Indonesias-BRICS-Shift-Opens-New-Runways-for-Global-Air-Cooperation.png,N,,2025-08-04 02:57:34.127918

Melalui program Perhutanan Sosial Sri Wana Lestari, PT Pertamina Patra Niaga Aviation Fuel Terminal (AFT) Ngurah Rai menghadirkan pendekatan berbasis komunitas untuk menjaga kelestarian hutan sekaligus mendorong ekonomi masyarakat.

Program ini bukan sekadar tentang bagaimana menanam pohon tetapi dibaliknya ada filosofi lokal Tri Hita Karana, yang mencerminkan harmoni antara manusia, Tuhan, dan alam. Dengan melibatkan Kelompok Tani Hutan (KTH) Banu Giri Lestari, BUMDes Abdi Rahayu dan Poktan Taman Lestari, program Sri Wana Lestari menjadi contoh nyata bagaimana pelestarian lingkungan bisa berjalan beriringan dengan pemberdayaan masyarakat.

Salah satu sosok di balik program adalah Ketua KTH Banu Giri Lestari I Gede Sugiantara. Ia mengungkapkan bahwa program ini telah menekan angka kemiskinan di desa hingga 9,3% serta meningkatkan rata-rata penghasilan anggota KTH menjadi Rp2,2 juta per bulan.

“Semua kegiatan dikelola berbasis konservasi, dengan pendekatan agroforestry dan perlindungan sumber mata air untuk keberlanjutan jangka panjang,” ujar Sugiantara.

Sejak digulirkan, sebanyak 7.896 pohon produktif telah ditanam. Kawasan hutan seluas 76,25 hektar dikelola secara lestari oleh 58 orang anggota KTH. Masyarakat tak hanya menjaga hutan, tapi juga membangun sumber ekonomi baru dengan budidaya madu klanceng, pengembangan produk kakao, hingga wisata edukatif Green Clift yang menyuguhkan keindahan lanskap hutan.

“Tujuan kami bukan hanya merawat hutan tapi menjadikannya sumber kehidupan, kami ingin masyarakat bisa hidup layak tanpa harus merusak alam. Terbukti saat ini, kelompok tani berhasil menjalin sinergi antara konservasi, ekonomi dan nilai-nilai budaya yang luhur. Hal ini dibuktikan dengan munculnya sumber air deras yang disuling dan jual sebagai Air Minum Dalam Kemasan (AMDK) Amara, yang dalam 1 tahun dapat memproduksi sekitar 6.166 galon,” lanjut Sugiantara.

Melalui Sri Wana Lestari, Pertamina menunjukkan bahwa tanggung jawab sosial tidak hanya soal memberi, tapi membangun ekosistem yang tumbuh bersama. Dari bibit pohon yang ditanam hingga harapan yang dirajut di setiap rumah, program ini menjadi simbol perubahan dari desa untuk lingkungan yang lebih lestari.

Vice President Corporate Communication Pertamina Fadjar Djoko Santoso mengatakan Program Perhutanan Sosial ini turut mendukung program ketahanan pangan nasional, yang saat ini menjadi fokus utama Presiden Prabowo Subianto.

“Lewat program ini, kami ingin memaksimalkan potensi lahan hutan agar bisa lebih produktif, terutama dalam meningkatkan hasil pangan bagi Masyarakat,” ungkap Fadjar.

“Sampai saat ini, Program Tanggung Jawab Sosial dan Lingkungan (TJSL) Hutan Lestari Pertamina telah menanam pohon darat dan mangrove lebih dari 8 juta bibit di 337 lokasi. 13 lokasi termasuk dalam program Perhutanan Sosial. Selain itu, program ini telah memberikan manfaat kepada lebih dari 4 ribu orang dan menambah kenaikan ekonomi sebesar 3 miliar rupiah per tahun,” tutupnya.
