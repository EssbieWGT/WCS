Ministers have admitted that the Government may miss its sustainable aviation fuel target which is key to allowing a third runway at Heathrow.

They highighted “risks” to achieving the goal to getting more planes using eco-fuels.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves has trumpeted the switch to sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) as a solution to airport expansion in the UK without breaching legally-binding climate change commitments.

The Government has specific targets to ensure sustainable aviation fuels form part of the UK jet fuel mix, reaching 22% in 2040.

Aviation experts, though, have questioned whether this will be achieved.

In reply to the Commons environmental audit committee’s (EAC) report entitled Airport Expansion and Climate and Nature Targets, ministers have now accepted that the eco-fuel goal may be flunked.

“The Government recognises there are risks to scaling up SAF production both domestically and globally to the level required to meet the targets set out in the SAF mandate,” they said.

But they argued: “Setting ambitious targets in the SAF mandate is itself a way to promote the supply of SAF from a diverse range of feedstocks.”

Heathrow airport’s expansion has moved a step closer after the Government launched a review into how it will consider plans for a third runway

PA Archive

The Government has backed expansion at several airports including Heathrow, a new second runway at Gatwick, as well as more capacity at Luton and City airports.

It told the EAC: “Airport expansion will help to unlock the growth benefits that a world class aviation sector can provide.

“The Government is committed to ensuring that these economic benefits of airport expansions are delivered in a way that considers and addresses its environmental and social responsibilities.”

On the west London airport, it added: “Heathrow Airport, as the UK’s busiest and only hub airport, plays a critical role in enabling international connectivity for both passengers and freight.

“Its expansion has the potential to boost the UK economy and could support over 100,000 jobs in the local area.”

Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband who has stressed Heathrow expansion can only happen within the Government’s legally-binding climate change commitments

The Government has chosen Heathrow’s £33 billion scheme to expand the airport which will increase capacity by more than 50% to 756,000 flights a year, and involve moving the M25 which could create years of disruption for motorists.

Net Zero Secretary Ed Miliband had stressed that the expansion plans have to be consistent with the Government’s legally-binding commitment on net zero by 2050.

The Government is now reviewing the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS), which provides the primary basis for decisions on a Development Consent Order application for a third runway at Heathrow, which is essentially planning consent.

Part of the ANPS work is to ensure that a bigger Heathrow meets the Government’s four tests on economic growth, air quality, noise and climate change.

However, the Government has already backed a third runway even before deciding what the tests should be to ensure that these economic and environmental aims are achieved.

In the reply to the EAC, it said: “As part of the ANPS review, DfT (Department for Transport) is considering how the Government’s four tests for Heathrow expansion, including air quality, should be set.

“The review will consider changes in legislation, policy and data since the ANPS was designated in 2018 and will consider all key air quality pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.”

The Government added: “The mitigations for air quality impacts will be determined as part of the review process, and if any amends are made to the existing ANPS, they will be subject to consultation in summer 2026.”

Attached to the agenda for the Monday, Jan. 12 council meeting was a letter from Tidewater Renewables vice-president of business development Amber New.

She wrote that the company is looking to develop the aviation fuel project adjacent to its existing refinery, which began operating in 2023.

In late 2024, when company CEO Jeremy Baines told The Citizen that its refinery was in danger of closing due to an unequal playing field caused by American competitors getting subsidies on both sides of the border, he added that its planned aviation fuel expansion for the site was in jeopardy.

In late February 2025, the provincial government expanded the required made-in-Canada and renewable components of diesel sold in the province to address the issue.

New’s letter said the aviation project has completed a front-end engineering and design study, which includes a Class 3 capital estimate and project schedule. The company is now waiting a final investment decision in the second quarter of 2026.

If built, the facility would have the capacity to produce 6,500 barrels per day of fuel that new described as “a low carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel with an annual reduction of ~800,000 tonnes of C02/year.”

As part of the process, New said the company is looking to secure capital support from the provincial government from the British Columbia Low Carbon Fuel Standard (BC-LCFS) program — the same program that helped fund the diesel refinery.

The aviation facility is expected to create 60 permanent full-time jobs and the construction is expected to require 400 to 500 workers over a three-year period.

Currently, construction is expected to begin in mid-2027.

New said Prince George “has demonstrated a strong, industry-friendly culture that supports responsible industrial development” that has allowed companies like Tidewater to set up shop.

To continue its partnership with the city, Tidewater requested a letter of support for its BC-LCFS program.

Coun. Ron Polillo pointed out the employment and economic benefits touted by the letter and said it was worthy of the city’s support.

Mayor Simon Yu said the project would mean a lot to both the city and the region.

In this note, we outline the key themes and anticipated developments from a UK focus that we expect will shape the sector in the year ahead.

Consumer protection and passenger rights

EU261: Reform of EU261 remains a priority. In October 2025, the European Parliament’s Transport Committee adopted its negotiating guidelines on EU261 reform, including:

Maintaining the right to compensation after a three-hour delay (per Sturgeon).

Guaranteeing free cabin luggage, consisting of a personal item and a small trolley bag.

Banning fees for check-in, child seating and booking corrections.

Requiring airlines to send a standard compensation form or activate alternative automatic communication channels within 48 hours of disruption (passengers would have one year to claim the compensation).

Creating a defined list of “extraordinary circumstances” based on existing CJEU EU261 case law (e.g. natural disasters, war, weather conditions or unforeseen labour disputes – but excluding airline staff strikes).

These guidelines conflict with the European Council’s June 2025 agreement to raise the delay threshold to four or six hours, whilst also contradicting existing EU law on cabin baggage.

Despite intensive trilogue talks between the Council, European Parliament, and Commission, no final agreement was reached by the end of the Danish Presidency term. The file has now rolled over into Cyprus’s Presidency term, which started on 1 January, with further negotiations scheduled for February. Whether such negotiations will be productive is doubtful given that, to the disappointment of important industry groups including IATA, the European Regional Airlines Association and Airlines for Europe (A4E), the Transport Committee doubled down on its guidelines during a vote on 12 January. All airlines operating into the EU should watch closely for developments in 2026.

UK261: Airlines based in or operating into the UK will be interested in EU261 reform as this may influence how the UK's own passenger protection regime – UK261 – might develop in the future.

In October 2025, the UK CAA opened a compliance programme to assess industry compliance with its obligations to passengers under UK261. The programme is expected to run for at least 18 months, with the CAA indicating that it will publish progress updates during that period.

Greenwashing, green claims and consumer protection: The implementation of the Digital Markets, Competition and Consumers Act (DMCCA) and associated guidance will continue to shape enforcement of unfair commercial practices, with the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) alongside the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) expected to scrutinise claims in airline and travel company marketing relating to aircraft emissions and sustainability pledges. The CMA has also been involved in a recent clampdown on online pricing practices at a number of travel companies concerning price transparency and the use of drip pricing. This scrutiny is likely to increase following the implementation of the DMCCA's new rules on subscription services, which is anticipated to take place in Autumn 2026.

Accessibility and inclusion: We expect any regulatory updates on accessibility in 2026 to be informed by the Aviation Accessibility Implementation Group following the publication of the Aviation Accessibility Task and Finish Group’s independent report in July 2025. We also await the CAA’s publication of a summary of responses and decision document following the consultation on the requirement to publish information on mishandled mobility aids (CAP 3088) that took place in Autumn 2025. The Aviation (Accessibility) Bill is due to have its second reading in the House of Commons on 23 January 2026.

Sustainability

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): The UK Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill continues to work its way through the parliamentary process, with the Bill currently at the Report stage in the House of Lords. With a third reading in the House of Lords to take place before consideration of the amendments can occur, we consider that it is likely the SAF Bill will receive Royal Assent in 2026 as previously envisaged by the Government.

We also expect the Government’s response to the recent consultation seeking views on the design of the proposed levy on fossil aviation fuel suppliers that will be used to fund the SAF revenue certainty mechanism (RCM) – see our blog post for further detail – along with further consultations relating to the design of the RCM.

Airspace and infrastructure

Airspace modernisation: Following the publication in August 2025 by the CAA of a revised deployment plan for its Airspace Modernisation Strategy (AMS), we expect there will be progress in 2026 in UK airspace modernisation. This may include guidance and requirements further to consultations launched in late 2025 on:

UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) – draft guidance to streamline complex airspace changes.

UK Airspace Coordination Service (UKACS) – the final proposals to modify NATS (En‑Route) plc’s air traffic services licence to give formal effect to UKADS – including governance, transparency, engagement, and provision of information duties – plus the creation and operation of an Airspace Design Support Fund, with cost recovery via user charges (the details of which are set out in CAP 3164).

Updates to the air navigation directions (AND) and air navigation guidance (ANG) to provide clear priorities for the design of airspace, including the altitude at which noise and carbon are prioritised.

We also expect further integration measures for drones and eVTOLs under AMS, linked to the Law Commission’s review of the law around autonomous flight (as to which, see the ‘Technology and autonomy’ section below).

Airport rules: In late 2025, the European Commission opened an EU-wide public consultation on various rules affecting airports, namely the Slot Regulation, the Groundhandling Directive and the Airport Charges Directive. This consultation is part of a fitness check launched by the European Commission of the legislation concerning airports and airport capacity and may lead to reform in these areas. Such reform may include revising the Slot Regulation.

The UK will be watching such developments closely. Despite the DfT’s consultation on slot reform in 2023/24 proposing time-limiting historic rights, tightening or revisiting the 80/20 usage rule, restricting long‑term slot leasing, strengthening the transparency and powers of the UK coordinator and, in certain circumstances, introducing auctions for newly created capacity, amendments at a UK level have been minimal and limited to the Airports Slot Allocation (Alleviation of Usage Requirements etc.) Regulations 2025. The 2025 Regulations introduced changes expanding the definition of a “new entrant” (from five to seven daily slots), streamlining elements of the allocation process and introducing a permanent statutory mechanism for justified non‑utilisation during public health emergencies.

Airport development: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for UK airport development as government policy, planning decisions and economic regulation begin to converge. The UK Government’s October 2025 announcement of a review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) has placed Heathrow expansion back on the political agenda. A revised draft ANPS is expected for consultation in summer 2026, updating the framework in light of the UK’s strengthened climate, noise and air quality commitments. Gatwick enters 2026 with a Development Consent Order (DCO) already secured to bring its Northern Runway into routine use. Following the Transport Secretary’s approval of Luton’s DCO in April 2025, 2026 will see the early stages of delivery of the £2.5bn expansion, including a new terminal complex and associated taxiways, stands and access improvements.

Technology and autonomy

Aviation autonomy: The Law Commission and CAA are advancing work on legal frameworks for highly automated and autonomous systems in aviation and aviation infrastructure. A final report on liability models for drones, VTOL aircraft and air traffic management for uncrewed aircraft is expected in early 2026.

We also anticipate the CAA will continue its work on VTOL policy and regulatory frameworks, following the publication of its Advanced Air Mobility: eVTOL Delivery Model last year.

New drone rules: New rules in the UK now apply for recreational and commercial operators. Effective from 1 January 2026:

A Flyer ID is required for flying drones weighing 100g or more outdoors in the UK. This requires successful completion of the CAA’s basic competence test.

An Operator ID must be labelled on drones weighing 100g or more with a camera, or weighing 250g or more regardless of camera.

A classification system for drones has been introduced, from UK0 to UK6. These classes define operational limits, safety features, and compliance requirements and are similar to EU classes but tailored for UK regulation.

All UK1, UK2 and UK3 class-marked drones must broadcast a Remote ID signal during flight, which includes the drone’s unique ID, location, and operator details, enabling authorities to identify and track drones in real time. Legacy drones have until 1 January 2028 to comply with this requirement.

Drone operators must follow updated airspace restrictions, including geofencing and altitude limits.

There are enhanced requirements for risk assessments and insurance for commercial drone operations.

These rules are summarised in The Drone and Model Aircraft Code and align with the CAA’s AMS, supporting safe integration of drones with manned aircraft and future urban air mobility.","https://www.burges-salmon.com/articles/102m1jm/ https:/images.passle.net/fit-in/860x860/filters:crop(0,176,2121,1187)/Passle/5d9604688cb6230bac62c2d0/SearchServiceImages/2026-01-10-14-01-50-258-69625bce1e42b4e6137976ba.jpg",N,,2026-01-13 11:11:48.806270

“Investment dollars flow to areas with a perceived competitive advantage,” said Monte Shaw, executive director of the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association. “The states attracting significant investment have one thing in common – the ability to sequester carbon either locally or via pipeline infrastructure. While Iowa remains the largest ethanol-producing state, we are behind in the race to maximize the incentive and market benefits from producing ultra-low carbon ethanol.”

If Iowa’s 4.6 billion gallons of ethanol production utilized CCS technology, it would bring over $3 billion in 45Z tax credits back to the state and strengthen its competitive position by making its ethanol more attractive to emerging domestic and export markets.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/archived/epm/posts/web/2016/12/IRFALogo_14824431249673.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 11:11:57.631075

How OXCCU stands out in the sustainability space:

The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using cutting-edge technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1,000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF.

Following this success, the business secured £20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

Why is OXCCU’s technology revolutionary?

The team has developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO₂ with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

Its patented iron catalyst converts CO₂ and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

What are OXCCU’s future goals?

OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

This could lower the environmental impact of fuel-guzzling industries.

From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn’t have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

OXCCU’s co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, says: “Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we’ve built this year.

Securing our 21M Series B funding, starting the build of our second demonstration plant OX2, and growing the team has given us strong foundations to move forward.

With strong investors alongside us, the focus now is on proving the technology at a larger scale and building the foundations for a pathway that can make a meaningful difference to future aviation fuel production.”

Editor of Startups.co.uk, Zohra Huda, comments:

“We are incredibly proud to name OXCCU as this year’s Sustainability Award winner. Their mission to create a low-cost, low-emission route to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) addresses one of the most urgent challenges in the global climate agenda.

Aviation and petrochemicals are notoriously difficult to decarbonise, yet OXCCU offers a genuinely scalable alternative to fossil fuels, proving that breakthrough science and commercial ambition can go hand-in-hand.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-4.png,N,,2026-01-13 11:12:05.684007

The findings from our latest GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Challenge offer both encouragement and a clear call to action for the year ahead. Engagement continues to rise as more companies commit to measuring and managing their travel emissions ─ yet we also see where progress is stalling, and where we must move faster.

Business travel remains a critical enabler of global collaboration and connection. But with growing expectations from employees, regulators, investors, and customers, it must evolve. Sustainability can no longer be viewed as a compliance exercise. It’s becoming a behavioural expectation, shaping travel programs, influencing procurement decisions, and increasingly defining what strong and strategic leadership looks like.

What the 2025 Acceleration Challenge tells us

With 285 companies participating in 2025, the benchmark shows incremental improvements: improved reporting practices, clearer emissions targets, and a rise in sustainable travel policies. More organisations are introducing carbon budgets, and smaller programs are stepping up, often using sustainability leadership to differentiate themselves.

But the data also reveals gaps. Tools that influence booking choices, such as carbon fees or sustainability nudges, have stalled in adoption. Supplier engagement remains inconsistent, and while some companies are integrating sustainability clauses into contracts or using GBTA’s Sustainable Procurement Standards, these practices are far from mainstream. And while Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is gaining momentum, overall adoption remains low despite its essential role in decarbonisation.

The simple truth is this: progress is happening, but not at the pace the industry needs.

What travel managers should prioritise now

There are several actions organisations can take immediately to drive meaningful impact and embrace their role in shaping a more sustainable business travel ecosystem.

1. Go back to basics

Policies and reporting remain foundational. Sustainable travel policies must be actionable, visible, and integrated into everyday decision-making. Emissions reporting should be accurate, timely, and shared widely to build internal accountability.

2. Actively influence traveller behaviour

Putting sustainability front of mind during booking is one of the most effective levers for change. Carbon displays, recommended options, or default settings that prioritise lower-carbon choices can shift behaviour at scale.

3. Step by step with SAF

SAF can feel complex and budgets are often tight, but even small investments create internal momentum. Our new SAF Corporate Connect hub supports travel managers on this journey, and the SAF Playbook offers a step-by-step guide for integrating SAF into corporate travel strategies.

4. Make sustainability part of the first conversation

Engage suppliers early. Introduce sustainability assessments, include sustainability commitments in contracts, and identify shared goals. Prioritising sustainable procurement strengthens the entire program and drives long-term impact.

5. Planning for longer-term impact

The next phase of sustainable business travel will require greater transformation. Companies must prepare for more robust carbon reporting requirements, ensure travel program structures align with corporate climate goals, and invest in long-term low-carbon solutions. Multimodal travel strategies and SAF procurement pathways are among the tangible steps that can support the acceleration of more sustainable practice.",https://thebusinesstravelmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bigstock-Business-Growth-Success-Achiev-471025813-e1768313550880.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 10:58:31.334724

Facility aims to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified SAF annually with projected emissions reductions exceeding 70 percent

Total funding now exceeds $60 million with new strategic investors and regional leadership expansion

Sustainable fuels technology company Aether Fuels has raised $15 million in convertible note financing to accelerate development of its first commercial scale sustainable aviation fuel facility, a project that puts Singapore at the center of a fast evolving global market for low carbon aviation fuels.

Founded in 2022, Aether is developing liquid fuels aimed at decarbonizing aviation and maritime transport. Its proprietary Aurora technology converts a broad set of feedstocks including captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, biogas, gasified municipal waste, and waste biomass into sustainable fuels that meet aviation specifications. For heavy transport and aviation, which lack cost-effective electrification pathways, liquid fuels remain an essential part of long-term decarbonization strategies.

Commercial Facility and Production Outlook

The new financing will support Project Beacon, a 50 barrel per day facility expected to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified sustainable aviation fuel each year. The company plans to convert industrial waste gas and biomethane into fuels that meet international sustainability criteria. Engineering is underway, with construction targeted for this year and commercial operations scheduled for 2028. Aether estimates greenhouse gas emissions reductions of more than 70 percent versus conventional jet fuel.

Singapore’s interest in the project intersects with its ambition to position the city-state as a regional hub for sustainable fuels, green maritime solutions, and carbon services. Regulatory developments around book-and-claim systems, emissions disclosure, and sustainable aviation pathways are advancing in parallel across Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States.

Financing and Investor Interest

The round included new investors Aster Ventures and EDBI, alongside participation from existing investors AP Ventures, Xora Innovation, CDP Venture Capital, TechEnergy Ventures, Foothill Ventures, Eni Next, and Chevron Technology Ventures. With the latest raise, Aether’s total funding exceeds $60 million.

Investor appetite for sustainable aviation fuels continues to grow as airlines, airports, and corporate travel programs prepare for tightening compliance mechanisms and rising demand for verifiable emissions reductions. SAF markets remain supply constrained, and projects with clear line of sight to commercial scale are viewed as strategically valuable.

Leadership and Execution Strategy

Alongside the financing, Aether announced several leadership appointments to advance execution and regional scale-up. Stu Stott, Global Vice President of Projects, will be based in Singapore with responsibility for commercial facility delivery. Mei Chia, who joined in 2023, will lead a planned Singapore research and development center expected to open in 2026. TC Goh will continue to lead business development across Southeast Asia.

Conor Madigan, Founder and CEO of Aether Fuels, described the past year as pivotal. “Aether closed 2025 with strong momentum across leadership, technology and project execution. First, we are thrilled to add Aster Ventures and Singapore’s EDBI as new investors. Second, over the past 12 months, we have expanded our global team and advanced our first commercial facility in Singapore, whilst simultaneously maturing and scaling our core technology through our pilot and demo projects in the US.""

Conor Madigan, Founder and CEO of Aether Fuels

Implications for Policy, Markets, and Climate

The policy environment for SAF is tightening as governments consider mandates, incentives, and credible carbon accounting structures. Demand is also influenced by CORSIA obligations, corporate Scope 3 targets, and voluntary aviation commitments, which are pushing airlines toward offtake agreements and long-term price hedging strategies. SAF developers must navigate feedstock availability, certification pathways, and infrastructure integration challenges while competing against fossil jet fuel on price.

For investors and corporates, Aether’s positioning reflects a broader shift from demonstration to early commercial deployment in hard-to-abate sectors. As Europe, the United States, and parts of Asia explore coordinated climate regulation for aviation, new projects in Singapore and Southeast Asia could reshape regional market geography and supply chains.

Sustainable fuels for aviation remain a central test for global net-zero strategies. If manufacturers can produce at commercial scale while meeting sustainability, cost, and certification requirements, SAF could become a foundational climate tool for aviation and logistics sectors that lack near-term electrification substitutes. The outcome carries global relevance given aviation’s projected emissions trajectory and the geopolitical competition to anchor emerging supply chains.",https://decarbonfuse.com/assets/favi/favicon-32x32-b1c94ae87840c662751403aefa5b6ea92417e97aab4cbce5a1b99c4e112cac36.png,N,,2026-01-13 11:12:20.310485

Facility aims to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified SAF annually with projected emissions reductions exceeding 70 percent

Total funding now exceeds $60 million with new strategic investors and regional leadership expansion

Sustainable fuels technology company Aether Fuels has raised $15 million in convertible note financing to accelerate development of its first commercial scale sustainable aviation fuel facility, a project that puts Singapore at the center of a fast evolving global market for low carbon aviation fuels.

Founded in 2022, Aether is developing liquid fuels aimed at decarbonizing aviation and maritime transport. Its proprietary Aurora technology converts a broad set of feedstocks including captured carbon dioxide, industrial waste gases, biogas, gasified municipal waste, and waste biomass into sustainable fuels that meet aviation specifications. For heavy transport and aviation, which lack cost-effective electrification pathways, liquid fuels remain an essential part of long-term decarbonization strategies.

Commercial Facility and Production Outlook

The new financing will support Project Beacon, a 50 barrel per day facility expected to produce roughly 2,000 tons of CORSIA certified sustainable aviation fuel each year. The company plans to convert industrial waste gas and biomethane into fuels that meet international sustainability criteria. Engineering is underway, with construction targeted for this year and commercial operations scheduled for 2028. Aether estimates greenhouse gas emissions reductions of more than 70 percent versus conventional jet fuel.

Singapore’s interest in the project intersects with its ambition to position the city-state as a regional hub for sustainable fuels, green maritime solutions, and carbon services. Regulatory developments around book-and-claim systems, emissions disclosure, and sustainable aviation pathways are advancing in parallel across Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States.

Financing and Investor Interest

The round included new investors Aster Ventures and Singapore’s EDBI, alongside participation from existing investors AP Ventures, Xora Innovation, CDP Venture Capital, TechEnergy Ventures, Foothill Ventures, Eni Next, and Chevron Technology Ventures. With the latest raise, Aether’s total funding exceeds $60 million.

Investor appetite for sustainable aviation fuels continues to grow as airlines, airports, and corporate travel programs prepare for tightening compliance mechanisms and rising demand for verifiable emissions reductions. SAF markets remain supply constrained, and projects with clear line of sight to commercial scale are viewed as strategically valuable.

Leadership and Execution Strategy

Alongside the financing, Aether announced several leadership appointments to advance execution and regional scale-up. Stu Stott was named Global Vice President of Projects and will be based in Singapore with responsibility for commercial facility delivery. Mei Chia, who joined in 2023, will lead a planned Singapore research and development center expected to open in 2026. TC Goh will continue to lead business development across Southeast Asia.

Conor Madigan, Founder and CEO of Aether Fuels, described the past year as pivotal. “Aether closed 2025 with strong momentum across leadership, technology and project execution. First, we are thrilled to add Aster Ventures and Singapore’s EDBI as new investors. Second, over the past 12 months, we have expanded our global team and advanced our first commercial facility in Singapore, whilst simultaneously maturing and scaling our core technology through our pilot and demo projects in the US.”

Implications for Policy, Markets, and Climate

The policy environment for SAF is tightening as governments consider mandates, incentives, and credible carbon accounting structures. Demand is also influenced by CORSIA obligations, corporate Scope 3 targets, and voluntary aviation commitments, which are pushing airlines toward offtake agreements and long-term price hedging strategies. SAF developers must navigate feedstock availability, certification pathways, and infrastructure integration challenges while competing against fossil jet fuel on price.

For investors and corporates, Aether’s positioning reflects a broader shift from demonstration to early commercial deployment in hard-to-abate sectors. As Europe, the United States, and parts of Asia explore coordinated climate regulation for aviation, new projects in Singapore and Southeast Asia could reshape regional market geography and supply chains.

Sustainable fuels for aviation remain a central test for global net-zero strategies. If manufacturers can produce at commercial scale while meeting sustainability, cost, and certification requirements, SAF could become a foundational climate tool for aviation and logistics sectors that lack near-term electrification substitutes. The outcome carries global relevance given aviation’s projected emissions trajectory and the geopolitical competition to anchor emerging supply chains.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Aether-Fuels-Raises-15-Million-To-Advance-Singapore-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-Facility.webp,N,,2026-01-13 10:58:58.230171

In China, used cooking oil prices rebound.

1. Europe's gas market transformed by LNG imports

What's happening? Europe's LNG imports reached record levels in 2025, with the US being the leading supplier, accounting for over 77% of imports, according to S&P Global Energy CERA data. Price signals and regional competitiveness influenced cargo flows, while high regasification terminal utilization prompted traders to seek innovative, cost-effective routes, LNG traders based in Europe said. Oversupply widened the LNG-TTF spread, and the narrowing price gap with Asia encouraged more cargoes to remain in Europe. Northwest Europe averaged $11.423/MMBtu over 2025, up from $10.743/MMBtu over 2024, according to Platts data. The Platts DES Northwest Europe marker for February was assessed at $9.144/MMBtu Jan. 9. Platts is part of S&P Global Energy.

What's next? LNG will remain crucial to Europe's gas mix, with imports forecast to peak at 147.74 million metric tons in 2027, S&P Global Energy CERA data showed. Wider LNG-TTF spreads are expected in 2026, possibly prompting pipeline and storage traders to optimize supply, an LNG trader said. Europe's reliance on LNG will persist as the region continues to move away from Russian gas. Additional US supply will drive further changes in pricing and procurement strategies.

2. Simandou iron ore project unlikely to disrupt Pilbara market in 2026

What's happening? The Simandou iron ore project in Guinea is expected to have limited immediate impact on Australia's Pilbara iron ore market in 2026. Logistical constraints and a gradual production ramp-up will restrict the project's market entry, according to market participants who spoke to Platts. Shipments are expected at 15 million mt-20 million mt, and 2027 at 40 million-50 million mt, skewed to the lower end, following the first cargo's delay out of Morebaya. China's iron ore market has been in surplus since 2024 amid sluggish steel demand, even as prices held firm in 2025.

What's next? The immediate price impact looks limited in 2026 at 15 million mt-20 million mt, with CERA analysts expecting IODEX to average around $100/dmt, as Chinese pig iron output drops 1.5%-2% year over year. Oversupply risk rises from 2027 as Simandou ramps up, with CERA analysts seeing a potential 16% price decrease to around $89/dmt by December 2027. With all-in sustaining costs around $55-$60/dmt, some higher-cost seaborne and domestic ore could be pushed out of the market. Simandou's high grade iron ore is expected to be sold largely as mid-grade blends that directly substitute for Pilbara Blend and Vale 62%-63% fines, but for now, Pilbara ore will sustain its competitiveness in China's steel supply chain.

3. Northeastern US power, gas prices increase amid cold snap

What's happening? Power prices climbed into triple digits across the New England and New York Independent System Operators as 2025 ended, with Platts pricing Jan. 1 delivery at $165/MWh and $127.69/MWh, respectively. Natural gas prices at Algonquin city-gates jumped to $18.76/MMBtu, driven by freezing temperatures that dramatically increased energy demand. The extreme cold pushed ISO-NE's December 2025 peakload demand to an average of 17.50 GW, a 4.4% increase, while NYISO load rose 3.5% to 20.51 GW, highlighting the direct impact of winter weather on regional energy consumption.

What's next? Power prices stabilized through the first week of 2026, with ISO-NE and NYISO power trading near $82.50/MWh and $54/MWh by Jan. 8. The price correction followed warmer temperatures and the expiration of winter weather advisories from the US National Weather Service. The rapid market shifts underscore the critical role of weather patterns in shaping power market fundamentals, demonstrating how supply and demand can quickly respond to temperature fluctuations.

4. China's domestic used cooking oil market shows signs of recovery...

What's happening? China's domestic used cooking oil market is rebounding in early 2026 as producers increasingly supply feedstocks to local sustainable aviation fuel plants. On Jan. 9, Platts, assessed UCO prices at major Chinese ports: Tianjin Port at Yuan 7,000/mt, Nantong Port at Yuan 7,050/mt and Nansha Port at Yuan 7,050/mt. Weak export market demand, particularly from Europe, has pushed sellers to focus on domestic SAF plants, with Chinese SAF producers strategically pivoting to hydrotreated vegetable oil production, capitalizing on profitable margins despite antidumping duties. This strategic shift allows producers to maintain operations and cash flow while awaiting SAF whitelist approval.

What's next? Market activity is expected to pick up before the Lunar New Year, with domestic demand and HVO output likely to remain strong as the price spread between HVO and SAF widens, according to a Chinese UCO producer.

5. ...while RME gains premium over UCOME after Germany's RED III clarification

What's happening? Rapeseed methyl ester prices have traded above UCO methyl ester in ARA since Dec. 9, 2025, following Germany's Renewable Energy Directive III legislative clarification. The RME-UCOME spread widened to $54/mt Jan. 6, with Platts assessing FOB ARA RME at an $825/mt premium to ICE LSGO, up $24/mt from Dec. 9, 2025. The German Federal Cabinet's approval of RED III, which removes double-counting incentives for advanced biofuels starting in 2026, has renewed interest in first-generation biodiesel with high greenhouse gas savings.

What's next? Market participants anticipate continued price support for RME in the near term as a winter-spec fuel. In the lead-up to legislative changes, the market had anticipated that the removal of double-counting would create a bullish outlook for renewable diesel in 2026 and that demand for UCOME as a cost-effective alternative would consequently remain strong. With UCOME margins poor, key players are closely monitoring competition for used cooking oil feedstock across UCOME, renewable diesel and the sustainable aviation fuel markets.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-13 10:59:02.350698

The award honours businesses that demonstrate innovative and impactful sustainability practices.

The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining the standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF. Following this, the business secured £20.75 million in Series B funding at the end of 2025 to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

The team has developed a single-step process that combines captured CO2 with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons. Its patented iron catalyst converts CO2 and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

OXCCU aims to produce 10 000 tpy of SAF before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 t) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

OXCCU's co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, said: “Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we have built this year. Securing our Series B funding, starting the build of our second demonstration plant OX2, and growing the team has given us strong foundations to move forward.

Cost an ongoing problem

Prices twice those of normal fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could force airline ticket prices up by as much as 40 percent, an industry expert has warned, with the greener alternative unlikely to match the cost of conventional jet fuel until around 2050.

The aviation sector accounts for 2.5 percent of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions, according to the International Energy Agency, and will require almost $3.2 trillion of investment to reach net zero by 2050, according to estimates from the International Civil Aviation Organization.

The net zero by 2050 target, derived from the 2015 UN Paris climate agreement, refers to the goal of balancing greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide, with removals so total emissions fall to zero by mid-century.

SAF is central to that effort. The fuel can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent and is expected to deliver around 65 percent of the emissions reductions needed for the sector to meet its 2050 target, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The problem is cost. The International Air Transport Association says that SAF prices in 2025 were more than double those of conventional jet fuel, rising to as much as five times higher in markets where usage is mandated, such as the EU and the UK.

“In our view, the 2050 target is achievable and by that date we could have prices that are really affordable for airlines and operations,” said Mohamed Khalifa Rahma, director of the International Civil Aviation Organization’s air transport bureau, speaking on the sidelines of the annual International Renewable Energy Agency assembly in Abu Dhabi.

A global aviation decarbonisation framework agreed in Dubai in 2023 includes a target to cut industry emissions by 5 percent by 2030.

“We need to accelerate the production and deployment of SAF to meet this goal,” Rahma said.

The International Air Transport Association estimates that SAF output in 2025 would reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024, but still only 0.6 percent of total jet fuel consumption.

At current price levels, the SAF premium translates into an additional $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the industry in 2025.

Green aviation fuel industry in UAE battles red tape

The Gulf is well-placed to soar on SAF – but not yet

Ahmed Badr, director of project facilitation and support at the International Renewable Energy Agency, said widespread use of SAF at current prices would translate directly into higher fares.

“Ticket prices would go up by around 40 percent,” he said. “It’s something people cannot afford.”

The UAE plans to supply its airlines with 1 percent domestically made SAF by 2031 and produce 700 million litres annually. Airlines Etihad Airways and Emirates, oil company Adnoc and several government entities formed a national consortium in 2023 to advance SAF development.

Emirates has begun receiving SAF from oil refiner Neste at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport and signed a deal with Shell in 2024 for deliveries into Dubai Airport. In November 2025, the carrier signed a partnership with oil company Enoc to explore joint SAF initiatives in Dubai.

“I think there is very little SAF around the world in any airport that we operate to today,” Emirates chairman Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum said in an interview in November. “We are always going to be a buyer of SAF if it is available.”

The Emirates Airline chief said last year that passengers will ultimately determine whether the aviation industry can afford to go green, suggesting higher fares might result from environmentally friendlier fuel.

“If you want a certain product, then you have to pay for it,” he said at the Dubai Airshow in November when asked whether travellers would be willing to shoulder higher fares tied to sustainable energy.

Nova Pangaea’s innovative REFNOVA technology converts cellulosic biomass like forestry and agricultural residues into bioethanol, which can then be processed into SAF. The company operates a demonstration plant at its headquarters in Wilton International, a major manufacturing site in Tees Valley. It plans to deploy its technology at four production plants across the UK as part of Project Speedbird, as well as to license its technology internationally.

The company has raised over £21 million (€24 million) to date from investors, including IAG, PXN Ventures, Mercia Ventures and the first Northern Powerhouse Investment Fund, in addition to grant funding of £7 million (€8 million).

The Rt Hon Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, welcomed the appointment. “Nova Pangaea Technologies is something we can be genuinely proud of here in Redcar & Cleveland,” said Turley. “It’s a forward-looking business doing important work on low-carbon technologies, including projects with real carbon-capture benefits, while creating skilled jobs and investment locally.

“Wilton is a hugely important site for our area and for the country. It has the infrastructure, skills, and industrial heritage needed to lead the next generation of cleaner industry, and companies like Nova Pangaea show exactly what that future can look like. I welcome the appointment of the new CEO and wish them every success as the company moves into its next chapter.”",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Nova-Pangaea-Stewart-Stewart-768x429.png,N,,2026-01-13 06:57:10.687469

The award celebrates businesses demonstrating exceptional innovation and impact in sustainability. OXCCU also secured fourth place in the 2026 Startups 100 Index, powered by Sage, the UK’s longest-running index of high-potential new businesses.

Founded in 2021 by Andrew Symes, Dr Jane Jin, Dr Tiancun Xiao, Dr Benzhen Yao and Professor Peter Edwards, OXCCU is addressing one of the aviation industry’s greatest challenges: how to decarbonise a sector heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The company’s world-leading technology converts captured carbon dioxide and green hydrogen into jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons in a single step, offering a lower-cost and lower-emission route to SAF production.

OXCCU’s patented iron catalyst enables CO₂ and CO to be converted directly into liquid hydrocarbons, eliminating intermediate processes and minimising by-products. This results in lower capital and operating costs, making SAF more commercially competitive.

The company’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already achieved more than 1,000 operating hours, delivering high conversion rates and strong selectivity for aviation fuel. Building on this success, OXCCU secured £20.75 million in Series B funding last September to accelerate the scale-up of its sustainable fuels and technologies and to begin construction of its second demonstration plant, OX2.

Looking ahead, OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF annually before 2030, while also exploring applications in chemicals and plastics, extending the impact of its technology beyond aviation.

Andrew Symes, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of OXCCU, said: “Our focus now is on proving the technology at a larger scale and creating a pathway that can make a meaningful difference to future aviation fuel production.”

The startup has also ranked 4th in the 2026 Startups 100 Index powered by Sage, the UK’s longest-running index of promising new businesses.

OXCCU was founded in 2021 by Andrew Symes, Dr Jane Jin, Dr Tiancun Xiao, Dr Benzhen Yao, and Professor Peter Edwards. The UK startup is tackling the need to find alternative means of maintaining our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels, by using cutting-edge technology to make waste carbon usable.

OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF.

Following this success, the business secured £20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

OXCCU’s technology

The team has developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO₂ with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

Its patented iron catalyst converts CO₂ and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

Future goals

OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

This could lower the environmental impact of fuel-guzzling industries.

From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn’t have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

OXCCU’s co-founder and CEO, Andrew Symes, says, “Being recognised in the Startups 100 Index reflects the momentum we’ve built this year.

“Securing our £21m Series B funding, starting the build of our second demonstration plant OX2, and growing the team has given us strong foundations to move forward.

“With strong investors alongside us, the focus now is on proving the technology at a larger scale and building the foundations for a pathway that can make a meaningful difference to future aviation fuel production.”

A new research paper, published last month in the journal Energy Research and Social Science, shines a light on this trend, exploring such projects that have also caused environmental injustices such as air pollution or depriving communities of their source of income.

The study by the Institute of Environmental Science and Technology at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (ICTA-UAB), in collaboration with the University of Sussex, is based on 48 cases of environmental conflicts around the world, contained in the ICTA-UAB’s Global Atlas of Environmental Justice (EJAtlas).

The selected cases range from Norway’s Trollvind offshore wind farm, built partly to decarbonise the power supply to the Troll and Oseberg oil and gas fields; to US fossil fuel firms working with the dairy industry to turn manure into biogas; and a tree plantation in the Republic of Congo proposed by TotalEnergies, where locals say they have been prevented from accessing their customary farmland.

“House of cards”: Verra used junk carbon credits to fix Shell’s offsetting scandal

The researchers argue that “false solutions” – which also include large-scale carbon offsetting projects, many of which have been discredited – help to reinforce the political and economic power of the industry that is responsible for the climate crisis, and are undermining the global energy transition.

Climate Home News spoke to co-author Freddie Daley, a research associate at the University of Sussex’s Centre for Global Political Economy, about the paper’s findings and implications for climate policy.

Q: What was your motivation in exploring these types of “false solutions” to the climate crisis?

A: It’s very much a reaction to the fossil fuel industry insisting these technologies are solutions, rather than us creating a typology of things that are not working. All of the [paper’s] authors are very keen on a habitable planet – and we’re not going to let perfection be the enemy of the good.

But this is a call [to] arms to say that governments need to be very careful about what they’re giving public subsidy to, because in a complex situation – where there’s an urgency for reducing emissions but also for creating sustainable livelihoods and for ensuring that the needs of people living in and around these projects are met – I think it’s very important to scrutinise the viability of these schemes.

The starting point was off the back of oil majors – or so-called integrated energy companies – coming out and being very bullish on sustainability and net zero, and alongside this, proffering that they were part of the solution to climate mitigation, energy transition, job creation, green growth. And we took this as a problem statement to begin our analysis: How can fossil companies be part of the solution?

Q: What did your work reveal about “false solutions” and how can it deepen understanding of them?

A: “False solutions” is a term that’s been used for many, many years by Indigenous groups and by frontline communities – so we wanted to formalise it because it’s not really been engaged with in academic literature so far. We thought it was quite a big gap that needed to be filled.

We thought how can we categorise it? How can we help redefine it? What are the characteristics of these false solutions? So we dug into the data, the EJ Atlas, across many technologies – from hydrogen through to carbon offsets and biofuels, but also renewable energy projects, because we were finding that renewable energy projects causing conflicts were either being used to fuel fossil fuel production, such as solar panels or wind turbines to run rigs, which we thought was an interesting pattern – and also utility-scale renewable energy projects which were operated by fossil fuel firms.

Out of total energy generation, fossil fuel companies’ production of renewables is a tiny, tiny fraction. Why do these projects exist, and how do they operate within the broader energy system? We wanted to look at what their function was – and going through the data and the lived experience of the communities on the frontlines of these projects, we found that they’re very much used to legitimise fossil fuel expansion or just continued operation.

Is the world’s big idea for greener air travel a flight of fancy?

And then we also looked at the governmental role within the institutions as well – so fossil fuel firms using these technologies and these false solutions as ways to garner public subsidy, particularly for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and hydrogen, to some degree.

And what we found across all these cases was they did very little to reduce emissions and generated environmental conflicts… and they ultimately delayed an energy transition, or the sort of industrial transformation that’s required to deliver deep and rapid emissions cuts.

Q: Shouldn’t fossil fuel companies be able to use all the climate solutions available to help reduce their emissions while the world is transitioning away from coal, oil and gas?

A: My response [to that argument] is to actually look at the data. When people say hydrogen and CCS are very important and they’re crucial, I don’t disagree with the idea that we might need some sort of technology to suck carbon out the atmosphere at some point in the future. But currently, the operational projects are not delivering that, and fossil fuel projects should not be expanded on the premise that future technologies can undo their emissions.

Just a few weeks ago, the Financial Times ran a very big story about how most of the oil majors have cancelled all their hydrogen projects because the scale of it’s not there yet, and they don’t think it’s going to stack up. These are companies with huge amounts of capital in an easy-to-abate sector – energy – saying we’re not going to do this. So you have to question the plan of hydrogen as a solution, if even the people that have the expertise and the capital to make it work are saying we’re not going to do this because we cannot make it work.

Clean hydrogen hype fades as high costs dampen demand

Likewise with carbon capture, many of the large energy projects and energy producers that have garnered vast amounts of public subsidies on the promise that they will do carbon capture are cutting those research projects down.

So at this stage in the energy transition – which some people call the “mid transition”, the difficult part – I think we need to scrutinise these technologies and look at what they do deliver on a project-by-project basis, and then on an aggregate basis.

Q: High-carbon industries say they need government subsidies to cover the high cost of researching, developing and creating markets for new technologies to help combat climate change. Is this justified?

A: I’m a big believer in the idea that the energy transition – the ideal energy transition, which is one of scaling up new industry while phasing out an old one – is going to require not only public money, but public coordination. That means states actively stewarding investment, picking winners and sequencing what is going to be a highly disruptive process.

I think public subsidy is necessary. We need to see deep and rapid decarbonisation, especially in wealthy industrialised states, but it should be used in a very targeted way to scale up technologies which have a marked impact on emissions and also uplift welfare as well – so heat pumps insulating homes in poorer communities. With these sort of things, you get your bang for your buck.

Comment: The battle over a global energy transition is on between petro-states and electro-states

You don’t get bang for your buck giving BP and Shell money to pilot a carbon capture and storage facility. It’s an extension of existing relationships between big business and government that needs to be looked at closely in the context of energy transition, because ultimately, these companies are not serious about transitioning at the requisite speed or scale to stave off climate disaster.

Look at both oil and gas companies’ ownership of renewable assets (1.42% of operational renewable projects around the world) and the renewables share of their primary generation (0.13%). They have the capital, and they have the know-how to do this. They haven’t done it. The question is, why do they need more public subsidy to continue not doing it?",https://www.climatechangenews.com/wp-content/files/2025/03/COP27_Masayoshi-Iyoda-350.org_.jpg,N,,2026-01-13 02:57:07.646434

In this issue of Biomass Magazine, we examine how renewable carbon is being defined, deployed and scaled—from pyrogenic biocarbon standards and orchard waste solutions to the accelerating role of renewable natural gas in transportation. Collectively, the feature articles we’ve delivered underscore a central theme: biomass is moving away from a niche solution, emerging as a critical tool in the broader energy and carbon-management transition.

In “Developing Pyrogenic Biocarbon Standards” on page 20, Associate Editor Katie Schroeder explores the growing urgency around clear definitions and standardized testing for biochar, biocarbon and biocoal as these materials move from pilot projects to commercial markets. Through insights from Myles Gray of the U.S. Biochar Initiative and Chris Wiberg of Timber Products Inspection/Biomass Energy Lab, the article explains how standards are essential for investor confidence, global trade and safe handling—particularly as industrial demand for low-carbon materials accelerates. As interest from sectors like steelmaking and construction grows, this feature highlights why consistent terminology and ISO-aligned frameworks are foundational to the next phase of biocarbon growth. And hopefully, it serves as a resource in regard to the commonalities and differences among pyrogenic biocarbon, which is the broad term encompassing these materials.

Our biochar coverage continues with “From Burn Piles to Biochar” on page 14, by contributing writer Keith Loria, which takes a deep dive into California’s San Joaquin Valley as it completes the final phase of its agricultural burn ban. With open burning no longer an option, growers are navigating higher costs, limited infrastructure and mounting volumes of ag residue. Loria examines how localized biochar and biomass solutions—such as the Sitos Group and Treehouse California Almonds pyrolysis project—could offer a viable alternative, while also outlining the regulatory, economic and logistical hurdles that still stand in the way of large-scale adoption. It’s a timely look at how policy, agriculture and bioenergy intersect on the ground.

Rounding out our feature article lineup is “Fueling the Future” on page 26, by contributing writer Caitlin Scheresky. The story profiles OPAL Fuels and the rapid expansion of renewable natural gas as a transportation fuel, tracing OPAL’s evolution from landfill gas-to-power roots to a vertically integrated RNG producer serving heavy-duty trucking fleets across North America. Against a backdrop of shifting policy incentives, depressed D3 RIN prices and growing international interest, the article illustrates why methane abatement and RNG infrastructure are increasingly viewed as some of the most practical and impactful near-term decarbonization tools—especially for hard-to-electrify sectors.

Together, these feature stories reflect an industry at an inflection point—one where definitions matter, local solutions are critical and scalable projects are beginning to reshape how biomass contributes to a lower-carbon future. Also complimentary to this theme are our contribution articles, which focus on sustainable aviation fuel’s potential, feedstock dynamics in the wake of SAF and maritime mandates, and lessons learned in material handling design and execution.

2025 was ripe with challenges, but we’ve also seen many successes and have been fortunate to help tell these stories. As we move into the year ahead, we wish everyone across the biomass value chain a year defined by progress, resilience and success. From project development and policy clarity to market growth and deployment, Biomass Magazine looks forward to telling the stories that shape the industry’s future.

Good evening, Gujarat has done it again. Just weeks ago we told you about the Indian AI research organization at GIFT City. We told you that the state was pivoting but had Vibrant Gujarat 2026. We did not expect that that pivot would become an avalanche. 4 giants, one stage, 1 message make Gujarat the motherboard of India's Reliance Adani, Welspun, Jyoti, CNC. These four showed up center stage. And opened the world. 8.6 lacquerware rupees. Yes, Mukesh Ambani took the mic in Rajkot and made a statement, a 7,00, 000 crore rupee statement, which is double award Reliance spent in the last five years. And here is a glimpse into what lies ahead. Jamnagar as we know it is the oil capital and now solar, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel and alongside all of that is also building. India's largest AI ready data center right there in Jamnagar. The goal? Well, geos, people, first intelligence platform, AI in your language, on your device, and importantly, at an affordable price. He wants the AI revolution to be as cheap as data. And the timing? While it is almost cinematic, this lands exactly as the street. Whispers are getting louder about the Reliance Jio IPO, a $4.5 billion float. And a potential $240 billion valuation, I guess he has broken the investment news right now to drive up the valuation at a later stage. Quite nice. No? That's actually how the game is being played right now. And of course, while everyone else is focused on the industry, he's also, by the way, backing the bid for the 2036 Olympics, which means control the business and host the spectacle, of course. The moment Ambani sat down, Karan Adani stood up with the counterpunch. A 1.5 lakh crore rupee whopping counterpunch. The target cutch. Adani calls it their karma bhumi. We call it a fortress. He is building the Khabra Renewable Energy Park, 37 gigawatts, the world's largest, commissioned by 20-30. And then of course, there is Mundra Port. What started as a port now anchors. An entire industrial system, copper, PVC, power, logistics, with the goal to double capacity over a decade, which clearly indicates that Ambani controls the data and Adani controls the electrons and the movement. 2 giants, one state. But the money isn't just for the billionaires, it's also for the builders. And now of course, we come to Jyoti CNC 10,000 crore rupees. This is for the deep tech. Ecosystem, aerospace, defense, semiconductor, machines. So while Ambani shapes the digital layer, Jyoti builds the physical one. And together they established the foundations of Atman neighbor Bharat.

Etihad Airways posts record 22.4 million passengers, signals more capacity for 2026 assignments

Etihad Airways carried 22.4 million passengers in 2025—its highest total to date—representing 21 % year-on-year growth and an 88.3 % load factor, the airline reported on 12 January ([m.economictimes.com](https://m.economictimes.com/nri/visit/etihad-airways-notches-record-passenger-traffic-in-2025/articleshow/126477712.cms)). December alone saw 2.2 million flyers, underscoring Abu Dhabi’s rebound as a transfer hub.

CEO Antonoaldo Neves attributed the surge to a 127-strong fleet (up 29 aircraft in 2025) and network expansion from 94 to 110 destinations. For corporate mobility programmes, the numbers translate into greater seat availability on key long-haul routes and improved chances of securing group allocations during peak project phases.

The growth also feeds into Etihad’s Stopover programme, which grants business travellers two free hotel nights in Abu Dhabi—an incentive HR teams can leverage when structuring cost-efficient layovers or client meetings. Cargo capacity has risen in tandem, benefiting relocations that require unaccompanied baggage or pet transport.

Before those extra seats are booked, however, many travellers will still need to secure UAE entry clearance. VisaHQ streamlines this step by handling tourist, business and transit visa applications online, offering real-time status updates and dedicated support for bulk corporate requests—services that pair neatly with Etihad’s growing network.

Sinopec, the world's largest oil refiner and China's top aviation fuel producer, processes crude into oil products, including jet fuel, supplying it to CNAF, the country's largest State-owned aviation fuel supplier which integrates the purchase, transportation, storage, quality management, sales and into-plane service of aviation fuel.
By eliminating intermediary links and reducing supply costs, the merger will provide a robust guarantee for China's aviation energy security, said Liu.
The merger will allow both domestic enterprises to leverage complementary strengths, scaling up China's aviation fuel industry while sharpening its global competitiveness and accelerating the sector's green transition.
According to International Air Transport Association data, global SAF consumption was expected to reach 6 million tons in 2025, surging to 18 million tons by 2030.","China has greenlit a landmark merger between its top refiner China Petroleum and Chemical Corp (Sinopec) and China National Aviation Fuel Group, creating a vertically integrated giant to anchor a market where jet fuel consumption is set to nearly double by 2040, said industry experts.

The State-led consolidation between the country's largest refiner and Asia's largest aviation transportation service provider is designed to dismantle the logistic barriers between Sinopec's massive refining capacity and CNAF's nationwide airport network, they say.

The restructuring of Sinopec and CNAF was announced by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council on Thursday.

This synergy arrives as China's aviation fuel demand is projected to surge from around 39 million metric tons in 2024 to 75 million tons by 2040, requiring a more resilient and cost-effective supply chain to support the world's fastest-growing aviation market.

According to a recently released report by Economics & Development Research Institute under China Petroleum and Chemical Corp, jet fuel has emerged as the sole growth engine in China's future refined oil consumption structure.

Forecasts by S&P Global also reveal that China's aviation fuel consumption is projected to reach 75 million tons by 2040.

Industry insiders believe that the restructuring is expected to lower aviation fuel supply costs, boost the industry's competitive edge, and support a green transition in the aviation sector.

The combined entity will leverage its strengths in integrated refining and petrochemical operations and its aviation fuel supply security system, said Liu Xingguo, a researcher with China Enterprise Confederation.

Sinopec, the world's largest oil refiner and China's top aviation fuel producer, processes crude into oil products, including jet fuel, supplying it to CNAF, the country's largest State-owned aviation fuel supplier which integrates the purchase, transportation, storage, quality management, sales and into-plane service of aviation fuel.

By eliminating intermediary links and reducing supply costs, the merger will provide a robust guarantee for China's aviation energy security, said Liu.

Currently, major international aviation fuel service providers are primarily integrated petrochemical giants, characterized by massive production scales, robust infrastructure support, and extensive sales networks, having established a fully integrated production-supply-marketing business model.

The merger will allow both domestic enterprises to leverage complementary strengths, scaling up China's aviation fuel industry while sharpening its global competitiveness and accelerating the sector's green transition.

Aviation has long been one of the most difficult transportation sectors to decarbonize, with sustainable aviation fuel widely recognized as the primary pathway to net-zero.

According to International Air Transport Association data, global SAF consumption was expected to reach 6 million tons in 2025, surging to 18 million tons by 2030.

Sinopec was Asia's first company to master proprietary R&D and commercial production of bio-jet fuel, while CNAF plays a pivotal role in market promotion and ecosystem building.

""This restructuring is a forward-looking move to seize the high ground in green aviation and cultivate a new growth engine,"" said Zhu Changming, a partner at Sunshine Law Firm.

Sinopec announced earlier a Heads of Agreement with French energy giant TotalEnergies to jointly develop a sustainable aviation fuel production unit at Sinopec's refinery in China. The planned unit, jointly owned by Sinopec and TotalEnergies, will have the capacity to produce 230,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel per year and will process local waste or residues from the circular economy, including cooking oils and animal fats.

Restructuring the State-owned economy is a key step toward building more competitive and sizable State-owned enterprises and capital. During the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, China strategically restructured 10 centrally-administered SOEs into six groups and established nine new central SOEs, effectively enhancing the allocation and operational efficiency of State-owned capital.

SAF’s Future Following a period of growth in 2025, production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is projected to slow down in 2026.","Five years following the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, aviation has more than roared back.

Despite some lingering challenges, such as supply chain shortages and higher labor costs, 2025 appears to have been a record year for the industry with revenues nearing a record $1 trillion mark, aided by strong demand and stable fuel costs.

With the pandemic mostly an afterthought, the industry is looking to build off its current momentum heading into 2026 highlighted by growth, modernization, competition and sustainability. Here are some of the top stories in aviation heading into the new year.

Another Busy Year for Air Travel

In the U.S., aviation analytics firm Cirium expects passenger demand to remain robust in 2026 supported by continued recovery in international travel and sustained growth in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the International Air Transportation Association (IATA) expects worldwide passenger traffic to grow nearly 5 percent this year.

For cargo, IATA expects nearly 3 percent in growth, noting that air freight is projected to remain robust thanks to AI-driven investment, increasing demand for high-value, time-sensitive goods, and the industry’s shift towards e-commerce.

While airlines look to grow, persistent supply chain bottlenecks have affected deliveries from big manufacturers, including Airbus and Boeing, making demand outpace the supply of planes. Additionally, longer certification times by federal regulators have held up deliveries of aircraft, particularly Boeing’s 737 MAX 7 and MAX 10 narrowbody aircraft.

ATC Modernization Full Steam Ahead

The U.S. is moving ahead with plans to modernize the nation’s air traffic control network in one of the largest aviation infrastructure projects in decades.

The Federal Aviation Administration is putting forth over $12 billion in Congressional funding towards a full overhaul of the country’s ATC system. According to the FAA, the funding will cover various projects replacing core infrastructure such as telecommunications networks, radar, software and hardware to support modern air travel.

Furthermore, federal funding will go towards increasing the number of air traffic controllers by nearly 8,900 through 2028. Both the FAA and U.S. Department of Transportation have taken measures to increase the hiring process of air traffic controllers while also providing incentives to students and graduates.

In December, the FAA and DOT selected national security firm Peraton to manage the ATC modernization project following a months-long bidding process. Peraton will serve as the project’s prime integrator supporting the FAA to deploy new systems and capabilities throughout the National Airspace System and, “providing centralized leadership to ensure change happens in a coordinated, effective way.”

The initiative is part of the Trump administration’s timeline to complete the overhaul of the nation’s ATC network by 2028 amid growing calls by the industry to replace aging equipment and upgrade air traffic control staffing nationwide to reduce flight delays and improve efficiency of the National Airspace System.

The Race for Premium Customers Accelerates

The hyper-competitive airline industry is about to add eats, lounges and in-flight products in 2026 as airlines battle for premium customers.

Numerous U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United, plan to add lounges at their respective hub airports in 2026. In addition, banks including American Express, Capital One and Chase, have expanded in the airport lounge space, and each have new locations planned as well.

JetBlue Airways recently opened its first BlueHouse lounge at New York-JFK’s Terminal 5, with a second Boston location coming in 2026. Southwest Airlines also plans to enter the lounge mix; the airline’s CEO Bob Jordan told CNBC in December that the airline is “actively pursuing” a network of airline lounges.

Onboard, U.S. carriers, including American, Delta, Southwest and United, continue to roll out upgraded premium seats, while JetBlue is reportedly exploring plans to introduce domestic first-class seats to much of its fleet in 2026.

Additionally, airlines are introducing faster in-flight connectivity that can be used by passengers at no cost. United and British Airways are adopting Starlink Wi-Fi in the coming years while American and Southwest have introduced free Wi-Fi to members of their frequent flier programs.

Spirit Looks to Build on its Bankruptcy Progress

Spirit Airlines’ ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy is being closely monitored by the industry as the airline continues to reorganize for a successful future.

Spirit is in its second bankruptcy filed in August 2025 after reorganizing from November 2024 through February 2025. The airline has faced multiple challenges in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, which include changing customer preferences, a failed merger attempt with JetBlue challenged successfully by the Department of Justice, global engine shortages causing unplanned groundings of its Airbus A320 family aircraft and rising labor costs.

In its second bankruptcy, Spirit has taken more aggressive measures to organize its balance sheet. The carrier has cut jobs, exited over a dozen airports and has shed nearly half of its Airbus fleet.

In recent weeks, Spirit has reached several milestones with its restructuring plan including an additional $100 million in debtor-in-possession financing from its lenders, adding to the carrier’s $475 million stockpile approved by a bankruptcy court, and an agreement with its pilots and flight attendants unions on an amended labor contract that will further cut costs and aid in the company’s long-term recovery.

Spirit continues to operate normally, including all flights, ticket sales and its frequent flier program, and has maintained its presence at PIT during its two bankruptcies. Under its latest plan, Spirit expects to exit restructuring and become profitable again by 2027 as a standalone airline, while some industry reports have argued that a merger agreement with another airline is also a possible outcome.

American, United Turn 100

American and United have huge birthdays planned for 2026 as both airlines turn 100 years old. While United has not unveiled celebration plans yet, American has revealed how it will recognize its rich history during its centennial.

American has added a new retro jet to its lineup of heritage liveries with a Boeing 777-300ER, registered N735AT, painted to reflect the airline’s “Silver Eagle” color scheme that first appeared on its Douglas DC-3s in the 1930s. In addition, American will unveil a Boeing 737-800 wearing a modified version of its current livery featuring the company’s centennial logo.

Additionally, American is adding its centennial logo decals to its fleet of 1,500 aircraft and has updated its website, social media channels and in-flight entertainment in recognition of the company’s milestone. It has also created a special website paying homage to the airline’s history featuring stories from employees and merchandise available for purchase.

American first took flight on April 15, 1926, using a Robertson Aircraft Corporation DH-4 flying mail between Chicago and St. Louis.

United traces its roots to aviation pioneer Walter T. Varney, who founded Varney Air Lines on April 6, 1926, the first of several subsidiaries controlled by Boeing that merged to form United years later.

American and United’s centennials come after Delta celebrated its 100th birthday in 2025. Delta marked the occasion by painting two newly delivered Airbus A321neo and A350-900 aircraft in special centennial liveries, as well has hosting numerous employee events and unveiling renovations to the Delta Flight Museum in Atlanta.

SAF’s Future

Following a period of growth in 2025, production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is projected to slow down in 2026.

According to IATA’s latest report, SAF output reached nearly 1.9 million tons, almost double the total amount from 2024, but the total figure, “is a downward revision from IATA’s earlier forecasts due to lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities,” the organization said.

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” IATA Director Willie Walsh said in a statement.",https://blueskypit.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/DSC_6269-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:57:40.281474

“Sustainable aviation fuel puts the Cascadia region at the forefront of the next major chapter of the clean energy transition that will shape how the world is powered,” said Washington State Gov.
“Cascadia is a concrete example of that collaboration toward meaningful progress on a Sustainable Aviation Fuel ecosystem right here at home.""
The January 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors.
The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.","Washington State leaders, aviation industry partners, research institutions, Tribal representatives and sustainability advocates on Jan. 8 launched the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator (CSAA). Announced at the Boeing Future of Flight, the initiative is the most comprehensive and well-funded across the region of its kind to accelerate the production, deployment and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Funded through a 2025 State of Washington appropriation and private philanthropic donation of an additional $10 million, the CSAA positions the Pacific Northwest as a global leader in an accelerated transition to sustainable aviation fuel while capitalizing on the once-in-a-generation economic opportunity of scaling local SAF production. In partnership with the Washington State Department of Commerce, CSAA is a non-profit organization dedicated to advancing the renewable fuels industry in the Pacific Northwest.

Unlike traditional jet fuel, SAF is formulated from sustainable feedstocks, like crop seed oil, agricultural and forestry waste. Advancements in SAF technology and greater availability of affordable SAF will reduce the carbon footprint of air transportation, improve air quality and contribute to a more sustainable future while creating new industries, jobs and economic opportunities.

“Sustainable aviation fuel puts the Cascadia region at the forefront of the next major chapter of the clean energy transition that will shape how the world is powered,” said Washington State Gov. Bob Ferguson. “Clean fuels are good for jobs, good for the economy and good for the environment. Washington is uniquely positioned to seize on this opportunity.”

The Cascadia region has been a trailblazer in aerospace innovation for over a century, and today it is uniquely positioned as a global center of aviation innovation, with an opportunity to unlock the next generation of sustainable fuel. With access to local, low carbon feedstocks, affordable clean energy, established infrastructure and a skilled workforce, the region has all the elements necessary to support production of up to one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel by 2035. Scaling production at this level would drive economic prosperity and development, strengthen regional energy security and independence, support state and regional climate initiatives and build on Cascadia’s long legacy as an aviation innovator.

The global aviation industry, which generates some $4.1 trillion in economic activity and supports 86.5 million jobs, currently accounts for approximately 2-3% of global carbon dioxide emissions, in addition to other environmental impacts. SAF is a safe, effective drop-in solution projected to be used for the next 70-plus years that can reduce emissions by 80% compared to fossil-based fuels and the transition to a thriving circular economy through locally produced SAF.

""This initiative will be successful because it is grounded here, in the communities where aviation, manufacturing and clean energy intersect,"" said Snohomish County Executive Dave Somers, who serves as chair of the CSAA board of directors. ""CSAA builds on the infrastructure, workforce and partnerships we have already put in place, and this is just the beginning. Coalition partners like Washington State University are eager to partner in the establishment of a world class research and development facility adjacent to Paine Field. Combined with our region’s aviation industry cluster, these developments ensure we will be a leader in global aviation sustainability and investment well into the future.”

The region’s strength is built on advanced science, technology and aviation expertise, supported by leaders like Washington State University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and Boeing. This research foundation provides the technical backbone needed to move sustainable aviation fuel from small-scale production to commercial scale.

“For the last six decades in Snohomish County, Boeing has relied on strong community partnerships to turn ambitious ideas into reality,” said Bill McSherry, Boeing vice president of government operations. “Cascadia is a concrete example of that collaboration toward meaningful progress on a Sustainable Aviation Fuel ecosystem right here at home.""

Local aviation and technology leaders recognize that scaling SAF research and production will require coordinated action across the entire aviation ecosystem. Manufacturers like Boeing bring the technical expertise to integrate sustainable aviation fuels into aircraft and operations, while operators including Alaska Airlines and Amazon provide the operational expertise and market demand for cost-competitive SAF. Lawmakers, like Washington State Senator Marko Liias, have championed these partnerships at the state level by advancing legislation that supports SAF development and unlocks long-term investment.

“Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are committed to this journey to reduce carbon emissions for a more sustainable future for aviation, and while we are proud to be the most fuel-efficient premium U.S. carrier, SAF remains the biggest lever for us to meaningfully lower our emissions and reach our decarbonization goal,” said Diana Birkett Rakow, CEO of Hawaiian Airlines. “We’re thrilled to be a founding partner of CSAA because regional, cross-sector efforts like this are critical to align policy, public and private investment, to identify and invest in the right technologies and to incentivize and scale local production.""

Combined with existing infrastructure, affordable clean energy and access to feedstocks, research institutions are advancing the science that makes sustainable aviation fuels viable, and policymakers are ensuring sustainability and airport community impacts remain central as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels.

""Washington has led the world in aerospace innovation for generations, and now we face a defining moment for the next generation of aviation,"" said Washington State Senator Marko Liias. ""Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it. This is the moment to act, and CSAA gives us the vehicle to lead.""

The January 8 launch event featured remarks from leaders across the aviation, research and public sectors. Executives from Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines and Boeing spoke to the importance of aligning the full ecosystem of manufacturers and operators, policy, research, financing and public awareness to scale sustainable aviation fuel and secure the long-term future of aviation. Representative Mia Gregerson highlighted the need to center sustainability and airport communities as the industry transitions to cleaner fuels. Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell underscored the role of research and innovation in advancing sustainable aviation fuel from the lab to commercial deployment, while Washington State Department of Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn addressed the state’s investments in clean energy, economic development and partnerships with Tribal nations.

The event also hosted a panel discussion moderated by Tim Zenk, a sustainable aviation fuel expert at Earth Finance, featuring executives Guy Palumbo at Amazon; Andy Billig, board member at SkyNRG; labor leader Jon Holden, Machinists Union, District 751; and Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck. The panel focused on investment pathways, workforce development and the economic opportunity presented by large scale sustainable aviation fuel production.

According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.
Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.
Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.
“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said.","Iowa produced 4.6 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025 — a figure consistent with the past two years and one that Iowa Renewable Fuels Association says could be higher if Iowa had access to carbon sequestration technologies.

The call for carbon capture and sequestration comes from the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association at the start of Iowa’s 2026 legislative session, where debate around property rights and carbon sequestration pipelines are set to be top priority.

A proposed carbon sequestration pipeline from Summit Carbon Solutions would connect to Iowa ethanol plants and transport their sequestered carbon dioxide to an underground storage site. This would allow ethanol plants to participate in the ultra-low carbon ethanol industry to produce things like sustainable aviation fuel and marine fuel, but the project has been contested in legal and legislative settings by landowners who feel the pipeline is not a public use worthy of the power of eminent domain.

Under eminent domain, unwilling landowners can be forced to accept easements on their property at a price set by a county commission for projects considered in the public interest.

Nationally, the U.S. produced 16.4 billion gallons of ethanol in 2025, according to the national Renewable Fuels Association. IRFA pointed out in a news release that while national ethanol production has increased annually over the past five years, Iowa production has remained “stagnant” at 4.6 billion gallons annually since 2023.

While Iowa remains the top ethanol producing state in the country, in 2025 the Hawkeye State produced 28% of the nation’s ethanol supply, which is less than the share it produced in 2023 and 2024 when Iowa accounted for roughly 30% of the national share, according to the association.

Figures from the U.S. Department of Agriculture show that increased ethanol production in the country has been driven primarily by a rise in ethanol exports. In March 2025, fuel ethanol demand for the month was equivalent to about 465 million bushels of corn, which was a 60-million bushel increase in monthly demand from 10 years prior.

Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw said Iowa is “behind in the race” as other states work to take advantage of incentives and market benefits of ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Investment dollars flow to areas with a perceived competitive advantage,” Shaw said in a news release. “The states attracting significant investment have one thing in common – the ability to sequester carbon either locally or via pipeline infrastructure.”

In addition to expanded markets, low carbon ethanol fuel producers and CO2 transportation pipelines are eligible for federal tax credits known as 45Z and 45Q.

According to the association, if all 4.6 billion gallons of Iowa ethanol utilized carbon sequestration technology, it could bring $3 billion to the state via 45Z tax credits.

Iowa ethanol advocates have also said the start of a carbon sequestration pipeline in Nebraska would cause Iowa to lose its “crown” as the top ethanol producing state, because business would shift to the more lucrative, ultra low-carbon ethanol producing facilities.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Iowa continues to have a significant lead over other states in ethanol production capacity with nearly double the number of plants in Nebraska.

“There is no reason why Iowa plants won’t grow in the near future if we maintain their access to the tools and technologies to compete,” Shaw said.

Lawmakers passed a bill last year that restricted carbon sequestration pipelines’ abilities to utilize eminent domain in the state, but the bill was vetoed by Gov. Kim Reynolds.

Landowners opposing the pipeline project plan to lobby, beginning Tuesday, for similar legislation this year to limit the project’s ability to take land for its construction against landowner wishes.

The Summit pipeline has also been affected by a ban on eminent domain for CO2 pipelines through South Dakota. Recent filings from the company indicate it may change paths, pending state approval, to avoid crossing through South Dakota.

Shaw said emerging ethanol markets are “demanding” ultra-low carbon ethanol.

“Iowa needs carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and conservation-smart agriculture practices to be attractive,” Shaw said. “IRFA will continue to support legislation that enhances landowner rights, streamlines the permitting process, and maintains a viable path forward for CCS. Our future depends on it.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/adkins-ethanol-plant-lena-IL-_-Getty.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:57:53.989173

These approvals confirm that the project meets state and local environmental standards, including requirements related to land use, water protection, and fuel transportation. Project Wigeon will be among North America’s first commercial-scale SAF projects producing jet fuel from renewable natural gas (RNG).

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to reduce harmful emissions, which is why SkyNRG is building SAF facilities such as Project Wigeon around the world,” said John Plaza, Chief Executive Officer of SkyNRG Americas. “The Department of Ecology’s environmental review and Walla Walla County’s approval demonstrate our commitment to building this facility the right way—using industry-leading technology and conducting robust analysis of environmental impacts. This milestone allows SkyNRG to continue delivering clean fuel to major airports, building economic opportunity in Eastern Washington, and protecting natural resources and community health for years to come.”

“For several years, Boeing has supported SkyNRG’s efforts to develop SAF in the Pacific Northwest to enable our industry’s long-term growth, innovation, and efficiency,” said Allison Melia, Vice President of Sustainability at Boeing. “We look forward to leveraging SAF supply from SkyNRG and others for our operations as we increase airplane production to meet strong demand for our products.”

SkyNRG’s new facility supports a fast-emerging SAF global market as the aviation industry looks to develop new, domestically produced fuel options to meet rising demand and reduce emissions. Demand for SAF is accelerating, with global demand projected to reach five billion gallons by 2030 and more than 12 billion gallons by 2035.

Environmental Permitting Progress

In December 2025, Walla Walla County issued Project Wigeon its Critical Areas Permit, which documents the facility’s compliance with local environmental regulations.

The Critical Areas Permit was preceded by the Washington State Department of Ecology’s Mitigated Determination of Nonsignificance (MDNS) pursuant to the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) in September 2025. The MDNS reflects the state’s conclusion that there are no significant adverse outcomes resulting from the project that are not mitigated.

The facility’s mitigation measures address local air emissions, clean fuel transportation, use of local water supplies, and groundwater impacts. This includes energy-efficient technologies built into the facility’s design and operations, creating a durable foundation for both environmental protection and long-term economic growth in the region.

Key aspects of the project include:

Closed-loop industrial water system (Zero Liquid Discharge): All industrial and process water produced at Project Wigeon will be treated and reused on site, avoiding discharge, storage in ponds, or dispersal into groundwater.

Water conservation: The facility will use water from the Port of Walla Walla water system and will maximize recycling to reduce overall water demand.

Energy Production: Project Wigeon will utilize by-products of SAF production and excess steam to produce electricity on-site to offset impacts on the state’s electricity grid and reduce the overall lifecycle emissions of SAF.

Air quality protections: The facility will be designed to operate under stringent air permit conditions set by state regulators, with ongoing monitoring and reporting.

Stormwater management: Engineered containment systems will manage and control stormwater to protect surrounding land and water resources to limit impacts to local groundwater.

Transportation safety and coordination: The transportation plan for SAF deliveries prioritizes safe, reliable methods for rail and trucks, purpose-built loading and containment areas that are aligned with federal and state requirements. Coordination with local partners and emergency services will be factored into project development and regular operations.

These measures, and the secured state and county approvals, are the result of more than three years of analysis and studies provided to state regulators, local officials, technical experts, and community leaders. This collaboration ensures the facility meets Washington’s highest environmental and community standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is made from sustainable resources and can be used alongside traditional jet fuel to reduce emissions. It is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it can be used without changes to aircraft or fueling infrastructure once blended and certified.

Fuel produced at the Walla Walla site will use RNG feedstocks, otherwise known as biogenic methane. RNG is collected from domestic landfills, wastewater treatment facilities, and manure from animal farms, and can be delivered to Project Wigeon through existing infrastructure. SAF produced at Project Wigeon can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions up to 85% compared to fossil jet fuel, based on Washington state’s emissions calculators, and can materially reduce particulate and sulfur emissions from jet aircraft that burn traditional jet fuel.

Washington’s Role in Scaling the SAF Industry

Washington state is a national leader in SAF policy, backed by bipartisan support to scale clean fuels, cut emissions, improve air quality, and strengthen U.S. energy independence through domestic aviation fuel production.

That leadership is reinforced by policies such as Senate Bill 5447, signed into law in 2023, which established one of the nation’s most effective incentives to scale sustainable aviation fuel. The state legislature has also demonstrated long-standing leadership through the Washington State Alternative Jet Fuels Workgroup. Created in 2011, this leadership group advances SAF development statewide through coordinated policy recommendations that support innovation, job creation, and emission reduction across the state’s aviation sector.

In addition to legislative support for SAF production and use, the executive branch has played an active role as a partner in advancing this work. In 2025, the Washington State Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility, underscoring the project’s economic potential and the state’s commitment to advancing energy transition opportunities.",https://stateaviationjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-Plane-w-logo-1-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-12 17:12:16.573210

People with solar panels on their roofs aren’t just consumers anymore — they’re producers too. Our traditional system for tracking and trading energy wasn’t built for this kind of complexity.

The blockchain in the energy market shows impressive growth — from $3.1 billion in 2024, it’s expected to hit over $90 billion by 2034. Behind these figures sit real problems: how do you track where exactly your electricity came from? How do you make sure that a renewable energy certificate is legit? How do you let people sell excess energy to their neighbors without a pile of middlemen?

The Blockchain technology in the energy market offers answers to these questions. The technology works like an unchangeable ledger where every transaction leaves a trace that’s impossible to fake or delete. For energy, this means transparency we’ve never had before — you see the entire path of every kilowatt from source to consumer.

In this article, we’ll look at ten companies already implementing the blockchain in the energy sector today.

What is Blockchain and How Does It Work in Energy

Imagine a massive notebook that thousands of people store simultaneously. When someone adds a new entry, all copies update automatically. Faking something would be impossible — you’d need to change records in all of them at once. That’s exactly how blockchain works.

For the energy sector, this technology opens up new possibilities:

Peer-to-peer energy trading — solar panel owners can sell excess electricity directly to neighbors, without an energy company as a middleman. The system automatically calculates who produced and consumed how much.

Energy origin tracking — every kilowatt gets its own digital passport. When buying “green” electricity, you see it’s really from a wind farm in Colorado, not from a coal plant.

Automation through smart contracts — deals execute themselves. For example, when your electric car charges, blockchain automatically calculates the cost and processes payment without your involvement.

Distributed energy resource management — thousands of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries coordinate as a single system. Blockchain helps balance supply and demand in real time.

Renewable energy certification — every “green” certificate becomes a token on the blockchain. This makes double-selling the same portion of clean energy impossible.

Carbon credit transparency — companies reducing emissions get tokenized credits. The entire market becomes honest because you can see each credit’s history from beginning to end.

The Blockchain technology in the energy market solves the main problem of decentralized energy coordination. When millions of devices produce and consume energy, traditional systems can’t handle the accounting. Blockchain does this naturally.

The Blockchain in the energy market faces real challenges. Regulatory uncertainty remains the biggest obstacle — legislation simply can’t keep up with technology. Many countries lack clear rules for peer-to-peer energy trading, which slows implementation.

Technical complexity is no joke either. The blockchain “trilemma” — choosing between scalability, security, and decentralization — forces developers to compromise. Energy platforms must process thousands of transactions per second while remaining secure and decentralized.

Integration with legacy systems presents another major headache. Utilities spent decades building their IT infrastructure. Replacing everything with blockchain is impossible — we need to find ways to integrate. This requires time, money, and technical expertise.

Still, the prospects are impressive. By 2034, the blockchain technology in the energy market could reach $548 billion, according to some forecasts. This isn’t just market growth — it’s a fundamental change in how energy works.

Virtual power plants uniting thousands of small sources into a single system will become the norm. Microgrids will let neighborhoods and cities achieve energy independence. Cross-border energy trading will become simpler and more efficient.

The changing consumer role. People will stop being passive electricity receivers. They’ll become active energy market participants who produce, store, and sell energy. Blockchain makes this possible by ensuring transparency and automation.

Conclusions

The Blockchain technology in the energy market isn’t just a tech trend. It’s the answer to a real problem: how to manage an energy system where millions of devices simultaneously produce and consume electricity.

The ten companies we examined are already building this new energy system today. The Blockchain in the energy sector changes the fundamental rules. Energy becomes digital, decentralized, and democratic. Utilities stop being monopolists — they become platforms for exchange. Consumers gain control over their energy and the ability to earn from surpluses.

The next ten years will show how deep these changes run. One thing’s clear: energy will never be what it was before.",https://energiesmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/TOP-10-Providers-of-Blockchain-Solutions-for-the-Energy-Sector.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 16:57:58.221531

As we do annually, we revisit those calls to evaluate what held true, what evolved differently than expected, and what lessons the industry can carry forward.

Our 2025 predictions were shaped by a backdrop of regulatory uncertainty, uneven global demand, and a growing emphasis on transparency, technology, and alternative value streams. Looking back, many of the structural themes we highlighted proved durable.

Below, we review each of our 2025 predictions and assess how they ultimately played out.

1. 2025 Would Be the Year of Supply Chain Transparency

We predicted that 2025 would mark a turning point for supply chain transparency, driven by regulations such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and heightened scrutiny of carbon markets.

Transparency remained a defining theme throughout the year, even as regulatory implementation timelines shifted. Although EUDR compliance requirements were delayed and, in some cases, simplified, the pause did not ease pressure on companies to improve traceability. Instead, many organizations continued investing in data infrastructure, supplier visibility, and risk assessment tools in anticipation of eventual enforcement.

At the same time, voluntary carbon markets faced growing scrutiny around integrity, verification, and disclosure. Buyers became more selective, quality standards rose, and expectations for transparent sourcing and reporting increased across forest-based value chains.

Certification organizations also reinforced the importance of improved traceability. In early 2025, the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) publicly acknowledged the need to strengthen tracking systems within certified supply chains, highlighting the adoption of advanced digital record-keeping and traceability tools to improve accountability and verify timber origins.

Momentum continued later in the year. In October 2025, more than 600 members convened in Panama for FSC’s triennial global General Assembly and global sustainability summit, where Motion 30 was adopted by a large majority. The motion mandates the development of a global digital system to track materials and volumes across FSC supply chains, with the goal of reducing fraud, increasing transparency, and strengthening trust in the FSC label. The system is expected to be implemented by 2030, pending final member approval at the 2028 General Assembly.

2. Eastern and Western Economies Drift Further Apart Amid Renewed Trade Tariffs

In 2025 we expected continued economic divergence between Eastern and Western markets, driven by geopolitical tensions and renewed tariff activity that would reshape trade patterns and supply chain decisions.

By mid-2025, the global tariff environment had grown more unpredictable and layered. The United States reinforced and expanded tariff measures affecting a broad range of trading partners and products. A 50% tariff on imports from Brazil and an additional 25% tariff on select goods from India exemplified how expansive and complex tariff policy had become, prompting companies to reassess sourcing strategies and supply chain footprints amid rising cost and compliance uncertainty. Earlier tariffs targeting Canadian softwood lumber, Chinese finished goods, and EU paper products largely remained in place, while retaliatory actions continued to complicate cross-border trade.

Trade frictions were not limited to U.S. policy. The European Union also increased its use of trade-defense instruments in 2025, imposing and reviewing anti-dumping duties on a range of Chinese industrial and bio-based products. These actions reflected growing concern among EU policymakers about market distortion from low-priced Chinese imports and reinforced a broader trend toward protectionism and strategic decoupling between Eastern and Western economies. While not always directly targeting forest products, such measures contributed to a more fragmented global trade environment, raising uncertainty for manufacturers and downstream buyers alike.

Rather than acting as temporary disruptions, these trade frictions reshaped how forest products companies operated. Plant managers and procurement teams increasingly pursued diversified supplier bases and regional trade agreements to reduce exposure to unpredictable tariff regimes, while nearshoring and alternative sourcing strategies gained traction to manage both cost and lead-time risk. Mexican producers, for example, saw increased demand for tissue and packaging board as tariff-free alternatives under USMCA, and India’s exporters found new opportunities amid shifting flows away from China and other high-tariff corridors.

3. Timberland Values Pivot Toward Carbon Amid Shifting Market Dynamics

We expected timberland valuations to increasingly reflect carbon and environmental attributes as fiber markets faced pressure.

In reality, carbon considerations continued to gain prominence, particularly among institutional investors evaluating long-term asset resilience. However, the shift proved more evolutionary than transformative. While carbon and environmental services became part of underwriting conversations, they did not universally replace traditional value drivers such as stumpage and harvest flexibility. Ongoing concerns around credit quality, verification, and long-term demand tempered more aggressive assumptions tied solely to carbon revenues.

At the same time, 2025 highlighted how timberland value narratives are broadening beyond carbon credits alone. In December, Weyerhaeuser announced a partnership with a biocarbon producer to supply wood fiber for use in the steel and metals industries, positioning renewable timber inputs as a substitute for coal in heavy industrial processes. The initiative underscored growing interest in industrial decarbonization pathways that leverage forest resources, expanding the range of potential environmental value streams tied to timberland ownership.

Taken together, these developments reinforced a more nuanced reality: carbon and environmental attributes are increasingly influencing how timberland assets are evaluated.

4. The U.S. South Will Attract Global Attention with Competitive Pulp Mill Prospects

We highlighted the U.S. South as a focal point for global interest due to its fiber cost advantages and scale.

That attention materialized, particularly in downstream manufacturing and packaging investments by international players. At the same time, the pulp sector faced meaningful headwinds, including capacity rationalization and mill closures, which complicated the case for new greenfield pulp investments in the near term.

5. Lumber Market to Rebound in Late 2025 with New Mill Announcements on the Horizon

We predicted a late-2025 lumber market rebound accompanied by new mill announcements. While one new sawmill was announced over the summer, several sawmills closed and more curtailed.

Instead, 2025 looked more like a transition year. Prices showed periods of stability and modest recovery, but not a decisive rebound. Producers remained cautious, managing capacity through restarts, curtailments, and selective investments rather than aggressive expansion.

While industry sentiment improved toward the latter part of the year, market conditions reflected positioning for a recovery rather than the recovery itself.

6. Global Investors Will Eye the U.S. Forest Products Market Due to Competitive Advantages

We anticipated a major acquisition by a Latin American or European forest products company in the U.S.

While the most visible transaction did not come from the regions we specified, the broader prediction held true. In 2025, Sumitomo Forestry of Japan completed a significant acquisition tied to sawmill operations in Louisiana, expanding its North American manufacturing footprint and reinforcing a long-term strategy of investing directly in U.S. downstream wood products capacity. The deal underscored the continued appeal of U.S. forest products assets to international investors seeking fiber security, scale, and proximity to end markets.

In addition, Spain-based SAICA Group announced a major investment exceeding $100 million in a new U.S. corrugated packaging facility. Although not a pulp-focused acquisition, the project represented a clear example of European capital flowing into U.S. forest products manufacturing to serve North American demand. Together, these moves highlighted sustained global interest in U.S. assets, even as investment activity skewed more toward sawmills and packaging than large integrated pulp platforms.

7. High Fiber Costs in the Nordics Will Force Pulp Mill Closures Amid Russia-Ukraine Crisis

Our prediction focused on sustained high fiber costs in the Nordics following disruptions linked to the Russia–Ukraine conflict.

In 2025, Nordic producers continued to face elevated wood costs and margin pressure. While this led to production curtailments and operational adjustments, widespread permanent closures were less evident than anticipated. The cost challenge was real, but responses were more flexible and incremental.

8. AI Would Not Take Over the World

Our final prediction argued that artificial intelligence would become a meaningful productivity differentiator rather than a disruptive takeover force.

This proved largely accurate. AI adoption expanded across industries, including forest products, but most companies remained early in scaling full value capture. Those that invested in operational analytics, maintenance optimization, and decision-support tools began to see measurable gains, reinforcing a widening gap between early adopters and laggards.

“The State of African Energy: 2026 Outlook Report” is available for download.","Let’s really think about this: Today, Africa contributes less than 5% of the world’s energy-related emissions, despite being home to 19% of Earth’s population. By 2060, the continent’s population is expected to reach 28% of the global total. But guess what? In that same timeframe, its share of energy-related emissions is projected to remain a modest 9%.

When you consider these statistics compiled in the recently released African Energy Chamber’s “State of African Energy: 2026 Outlook Report,” it’s evident that Africa’s responsibility for climate change is minimal at most. And yet, the Western advocates who continue the chant of “NET-ZERO! NET-ZERO!” expect their calls for rapidly phasing out fossil fuels to be enacted universally.

This makes ZERO sense.

Low per-capita energy use actually positions Africa to drive global decarbonization efforts. However, this low-carbon development pathway must be one that respects the unique needs of Africans.

It’s just a fact that infrastructure limitations make large-scale decarbonization more challenging on the continent than in other parts of the world. A lack of grid capacity, outdated transmission lines, and a significant energy deficit hinders the integration of large-scale renewable energy projects, such as solar and wind farms.A significant portion of the population lacks access to reliable electricity, and the continent as a whole faces energy deficits, which means decarbonization efforts must occur alongside the fundamental need to expand energy access.

Addressing such infrastructure challenges requires more than just building new assets — it also requires modernizing grids, promoting energy efficiency, improving regulatory environments, and fostering local expertise. Amid emissions regulations drafted by both the International Maritime Organization and the European Union, Africa has the potential to serve as a major green fuel supplier. But this potential cannot be reached without significant investments in infrastructure upgrades.

As we are all too aware, transitioning to a low-carbon economy requires significant upfront investment. Many African countries struggle to secure the necessary capital due to perceived political and financial risks. Inconsistent policies and slow permitting processes create uncertainty for investors, despite many governments setting ambitious decarbonization targets. A heavy reliance on fossil fuel exports means that many African nations will need to walk a fine line between economic stability and the transition to clean energy.

Despite its dependency on fossil fuels, Africa’s evolving energy profile — that includes hydrogen and critical minerals — has the potential to play an essential role in shaping global climate outcomes.

Growing Green Hydrogen

The 2026 Outlook reports that, by 2035, the continent could produce over 9 million tonnes of low-carbon hydrogen annually. Achieving this volume could be key to the nation’s decarbonization efforts. This is thanks to Africa’s vast solar and wind resources, extensive land availability, and proximity to major export markets. In fact, our report sees the continent becoming an exporter of hydrogen, either by transporting it as liquid via pipeline from Northern Africa to Europe or by using ammonia as a carrier to other international markets.

Currently, major green hydrogen projects in Africa are concentrated in Namibia, South Africa, Mauritania, Egypt, and Morocco. In 2022, these four nations joined two others — Egypt and Kenya — in launching the African Green Hydrogen Alliance (AGHA) that promotes Africa’s leadership in green hydrogen development. Now up to 11 members, the AGHA anticipates that green hydrogen exports from the continent will hit 40 megatons by 2050.

Namibia is a leader in the development of green hydrogen, particularly for export. The USD10billion Hyphen green hydrogen project, being developed by Namibian company Hyphen Hydrogen Energy — a joint venture between German energy company Enertrag and Nicholas Holdings — expects to produce more than 300,000 tons of green hydrogen annually, aimed at export to Europe.

Another Namibian-German partnership is the HyIron Oshivela green ironworks, which uses a 12 MW electrolyzer, powered by a roughly 25 MW solar array and large battery system, to generate green hydrogen. The hydrogen is then used to remove the oxygen from iron ore to create direct-reduced iron (DRI), a key feedstock for low-carbon steelmaking.

Meanwhile, construction is underway on the Daures Green Hydrogen Village, Africa’s first fully integrated green hydrogen and fertilizer production facility, which will combine renewable energy with sustainable agriculture.

Neighboring South Africa has established a national “Hydrogen Valley,” home to several large-scale projects that are successful largely thanks to public and private investment. The Coega Green Ammonia Project is a USD5.7 billion plant by Hive Hydrogen and Linde, projected to produce up to 1.2 million tons of green ammonia per year. The Prieska Power Reserve Project, located in the Northern Cape, is expected to begin producing green hydrogen and ammonia from solar and wind energy starting in the coming year. In August 2023, Sasol started operations at Sasolburg Green Hydrogen Pilot. This pilot program is capable of producing up to 5 tons of green hydrogen per day. And a consortium known as the HySHiFT Project is looking to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using green hydrogen in existing facilities.

In the north, Mauritania is pursuing large-scale “megaprojects” to capitalize on its extensive wind and solar potential. Project Nour (Aman) is one of Africa’s largest green hydrogen projects. Developer CWP Global hopes to produce 1.7 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually. The Mauritanian government has also entered into a separate $34 billion agreement with Conjuncta to develop a 10GW green hydrogen facility.

Further north, Morocco stands out as one of the first African nations to develop a national green hydrogen strategy. It is now positioning itself for export to Europe by allocating substantial land near ports and investing in shared infrastructure to facilitate production and export. Projects are underway in collaboration with entities like TotalEnergies and the European Investment Bank.

Egypt is also actively working to become a regional hub for hydrogen and its derivatives, with a strong focus on the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCEZ). The SCEZ is already having an impact: The Ain Sokhna Plant, located within the zone, is the first operational green hydrogen production plant in Africa. The Egyptian government has also signed numerous international agreements and secured over USD17.4 billion in investment commitments for several major green hydrogen projects.

Critical Diversification

In addition to its vast green hydrogen potential, Africa is also home to some of the world’s richest deposits of critical minerals such as cobalt, copper, gold, lithium, and platinum group metals (PGMs). As the 2026 Outlook forecasts, this bounty positions the continent as a pivotal player in the global supply chain during energy transition.

We expect demand for critical minerals to quintuple by 2035. This means that mineral-rich African nations stand to gain a significant strategic foothold in the industry, with opportunities all along the value chain from extraction to processing to refining — as long as they can pull in sustained investment in infrastructure, governance, and skills development.

Continued investment is the essential ingredient for the success of this sector. And the good news we’re reporting is that governments in other regions (particularly the United States and China) are clamoring to secure bilateral agreements with African countries to secure mineral access, promote joint ventures, and integrate mineral value chains.

Over the past year, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has led the world in cobalt production and ranked second in copper production. As we reported, the DRC was home to seven of the top 10 cobalt-producing mines in 2024. But in February 2025, the government imposed an export ban to curb oversupply and stabilize falling prices. While the ban was lifted in October, it was replaced with a strict quota system to govern mined output and exports until 2027 at the earliest.

The DRC also joins Zimbabwe, Mali, Ghana, and Namibia in leading lithium production. This group of nations produced 124,230 metric tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent (LCE) in 2024, and output is expected to grow over 150% by 2030. As the 2026 Outlook notes, Africa’s lithium mines are cost-competitive — making them an ideal investment target. So far, several projects have been developed quickly and at relatively low capital costs, particularly in Mali and Zimbabwe.

As for Zimbabwe, its strategic importance in the lithium supply chain continues to grow: In 2024, it was home to two of the world’s top 10 lithium-producing mines, collectively accounting for 7.42% of global lithium output. Zimbabwe also leads beneficiation efforts, having banned lithium ore exports and introduced a 2% royalty on lithium sales, while advancing a USD450 million refinery at the Mapinga industrial park.

Unlocking Our Mineral Potential

Based on our research, the 2026 Outlook outlines several strategies that we believe will help unlock Africa’s downstream potential in a rapidly evolving global minerals landscape.

For one, stable and transparent regulatory frameworks are a must. Securing long-term, consistent investment in refining and processing infrastructure requires predictable legal and fiscal environments. Governments must make regulatory clarity a priority, streamlining permitting processes and ensuring consistent enforcement to attract both domestic and foreign capital.

Promoting regional cooperation and sharing clean-energy infrastructure is another strategy. Governments and regional blocs should focus on investment in shared industrial infrastructure, such as roads, rail, and renewable energy corridors, to support clusters of processing facilities. Regional cooperation — standardizing export policies, environmental standards, and investment incentives across borders — is essential to overcome the fragmented nature of African markets and the landlocked geography of many resource-rich countries.

We also need to ramp up our efforts to build local technical capacity and enable technology transfer. Africa’s refining ambitions are hampered by the scarcity of skilled labor and the limited access to advanced processing technologies. Governments should provide incentives for local hiring, training, and R&D, encouraging partnerships with universities, technical institutes, and international development agencies to accelerate workforce development and knowledge transfer.

At the same time, we must avoid the human rights violations that have plagued other extractive industries in Africa. Our regulations must prioritize human dignity and workplace safety, with directives in place that criminalize child labor, safeguard indigenous people, protect the local physical environment, and promote healthy living and working conditions.

African leaders need to embrace this moment as an opportunity to move up the value chain into processing and refining. The continent can and will unlock significant economic value to help raise nations out of energy poverty – only if governments can foster sustained investment in infrastructure, governance, and skills development.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the latest USDA report underscores the pressing need to eliminate regulatory obstacles that are suppressing demand and limiting market opportunities for corn and ethanol alike.
Lawmakers should pass the Ethanol for America Act, which would simplify regulatory requirements related to E15 pump labeling and equipment compatibility.
The administration should also finalize the robust Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements it proposed last year, restrict small refinery exemptions (SREs), and reallocate any exempted volumes.
“We’re calling on policymakers to act swiftly to remove barriers to expanded ethanol use and open new markets for U.S. farmers.”","The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed today that farmers harvested a record-large corn crop in 2025, estimated at more than 17 billion bushels. At the same time, corn stockpiles are expected to climb to their highest level in eight years, while prices are projected to fall to lows not seen in six years. The Renewable Fuels Association said the latest USDA report underscores the pressing need to eliminate regulatory obstacles that are suppressing demand and limiting market opportunities for corn and ethanol alike.

“Today’s surprise USDA report serves as a sobering wake-up call about the state of farm economy and underscores the need for lawmakers to take immediate action to expand markets for America's corn growers,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The fastest and easiest way to shore up the growing supply-demand imbalance in the corn market is to permanently remove the summertime barrier on E15 sales and eliminate obsolete fuel retail infrastructure rules. These decades-old regulatory barriers are literally choking off demand and shortchanging America’s farmers.”

Cooper added that expanding access to higher ethanol blends represents the most effective path to creating long-term stability in the corn market. “Allowing E15 to be sold year-round nationwide could, over time, create new demand for more than 2 billion bushels of corn and sorghum,” he said. “Unlocking that opportunity now would deliver much-needed economic relief to farming communities across the Heartland, while also saving consumers an estimated 10 to 30 cents per gallon at the pump.”

According to RFA, several policy and regulatory changes are necessary to help prevent a broader economic downturn in the agricultural sector:

Congress should adopt legislation permitting year-round, nationwide sales of E15 without relying on temporary emergency waivers.

Lawmakers should pass the Ethanol for America Act, which would simplify regulatory requirements related to E15 pump labeling and equipment compatibility.

Congress and the administration should repeal antiquated “denaturant” rules that require ethanol producers to add toxic substances to their clean, renewable fuel—rules that complicate the production of sustainable aviation fuel and ultimately reduce corn demand by displacing ethanol with low-quality hydrocarbon additives.

The administration should also finalize the robust Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volume requirements it proposed last year, restrict small refinery exemptions (SREs), and reallocate any exempted volumes. While EPA’s proposed RFS volumes for 2026 and 2027 would help strengthen demand for farmers, those benefits depend on ensuring that exemptions do not erode the program’s integrity. The last time corn supplies were this large and prices this low—during the 2018–19 period—widespread SRE approvals significantly undermined demand for ethanol, biodiesel, corn, and soybeans.

“By taking these straightforward actions, Congress and the administration can reinforce the strength of American agriculture and help avert a looming crisis in farm country,” Cooper said. “We’re calling on policymakers to act swiftly to remove barriers to expanded ethanol use and open new markets for U.S. farmers.”",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/1799/1000/Corn+harvest+NCGA.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 14:56:41.013552

Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN’s aviation body.
“Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe.
IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.","Bill Gates said that aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, warning that it will require urgent innovation and stronger government policies to drive down emissions.

“The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40%,” Gates wrote in his annual note for 2026. “But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation.”

Aviation is especially hard to decarbonize due to long aircraft lifespans and the high cost of sustainable aviation fuel, which is three to five times that of jet fuel. And SAF still makes up just 0.7% of global supply.

Gates warned that unchecked climate change will cause suffering on par with poverty and disease, especially for the world’s poorest, and stressed the need to adapt to its impacts alongside cutting emissions.

“Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need,” he said.

Climate Change Top 5 Business Risk to Air Transport

Gates’ warning comes as aviation faces growing pressure, with SAF projects collapsing and airlines scaling back near-term climate goals amid European greenwashing crackdowns.

A new International Air Transport Association report lists climate change at the top of the list of risks to the industry that have both a high negative impact and a high likelihood of happening. IATA says it is major threat to airline profit margins this year from both disruptions caused by extreme weather and government regulations.

Aviation faces a patchwork of climate taxes and policies around the world. Because aviation is global, emissions policy has traditionally been coordinated by ICAO, the UN’s aviation body.

“In global civil aviation we can see an increase in national and regional policy initiatives that depart from ICAO’s 80 years of global harmonization,” IATA said. “Different frameworks now compete to determine how to address CO₂ emissions from air transport.

IATA said such policies:

Do little to cut emissions but make air travel more expensive

Undermine global climate coordination, slowing progress

Meanwhile, IATA said, climate change continues to impact businesses and livelihoods.

“Climate change is and will continue to disrupt lives, livelihoods, and productivity around the globe. Extreme weather, commodity price swings, supply chain stresses, can affect agriculture, infrastructure, global trade, and investment flows.”

It said unstable environments and economies can slow progress and harm the growth of aviation. The report painted a broader picture of climate disruption, warning that extreme weather, price volatility, and supply chain stress could affect aircraft production and aviation growth.

Migration is a Growing Concern

IATA also warned that climate-related migration could disrupt aviation and global systems.

Various reports link extreme weather and climate shifts to gradually destabilizing economies and societies.

Take for instance sea-level rise: By 2100, up to 410 million people may be living in areas less than 2 meters above sea level and at risk from sea level rises.

IATA echoed these concerns in its warnings about climate change.

“The world has turned more hostile toward immigration,” the report stated. “The total number of displaced persons reached 123.2 million in 2024 — nearly double the figure a decade ago. Both welcoming and rejecting migrants will strain borders and support systems.”

Airports Council International World has appointed Jost Lammers, Chief Executive Officer of Munich Airport (MUC), as Chair of the ACI World Governing Board for the 2026 to 2027 term, succeeding Candace McGraw, retired CEO of Cincinnati Northern Kentucky International Airport. McGraw concludes her tenure as ACI World’s first woman Chair, during which she guided the organisation through a period of strong global advocacy and strategic progress.

The ACI World Governing Board comprises 28 airport chief executives nominated by ACI’s five regions and provides strategic direction on airport policy, operational priorities, sustainability and innovation on behalf of airports worldwide.

Lammers brings more than 25 years of global aviation and airport leadership experience to the role. He has been a member of the ACI World Governing Board since 2019, served as Vice Chair from 2024 to 2025, and previously sat on the Board of ACI EUROPE from 2017 to 2023. Elected President of ACI EUROPE in 2019, he led the region through the COVID-19 crisis, strengthening cooperation among European airports and supporting sector recovery.

Since January 2020, Lammers has served as CEO of Munich Airport, one of Europe’s leading international hubs recognised for service quality, innovation and sustainable airport development. Before joining Munich Airport, he was CEO of Budapest Liszt Ferenc Airport from 2008, where he oversaw major modernisation and growth programmes.

Lammers also served for two years as President of the German Aviation Association, representing airlines, airports, air traffic control, ground handling service providers and retail companies. He began his aviation career in 1998 at HOCHTIEF AirPort GmbH, working on projects in Düsseldorf and Athens, including the commissioning and opening of Athens International Airport. He studied business administration and economics in Bayreuth, Witten Herdecke and San Diego.

ACI World Director General Justin Erbacci said: “We are proud to welcome Jost Lammers as Chair of the ACI World Governing Board. His global experience, proven leadership, and deep understanding of airport operations and policy come at a pivotal moment for our industry. As airports accelerate innovation, strengthen operational resilience, and advance sustainability, Jost’s ability to build consensus and drive strategic progress will be instrumental.

“I would also like to extend our sincere appreciation to Candace McGraw for her exceptional leadership as ACI World’s first woman Chair. Her commitment to sustainability, advocacy, and workforce transformation has helped position airports for long-term success.”

Munich Airport CEO Jost Lammers said: “It is an honour for me to serve as the Chair of the ACI World Governing Board. My dedication is focused on strengthening ACI’s leadership role on the global stage. By uniting strong advocacy, effective governance, and collaboration with global partners, we can ensure airports evolve as innovative, sustainable, and people focused organisations, enhancing their role as vital hubs of mobility and economic growth.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/0047_Jost_Lammers-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 12:57:17.783528

Multimedia Reporter

Leaders from the U.S. House and Senate Agriculture Committees remain committed to finishing work on the farm bill and addressing agricultural labor, among other issues, this session of Congress.

House Agriculture Committee Chairman Glenn “GT” Thompson (R-PA) and Ranking Member Angie Craig (D-MN), along with Senate Ag Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Ranking Member Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), addressed farmers and ranchers from across the nation at the American Farm Bureau Federation’s (AFBF) Annual Convention Sunday in Anaheim, Calif.

“We were able to, in the Big Bill (HR 1), create a situation where we were able to help with the risk management tools that we all desperately needed to update and also several other things that are so important to agriculture to the tune of about $68 billion,” Boozman said. “We’ve gotten a majority of the farm bill passed. Now, we need to come back and finish that up. I’d like to work and get that done very shortly.”

Boozman said he’d like to address loan limits when it comes to farm bill 2.0, or the “Skinny Farm Bill.”

“These things don’t cost a lot of money. We got most of the cost drivers done, but now we’ve got to get things that help rural America—quality of life issues—and again, loan limits, where they work now with the inflationary period that we’ve had,” he said.

Klobuchar also wants loan limits addressed in the farm bill. She and Sen. John Hoeven have a bill Klobuchar said could be included in some sort of package that calls for improvements.

Thompson said although much of the farm bill was addressed through HR 1, or the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, there’s more work that needs to be done.

“We were able to make a significant investment, historic investment in agriculture, with what we did on trade and animal health and bringing down the cost of crop insurance and safety net, but there’s more left to be done,” Thompson said. “That 20% of investment that we need to do that’s left, it’s about 80% of the policies, and it’s so important.”

As for funding increased loan levels in farm bill 2.0, Thompson seemed confident they could find the funding to do so.

“I get my exercise turning rocks over in Washington within the agriculture space, and I’m pretty confident that we’re going to be able to identify that,” Thompson said. “That’ll be a part of what we release here.”

The chairman said they plan to get a farm bill 2.0 text out in plenty of time before the markup so members can look at it and really digest it.

“Pay-fors will be a part of that,” Thompson said. “Now, how much we find, how much we have, we’ll determine how far we can go with some of the things that I would like to do.”

Craig told the crowd she’d like to make sure the farm credit and rural development areas of the farm bill are taken care of, as well.

“I do hope that we can come to a bipartisan consensus on those two things,” Craig said.

In addition to finishing up the farm bill, Boozman said his priorities include holding hearings on what can be done to make agriculture more economically sustainable.

“Congress is stepping in and being helpful. I think they’re going to continue to do that, but we can’t depend on it,” Boozman said. “We’ve got to get ourselves in a situation where agriculture is sustainable. I’d like to have a couple hearings, bringing in the experts, bringing in you, the people that work at this all day, every day, telling us what you need, telling us the tools you need in the toolbox, whether it’s trade, figuring out a way to better use the products that we have here in our country, increasing domestic demand, value added products, the list goes on and on.”

Other priorities mentioned were year-round E-15 and biofuels and ag labor.

“Some reform on ag labor—I think we all know how hard this has been hitting our farmers. We’ve had a number of bipartisan ag immigration bills. I know that’s not an easy word to say right now in our country, but we know there are a lot of ways we could try to make sure that we have a stable workforce when it comes to agriculture, as well as other areas,” Klobuchar said. “That’s something, it feels far away, but I think it’s such a need right now. There’s possibility we could move on that.”

Klobuchar said reversing tariffs “would also be about the best thing we could do.”

“Then, we’re going to have to figure out how we adjust for that and make some of these payments and the like. I think that would be good long term. If that doesn’t happen, I hope the administration will back down on some of them for the sake of input costs and for the sake of the markets overseas and the like, or we can pass something in Congress,” she said.

Increasing markets for agricultural goods was also named a priority.

“We need more export markets in this country. We need more domestic markets in this nation,” Craig said. “I’m going to be looking for year-round E15, higher blends of ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.”

The ranking member also named the cost of healthcare as one of her priorities.

“We have to be thinking about that. It’s not in our jurisdiction, but we haven’t brought up the cost of healthcare in this country. And I just want to say with 27% of farmers and ranchers across this country on some sort of Affordable Care Act plan today, the cost of healthcare is out of control, and we’ve got to figure out how we deal with it in this country,” Craig said.

Progress rarely follows a straight line, yet the voluntary carbon market (VCM) appears to be the exception heading into 2026. External pressures this past year ranged from the explosion in energy demand as the AI race reached full steam, to shifts in the policy and economic landscapes, creating new headwinds for broadscale decarbonisation efforts. Despite this, the VCM’s trajectory remained resolute, setting the stage for a robust and growing year ahead.

The VCM entered 2025 with momentum and closed out the year having reshaped expectations for what’s possible in engineered carbon removal. The past twelve months saw a surge in large-scale deals, broader participation from corporate buyers, and the emergence of new removal pathways, from biochar to biomass sequestration. Interest in bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) continued to solidify, and for the first time, the market demonstrated the diversity of durable carbon removal solutions needed to credibly deliver net zero commitments at scale.

This rising confidence was reinforced at COP30, where carbon trading took centre stage. Negotiators made meaningful progress toward establishing the global structures required for transparent, interoperable carbon markets. Integrity and permanence of carbon removals were a central theme. The global conversation has clearly shifted from whether carbon markets should play a role in climate action to how they must evolve to ensure high-quality, durable climate impact.

Against this backdrop, 2026 is poised to be a year of pragmatism with the VCM taking on greater significance in decarbonisation pathways. Companies facing intensifying customer expectations, supply-chain pressures, and near-term climate targets are expanding their decarbonisation toolkits. Carbon credits, especially engineered removals, are no longer viewed as supplemental. They are becoming strategic assets that offer optionality, resilience, and credibility in an increasingly complex operating environment.

The End of Puritanism in Climate Solutions

For much of the last decade, many companies bet heavily on a narrow set of decarbonisation levers: electrification, renewable procurement, and incremental efficiency gains. These remain essential investments, but economic and political shifts have exposed their limitations.

Permitting delays, supply-chain constraints, fluctuating power markets, and rising capital costs are complicating corporate decarbonisation timelines. In parallel, key sectors – particularly those with hard-to-abate processes – are discovering that technology pathways alone struggle to keep pace with near-term climate commitments.

The result: the era of “solutions puritanism” is fading. Companies are embracing hybrid-realistic strategies, where carbon credits complement on-site and supply-chain actions rather than replace them. This shift is not ideological, it is pragmatic. It reflects the recognition that avoidance-only pathways cannot reliably deliver emissions reductions at the speed and scale required. It equally doesn’t deter from the ambition to ultimately decarbonise where possible.

The Rise of the Portfolio Approach to Unlock Flexibility and Value

The same political and economic shifts driving organisations away from puritan solutions also incentivise them to diversify their holdings to incorporate flexibility and mitigate risk. Viewed as a portfolio of solutions, biomass, biochar, biomass with carbon removal and storage, BECCS, and other biogenic technologies can work as an effective hedge for sophisticated purchasers and provide a simple entry point for new buyers.

As the VCM matures, the diversity of credit types spanning engineered removals, nature-based solutions, biomass pathways, and more gives buyers unprecedented flexibility. In 2026, the most sophisticated corporate climate strategies will treat carbon credits as a portfolio, not a singular asset.

A portfolio-based approach allows companies to balance cost and permanence, mitigate supply and policy risks, and support long-term climate planning. Durable removals help meet future compliance and disclosure expectations, while scalable solutions enable near-term progress. As shown in the figure above, BECCS, enhanced rock weathering, mineralisation, biomass geological sequestration, and alkalinity enhancement all offer long-term, lower cost options for 2026 and beyond.

From Hard to Abate to Time to Abate

Some sectors illustrate the necessity of a diversified decarbonisation strategy more clearly than others. Steel and aviation, for example, cannot decarbonise solely through electrification or renewables in the near term. These industries face structural realities that make rapid transformation difficult – and in some cases, physically impossible – with existing technology.

Aviation is confronting overwhelming demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), paired with a staggering global supply gap. Similarly, green steel technologies are not yet commercially scalable. While innovation continues, the timelines do not align neatly with corporate emissions reductions schedules.

In the interim, alternative fuels, such as biomass-derived feedstocks for SAF or green hydrogen, offer meaningful reductions – but these solutions alone will not bring emissions down to the levels required for science-aligned pathways.

This is where carbon credits are expected to increasingly play a catalytic role. By pairing operational emissions improvements with high-quality removals or avoidance credits, hard-to-abate industries can chart credible decarbonisation trajectories. The combination of alternative fuels and carbon credits enables flexibility, protects competitiveness, and demonstrates good-faith progress toward net-zero commitments.

2026: The Year for Pragmatism

As 2026 begins, companies should take a step back and reevaluate their sustainability roadmaps with an eye toward realism and resilience. The question is not whether to use high-integrity carbon credits, but how to integrate them strategically into broader climate plans.

Now is the time for organisations to educate themselves on the diverse options available, understand their risk and cost tolerance, and design portfolios that maximize impact while maintaining flexibility. A diversified carbon credit strategy does more than hedge against uncertainty – it positions companies to lead confidently in a market where expectations for climate integrity are rising.

The likelihood of continued political and economic risk points to strengthening these trends. The VCM has matured. The opportunities are expanding. And for companies that are serious about net zero, diversification isn’t just prudent—it is essential.

Flying, driving; the activities we rely on every day all come at a carbon cost. In some sectors, the shift to renewables is comparatively simple. But aviation and petrochemicals are trickier. They need high-density fuels and complex molecules; things an EV battery can’t provide.

Enter OXCCU. The University of Oxford spin-out is tackling “the urgent need to find alternatives that maintain our standard of living without relying on fossil fuels”, by using world-leading technology to make waste carbon usable.

In development since 2010, the researchers filed their first patent in 2020, after the team developed a breakthrough single-step process that combines captured CO₂ with green hydrogen to create jet-fuel-range hydrocarbons.

As the founders explain, “most sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) approaches typically rely on land-based resources such as vegetable oil. But these rely on crops and are limited due to land use.” Another issue? Many produce “significant amounts of alcohols as a byproduct.”

Most sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) approaches typically rely on land-based resources such as vegetable oil. But these rely on crops and are limited due to land use.

In comparison, OXCCU’s process looks considerably more elegant. Its patented iron catalyst converts CO₂ and CO directly into liquid hydrocarbons in a single reaction, avoiding intermediate steps and minimising byproducts. This translates into lower capital costs, lower operating costs, and more competitive prices for SAF.

Oh, and of course, this method also reduces lifecycle emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil fuels; a figure which marked it as the clear winner for our 2026 Sustainability Award.

Proof of concept delivered, OXCCU formed as a fully-fledged company in 2021. Scaling the science has been a challenge, as with any climate tech. The team has learned that progress depends not just on the lab, but on the right partnerships and policy engagement.

The business now counts airlines – including British Airways’ owner IAG and United Airlines – venture firms, and two global energy companies among its supporters.

Still, the real proof is in the plant. OXCCU’s OX1 demonstration facility at London Oxford Airport has already logged 1,000 hours producing liquid fuel, with high conversion rates and excellent selectivity for SAF. Following this success, the spin-out closed £20.75m in Series B funding at the end of last year, to further scale its sustainable fuels and technologies.

Futuristic tech typically has a long timeline. OXCCU aims to produce 10,000 tonnes of SAF per year before 2030 (for context, a Boeing 787 transatlantic flight uses around 50 tonnes) while exploring applications beyond aviation in chemicals and plastics.

The mission goes without saying: enable fuel-guzzling industries to continue doing so, without the climate impact. From lab breakthroughs to commercial demonstrations, OXCCU is proving that waste carbon doesn’t have to be a problem; it can also be the solution.

,,2026-01-12 14:11:21+00:00,MIT Technology Review,Mitigating emissions from air freight: Unlocking the potential of SAF with book and claim,MIT Technology Review Insights,,,,,https://www.technologyreview.com/2026/01/12/1128939/mitigating-emissions-from-air-freight-unlocking-the-potential-of-saf-with-book-and-claim/,"For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.
And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.” Bridging the gap with book and claim Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).
“Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.” “SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates.
By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden.
“The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that.","And though fleet modernization and operational improvements by freight operators have contributed to ongoing decarbonization efforts, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) looks set to be instrumental in helping the sector achieve its ambitions to reduce environmental footprint in the long-term.

When used neat, or pure and unblended, SAF can help reduce the life cycle of greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by as much as 80% relative to conventional fuel. It’s why the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates that SAF could account for as much as 65% of total reduction of emissions.

For Christoph Wolff, CEO of the Smart Freight Centre, “SAF is the main pathway” to decarbonization across both freight and the wider aviation ecosystem.

“The great thing about SAF is it’s chemically identical to Jet A fuel,” he says. “You can blend it [which means] you have a pathway to ramp it up. You can start small and you can scale it. By scaling it there is the promise or the hope that the price comes down.”

At at least twice the price of conventional jet fuel, cost is a significant barrier hindering broader adoption.

And it isn’t the only one standing between SAF and wider penetration.

Bridging the gap between a concentrated supply of SAF and global demand also remains a major hurdle.

Though the number of verified SAF outlets has increased from fewer than 20 locations in 2021 to 114 as of April 2025, according to sustainability solutions framework 4Air, that accounts for only 92 airports worldwide out of more than 40,000.

“SAF is central to the decarbonization of the aviation sector,” believes Raman Ojha, president of Shell Aviation. “Having said that, adoption and penetration of SAF hasn't really picked up massively. It's not due to lack of production capacity, but there are lots of things that are at play. And book and claim in that context helps to bridge that gap.”

Bridging the gap with book and claim

Book and claim is a chain of custody model, where the flow of administrative records is not necessarily connected to the physical product through the supply chain (source: ISO 22095:2020).

Book and claim potentially enables airlines and corporations to access the life cycle GHG emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel even when SAF is not physically available at their location; this model helps bridge the gap between that concentrated supply and global demand, until SAF’s availability improves.

“To be bold, without book and claim, no short-term science-based target will be achieved,” says Bettina Paschke, vice president of ESG accounting, reporting and controlling at DHL Express. “Book and claim is essential to achieving science-based targets.”

“SAF production facilities are not everywhere,” she reiterates. “They're very focused on one location, and if a customer wants to fulfil a mass balance obligation, SAF would need to be shipped around the world just to be at that airport for that customer. That would be very complicated, and very unrealistic.” It would also, counterintuitively, increase total emissions. By using book and claim instead, air freight operators can unlock the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel now, without waiting for supply to broaden. “It might no longer be needed when we have SAF product facilities at each airport in the future,” she points out. “But at the moment, that’s not the case.”

At DHL itself, the mechanism has become central to achieving its own three interconnected sustainability pillars, which focus on decarbonizing logistics supply chains, supporting customers toward their decarbonization goals, and ensuring credible emission claims can be shared along the value chain.

Demonstrating the importance of a credible and viable framework for book and claim systems is also what inspired the 2022 launch of Shell’s Avelia, one of the first blockchain-powered digital SAF book and claim solutions for aviation, which expanded in 2024 to encompass air freight in addition to business travel. Depending on the offering, Avelia offers freight forwarders the opportunity to share the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction benefits of SAF relative to conventional jet fuel across the value chain with shippers using their services.

“It’s also backed by a physical supply chain, which gives our customers — whether those be corporates or freight forwarders or even airlines — a peace of mind that the SAF has been injected at a certain airport, it’s been used and environmental attributes, with the help of blockchain, have been tracked to where they're getting retired,” says Ojha.

He adds: “The most important or critical part is the transparency that it's providing to our customers to be sure that they're not saying something which they can't confidently stand behind.”

Moving beyond early adoption

To scale up SAF via book and claim and help make it a more commercially viable lower-carbon solution, its adoption will need to be a coordinated “ecosystem play,” says Wolff. That includes early adopters, such as DHL, inspiring action from peers, solution providers such as Shell, working with various stakeholders to drive joint advocacy, and industry associations, like the Smart Freight Centre creating the required frameworks, educational resources, and industry alignment.

An active book and claim community made up of many forward-thinking advocates is already driving much of this work forward with a common goal to develop greater standardization and consensus, Wolff points out. “It helps to make sure all definitions on the system are compatible and they can talk to one another, provide educational support, and [also that] there’s a repository of transactions so that it can be documented in a way that people can see and think, ‘oh this is how we do it.’ There are some early adopters that are very experienced, but it needs a lot more people for it to get comfortable.”

In early 2024, discussions were held with a diverse group of expert book and claim stakeholders to develop and refine 11 key principles and best practices book and claim models. These represent an aligned set of principles informed by practical successes and challenges faced by practitioners working to decarbonize the heavy transport sector.

Adherence to such a framework is crucial given that book and claim is not yet accepted by the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol nor the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) as a recognized model for reducing greenhouse gas emissions — though there are hopes that might change.

“The industrialization of book and claim delivery systems is key to credibility and recognition,” says Wolff. “The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and the Science Based Targets Initiative are making steps in recognizing that. There’s a pathway that the Smart Freight Centre is very closely involved in the technical working groups for [looking]to build such a system where, in addition to physical inventory, you also pursue market-based inventories.”

Paschke urges companies not to sit back and wait for policy to change before taking action, though. “The solution is there,” she says. “There are companies like DHL that are making huge upfront investments, and every single contribution helps to scale the industry and give a strong signal to the eco-space.”

As pressure to accelerate decarbonization gains pace, it’s critical that air freight operators consider this now, agrees Ojha. “Don't wait for perfection in guidelines, regulations, or platforms — act now,” he says. “That’s very, very critical. Second, learn by doing and join hands with others. Don’t try to do everything independently or in-house.

“Third, make use of registries and platforms, such as Avelia, that can give credibility. Join them, utilize them, and leverage them so that you won’t have to establish auditability from scratch.

“And fourth, don’t look at scope book and claim as a means for acquiring a certificate for environmental attributes. Think in terms of your decarbonisation commitment and think of this as a tool for exposure management. Think in terms of the bigger picture.”

That bigger picture being a significant sector-wide push toward faster decarbonization — and turning the tide on emissions’ steep upward ascent.

For Outokumpu, the project would enable improved utilization of industrial side streams, creating new revenue opportunities while materially reducing climate impact.
Norsk e-Fuel will take the lead in developing the project, leveraging its experience in Power-to-Liquid technologies and its established network of industrial and financial partners.
He underscored that Outokumpu’s industrial platform, combined with Norsk e-Fuel’s project development expertise, creates a compelling basis for competitive eSAF production.","Outokumpu, a global front-runner in sustainable stainless steel, has entered into a strategic collaboration with Norsk e-Fuel, a Nordic specialist in Power-to-Liquid fuel projects, to explore the large-scale conversion of industrial carbon side streams into sustainable aviation fuel. The companies have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to jointly advance plans for a CO-to-SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) production facility adjacent to Outokumpu’s stainless steel operations in Koivuluoto, Tornio, Finland.

As part of the agreement, Norsk e-Fuel will initiate a comprehensive feasibility study in 2026 to assess the technical, economic, and environmental viability of the project. Subject to favorable outcomes, the company expects to make a final investment decision around 2028, with commercial production targeted to begin in 2032. The initiative reflects a long-term commitment by both partners to accelerate industrial decarbonization while strengthening Europe’s clean energy value chains.

Under the proposed arrangement, Outokumpu would supply carbon monoxide (CO) side streams generated during its ferrochrome production process. These streams would be utilized as a key feedstock to produce approximately 80,000 to 100,000 tons of eSAF annually. This output would support the European Union’s emerging eSAF blending mandates and directly contribute to the decarbonization of aviation, a sector widely recognized as difficult to abate due to its reliance on energy-dense liquid fuels.

Once operational, the eSAF facility is expected to deliver significant environmental and economic benefits. For Outokumpu, the project would enable improved utilization of industrial side streams, creating new revenue opportunities while materially reducing climate impact. The company estimates that the initiative could cut its direct CO2 emissions by around 200,000 tons per year—equivalent to roughly 20% of Outokumpu’s global Scope 1 emissions. Beyond company-specific gains, the project would also support the EU’s clean energy transition goals and enhance regional energy security by expanding domestic production of sustainable fuels.

Norsk e-Fuel will take the lead in developing the project, leveraging its experience in Power-to-Liquid technologies and its established network of industrial and financial partners. The company will be responsible for engineering, securing financing, and engaging future customers for the produced eSAF. The total investment is currently estimated at approximately EUR 1.2–1.5 billion. In addition to climate benefits, the project is expected to generate substantial socio-economic value, including the creation of around 250 new jobs in the local Tornio region.

Commenting on the collaboration, Martti Sassi, President of Business Area Ferrochrome at Outokumpu, emphasized that decarbonization lies at the heart of the company’s strategy. He highlighted that the Kemi–Tornio industrial ecosystem provides a strong foundation for circular economy solutions that reduce emissions while delivering financial value. According to Sassi, the partnership demonstrates how Outokumpu’s sustainability ambitions extend beyond low-emission stainless steel and ferrochrome production to innovative uses of industrial side streams.

Lars Bjørn Larsen, Chief Commercial Officer at Norsk e-Fuel, noted that the partnership unites complementary strengths and a shared ambition to advance the energy transition in Finland and across Europe. He underscored that Outokumpu’s industrial platform, combined with Norsk e-Fuel’s project development expertise, creates a compelling basis for competitive eSAF production.

Conventional jet fuels remain a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, low-carbon alternatives. SAF can be produced from a wide range of non-fossil feedstocks, including waste oils, biomass, municipal solid waste, and captured carbon dioxide, offering multiple technological pathways to achieve substantial lifecycle emission reductions.

Despite recent advances in conversion technologies, refinery integration, and certification frameworks, significant technical, economic, and regulatory barriers continue to limit widespread deployment. The qualification of new SAF pathways under the ASTM D4054 protocol remains a complex, multi-year process requiring extensive collaboration with engine and airframe manufacturers. This creates a critical bottleneck for commercialization. In parallel, high production costs, constrained feedstock availability, and fragmented policy landscapes highlight the need for research that enhances supply chain resilience, reduces costs, and ensures sustainability across the entire value chain.

The appointment underscores a renewed international effort to speed up the aviation sector’s transition toward lower emissions, drawing on leadership from one of the world’s busiest global aviation hubs. As concerns over aviation’s environmental footprint intensify, Sustainable Aviation Fuel is increasingly viewed as the most practical short-term option for reducing carbon output, with the potential to lower lifecycle emissions from flights by as much as 80%. Despite this promise, SAF currently accounts for less than one percent of the global jet fuel market.

SMI’s Pathfinder Initiative brings together influential stakeholders from across aviation, energy, finance, and policymaking to help drive large-scale change. The SAF-focused programme concentrates on stimulating investment and clear demand signals to boost production, promoting aligned international policies and incentives, supporting the development of essential infrastructure, and strengthening cooperation throughout the supply chain to address cost and production challenges.

Commenting on his new role, Griffiths said he was honoured to take on the position at a pivotal moment for the industry. He highlighted SAF as a critical tool for decarbonising air travel and reaffirmed his commitment to accelerating its supply and uptake. He also pointed to the work of the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a collaborative initiative led by Dubai Airports, which is focused on advancing decarbonisation, innovation, and long-term resilience across Dubai International Airport (DXB) and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC).

The automaker believes that relying only on battery electric vehicles or hybrids will not be sufficient to cut emissions or reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels. Instead, it advocates a mix of solutions including electric vehicles, hybrid and plug-in hybrid models, flex-fuel vehicles, and emerging options such as hydrogen-powered technologies.

As per the news report, speaking on the issue, Toyota Kirloskar Motor’s Country Head and Executive Vice-President, Vikram Gulati, said India’s wide-ranging conditions—from infrastructure readiness and energy availability to consumer acceptance—require a combination of technologies to meet national goals. He noted that such an approach would support energy independence, encourage local manufacturing, create jobs, strengthen the manufacturing sector’s contribution to the economy, and help curb pollution and carbon emissions.

Gulati pointed to government initiatives such as the ethanol blending programme and the national hydrogen mission as key efforts aimed at reducing fossil fuel usage and enhancing energy security. He added that alternative fuels like ethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), and hydrogen are particularly important for addressing local pollution challenges in different parts of the country.

Highlighting urban conditions, Gulati said hybrid vehicles are well suited for congested cities like Delhi, where average driving speeds are low. In stop-and-go traffic, the electric motor in a hybrid can operate efficiently, helping to reduce emissions. As a result, hybrids can complement electric vehicles in tackling air quality issues, rather than being seen as a competing technology.

Looking ahead, Gulati stressed that localisation will be central to India’s journey toward sustainable mobility. He said Toyota already has access to a full spectrum of clean technologies, including electric vehicles, strong hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and models running on alternative fuels. However, he noted that wider EV adoption will depend heavily on the expansion of charging infrastructure across the country.

Toyota, he said, is committed to introducing all clean technologies that can contribute meaningfully to sustainable mobility. The company aims to move away from petrol and diesel at the fastest possible pace, aligned with Toyota’s global environmental goals set in 2015, which include achieving carbon neutrality across vehicle life cycles.

At the same time, Gulati emphasised that customer preferences and local conditions must be considered when deploying green technologies. Regardless of the pathway chosen, he said, the common challenge remains reducing fossil fuel consumption and cutting carbon emissions.

On the growth of electric vehicles, Gulati highlighted the need to bring down manufacturing costs. He cautioned that the industry cannot rely indefinitely on subsidies or favourable tax regimes, stressing that long-term viability will come from achieving scale. According to him, that scale can only be reached by steadily expanding the range and availability of electrified vehicles in the market.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/WhatsApp-Image-2025-07-07-at-14.37.43_9f7649fb-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-12 08:56:51.001856

The increasing global wealth and high net-worth individuals (HNWIs) are estimated to generate considerable demand for business jets. Additionally, the growth of access models, with charter fleets and fractional ownership making it easy for individuals to use business jets without fully owning it, is also estimated to facilitate growth and break the entry barrier for new users to enter the market.

Due to the post-pandemic uptick in global travel, tourism and expansion of businesses overseas, there has been a surge in demand for efficient long-range large business jets. This has led to OEMs working on new large jet models to meet the market demand trend. OEMs are also focusing their efforts on expanding the service availability due to the international nature of their customers and to provide a robust ecosystem of services across the world.

The market technologies revolve mainly around sustainable aviation, smartification of cabin and cockpit, Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) deployment to improve maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) processes. These technological innovations will drive the spending in the market as they make the business jets more efficient to own and operate.

Jefferies attributes the anticipated outperformance to strength in the company’s Feed (Proteins) segment and Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) operations.
For the first quarter of 2026, Jefferies forecasts core EBITDA of $204 million, below the consensus estimate of $232 million.
Additionally, Darling Ingredients announced the sale of $50 million in production tax credits from its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, adding to previous sales and bringing the total to $235 million for 2025.
Furthermore, Darling had previously announced the sale of $60 million in production tax credits, also under its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture.","Investing.com - Jefferies raised its price target on to $50.00 from $44.00 on Monday, while maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. This target aligns with InvestingPro analysis, which indicates the stock is currently undervalued. Trading at $39.08, DAR has shown strong momentum with a 7.66% return over the past year and sits near its 52-week high of $42.15.

The research firm expects Darling to report fourth-quarter EBITDA of $284 million, excluding LCM adjustments, which would represent a 6% increase compared to consensus estimates. Jefferies attributes the anticipated outperformance to strength in the company’s Feed (Proteins) segment and Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) operations. For perspective, Darling’s last twelve months EBITDA stands at $863.95 million, with analysts maintaining a bullish consensus recommendation of 1.38.

For the first quarter of 2026, Jefferies forecasts core EBITDA of $204 million, below the consensus estimate of $232 million. The firm cites lag in feedstock pricing as a potential headwind for the Feed segment, unless market conditions reverse in January.

Jefferies notes that lower feedstock pricing should benefit the Diamond Green Diesel segment in the first quarter, though pressure could emerge from lower 45Z credits for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The firm also highlights that market attention remains focused on the final Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO), which could potentially be released by the end of the first quarter.

In other recent news, Darling Ingredients Inc. reported mixed results for its Q3 2025 earnings. The company posted earnings per share of $0.12, which was below the projected $0.25, marking a 52% negative surprise. However, revenue surpassed expectations, reaching $1.56 billion compared to the anticipated $1.51 billion, a 3.31% positive surprise. Additionally, Darling Ingredients announced the sale of $50 million in production tax credits from its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, adding to previous sales and bringing the total to $235 million for 2025.

In another development, Darling Ingredients plans to form a joint venture with Belgium’s Tessenderlo Group to merge their collagen and gelatin businesses. Darling will hold an 85% majority stake in this venture, which requires no initial cash investment and is expected to close in 2026, pending regulatory approvals. Furthermore, Darling had previously announced the sale of $60 million in production tax credits, also under its Diamond Green Diesel joint venture. Meanwhile, the company faced a potential regulatory challenge as the Trump administration considered delaying proposed cuts to biofuel import incentives, which could impact the value of renewable fuel credits.

Lines, Ltd. (MOL) and ITOCHU Corporation have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to advance decarbonization in the transportation sector through the use of Environmental Attribute Certificates (EACs).

Under this MOU, MOL and ITOCHU will collaborate on marketing, public relations, sales, and other initiatives to promote the adoption of EACs. This partnership aims to help companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions. By bridging the shipping and aviation industries, this initiative establishes a new model for decarbonization in Japan.

As part of the collaboration, both companies, acting as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to offset their respective Scope 3 emissions:

Transaction summary:

MOL purchased “air transport” EACs from ITOCHU to reduce emissions associated with employee air travel (Scope 3, Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport” EACs from MOL to reduce emissions from its use of sea freight (Scope 3, Category 4).

These transactions were executed through 123Carbon’s platform in the Netherlands, which acts to ensure the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs under a robust audit framework.

Scope 3 emissions represent indirect emissions that occur in a company’s value chain, both upstream and downstream, excluding the emissions from the company’s own operations (which are Scope 1 and 2).

Reducing Scope 3 emissions, often the largest share of corporate emissions, is a major challenge due to complex supply chains. MOL will leverage its expertise in low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will apply its experience with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). To remind, in February 2025 MOL has launched the BLUE ACTION NET-ZERO ALLIANCE program to help reduce Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions for shippers and Non Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCCs) using ocean transport.

Its aim is to convert waste carbon into SAF by combining the biogenic carbon and (green, if required) hydrogen in waste biomass or biogas and/or carbon dioxide from sustainable sources.
The award comes after a successful year of funding for the company.
The award is a positive sign for a sector that has seen bottlenecks due to the slow pace of technology roll-out.","UK-based climate tech company OXCCU has won the Startups 100 Sustainability Award for its efforts to develop the world’s “lowest cost and lowest emission” pathways to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The company and its technology stems from over a decade of research at the University of Oxford. Its aim is to convert waste carbon into SAF by combining the biogenic carbon and (green, if required) hydrogen in waste biomass or biogas and/or carbon dioxide from sustainable sources.

What makes the company different is its use of a patented iron-based catalyst. This eliminates the need for reverse water gas shift or e-methanol steps.

This reduces capital and operating costs and reduces the carbon intensity of the fuel.

The award comes after a successful year of funding for the company. In July 2025, it received £2.81m under the UK government’s Advanced Fuels Fund scheme.

In October, the company raised £20.75m in a round of funding designed to accelerate commercialisation efforts, expand operations, and advance the next phase of technology scale-up.

OXCCU also received a £1.8m grant through the ATI Non-CO2 Programme to investigate the non-CO2 effects of its synthetic crude ‘Oxfuel’.

“This ATI Programme funding not only enables us to advance our technology but also supports our ambition to lead the industry in producing cleaner aviation fuels with a reduced contribution to global warming,” said Andrew Symes, CEO of OXCCU.

The next phase will build on the launch of the company’s OX1 demonstration plant at London Oxford Airport in 2024. Its second demo plant, OX2, is underway and should be fully operational in 2026.

The award is a positive sign for a sector that has seen bottlenecks due to the slow pace of technology roll-out. A 2025 report from the International Air Transport Association revealed that airlines will need 500 million tonnes of SAF to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, at the release of the report. “However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now.”","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/gwml/exploringtheuseofgassensorsinaviation_493129.jpg",N,,2026-01-12 06:57:21.546167

The super-midsize jet remains a staple of the jetset lifestyle. Large enough to accommodate a sizable party in an intimate, bespoke setting, and allowing plenty of space for retreats and relaxation, the super-mid embodies the luxury demanded by high-performance VIP travelers worldwide. Crucially, these aircraft are fast, offering impressive range. Now, the super-mid could gain a key advantage that has long eluded the business jet world: fuel efficiency.

American startup Otto Aerospace grabbed attention at the 2025 Paris Air Show with its super-mid private jet concept, the Phantom 3500. This bold entry into the super-mid market features a remarkably efficient and lightweight design that leverages the advantages of a phenomenon called laminar flow. According to Otto Aerospace, laminar flow refers to a state where air moves smoothly over a jet’s surface, allowing the aircraft to achieve exceptional aerodynamic efficiency. By maintaining this smooth airflow throughout its body, the Phantom 3500 significantly reduces drag, enabling it to fly with less energy and enhancing its overall performance in the skies.

Scott Drennan, President and Chief Operating Officer of Otto Aerospace, told Jetset that the Phantom will consume 61 percent less fuel with significantly lower carbon emissions (as much as 90 percent less with sustainable aviation fuel) without sacrificing range or cabin space. This truly sustainable aircraft will weigh approximately 19,000 pounds—nearly half the weight of some super-mids—and carry only 7,500 pounds of fuel.

The Phantom presents an unconventional visual profile. The cockpit contains the only windows with the rest removed to promote better aerodynamics. Its fuselage showcases a teardrop design, while renderings indicate a sleek gray finish highlighted front to back by a black stripe. The long, narrow wings lend the aircraft a futuristic look, evoking an image of an orca killer whale that has sprouted wings and taken to the skies.

Its range of 4,000 miles positions well with other super-mids like the Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 with its 3,900-mile range. Moreover, the Phantom will operate at a maximum altitude of 51,000 feet, much higher than its competitors and optimal for laminar flow, according to Drennan. Powered by a pair of Williams International FJ44s jet engines, the Phantom will cut through the high atmosphere and achieve a maximum speed of over .8 Mach, or around six hundred miles per hour.

While other business jets use larger engines, the smaller Williams FJ44s engines paired with Phantom’s ability to channel laminar flow potential makes Otto’s design a true game changer. The Phantom’s takeoff weight of 19,000 pounds makes it nimbler than other super-mids, which weigh in at around 35-40,000 pounds. Lower weight translates into reduced fuel consumption, especially when combined with smaller engines and fewer components requiring maintenance and repair, Drennan explained. “This results in a more efficient aircraft overall. It turns the economics in your favor.”

Virtual Views

Unlike traditional aircraft designs that rely on cabin windows, the passengers’ view will be virtual. Small exterior cameras will capture what’s happening outside the aircraft and display it on high-definition screens in the cabin. This technology, called Super Natural Vision, will provide a “cinematic view of the world,” Drennan said.

Super Natural Vision will also double as an infotainment system. Passengers can switch between business activities such as Zoom and Outlook as well as stay up to date on the latest streamable movies and television shows. Otto is considering a touch screen interface inside the cabin to control the system. Passengers will control the system remotely with an app that will run on an operating system Otto is developing.

Inside, the Phantom offers sizable living space that accommodates up to nine passengers, with a cabin height of 6 feet 5 inches, a width of 7 feet 6 inches, and a length of twenty-three feet. In comparison, Bombardier’s Challenger 3500 has a cabin height of 6 feet, width of 7 feet 2 inches, and length of twenty-five feet. Like Bombardier’s Challenger, the Phantom can be customized, with owners and fleet operators choosing from up to four variations of the cabin or working with outside designers to fashion their own floating luxury loft.

Sustainable Future

Drennan didn’t discuss a starting price in his conversation with Jetset. However, he said the company believes that reducing operating costs and design efficiency positions the Phantom as a competitive option in the super-midsize market. One indication of the level of interest in the new aircraft is that the fractional jet ownership company Flexjet has agreed to purchase 300 Phantom 3500 jets, making the company Otto’s first fleet customer.

Otto plans to begin testing the Phantom in 2027 and aims to achieve FAA certification by 2030, when they expect to launch commercial operations. It will enter a field dominated by established manufacturers offering super-midsize jets, including the Bombardier Challenger 3500, Praetor 500, and Gulfstream G280. These aircraft, much like the Phantom, are designed to operate transcontinental at transonic speeds while accommodating nine to ten passengers.

If successful, the Phantom could offer a practical and immediate response to the challenges of carbon emissions in the business aviation space, all while providing the bespoke luxury VIPs have come to expect from business jets. Even if owners elect to use standard aviation fuel instead of sustainable aviation fuel, they can still net a 60 percent reduction in carbon footprint, Otto claims. The company is committed to achieving net-zero emissions by the time the aircraft becomes operational, well ahead of an industry-wide push for significant reductions in carbon pollution by 2050.

“It is the best short way to take the biggest chunk out of your carbon footprint, ” Drennan said.",https://jetsetmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/v12.2-El-Zorro-5-3500-1.webp,N,,2026-01-12 06:57:29.845327

Monday, January 12, 2026Cathay welcomes the release of Igniting the SAF Market: Policy Pathways for Scaling Sustainable Aviation Fuel in China, a research study published by Peking University's National School of Development in late 2025. The in-depth analysis and recommendations outlined in the study offer actionable insights on scaling SAF adoption in the Chinese Mainland through market measures on both supply and demand fronts.

The study examines the challenges and untapped potential in scaling SAF in the Chinese Mainland, benchmarking global best practices while drawing parallels with China's thriving solar photovoltaic industry. The report highlights China's unique feedstock and manufacturing advantages, and projects long-term cost implications across different technical production pathways. Notably, the Power-to-Liquid (PtL) pathway - best known for producing electro-sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) - shows the greatest potential for long-term cost reduction. The study notes that, with appropriate policy support, SAF produced locally via PtL may achieve price parity with conventional jet fuel (including China's projected carbon price in 2030) ​ when the cumulative eSAF output reaches 1.6 million tonnes.

In addition, the study recommends a multi-pronged approach to growing the national SAF industry and capturing long-term cost benefits, from policy integration and stimulating market demand to expanding international market access and establishing procurement mechanisms that ensure stable supply and demand.

Cathay General Manager Sustainability Grace Cheung said: ""As a vital player in global aviation and the SAF ecosystem, the Chinese Mainland's development of its domestic SAF industry not only capitalises on global momentum and supports national carbon targets, but also helps promote the availability and affordability of SAF needed by the global aviation industry.

""This study by Peking University is encouraging, as it demonstrates the long-term potential for cost parity between SAF and conventional jet fuel, provided there is sufficient support for the development of new technologies and large-scale SAF production, along with policies that support SAF deployment from both demand and supply sides. Such progress will be essential for global airlines to realise further SAF usage in a commercially viable way.""

Cathay has long supported SAF development in the Chinese Mainland. The airline was among the early ones to uplift Chinese-made SAF products at Hong Kong International Airport, Amsterdam Schiphol, and London Heathrow.

SAF continues to play a critical role in aviation's path to decarbonisation. Compared to conventional jet fuel, SAF can reduce around 80% of carbon emissions on a lifecycle basis, based on the SAF procured by the Cathay Group in 2024.

In recent years, several major carriers have expanded premium cabin ratios to offset rising costs and volatile demand.
Load factors complicate the picture Premium cabins also influence load factors, another key determinant of emissions performance.
Premium cabins, particularly first class, often experience lower load factors than economy sections, especially outside peak travel periods.
For airlines, improving premium cabin utilisation becomes both a commercial and environmental imperative.","For more than a decade, airline strategy has been steadily drifting toward premiumisation. Larger business class footprints, the reintroduction of first class on select routes, and the rise of ultra long haul services have all been justified by one simple logic: yield matters more than volume.

But a new global study on commercial aviation efficiency suggests that this shift carries a climate cost that the industry has largely avoided confronting.

According to research published in Communications Earth and Environment, premium seating configurations are among the most carbon-intensive features of today’s air transport system, with business and first-class seats generating up to 5 times the emissions per passenger of economy-class travel.

For an industry under increasing pressure to demonstrate credible decarbonisation pathways, the findings place cabin design squarely at the centre of the sustainability conversation.

Why seat configuration matters

The study analysed 27.5 million commercial flights across more than 26,000 city pairs in 2023, measuring emissions in grams of carbon dioxide per revenue passenger kilometre. While aircraft type, route length, and load factors were expected drivers of efficiency, cabin layout emerged as one of the most influential variables.

Premium cabins consume disproportionately more space and weight per passenger. Larger seats, lower seat density, additional furnishings, and higher service loads mean that fewer passengers share the same fuel burn. When emissions are allocated per passenger, the result is a sharp divergence between premium and economy seating.

The researchers cite industry benchmarks indicating that a first-class seat can be up to five times more carbon-intensive than an economy seat, and a business-class seat around four times more intensive. On widebody aircraft operating long-haul routes, where premium cabins are most prevalent, this effect is magnified.

In simple terms, even highly efficient aircraft can deliver weak emissions performance if a significant portion of cabin space is dedicated to premium seating.

Premiumisation versus efficiency

The tension between premiumisation and efficiency is not theoretical. It is visible across fleet deployment and product strategy decisions made by airlines worldwide.

In recent years, several major carriers have expanded premium cabin ratios to offset rising costs and volatile demand. This trend is particularly pronounced on intercontinental routes, where business class demand has proven more resilient than economy traffic.

The study highlights that premium heavy airlines, even when operating modern fleets, often record higher emissions per revenue passenger kilometre than carriers using similar aircraft with denser seating layouts. The implication is clear: aircraft efficiency alone does not guarantee system efficiency.

This challenges a common industry assumption that sustainability progress is primarily driven by fleet renewal. While new generation aircraft deliver meaningful fuel savings, those gains can be diluted by low-density cabin configurations.

The Middle East dilemma

Nowhere is this trade-off more relevant than in the Middle East.

Gulf carriers have built global brands on premium service, widebody scale, and long-haul connectivity. Business and first-class cabins are not mere add-ons; they are core to the value proposition. At the same time, these airlines operate some of the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets in the world and benefit from consistently high load factors.

The study’s data show that major Middle East hubs perform relatively well on emissions per revenue passenger kilometre compared with many Western airports, reflecting strong utilisation and the deployment of modern aircraft. Yet the presence of large premium cabins remains a structural efficiency constraint.

For Middle East airlines, the question is not whether premium travel should disappear, but how it can evolve without undermining emissions performance.

Hidden opportunity in cabin optimisation

One of the study’s most striking findings is the scale of potential emissions reduction available through cabin reconfiguration alone.

When modelling a shift to all-economy layouts on the most efficient widebody aircraft currently in service, the researchers found that emissions could fall by 21.5% to 56.7%, depending on aircraft type and seating assumptions. These reductions are achieved without changing routes, frequencies, or passenger volumes.

Even allowing for a modest fuel penalty from increased passenger weight, the net emissions benefit remains substantial.

While fully economic configurations are unlikely to be commercially viable for network carriers, the analysis highlights the untapped potential of hybrid approaches. Higher-density business-class layouts, reduced first-class footprints, and smarter use of premium economy could all deliver efficiency gains without eliminating premium offerings.

Load factors complicate the picture

Premium cabins also influence load factors, another key determinant of emissions performance.

The study confirms that flights operating at lower load factors see sharply higher emissions per passenger. A half-full aircraft emits nearly twice as much CO2 per revenue passenger kilometre as a full one on comparable distances.

Premium cabins, particularly first class, often experience lower load factors than economy sections, especially outside peak travel periods. This means that even when an aircraft appears full, emissions per passenger may be higher than headline load factor figures suggest.

For airlines, improving premium cabin utilisation becomes both a commercial and environmental imperative.

Policy and investor pressure is coming

While aviation climate policy has focused heavily on sustainable aviation fuel mandates, the study argues that efficiency-based measures could deliver faster emissions reductions.

Cabin layout sits uncomfortably within that debate, but it may not remain immune. Investors, lenders, and regulators are increasingly interested in emissions intensity metrics rather than absolute emissions alone. As disclosures become more granular, airlines may be asked to explain not just what they fly, but how they configure it.

Efficiency-based landing fees, emissions intensity benchmarks, or transparency requirements could all bring cabin design decisions into sharper focus.

A strategic reckoning ahead

Premium travel is not going away. Demand for comfort, privacy, and flexibility remains strong, particularly in the long-haul markets that Middle East airlines dominate.

But the study makes one thing clear. Cabin configuration is no longer a purely commercial choice. It is a structural driver of aviation’s climate impact.

For airlines that want to lead the sustainability conversation without compromising their business model, the next frontier will not be abandoning premium cabins, but redesigning them for a lower-carbon future. As aviation enters a decade where growth, efficiency, and climate credibility must coexist, comfort will increasingly come with a question attached: at what cost, and how smartly can it be delivered?",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2026/01/12/WhatsApp-Image-2026-01-12-at-1.30.39-PM.jpeg,N,,2026-01-12 05:56:37.856644

The CJ3 Gen2 was first announced by Cessna in October 2023, during the National Business Aviation Association - Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) in Las Vegas. It was hailed, even from back then, as the result of customer feedback received via a Customer Advisory Board made up of owners, pilots, and mechanics.

What this means is that, even if the plane remains mechanically the same as the Citation it is based on, it does add a number of features intended to make both pilots and passengers more comfortable than before.

In the cockpit, for instance, pilots can enjoy 4.5 inches (11.4 cm) more legroom, something that not only makes the ride smoother for the one in control of the plane but also allows for easier entry and egress from the pilot's seat.

To make flying easier, Cessna included in the design the Garmin G3000 software and hardware suite that packs together autothrottle, touchscreen controllers, and GDL60 for aircraft connectivity, allowing for remote transmission of flight plans, automatic database updates, and wireless transmission of aircraft diagnostic data.

Back where the passengers sit, the fully customizable luxury interior is capable of transporting up to 10 passengers at a time. People now climb on board using a new step and assist handle and rest in either fixed side-facing seats or folding side-facing seats. Every seat comes with USB-C power, floor tracking, and a swivel function as an option.

Cessna also tinkered a bit with the plane's bathrooms, which now feature skylights. Everywhere you look, there is RGB accent lighting to set the proper mood on long flights. An externally serviceable lavatory rounds up the changes.

Speaking of long flights, the plane's pair of Williams International engines can keep the Citation CJ3 Gen2 going for as many as 2,350 miles (3,770 km). They allow the plane to carry with it 2,135 pounds (968 kg) of cargo, and they can be operated on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The aircraft got certified by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in October 2025, and in the first decade of January, Cessna announced the plane's entry into service, a little later than originally planned.

The launch customers for the aircraft are Textron Aviation's Customer Advisory Board member Dave Mecartney, and Shannon Day.

SAF so far: too little, too slow

No realistic decarbonization pathway is in sight for aviation. Not by 2030 and not by 2050. Demand for fossil jet fuel continues to rise. It is expected to reach new record levels this year. IEA and BNEF anticipate an increase of 50% to 11.4-11.6 mb/d by 2050, should there be no fundamental changes in climate or transport policies.(1)

Consumption rose by 200,000 b/d (barrels per day) in 2025 compared to the previous year, representing approximately 3% growth. For the current year 2026, a similarly robust increase of 180,000 b/d of jet fuel is expected (see chart below).

In absolute terms, consumption of fossil jet fuel grew 10 times faster than Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) supply last year. In the current year, according to current IATA projections, the growth rate will be 16 times faster.

The deployment of SAF cannot keep pace with this growth. Volumes climbed from the equivalent of 22,700 b/d (2024) to 43,100 b/d (2025) and could reach 54,400 b/d SAF this year according to IATA. This means SAF’s market share will remain below the 1% threshold this year (see chart below).

Projections for the coming years are only cautiously optimistic. They primarily refer to the production capacities of facilities that can produce either SAF for aviation or HVO/RD (2) for road transport. What the actual mix will look like is difficult to predict.

Market experts at GENA Solutions Oy (Lahti/Finland) estimate the nominal operational capacities of these facilities at 6.1 million tonnes at the end of 2025. One year earlier, it was 2.9 million tonnes. This would indicate that less than one-third of HEFA/HVO capacities were used for SAF.

2. SAF production pathways and limitations

🔷 HEFA (feedstock: UCO/Animal Fats)

Apart from two small facilities, there are currently only HEFA-SAF capacities available for SAF (stand-alone or co-processing). They demonstrate favorable climate performance when using UCO (used cooking oil) as feedstock, which has been the dominant practice to date.

However, UCO potential is limited (more on this in a later blog post). Aviation also competes here with trucking (HVO/RD) and maritime shipping.

Competition to the HEFA pathway will remain limited. Well into the 2030s, the near-total dominance of HEFA-SAF will persist.

The problem of inter-sectoral competition also arises in similar fashion for ethanol and methanol (see below), which can be utilized for decarbonization in road transport (ethanol), maritime shipping (ethanol, methanol), and also in industry (methanol).

🔷 Ethanol-to-Jet (EtJ)

EtJ has considerable growth potential in the SAF sector. Electrification in road transport could free up substantial volumes for aviation. Sugarcane, corn, and other crops provide a large feedstock base.

The climate performance of corn ethanol is disputed, as is the case with most crop-based oils. This does not constitute a fundamental obstacle, as crucial factors (particularly ILUC effects, energy/fertilizer inputs) could be minimized. Until then, however, considerable efforts are required.

LanzaJet commissioned the first commercial-scale ethanol-to-jet facility in November 2025 (Freedom Pines). Current production volumes are not publicly known. According to earlier reports, volumes of up to 500 b/d would be conceivable.

🔷 Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ)

MtJ also has potential, particularly in China, though deployment in maritime shipping or industry appears more likely. Further processing toward jet fuel would be technically quite complex and demanding.

🔷 Fischer-Tropsch Process (FT-Waste)

FT facilities can in principle utilize a very broad range of waste feedstocks. However, very high costs, low output selectivity, and numerous technical problems will significantly slow or even completely prevent widespread deployment. To date, there is no commercial-scale FT-waste facility in sight.

🔷 E-SAF

The same applies to eSAF (synthetic aviation fuel), which is intended to utilize electrolysis hydrogen (green hydrogen) and CO2 from other processes (primarily from industry and agriculture). Output of existing projects is negligible..

The EU mandates a 1.2% eSAF blending requirement from 2030, which is to rise to 35% by 2050.

However, costs are exorbitant, running ten times higher than conventional jet fuel. No significant cost reduction is in sight. Volumes will therefore remain low, as government financing will rapidly reach its limits.

CO2 availability will also become more difficult once industrial CO2 point sources becomes scarce in the EU after 2040 and biogenic CO2 would simultaneously need to serve several demand sectors.

3. SAF climate benefits and feedstocks

The feedstock potential of UCO and other waste oils is limited. Crop-based oil or ethanol can broaden the feedstock base, but this reduces the climate benefit per litre of SAF.

Large feedstock potentials with favorable climate performance will become available if agricultural residues of all kinds can be utilized (cellulosic biomass). In addition, the methanol economy could be expanded so massively that it could supply not only industry and maritime transport but also aviation.

The cellulosic and/or methanol pathway likewise faces enormous scale-up challenges. Most experts remain rather pessimistic. The expansion could proceed so slowly that leapfrogging toward hydrogen or electric aircrafts might even be easier and faster.

4. SAF costs and prices

The alternatives to fossil jet fuel are expensive. EASA places average market-based reference prices in the EU at:

€734/t for conventional jet fuel

€2,085/t for HEFA-SAF

€7,695/t for e-SAF

This results in enormous direct CO2 avoidance costs of approximately €430/tCO2 when deploying HEFA-SAF and €2,210/tCO2 for eSAF. By comparison, one tonne of CO2 (EUA) currently costs just €85/t in the European ETS.

Particularly regarding eSAF promotion, the question therefore arises whether government-subsidized expansion of this pathway represents the best solution.

The potential for significant cost reduction is limited for both HEFA-SAF and eSAF. Moreover, the cost question is too narrow in any case, as a rapid increase in SAF mandates will drive prices far above costs. It would therefore be quite possible that SAF will become more expensive rather than cheaper in the future.

5. SAF mandates and new import dependencies

The number of SAF mandates outside the EU and UK remains limited at present, but a number of Asian countries are gradually following suit, starting with Singapore and Korea and soon to be followed by India, China, and other states. In the US, individual airlines are already quite active in deploying SAF. Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, India, and China can draw on a large domestic feedstock base for HEFA-SAF (UCO). The US or Brazil could pursue the EtJ pathway (corn, sugarcane).

In the EU, the feedstock base is less favorable. As with many other technologies, Europe is heading toward high dependence on China for HEFA-SAF as well. Already in 2024, 38% of feedstocks (primarily UCO) for SAF production in Europe came from China, according to EASA.

The abolition of double-counting for advanced biofuels and (from 2027) palm oil products in major EU states such as Germany (under RED III) will further complicate UCO availability for aviation. Higher SAF exports from China can likely only ease the situation until SAF demand rises in China. Thirty SAF projects have already been announced in China. However, there is no timeline yet for nationwide SAF mandates..

Source: Argus

6. Conclusion

It is clear that HEFA-SAF can only represent an interim solution for aviation decarbonization.

The feedstock base must be considerably broadened. Ethanol and perhaps also methanol are candidates here. However, in the long term larger volumes would only be available through the utilization of cellulosic biomass, that is, through the enormous quantities of straw, bagasse, stover, etc., that accrue regularly.

Or a leapfrogging approach toward new propulsion systems such as H2 or batteries must be pursued. Here, in addition to major technological challenges, an airline industry that hardly appears innovation-friendly and a sluggish licensing bureaucracy stand in the way.

In parallel, therefore, the numerous non-fuel ideas should be implemented. Rapid contrail management would be inexpensive and comparatively quick to realize. In the areas of fleet modernization, air traffic organization, and the airline industry itself, there are also many potentials that can contribute to comparatively rapid decarbonization.

Notes:

(1) Reported volumes depend on definition. We estimate the combined demand of commercial aviation, general aviation, private jets and military jets, based on data from IATA and IEA.

(2) HVO = Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (EU); RD = Renewable Diesel (USA). Synthetic diesel fuels produced from vegetable oils, waste fats or used cooking oils. The hydrogenated paraffinic composition is chemically similar or identical to fossil diesel and can be used as a drop-in fuel in diesel engines.

This year’s Sustainability Award – with the shortlist chosen from our 2026 Startups 100 Index, powered by Sage – was a fiercely contested category, as so many conscience-led ventures are out there trying to find solutions. This category that filled us with hope that there are great and innovative minds working tirelessly to make a difference.

Here is the winner and shortlist for the 2026 Startups 100 Index Sustainability Award.

Winner – OXCCU

In 2023, aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO₂ emissions. It is an industry that has proved slow to change, despite its reputation as a high polluter.

The main problem has been finding an alternative to the fossil fuel-based aviation fuel that powers the majority of fleets. In 2024, the aviation industry accounted for around 8% of global final oil consumption, as compared with maritime shipping, which sat at around 7%.

OXCCU’s mission is to develop the world’s “lowest cost and lowest emission” pathways to make sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from waste carbon. The team explains that it combines the biogenic carbon and hydrogen contained in waste biomass or biogas and/or CO2 from a variety of sustainable sources, and adds electrolytic H2 if required.

The team has already launched a demonstration plant at Oxford Airport, and has won £18m in Series A funding plus £20.75m in Series B, as well as £5.9m in government grants.

The team sees its work as part of a wider movement to push the aviation industry to net-zero, as its technology will “enable people to continue to fly and use hydrocarbon products but with a reduced climate impact”. And this is why the aviation industry is interested.

Shortlist – PulpaTronics

This startup caught our attention last year when it was also nominated for our 2025 Sustainability Award, and it has again won a place on the shortlist for 2026. This team set out to tackle an issue that so many of us ignore or aren’t aware of: the e-waste caused by discarded RFID tags.

These tags are prolific. We use them in shops across the world. However, more than over 30 billion single-use tags end up in landfills every year.

PulpaTronics has created metal-free and chipless RFID tags made only from paper using a laser technology. They use fewer components than traditional tags and have a simpler manufacturing process. This means that, not only are they recyclable, they are also cheaper to make.

What started out as a final year master’s project could now have a profound impact. PulpaTronics has the backing of the Imperial Enterprise Lab and Innovate UK, among others, and is actively recruiting to boost its team.

PulpaTronics was also one of the winners of this year’s H&M Global Change Awards. This brought a €200,000 prize, but also access to mentors, collaborators and industry leaders from the fashion world.

For an industry in which there have been some high profile accusations of greenwashing, the switch to sustainable RFID tags could have an immediate and yet lasting impact.

Shortlist – Adamo Foods

Intensive meat production is now well-known to be bad for the environment and people’s health, and Adamo Foods has set out to find an alternative. However, as founder and CEO Pierre Dupuis says, the plant-based meat alternatives on the market are often mushy and have a poor texture, which puts consumers off.

The Adamo Foods team set about creating an alternative to meat whole cuts, which represent 85% of the $1.2trn real meat market. It developed a proprietary fermentation process to create a fungi which has long, densely-packed fibres. This replicates the texture of real meat, and is also high in protein and fibre.

Its production also used 93% less CO₂e than conventional meat, and 99% less water and land. “This will save 74,000 tonnes of CO₂e in the next five years,” says the team.

Dupuis has been a vegetarian since the age of 12, and while this was driven by concerns about animal welfare at the time, his motivation now also includes broader environmental and health concerns. Led by him, Adamo Foods is creating products that hit the mark for taste and nutrition, but don’t come with a hefty price tag for our environment.

Shortlist – Treeapp

Treeapp lets anyone with a phone contribute to reforestation in under a minute and at no financial cost. This incredible eco-friendly startup has now planted more than six million trees across 20 countries, with each site working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

“Collectively, these trees will absorb an estimated 654,000 tonnes of CO₂ over their lifetimes, equivalent to almost one million London to New York flights, while restoring 4,002 hectares of land and creating 60,000 fair-wage workdays worldwide,” the team shares proudly.

The app has already gained a following among businesses as diverse as sock brand ChattyFeet and Brighton & Hove Albion football team. As well as catching the attention of the press, the team has also won accolades, including the World Economic Forum’s Uplink Challenge for Restoration at Scale and One Young World’s Lead2030 Challenge.

Now a certified B-Corp, the team is hoping to launch in more countries in the future, and bring in more businesses, both as partners and as clients. The aim is to make helping the planet seamless but effective – one tree at a time.

The airport of 2026 and beyond will set the pace for secure, seamless and sustainable travel that communities can measure, and travellers can experience.","Justin Erbacci, Director General of ACI World, reflects on how outcomes from ICAO’s 42nd Assembly will empower airports to deliver smarter, greener and more seamless travel in the coming years.

The next few years will be decisive for global aviation. Demand is rising, the sector and communities desire cleaner growth, and travellers expect journeys that are secure, seamless and inclusive. Against this backdrop, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 42nd Assembly became the arena to align ambition with action. Held in Montreal from 23 September to 3 October 2025, the triennial assembly gathered more than 2,000 leaders from 192 States to set priorities for the international civil aviation sector.

Under the theme “Transform airports, empower aviation and connect the world,” Airports Council International (ACI) achieved several significant outcomes that will help transform the future of global aviation. In addition, we actively defended airport interests through targeted interventions, ensuring these priorities were reflected in the final outcomes.

What will the airport of 2026 and beyond look like?

Assembly outcomes equip airports, the industry, and States to integrate risk-based security, scale clean energy, modernise slot policy, strengthen economic frameworks, enable digital and inclusive journeys, and advance aerodrome certification. Success will be visible in safer airports, shorter queues, greener operations, more reliable schedules, and a stellar traveller experience. Most importantly, it will be measurable – in emissions reduced, connections added, safety enhanced, and prosperity shared.

What was achieved for airports and the industry?

Driving efficiency and risk-based, harmonised aviation security

As the security landscape evolves, airports and States are aligning on a smarter, standardised way to keep people safe without slowing them down.

Changes to the Assembly Resolution on Security, driven by ACI and broadly supported by States, reinforced the need for a co-ordinated, efficient and harmonised approach to testing and certification to accelerate the deployment of new security equipment, supporting stronger security, greater operational efficiency, and an improved passenger experience.

Secured recognition of airports as critical to aviation decarbonisation

Meeting climate goals requires empowering airports to generate, store, and manage cleaner energy as integral nodes of the aviation ecosystem.

ACI welcomed the formal recognition of airports’ critical role in aviation decarbonisation, with States called to establish enabling frameworks for airport projects such as renewable energy and energy storage. This recognition, driven by ACI, was one of the biggest changes to the ICAO Assembly Resolution on Climate Change agreed during this Assembly.

Advocated for modernised airport slot policy

To match capacity with demand fairly and efficiently, slot rules must reflect today’s operational realities and public-interest objectives.

ACI’s positions gained support across different regions to ensure that public interest is served through equitable, nationally tailored slot policies; the Assembly called for strategic discussions on slot policy modernisation that considers local infrastructure.

Championed airports as businesses in their own right and defended their economic interests

Sustainable airport economics enable the airport investments that travellers and communities expect.

ACI’s promotion of greater air connectivity won States’ support and led to recognition by the Assembly of the need to tackle policy and fiscal barriers affecting connectivity and consumers, and impeding socio-economic development. ACI also defended airports’ and passengers’ interests in matters of consumer protection, called for progress on air service liberalisation, and opposed excessive and double taxation of air transport.

Underscored the critical importance of seamless travel

With volumes rising, the path to resilience is frictionless processing rooted in digital identity, trusted data, and co-ordinated agencies.

With air travel demand expected to reach 18.9 billion by 2047, ACI urged States to enable seamless travel by improving inter-agency co-ordination nationally, accelerating digital travel credentials globally, and supporting industry in implementing digital identity management and biometric solutions – with a focus on seamless borders.

Strengthened aerodrome certification worldwide

Raising the safety baseline everywhere depends on practical support that helps airports achieve and maintain certification.

ACI’s advocacy on aerodrome certification, supported by States across four ICAO regions, called for stronger, coordinated support for governments and airport operators to overcome the challenges in improving safety and getting airports certified.

The ICAO 42nd Assembly placed airports at the centre of global aviation policy. Now we must execute pragmatically and collaboratively. If we seize this moment, the airport of 2026 and beyond will not merely cope with demand; it will set a new standard for secure, seamless and sustainable travel. That is the future ACI will continue to champion, and the future we can build together.

What this means for travellers

Assembly outcomes show up in the traveller’s journey. For instance, risk-based, harmonised security and digital identity shorten queues while keeping safety standards high. By accelerating digital travel credentials globally, travellers experience smoother journeys. Aerodrome certification support raises the safety baseline everywhere and for everyone and facilitates greater global connectivity.

Making 2026 tangible

As airports and their partners translate assembly outcomes into action, success will be judged where it matters most: travellers and communities. Smarter risk-based security, cleaner energy on airport estates, modernised slot regimes, balanced economics and digitally enabled journeys will be part of this future. The airport of 2026 and beyond will set the pace for secure, seamless and sustainable travel that communities can measure, and travellers can experience.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_168215864.png,N,,2026-01-12 05:57:42.469594

Through this MOU, both companies will collaborate in marketing, public relations, sales, and other areas to promote the adoption of EACs, helping companies using transportation services reduce their Scope 3 emissions.

By forming a cross-industry partnership between shipping and aviation, this initiative represents a new model for decarbonisation in Japan.

As part of this initiative, both companies, in their capacity as users of maritime and air transport, have engaged in mutual trading of EACs to reduce their respective Scope 3 emissions as follows:

MOL purchased “air transport (air travel and freight)” EACs issued by ITOCHU to reduce GHG emissions associated with its employee air travel (Scope 3 Category 6).

ITOCHU purchased “maritime transport (sea freight)” EACs issued by MOL to reduce GHG emissions associated with its use of maritime transport (Scope 3 Category 4).

This transaction was executed through the platform provided by 123Carbon in the Netherlands. Operating under a robust audit framework, the platform centrally manages the issuance, transfer, storage, and retirement of EACs. It ensures traceability and reliability of transactions while maintaining high transparency in accordance with global standards.

MOL said reducing Scope 3 emissions-which represent a significant share for many companies- is an unavoidable challenge in advancing climate change response.

One of key barriers is the difficulty of ensuring traceability, given the complexity of supply chains. MOL will leverage its strengths in marine transport through the use of low-carbon marine fuels, while ITOCHU will draw on its expertise in adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Through this collaborative effort in the shipping and aviation sectors, the two companies will establish a framework to support transportation service users in reducing their Scope 3 emissions. Together, they are committed to advancing decarbonization across the broader transportation supply chain through this partnership.

Local boat builder Pinnacle Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd on Sunday (11 January) said its first full biodiesel utility boat, President 100, completed a 1,000-hour sea trial.

Powered by B100 biodiesel, the vessel operated by Prestige Ocean Pte Ltd, captured data on bunker fuel emissions, marine fuel behaviour, and performance in the trial which began in July 2025.

“Across 1,000 operational hours, the trial demonstrated that carbon neutral biofuels are not a distant ambition, but a viable and immediate solution for the maritime energy transition,” the company said in a social media post.

Wilmar International supplied the biodiesel that fuelled this journey and Gulf Marine provided the specialised lubricants essential to engine performance.

Weichai Singapore Pte Ltd engineered the biodiesel engine that powered the vessel while Maritime Energy & Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence (MESD) performed the research and will produce a report to provide critical empirical data to support industry-wide adoption.

The milestone event began with a presentation of the 1,000-hour research findings by Dr Ningrui Tang, followed by a ceremonial signing between the four lead partners.

“This signing represents more than the conclusion of a trial. It opens the door to a new era of Green Marine operations. We hope this project serves as a catalyst for others embarking on their own decarbonisation journeys,” the company added.

CNOOC Gas & Power Group on Thursday (8 January) said it completed its first bonded LNG bunkering operation for the year at Shenzhen Yantian Port Container Terminal.

The company refuelled CMA CGM Concorde with 10,000 cubic meters (m3) of bonded LNG during the operation on 7 January.

In January 2023, CNOOC Gas & Power Group completed CNOOC’s first international bonded LNG vessel bunkering operation with the refuelling of CMA CGM Concorde at Yantian Port in Shenzhen.

Since then, the company said it has achieved a number of milestones including completing the first cross-customs bonded LNG bunkering operation in Guangdong Province, set a record for the largest single LNG bunkering operation in Hong Kong, helped Guangzhou become the first “terminal and anchorage” international bunkering centre in South China, and built CNOOC’s first shore-based bunkering station.

At the same time, it has achieved the implementation of the “Gasification of the Pearl River” project, normalised international ship bunkering operations, and built a “super bunkering centre” in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.

Gas Power Group added its Green Shipping Project Team will focus on technological innovation and service improvement in bunkering.

Early this month, multiple tank trucks were planned to operate in parallel, simultaneously carrying out bunkering and vehicle loading/unloading operations for roll-on/roll-off (Ro-Ro) ships , significantly improving customs clearance efficiency.

In the mid of January, the company added it will conduct the first anchorage bunkering operation in Shenzhen, helping the city build an international bunkering centre combining a terminal and anchorage.

Bureau Veritas Marine & Offshore (BV) on Thursday (8 January) said it has granted Approval in Principle (AiP) certificates to two ammonia-fuelled vessel designs jointly developed by CIMC Ocean Engineering Design & Research Institute Co Ltd (ORIC) and Zhoushan Changhong International Shipyard Co Ltd. (Changhong International).

The certified designs include an ECO-159,000 DWT ammonia dual-fuel crude oil tanker and a 21,700 TEU ammonia-fuelled ultra-large container ship, supporting scalable solutions for deep-sea shipping decarbonisation.

The two vessel designs address long-term decarbonisation requirements and provide a solid technical basis for future commercial construction.

The ECO-159,000 DWT ammonia dual-fuel crude oil tanker is designed as a next-generation green Suezmax solution for long-haul crude oil transport. Based on a technical pathway combining zero-carbon fuel and wind-assisted propulsion, the design integrates advanced propulsion systems, intelligent control, and an optimised hull form.

The vessel is equipped with a latest-generation ammonia-fuelled main engine and two large Type C ammonia fuel tanks arranged on the main deck, targeting ultra-low to zero well-to-wake emissions. Fuel system arrangements are developed in line with the IGF Code and relevant classification guidelines to ensure safe application.

The 21,700 TEU ammonia-fuelled ultra-large container ship is designed to support the green transition of global mainline container shipping. Based on the principles of zero-carbon fuel readiness, high energy efficiency, and full route adaptability, the design integrates advanced propulsion technologies, optimized hull and layout solutions, and intelligent systems, offering a forward-looking and practical zero-carbon container vessel concept.

In addition, BV completed three-dimensional (3D) classification approval for the 21,700 TEU container ship design developed by ORIC, contributing to the exploration of 3D-based classification approaches for ultra-large vessels.

The AIP certifications further strengthen cooperation between BV, ORIC, and Changhong International in advancing ammonia-fuelled ship design and supporting the maritime industry’s transition toward low- and zero-carbon shipping.

Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator.
Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises.
Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity.
China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining.","China has approved a restructuring between China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited (CNAF), marking a major state-led consolidation in the country’s petroleum and aviation fuel sector.

The State Council approved the plan following an announcement by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) on January 8, 2026. Sinopec said the restructuring would be implemented in accordance with government arrangements, but provided no further operational details.

Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator. CNAF controls aviation fuel supply, storage, and into-plane refuelling services at more than 200 airports across mainland China, while Sinopec is the nation’s largest producer of jet fuel and refined petroleum products.

China consumes just over 40 million tonnes of jet fuel a year, equivalent to roughly 0.8–0.9 million barrels per day.

CNAF does not operate crude oil refineries and sources most of its jet fuel from domestic refiners, including Sinopec and PetroChina. Its core assets lie in airport-side infrastructure, including storage tanks, pipelines, hydrant systems, and refuelling fleets. Sinopec, by contrast, operates one of the world’s largest refining systems and an extensive nationwide fuels marketing and pipeline network.

Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises. By combining refining, logistics, and airport distribution within a single group, policymakers aim to improve operational efficiency and strengthen control over a strategically important fuel segment.

The restructuring also aligns with broader efforts to optimise the state-owned economy amid slowing economic growth and structural shifts in fuel demand. As gasoline and diesel consumption plateaus due to electrification and efficiency gains, aviation fuel and petrochemicals are seen as key growth areas for refiners.

Industry observers also expect the integration to support China’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ambitions by linking Sinopec’s refining and biofuel development capabilities with CNAF’s nationwide airport distribution network.

SAF is emerging as a strategic priority for China’s aviation and refining sectors, linked to the country’s targets to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Under the 14th Five-Year Plan for Green Civil Aviation Development, China set initial SAF consumption targets of 20,000 tonnes per year by 2025, with longer-term policy scenarios pointing to blending rates of 5–15% by 2030. Industry and policy analyses indicate this could translate into domestic SAF demand of several million tonnes per year by the end of the decade, positioning China among the world’s largest potential SAF markets.

China has already begun building the industrial and regulatory foundations to support large-scale SAF deployment. As of 2024, operational and planned SAF capacity—primarily based on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology—totalled more than three million tonnes per year, with several producers receiving airworthiness certification under a CAAC-recognised framework. CAAC, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, is China’s national civil aviation authority under the Ministry of Transport, responsible for regulating and supervising civil aviation, including flight and ground safety, air traffic management, market regulation, and accident investigation.

Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity. Through its Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company unit, Sinopec developed the SRJET HEFA process and commissioned China’s first dedicated SAF plant, with a design capacity of about 100,000 tonnes per year, securing both Chinese airworthiness approval and international sustainability certification. The company has already supplied SAF to Airbus’ Tianjin facility and delivered used-cooking-oil-based SAF to Hong Kong International Airport for uplift by Cathay Pacific, signalling ambitions that extend beyond domestic decarbonisation to regional SAF trading and exports. Sinopec is also expanding capacity through a planned 230,000-tonne-per-year SAF plant developed with TotalEnergies, while positioning SAF alongside carbon capture and other low-carbon fuels as part of its broader transition strategy.

China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining. As the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and into-plane refuelling operator, CNAF has taken equity stakes in private SAF producers to secure upstream volumes, including investments in used-cooking-oil-based SAF projects. At the same time, CNAF plays a central operational role in China’s CAAC-led SAF pilot programmes, managing storage, blending, quality control, and into-plane delivery at major airports. This positions CNAF as the logistics backbone of China’s emerging SAF market, complementing refiners such as Sinopec by ensuring that certified SAF can be distributed efficiently to airlines as blending targets and policy support expand.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-12 01:11:56.050287

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short.
Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel.
The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview.
Editor’s note: This story was updated to clarify the status of BP’s sustainable aviation fuel project at Cherry Point.","A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Jan. 9 extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.

The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.

Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.

“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.

State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”

The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.

“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”

The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.

SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.

The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.

Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Jan. 8 that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.

A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.

Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.

On the west side of the Cascades, BP was awarded nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal was to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually. But since then, BP corporate management scaled back its renewable fuels ambitions globally and put the Whatcom County project on indefinite “pause,” according to a spokesman. Its future is now unclear.

If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.

By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.

If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.

During a press availability following the Jan. 8 launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.

Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.

The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview. Billig is a former state Senate majority leader who played an instrumental role in the 2023 passage of state tax incentives for SAF producers and users during his final term in office.

As of early 2026, a transformative partnership between Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Kuehne+Nagel has entered a crucial operational phase, following a major agreement signed in late December 2025. This alliance is focused on the commercialization of solar-based synthetic aviation fuel, a revolutionary step towards achieving decarbonization in the aviation sector. This collaboration brings together a Swiss clean-tech pioneer, Synhelion, whose innovative technology is at the heart of this significant move, promising to reshape the future of aviation fuel.

The deal marks the start of a new chapter in the airline and logistics industries as these giants join forces to combat the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. With sustainability at the forefront, this partnership aims to make solar-based fuel a viable, scalable, and long-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel.

Who Are the Key Players in the Partnership?

This landmark collaboration involves three main players: SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion. SWISS, the national carrier of Switzerland, is leading the way as the first airline to integrate solar-based synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) into its regular operations. Kuehne+Nagel, a global logistics provider, will benefit from this innovation by offering its airfreight customers a way to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Synhelion, a clean-tech company from Switzerland, is the technology provider behind the synthetic fuel, specializing in converting concentrated solar heat into aviation fuel.

What Is Solar-Based Synthetic Fuel?

The core of this groundbreaking partnership is the support for Synhelion’s solar fuel technology, which has already made headlines in the clean-tech industry. Synhelion is the first company globally to use concentrated solar heat to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional biofuels, which rely on agricultural crops and waste products, solar jet fuel is produced by harnessing the power of sunlight to create high-temperature process heat. This heat is then used to convert biogenic carbon and water into liquid fuel, resulting in a synthetic fuel that is both carbon-neutral and scalable.

The technology is being hailed as a game-changer for the aviation industry, as it does not compete with food crops, unlike traditional biofuels. The fuel is designed as a “drop-in” solution, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without the need for any modifications, making it a practical and seamless transition for airlines.

How Will This Partnership Work?

Under the terms of the agreement, SWISS has committed to purchasing at least 200 tonnes of Synhelion’s synthetic SAF annually. This move is critical to the financial sustainability of Synhelion’s production capabilities, ensuring that the company can scale its operations and meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel. The fuel will be used by SWISS in its own operations, marking the airline as a trailblazer in sustainable aviation practices.

Furthermore, Kuehne+Nagel will also benefit from the partnership by purchasing a significant portion of the SAF. The global logistics provider will use this fuel specifically for its airfreight shipments handled by Swiss WorldCargo, the air cargo division of SWISS. This marks a major step in the broader decarbonization of supply chains, as Kuehne+Nagel will be able to offer its customers a tangible and effective way to reduce the CO₂ footprint of their supply chains.

What Are the Long-Term Goals and Timeline for This Partnership?

This collaboration is based on a binding, long-term offtake agreement, ensuring that both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel have a reliable and steady supply of synthetic SAF for years to come. The fuel supply agreement for Kuehne+Nagel will officially begin in 2027, once Synhelion completes its first industrial-scale production facility.

The partnership is a significant step in the aviation industry’s collective effort to reach ambitious decarbonization targets. SWISS’s parent company, Lufthansa Group, is aiming to reduce net CO₂ emissions by 50% by 2030, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. This collaboration will help the airline make substantial progress toward these targets, setting a standard for other airlines to follow.

Why Is This Partnership Considered a “First-of-Its-Kind”?

Unlike many airlines that use bio-SAF, produced from waste oils and fats, this partnership is focused on synthetic SAF, which is seen as the “gold standard” for sustainability. Synthetic SAF does not compete with food crops, has the potential for near-limitless scalability, and offers a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional aviation fuel. Additionally, synthetic SAF can be produced at scale without relying on the limitations of agricultural resources, making it a highly sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

This partnership also stands out because it bridges the gap between the airline industry, logistics, and clean-tech solutions. By partnering with Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS is not only leading by example in the aviation sector but also contributing to the larger efforts to decarbonize global supply chains.

What Are the Strategic Goals for This Collaboration?

The goals of the partnership go beyond simply purchasing and using synthetic SAF. The primary objectives include:

Decarbonizing Aviation: Both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel are committed to using sustainable aviation fuel as a critical part of their decarbonization strategies. For Kuehne+Nagel, securing a long-term supply of SAF allows the logistics giant to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from its airfreight operations.

Scalability of Synthetic SAF: One of the long-term goals is to scale the production of synthetic SAF to make it economically viable and accessible to the wider aviation industry.

Strategic Alignment with Climate Goals: This collaboration aligns perfectly with the Lufthansa Group’s broader climate targets and emphasizes the importance of innovation in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

What Does This Mean for the Aviation and Logistics Industries?

The agreement between SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion is a major milestone for the aviation and logistics sectors. This partnership provides a practical solution to one of the industry’s most pressing issues: reducing emissions from air travel. As the first airline in the world to integrate solar fuel into its operations, SWISS is setting a new benchmark for the industry. This collaboration is also a clear signal to other logistics and aviation companies to follow suit and explore sustainable fuel alternatives.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250724-swiss-synhelion.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:17.783186

From major airport projects and new long-haul routes to sustainability efforts and regional policy reforms, the year marked a turning point, with Kenya playing a visible and influential role.

Across the continent, airlines and governments moved beyond post-pandemic recovery and began laying foundations for long-term growth. The changes were not just about more flights, but about cheaper travel, greener technology, and stronger regional cooperation.

Kenya’s Growing Role in African Aviation

Kenya remained one of East Africa’s aviation anchors in 2025. Nairobi continued to serve as a key gateway between Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, while Kenyan airlines took notable steps toward sustainability and innovation.

Safarilink Aviation made headlines by committing to hybrid-electric aircraft, positioning Kenya among the early African adopters of cleaner aviation technology. At the same time, Kenya Airways advanced plans to support local production of sustainable aviation fuel, signaling a shift toward greener long-haul operations and reduced carbon emissions.

These moves placed Kenya firmly within Africa’s broader push to modernize aviation while responding to global environmental pressures.

Big Infrastructure and Global Ambition

Elsewhere on the continent, Ethiopian Airlines led one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in African aviation history — the development of Bishoftu International Airport, set to become Africa’s largest airport. The project underscored Africa’s intention to compete directly with major global hubs in Europe and the Middle East.

For Kenya, this expansion presents both competition and opportunity. Improved continental hubs can strengthen inter-African connectivity, benefiting Nairobi as a regional link point for business, tourism, and cargo.

Cheaper Skies Through Regional Action

Perhaps the most significant policy shift came from West Africa. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) approved a decision to cut air ticket taxes and passenger charges, a move expected to reduce fares by up to 40 percent.

Aviation experts say this decision has direct relevance for regions such as East Africa, where flying remains expensive for ordinary citizens. For Kenya and its neighbors, the ECOWAS model provides a clear example of how regional cooperation can make air travel more affordable and boost intra-African tourism and trade.

New Routes, New Connections

Across Africa, airlines expanded international reach. Uganda Airlines launched direct flights to London, Nigerian carriers strengthened partnerships with global airlines, and Ethiopian Airlines expanded cargo links to Asia.

Kenya, already well connected internationally, benefited from this wider network growth by strengthening its role in regional feeder traffic, supporting tourism flows into the country and across East Africa.

Challenges Still Remain

Despite progress, 2025 also highlighted persistent challenges. Safety oversight, regulatory consistency, geopolitical tensions, and high operating costs continue to affect African aviation — including in Kenya.

Airlines and regulators face ongoing pressure to balance expansion with safety, affordability, and environmental responsibility.

A Shared African Direction

What stood out in 2025 was a shared sense of direction. Africa’s aviation sector — including Kenya — is no longer focused only on survival. It is investing, experimenting, and coordinating across borders.

For Kenya, the year reinforced its position as a regional aviation leader, while showing that future success will depend on deeper regional cooperation, smarter policies, and continued innovation.

As Africa looks ahead, the skies are no longer just opening — they are being deliberately redesigned, with Kenya firmly part of the journey.",https://katakenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cropped-cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:27.535296

He emphasized that renewable energy is now the most cost-effective and resilient source of electricity.

Economic and strategic importance

La Camera stressed that countries adopting renewables quickly will gain economic competitiveness, while slow adopters risk falling behind. He highlighted the need for international cooperation and affordable financing to accelerate the global energy transition.

Mumbai: Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani on Sunday announced a plan to invest ₹7 lakh crore in Gujarat, reinforcing the state's position as a global hub for clean energy, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing.

Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conferences for the Kutch and Saurashtra region in Rajkot, Ambani said Reliance would double its investments in the state, having already invested over ₹3.5 lakh crore in the last five years.

The fresh investments are expected to generate large-scale employment and accelerate economic growth across Gujarat, the company said in a press release.

Clean Energy Hub

Ambani highlighted Reliance's ambitious clean energy plans centered in Jamnagar, where the company is building what he described as the world's largest integrated clean energy ecosystem. The project will span solar manufacturing, battery energy storage, green hydrogen, green fertilisers, sustainable aviation fuel, maritime fuels and advanced materials.

""Jamnagar, once India's largest hydrocarbon energy exporter, will become the country's largest exporter of green energy and materials,"" Ambani said.

In Kutch, Reliance is developing one of the world's largest multi-gigawatt, utility-scale solar power projects with round-the-clock clean energy generation enabled by advanced storage systems and modern grid integration.

AI, Data Centres and Affordable Intelligence

Reliance will build India's largest artificial intelligence-ready data centre in Jamnagar, Ambani announced. The facility will support Reliance Jio's upcoming ""people-first"" AI platform aimed at making AI services affordable and accessible to all Indians.

The platform will enable citizens to access AI tools in their own languages and on their own devices, he said, adding that the initiative would boost productivity and innovation nationwide.

Olympics and Social Infrastructure

Ambani announced Reliance Foundation's support for India's Olympic ambitions, including the Prime Minister's vision of hosting the 2036 Olympic Games in Ahmedabad. As part of this effort, Reliance will partner with the Gujarat government to manage the Veer Savarkar Multi-Sports Complex in Naranpura in Ahmedabad.

Additionally, Reliance will establish a world-class hospital in Jamnagar and significantly expand its educational institutions across Saurashtra, he said.

Electrofuels derived from renewable electricity sources and electrolytic green hydrogen may be scalable in the future. These electrofuels are also referred to as power to liquids or PtL fuels. A pertinent question about electrofuels is whether they are the best use of green electrons whilst there is such a surging demand for electricity around the world and the majority of power generation capacity still relies on fossil fuels. Gasification of residual biomass, such as forestry cuttings and post-harvest waste, is an alternative pathway to achieve liquid fuels. This pathway to SAF is more affordable than the electrofuels route. The challenge of this process is that the syngas produced by gasification is very rich in carbon monoxide (CO) but it does not contain sufficient hydrogen to produce liquid fuels such as kerosene and diesel. And, when we look to the very long term, the amount of available forestry waste is finite and driven by timber production, which is the primary use of the harvested tree. The combination of these two imperfect processes can create a harmonious synergy. The forestry waste biomass is stretched through the use of electrolytic hydrogen to mitigate the scalability concerns. The carbon from the biomass is fully utilised with minimal carbon dioxide emissions. And, the high cost of the pure electrofuel is reduced through combination with the more affordable waste biomass feedstock. Interested in clean energy projects and technologies?

In early September, SMBC Aviation Capital announced a definitive agreement with Sumitomo Corporation, Apollo and Brookfield to acquire Air Lease Corporation through a newly established entity, Sumisho Air Lease Corporation (Ireland) DAC.

The landmark agreement, which is due to close in the first half of 2026, will see the company renamed as Sumisho Air Lease Corporation.

Its order book is expected to transfer to SMBC Aviation Capital as part of the transaction, with the latter to act as servicer to the portfolio.

Leading SMBC Aviation Capital in the deal, valued at $7.4bn, is Peter Barrett, a veteran of the aircraft leasing industry who has been its chief executive for 21 years.

Barrett joins me over a video call from Budapest, where he is visiting customers. A few days earlier, he was in Vietnam.

These visits are a key part of his role for the company that leases and trades commercial jet aircraft to a diverse global customer base of over 150 airline and investors in more than 50 countries.

The aviation industry has endured a turbulent few years, with shocks including a worldwide pandemic and various unexpected geopolitical events.

How has Dublin-headquartered SMBC Aviation Capital, which currently has a fleet of 989 owned, managed and committed aircraft, adapted its business?

“I’m at this 35 years, so I remember the first Gulf War, the SARS crisis, 9/11 and the financial crisis. [Aviation is] a fantastic industry but given the scope and nature of it, it’s inevitably going to be impacted by events around the world.”

Covid, however, took the entire industry by surprise.

“Nobody, including ourselves, really modelled a world where aviation was shut down for over a year.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the events there mean it’s been a testing period . My philosophy since then has been ‘you can’t predict the future, but you can prepare for different eventualities’.”

Barrett says they are fortunate to be one of the best-capitalised of the big aircraft leasing companies, owned by a Japanese institution with one of the strongest credit ratings in the industry.

Ultimately, he adds, testing times allow for opportunities of growth and a chance to support customers.

“While aviation is cyclical, it is a consistently growing industry. As the world gets wealthier, as middle classes around the world grow, people want to travel.

“A big market for us is Mexico, which has a very strong, growing aviation low-cost market. If you have the choice of spending 36 hours on a bus or two hours on an airplane, if you can afford it you’ll obviously take the airplane and that’s a trend we see around the world.”

This growing appetite for convenient travel means potential for exponential expansion in the coming years.

Their young, predominantly narrow-body fleet has an average age of 5.64 years, which means they’re well equipped to meet customer requirements for modernity.

“It is a truly global business. So a 737 [aircraft] in Shanghai is the same as a 737 in Stockholm and a 737 in Sao Paulo. And that’s not true of most asset classes. Most assets are quite localised and the environment tends to be more fragmented,” Barrett says.

That doesn’t belie the intricacies of the business when it comes to transborder red tape, tax and legal systems as well as the sheer value of the aircraft and the highly complex nature of their systems.

Barrett describes their balance sheets as very large and says the funding cost of capital is an absolute competitive necessity.

“But the airplanes are the same everywhere in the world. And people recognise it as a global industry. So while there is complexity about it, and there are national and border issues, the fundamentals of what you’re trying to achieve in each jurisdiction or each market is fundamentally the same.”

He believes that, culturally, Irish people have an advantage in the business.

“I think people tend to see us as fairly neutral in that we don’t have any colonial past and we’re not a big player economically in the world, relatively speaking,” he says.

“I also think it’s really important that you try and understand and respect people’s cultures. They are different. They will do things differently. I won’t necessarily approach things the same way, but if you try to put yourself a little bit in their shoes, I think that makes a big difference.”

GROWTH

India, he says, has been a particular growth market for the company over recent years. He notes that the statistics there are “jaw-dropping”.

“[India has] 1.5 billion people, a huge continental country, an increasingly growing and mobile middle class, a road and rail network that is not up to the [job] of transport and moving people around the way that we need for a vibrant economy.

“So aviation has grown significantly. We’ve two very large customers there, Air India and IndiGo, the two biggest airlines in India.”

Colombia is another key area for the company, with an important customer in its national airline, Avianca.

“It’s just a very mountainous country. Building roads and railways is very difficult. So air travel is much more pragmatic,” he says.

Barrett is passionate about the business and firmly believes aviation is a force for good in both developed and developing economies.

“It drives economic activity. It supports businesses finding new customers and new markets. It supports tourism.

“I was in Vietnam meeting with the airlines there. They were very focused, because of the growth in manufacturing there over the last number of years, on cargo.”

While developing markets are full of promise, Barrett also emphasises the importance of their established customer base.

“Markets like North America and, indeed, Europe. While these are mature markets, they do need to replace older aircraft. Also, air travel is still growing there.”

SUSTAINABILITY

One aspect of the business increasingly under the spotlight is the need for increased industry-wide sustainability.

Barrett recognises the difficulties inherent in that change.

“Decarbonisation of aviation is going to be very difficult. It’s going to take a lot of time, it’s going to take a lot of effort and it’s going to be expensive. The most impactful thing we are doing today is helping customers replace less fuel-efficient aircraft [with] more fuelefficient aircraft, and that reduces the carbon footprint.

“Those numbers on an individual aircraft might be 10, 15 or 20 per cent. When you add all that up across lots of airplanes, it’s a meaningful number.”

The client Barrett is meeting in Budapest is getting their 250th aircraft. It’s brand new and considered one of the most per-seat efficient aircraft in the world.

“So you are talking about cycles of technology change here. There’s not going to be a 250-seater batterypowered aircraft in production today or tomorrow, and it probably won’t be for many decades to come. But there will be new-technology aircraft, probably towards the end of the next decade, and they will be even more efficient.”

As an industry there are aspects that they can change to reduce the carbon footprint, Barrett says, specifically around sustainable aviation fuel, operational efficiencies and air traffic control.

SMBC Aviation Capital has, in conjunction with Trinity College Dublin, opened a research facility which is looking at the processes for making sustainable aviation fuel.

“It is fantastic. In the overall scheme of things it’s relatively small, yeah, but I’m a passionate believer in an industry that does a lot of good in the world.

ANTICIPATING THE MARKET

While the financial markets might be key, Barrett says a prudent liability strategy is critical to success.

“We look at consumer demand and consumer trends. Post-Covid we see some evidence that consumers have reprioritised travel in their hierarchy of needs.”

They also closely track the manufacturers’ activity both in long-term strategy and short-term production.

With airframe and engine manufacturers all experiencing a variety of challenges over the last decade, it’s imperative to stay close to that side of the market too.

“I’m a reasonably avid reader of current affairs and the paper I open every morning is Financial Times. And every article you read is probably relevant to our industry, be it oil prices, the cost of money, geopolitics, technology, social trends and social behaviours. You need to keep a very broad radar and look at lots of different things to really manage the business.”

LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

Barrett’s leadership philosophy is straightforward.

“Leadership is a combination of things. Authenticity is very important, having a clear sense of where you’re going and being guided by your own lights. You can’t be flip-flopping on strategy, tactics or style.

“All of us as leaders have strengths and weaknesses. I’m very conscious of that. But being consistent and having an element of predictability and dependability is important for all your counterparts, be that your colleagues, customers or stakeholders.”

Communication, Barrett adds, is really important and one of the hardest things to get right in any job.

The chief executive advocates “playing the long game” as critically important in his industry.

“We buy 25-year assets, we write 12-year leases. You need to think about your business and what you’re doing as a leader, not in the context of today or tomorrow or next week, although obviously the short term is something you need to deal with. You always need to keep an eye on the long game. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”

Barrett credits this view as one of the strengths of their business and one of the reasons for the excellent partnership with their Japanese shareholders, who tend towards a long-term view.

Predictably, Barrett’s job entails an inordinate amount of travel.

“It’s an unusual life. I accept that. As you get older, it gets frankly more demanding physically. But I still enjoy it. And look, it’s a great pleasure and, indeed, privilege to travel around the world and meet really interesting people. I’m exceptionally fortunate in life. I would recommend it to anybody.”",https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/flying-high-LI.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:42.188599

Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.
Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.
Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.
This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.","After a $29.7 billion real-estate and tourism deal on the North Coast and a $200 million agreement to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), Qatar has finalised an agreement to supply Egypt with liquefied natural gas (LNG) during the summer months.

This is the most recent form of cooperation between the two countries after a year in which many important agreements were signed. Qatar announced in 2025 that it would dedicate a $7.5 billion investment package to Egypt, and in late 2025 Qatari investments in Egypt totalled around $3.2 billion across 266 companies.

Recent months have witnessed a noticeable strengthening of economic relations between Egypt and the Gulf states, particularly Qatar, which has begun diversifying its investment destinations across various countries worldwide, Farag Abdallah, an economist and member of the Egyptian Association for Political Economy, told Al-Ahram Weekly.

He noted that the global economy is experiencing imbalances due to rapid political developments, which in turn affect the movement of capital seeking to minimise risks and contribute to reshaping the global investment landscape.

Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.

In December 2025, Egypt received $3.5 billion from Qatari Diar, the real-estate arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, as part of an investment agreement for the development and expansion of the Samla and Al-Alam Al-Roum Project on the northwestern coast of Matrouh governorate, with total investments amounting to $29.7 billion.

Of this sum, Egypt received $3.2 billion representing the value of the land last week.

Qatar has recently been moving towards diversifying its investment portfolio, even if returns are lower than oil revenues, in anticipation of potential changes in the global economic system, Abdallah said. This has prompted it to invest in assets and minerals instead of retaining its oil revenues in US and European banks.

Abdallah said that Qatar had injected around $55 billion of investments into Turkey following the earthquake that struck the country a year and a half ago in an example of its trend to invest in assets. He noted that Egypt’s stable political and economic environment makes it well positioned to attract further investments.

Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.

He highlighted Egypt’s role in establishing the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum and transforming it into an intergovernmental organisation headquartered in Cairo, a development that has strengthened Egypt’s position as a gas trading hub and contributed to attracting major deals in gas liquefaction and re-export.

Qatar Energy announced that it will supply Egypt with up to 24 shipments of LNG during the summer of 2026, under an agreement signed between the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and the Qatari company.

The agreement comes as a continuation of the success of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the supply of LNG.

Karim Adel, president of the Al-Adl Centre for Economic and Strategic Studies, a think tank, told the Weekly that Egypt has a strong track record in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), relying on a system of tax exemptions, the availability of advanced basic and technological infrastructure, and efforts to remove obstacles facing the establishment of diverse business activities.

He explained that Egypt has become both a regional and a global hub due to its strength in key sectors, most notably agriculture and energy, supported by its unique geographical location and its role as the main gateway for business and investment in Africa.

Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.

He expects the coming period to see the implementation of a number of joint projects between the two sides, particularly in infrastructure development, energy, and transport, alongside the review of opportunities related to infrastructure and technology development.

Egypt and Qatar aim to achieve sustainable development and build a smart environment by focusing on mechanisms to realise sustainability and protect the environment in the light of global environmental challenges, he added.

The contribution of real-estate activities to Egypt’s economy has increased over recent years, reaching around 20 per cent of GDP. This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.

He said that maximising the economic returns from these investments depends on the speed with which agreed-upon real estate, tourism, and hotel projects can be implemented, given their role as a key driver for various economic sectors in Egypt, including transport and logistics, communications and technology, construction, tourism, and housing.",https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2026/1/11/41_2026-639037467040427814-42.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:57:49.220964

Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot on Sunday (January 11), Ambani told the conference about Reliance’s plans to spread the investment amount across 5 key commitments that have been listed as follows.

Investment and employment creation

Ambani hailed Reliance as the biggest private investor in Gujarat, having invested over ₹3.5 lakh crore in the state over the past five years. Ambani laid out employment creation as the company’s first commitment to the state through its ongoing and upcoming projects.

“We will double our precious investment of ₹3.5 lakh crore to ₹7 lakh crore over the next five years. This will create exponential employment, livelihoods, and prosperity for every Gujarati and every Indian,” he said at the conference. “For Reliance, Gujarat is our body, heart, and soul. We are a Gujarati company,” he added.

Global leadership in green energy

As a part of Reliance’s second commitment to the state, Ambani intends to establish Indian leadership in clean energy and green materials with Gujarat’s Jamnagar at the heart of his plans.

At Jamnagar, Reliance is building the world’s largest integrated clean energy ecosystem which includes manufacturing of solar power, battery energy storage, green hydrogen, green fertilisers, sustainable aviation fuel, maritime fuels, and advanced materials.

“Jamnagar, once the world’s largest exporter of hydrocarbon fuels, will in the coming years become India’s largest exporter of green energy and green materials,” Ambani proclaimed at the event.

Powering India’s growth story

Promising to produce a large amount of electric energy, Ambani said that Reliance’s multi-gigawatt, utility-scale solar project, among the largest in the world, will deliver round-the-clock clean power through advanced storage and modern grid integration aimed at powering India’s growth story.

Artificial intelligence

This appointment marks a key moment in the global push for decarbonisation, with Griffiths bringing his vast industry experience to lead the effort to scale SAF adoption worldwide.

Paul Griffiths at the Forefront of SAF Adoption

As the aviation sector continues to face increasing pressure to tackle its climate impact, SAF is recognised as one of the most viable near-term solutions to reduce flight emissions. SAF has the potential to cut emissions by up to 80%, offering a clear pathway for the aviation industry to meet its ambitious net-zero goals. However, despite its potential, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel supply. This gap underscores the need for concerted action to accelerate its production and adoption, which Griffiths will now champion through the SMI’s SAF Pathfinder Initiative.

The SAF Pathfinder Initiative, which Griffiths now leads, unites key stakeholders from across the aviation, energy, finance and policy sectors. Its primary focus is on mobilising investment, driving demand and advocating for harmonised global policies that support the production and adoption of SAF. Additionally, the initiative aims to facilitate the necessary infrastructure upgrades and foster collaboration across the supply chain to overcome the production and cost barriers that have hindered SAF’s widespread use.

Dubai Airports’ Proven Commitment to Sustainability

Paul Griffiths’ leadership in this initiative is backed by his strong track record in sustainability. Under his guidance, Dubai Airports has already made significant strides in reducing its environmental impact. The airport operator has achieved Level 4 “Transformation” accreditation from Airports Council International (ACI), a distinction that places Dubai Airports among the top 5% of airports globally for its sustainability efforts. This recognition highlights the effectiveness of Griffiths’ leadership in promoting sustainability and fostering collaborations with partners.

Dubai Airports has also been at the forefront of several initiatives to reduce emissions, including the implementation of biodiesel-powered ground fleets and the development of green infrastructure projects at both Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International (DWC). These initiatives align with the broader goals of the SAF Pathfinder Initiative, reinforcing Griffiths’ commitment to driving decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

Accelerating Global SAF Adoption

With the aviation industry’s 2050 net-zero target approaching, the need to scale up SAF production and usage has never been more urgent. Griffiths, alongside the SMI, is focused on creating the necessary conditions for SAF to play a central role in decarbonising aviation. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative will seek to unlock investment, overcome regulatory barriers and build a strong global network of stakeholders committed to SAF adoption.

Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, CEO of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, emphasised the importance of SAF as a catalyst for decarbonisation not only within aviation but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investments. With Griffiths’ proven leadership in the sustainability space, the SMI is poised to make significant strides in accelerating SAF adoption and driving the industry closer to a sustainable future.

As the global aviation sector looks ahead, the appointment of Paul Griffiths to lead the SAF Pathfinder Initiative signals a renewed commitment to sustainable aviation practices. Under his guidance, SAF is set to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry’s journey toward a low-carbon future, contributing to the global fight against climate change while helping to ensure the continued growth and success of the aviation sector.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sustainable-Aviation.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:00.328929

Under the partnership, NCC Bank will reduce emissions linked to its shipments by 30 per cent by using the GoGreen Plus service, which targets Scope 3 emissions. These are indirect emissions generated across a company’s value chain, including transportation and distribution.

The service uses an “insetting” approach that allows DHL to replace fossil fuels with Sustainable Aviation Fuel across its global network. Through a book-and-claim system, the resulting environmental benefits are allocated to customers investing in the solution, even if their individual shipments are not physically transported using aircraft powered by sustainable fuel.

GoGreen Plus is currently the only solution in the global express logistics sector that enables customers to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce emissions associated with their shipments.

Md Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said:

“We are thrilled to welcome NCC Bank to our GoGreen Plus initiative. By adopting sustainable aviation fuel, NCC Bank is taking a meaningful step toward reducing the environmental footprint of its shipments. Together, we can accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the air transport industry.”

DHL Express launched the GoGreen Plus service in 2023 to help customers reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from air freight through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The initiative is supported by long-term supply agreements with BP, Neste, Cosmo Energy and the Cathay Group.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is produced from alternative raw materials such as used cooking oil, waste and hydrogen, which have a lower-emission energy profile compared with conventional jet fuel derived from mineral oil.

The GoGreen Plus service supports DHL Group’s commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a focus on decarbonising air transportation, which accounts for the largest share of the group’s carbon footprint.",https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/2026-01/dhl.jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:49.362856

Hawai‘i is the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation. We rely on oil for about 65% of our electricity and spend billions of dollars annually on it.

This dependence has resulted in high electricity and transportation costs and exposure to supply and price volatility. This vulnerability underscores why clean energy should be framed as a fight for energy independence. Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Political scientist Jessica Green argues that climate politics is really a competition with trillions of dollars at stake. Fossil fuel asset owners are incentivized to delay the transition to protect their investments. Vulnerable asset owners face the consequences of climate change, e.g., property losses and higher insurance costs. Green asset owners are stakeholders whose assets gain value as the transition accelerates. We must consider these dynamics to accelerate progress.

Hawaiʻi already has many green asset owners. We have thousands of households with rooftop solar benefiting from reduced energy costs, owners of over 40,000 EVs on our roads converting gas to local electricity spending, and electric grids with 36% to 50% renewable energy. Importantly, electricians, installers, auditors, mechanics, engineers, and operators are also asset owners.

Our main fossil asset owner is Par Pacific, through its refinery and fuel distribution network. But it is already evolving, with part of the Kapolei refinery being converted to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines in 2026. This is what a practical transition looks like and an example of how fossil fuel assets can be repurposed while protecting our workforce and economic capacity and increasing energy independence.

Clearly, much more must be done to achieve our energy future. Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience. Each solution must perform its specific job well, prevent undesired consequences, and work with others so that the transition becomes self-reinforcing.

Here are a few priorities for our government and business leaders to consider in 2026:

Priority 1: Standardize and streamline permitting and modernize interconnection. This will speed up deployment of common projects (e.g., rooftop solar, EV chargers, batteries), prevent yearslong project delays for large grid-scale projects, and enable innovation in clean, firm power.

Priority 2: Scale green loans, rebates, and tax credits for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Incentivize the transition with close attention to our low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

Priority 3: Accelerate fleet electrification by deploying EV charging infrastructure and basing procurement on total cost of ownership, not just purchase price. This will ensure that our transportation goals are met and build general momentum for the transformation of our ground transportation system.

Priority 4: Fund workforce development programs to avoid worker capacity bottlenecks in clean tech, create career opportunities for our youth, and build economic resilience.

Priority 5: Create a carbon dividend program using our barrel tax. This would direct revenue to households, with additional support to those most exposed to energy price increases. This would protect households, provide businesses with certainty, and encourage investment in energy efficiency and clean transportation.

Priority 6: Publish a quarterly scorecard (with state, county, and utility inputs) to track progress on relevant metrics, e.g., rebate utilization, permit processing times, interconnection queue metrics, fleet and charger deployment, and household energy and fuel cost index.

Many of these changes can leverage federal grants, bonds and service-based delivery arrangements that don’t require upfront capital. Households and businesses can use PACE financing, solar leases, and community solar to convert capital expenditures into monthly energy and transportation costs at or below what they already pay.

We have a choice: the fossil asset corner, which means reliance on energy imports and vulnerability. Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi. The choice is clear.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/02/25135544/east-maui-windmills-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:06.095040

Their partnership marks Envision’s first net-zero energy project in Brazil and introduces AI-enabled renewable systems designed to support the country’s energy transition.

The three decade long agreement covers both turbine supply and a long-term strategic collaboration that could extend into data centre infrastructure and green hydrogen development.

Envision Energy's Chairman Lei Zhang and Mário Araripe, Founder of Casa dos Ventos witnessed the signing ceremony.

Henry Peng, Senior Vice President and President of Latin America and the European Region at Envision Energy, says: “Brazil has emerged as a global leader in renewable energy, with clean sources supplying nearly 90% of the country's electricity.

“As the government diversifies the energy mix, non-hydro renewables such as wind and solar are becoming a strategic pillar of Brazil's energy transition.

“As one of the earliest global renewable energy companies to invest in Brazil, our partnership with Casa dos Ventos goes far beyond turbine supply.

“We commit to explore topics such as AI-enabled, system-level net-zero solutions across wind, artificial intelligence data centres (AIDC), green hydrogen, energy storage and sustainable aviation fuel.

“Together, we aim to drive high-quality energy growth, strengthen local supply chains, accelerate emerging green industries and support Brazil's net-zero transition, creating new prosperity for Brazil and across Latin America.”

AI turbines connect energy and digital systems

Envision will supply customised 8.xMW Galileo AI wind turbines for the Casa dos Ventos project.

These units are among the largest single-capacity turbines installed in Brazil. The turbines run on Envision’s AI systems – the Tianshu Large Energy Model and Tianji Large Weather Model – designed to adjust for local resources, weather patterns and grid demands.

These models help boost reliability and output across the project’s lifetime. The turbines reflect Envision’s strategy of combining global wind system knowledge with local deployment conditions.

As part of the wider relationship, Envision and Casa dos Ventos may extend their partnership to areas beyond hardware, including asset management, green hydrogen and AIDC.

AIDC refers to data centres specifically built to support AI workloads, using energy-efficient designs and software to manage energy use, cooling and optimisation.

Lucas Araripe, Executive Director of Casa dos Ventos, says: “Our decision to partner with Envision is grounded in its leading technology, advanced AI capabilities and long-term commitment with Brazil as a strategic market.

“This collaboration will enable the delivery of high-quality, large-scale wind projects with reliability and performance, while accelerating the growth of emerging industries and attracting advanced technologies.

“Beyond supporting Brazil's energy transition and the expansion of the country's renewable energy matrix, the project will also generate lasting socio-economic benefits – bringing green jobs and development for several local communities.”

Broader net-zero infrastructure on the table

The wind deal follows several senior-level discussions between the two companies. In May 2025, Lei Zhang met Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in China to discuss Brazil’s energy transition, including net-zero parks, sustainable fuels and hydrogen. In September 2025, Mário and Lucas Araripe visited Envision to continue those talks.

This project introduces Envision’s broader net-zero infrastructure model to the region, including technical standards and scalable project approaches.

It creates a possible blueprint for large-scale green energy developments across Latin America and aligns with Brazil’s plan to strengthen domestic industries linked to renewable technologies.

Through this partnership, Envision signals its long-term interest in developing complete energy systems that combine wind, storage, digital management and industrial decarbonisation.

For the data centre industry, the inclusion of AIDC in the conversation highlights a shift toward integrating AI-ready infrastructure with green power generation.

By aligning wind capacity with data-driven management, the companies aim to support Brazil’s climate goals while also creating investment opportunities in future-proof sectors like green hydrogen and digital infrastructure.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/4ab466e10ee2b8c294087eac38ad000b:2f43a1b3b53589d89aaec335db3a3c7c/lei-zhang-envision-energy.webp.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 04:57:30.236454

Právě tento stát patří mezi přední producenty medu v Americe. Každoročně vyprodukoval zhruba 18 milionů kilogramů a přinesl včelařům zisk téměř 67 milionů dolarů (1,4 miliardy Kč).

Ráj se ovšem pomalu mění. Přirozené prostředí, na kterém život včel závisí, nahrazují plochy s kukuřicí a sójou. V Severní Dakotě se produkce kukuřice od přelomu století čtyřnásobně zvýšila na 16,5 milionu akrů (6,7 milionu hektarů). „Dříve jsme z jednoho úlu získávali 64 kilogramů medu,“ říká Miller. Jeho včelstvo však slábne, letos získal v průměru 15 kilogramů.

Za razantním úbytkem českého medu stojí i novodobí „bio-chovatelé“, říká včelař

Podle předběžné analýzy organizace Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) v loňském roce američtí včelaři přišli o více než polovinu svých včelstev. „Naše odhady naznačují, že včelařské provozy v USA ztratily během sezony 2024–25 více včelstev než v kterémkoli jiném roce v historii záznamů,“ uvedla organizace.

Poptávka po biopalivech

Kromě nemocí a používání pesticidů experti označují za problematickou aktuální poptávku po biopalivech. Jejich výroba z kukuřice a sóji totiž vede k přeměně přírodních travnatých ploch na monokultury, což ohrožuje včelí populace a narušuje rovnováhu místních ekosystémů, napsala agentura Bloomberg.

V loňském roce vzrostla americká výrobní kapacita biopaliv z 5 000 na 30 000 barelů denně. Spotřeba biopaliv, včetně těch leteckých, se pravděpodobně bude zvyšovat, a to kvůli rostoucí poptávce po letecké dopravě, poklesu používání tradičních fosilních paliv a také politickým iniciativám a regulacím.

Udržitelné létání je chiméra. Alternativy paliv klimatu nepomohou, říká studie

Jednou z nich je iniciativa Joe Bidena z roku 2021, která měla za cíl podpořit výrobu udržitelných leteckých paliv (SAF) ve Spojených státech a která nabídla producentům biopaliv daňové úlevy na podporu produkce.

Podle analýzy vědeckého pracovníka Bradena Limba z Colorado State University je pro splnění cílů SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) do roku 2050 potřeba o 50 procent více orné půdy pro kukuřici a sóju.

„Maximální množství půdy, které jsme v jednom roce přeměnili na ornou půdu, což je přibližně 0,73 hektarů, by muselo být zčtyřnásobeno každý rok po dobu příštích 30 let,“ řekl Limb. Podle něj sója a kukuřice nejsou optimálním řešením. Limb doporučuje zaměřit se na jiné plodiny, jako je čirok nebo ozdobnice.

Letecké společnosti zkoumají různé možnosti ke snížení emisí, včetně SAF. Průmysl se zavázal k používání biopaliv a Mezinárodní organizace pro civilní letectví (ICL) přijala ambiciózní cíl dosáhnout nulových čistých emisí uhlíku do roku 2050, což by vyžadovalo značné vstupy biopaliv.

Známe recept na snížení emisí. Létejte pomaleji, radí univerzitní studie

„Obávám se, že k udržitelným leteckým palivům nepřipojíme environmentální etiku. Pokud bychom správně připojili environmentální měřítka a výsledky k platbám za daňové úlevy, mohli bychom pohnout věcí na podporu zemědělců při přijetí praktik, které zvýší rozmanitost krajiny,“ zmínila Katrina Klettová, doktorandka na minnesotské univerzitě, která studuje změny ve využívání půdy a zdraví včel medonosných.

Někteří odborníci nicméně upozorňují, že produkce udržitelných leteckých paliv může být příliš drahá.

The aviation industry is in the middle of an uncomfortable transition. Airlines need more efficient engines to survive brutal fuel costs and carbon regulations, while passengers still expect cheap tickets and on-time flights. Engine OEMs sit squarely in the crosshairs of this tension. MTU Aero Engines has quietly positioned itself as one of the most important enablers of this new era: a specialist in high-efficiency engine modules, lifecycle services, and next-generation propulsion research that airlines and airframers increasingly cannot ignore.

Unlike headline-grabbing aircraft manufacturers, MTU Aero Engines focuses on what really keeps jets in the air: high-pressure compressors, low-pressure turbines, turbine center frames, and the complex maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) ecosystem around them. Its technology is inside some of the most widely used engines on the planet, particularly in the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan (GTF) family. As the aviation sector scrambles to cut emissions while ramping back to—and beyond—pre-pandemic traffic levels, MTU Aero Engines has become a leverage point for efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.

Inside the Flagship: MTU Aero Engines

MTU Aero Engines is not a single consumer-facing product but an integrated portfolio of propulsion technologies and services that underpin modern fleets. Its core proposition: design and manufacture mission-critical modules for commercial and military engines, then stay embedded throughout the lifecycle with high-value MRO offerings and digital services. That combination of hardware and recurring-services revenue is what makes MTU Aero Engines strategically important—and hard to dislodge.

On the hardware side, MTU Aero Engines has three standout pillars:

1. Geared Turbofan Leadership

MTU is a key partner in Pratt & Whitneys PW1000G geared turbofan family, used on aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A220, and Embraer E-Jets E2. In this program, MTU Aero Engines is responsible for major components including the high-speed low-pressure turbine and parts of the high-pressure compressor, as well as being a risk- and revenue-sharing partner.

The GTF architecture uses a reduction gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure turbine. This allows each section to spin at its optimal speed, delivering:

Double-digit reductions in fuel burn compared with previous-generation engines.

Significantly lower noise footprints, crucial for airport community acceptance.

Substantial CO2 and NOx emissions reductions.

MTU Aero Engines engineering and manufacturing capabilities are woven into the most efficiency-critical parts of this system. When airlines choose GTF-powered aircraft for better economics and environmental performance, MTU Aero Engines indirectly wins.

2. High-Pressure Compressors and Turbines

Across multiple engine families from partners like Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines contributes high-pressure compressor (HPC) and turbine modules. These components operate at extreme temperatures and pressures, and incremental gains in efficiency directly translate into lower fuel burn.

Key technical areas where MTU Aero Engines differentiates:

Advanced materials and cooling to withstand rising turbine inlet temperatures as OEMs chase better thermodynamic efficiency.

Aerodynamic optimization of compressor stages using high-fidelity simulations and digital twin concepts.

Lightweight design balancing durability and lifecycle cost with weight savings that airlines can monetize on every flight.

3. Military Propulsion and European Sovereignty

On the defense side, MTU Aero Engines is a significant player in European engine programs, including roles in the Eurofighter Typhoon and future fighter systems. This provides not just revenue diversification but also positions the company as a key asset in Europes push for technological sovereignty in defense and aerospace.

Lifecycle and MRO as a Strategic Product

In aviation, the engine is sold once but serviced for decades. MTU Aero Engines MRO network is effectively a product of its own: a bundled offering of overhaul, repair, parts management, and data-driven optimization for airlines and lessors.

Highlights include:

Global MRO footprint for narrowbody and regional jet engines, including GTF, V2500, CF34, and others.

Predictive maintenance based on engine health monitoring, using sensor data and analytics to reduce unplanned downtime.

Customized service packages that let airlines pay per flight hour, shifting capex to opex and reducing financial risk.

In a market where reliability issues and groundings can devastate airline schedules and P&L, this lifecycle capability is a core part of MTU Aero Engines value proposition.

Betting on Sustainable Aviation

Crucially, MTU Aero Engines is not just optimizing todays kerosene-based engines. The company is investing in:

SAF compatibility and combustion technologies that work with sustainable aviation fuel blends.

Water-Enhanced Turbofan (WET) concepts, aimed at further cutting fuel burn and emissions by recovering waste heat and using water injection.

Hydrogen-ready and hybrid-electrical studies in cooperation with European partners, exploring how future engines can radically reduce climate impact.

This pipeline matters because airlines and regulators are signaling that incremental efficiency gains wont be enough in the 2030s and 2040s. MTU Aero Engines long-game here is to stay indispensable as propulsion architectures evolve.

Market Rivals: MTU Aktie vs. The Competition

MTU Aero Engines operates in a tightly held club. In commercial and military jet engines, a handful of giants dominate: General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt & Whitney (Raytheon Technologies) are the best-known names. But MTU has carved out a role as a specialized partner and module supplier that competes and cooperates with these players simultaneously.

Compared directly to General Electrics LEAP program (through CFM International, the joint venture of GE Aerospace and Safran), MTU Aero Engines takes a different stance in the value chain. LEAP is a full engine family powering aircraft like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. GE-Safran fully control the engine product, brand, and aftermarket.

By contrast, MTU Aero Engines participates as a major risk- and revenue-sharing partner in the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM and related PW1000G variants rather than owning a standalone engine franchise. The trade-off:

Lower program control than GE over the entire engine.

Lower capital intensity and more diversified exposure across different platforms and OEM partners.

Strong MRO leverage thanks to its module expertise and joint ventures.

On the narrowbody workhorse battlefield, LEAP and the PW1000G family are direct rivals. Engine selection campaigns at Airbus and Boeing become indirect competitive arenas for MTU Aero Engines versus CFM, even if MTU logos are not on the nacelles.

Compared directly to Rolls-Royce Trent engines such as the Trent XWB

Rolls-Royce plays heavily in the widebody segment with its Trent family. The Trent XWB powers the Airbus A350 and has built a strong reputation for efficiency on long-haul routes. Rolls-Royce, however, is more concentrated in widebodies and has faced well-documented earnings volatility due to that segments cyclical nature and pandemic exposure.

MTU Aero Engines exposure is more balanced, with a stronger tilt towards narrowbodies and regional jets—segments that typically recover faster and offer higher frequency usage, which in turn means more predictable MRO revenues. The company also cooperates with Rolls-Royce on some military and industrial programs, again illustrating its hybrid role as both collaborator and competitor in different niches.

Safran and the European industrial ecosystem

Safran, via CFM International, is another direct competitor in the module and MRO space. Compared to Safran, MTU Aero Engines is smaller but more focused. Safran stretches across landing gear, interiors, avionics, and more, while MTU doubles down on propulsion and services.

This specialization lets MTU Aero Engines invest deeply in compressor and turbine technology without diluting R&D over too many product lines. In an era of stricter emissions targets and complex new materials, such focus is strategically valuable.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

MTU Aero Engines doesnt dominate headlines—but it punches above its weight by being in the right places of the propulsion stack.

1. Technology where it really counts

The companys strengths in high-pressure compressors, turbines, and low-pressure turbine modules give it leverage over the single biggest cost line for airlines: fuel. Every fractional percentage of efficiency MTU Aero Engines squeezes out of those stages translates into tangible savings and lower emissions. While full-engine OEMs grab the marketing glory, MTU sits in the value-dense heart of the machine.

2. Risk-sharing rather than winner-takes-all bets

Instead of betting the entire company on one engine family, MTU Aero Engines spreads its exposure as a partner on multiple platforms. That diversification has strategic benefits:

Resilience if one engine type faces technical or regulatory setbacks.

Access to long-term service revenues across different fleets and regions.

Stable relationships with multiple global OEMs instead of dependence on a single prime contractor.

3. Recurring revenue through MRO and digital services

Aircraft engines are one of the most service-intensive components in aviation. MTU Aero Engines MRO infrastructure is a structural advantage: it locks in customers for decades, creates data flywheels (more engines serviced equals better insight into wear patterns and failure modes), and supports incremental product improvements without waiting for full engine redesigns.

As airlines adopt power-by-the-hour models and seek predictable maintenance cost envelopes, MTU Aero Engines ability to bundle hardware, services, and analytics becomes a core differentiator.

4. Future-ready innovation in sustainable propulsion

Aviations climate problem wont be solved by tweaking existing engines alone. MTU Aero Engines work on Water-Enhanced Turbofans, SAF-ready combustion, hydrogen studies, and hybrid-electric concepts positions it not just as a participant in the current generation of engines, but as an enabler of what comes next.

Compared to more diversified conglomerates, the company can aim its R&D laser directly at propulsion, rather than competing internally for capital against non-aviation divisions.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

MTU Aktie (ISIN DE000A0D9PT0) is effectively a liquid proxy on the future of high-efficiency commercial and military propulsion, plus the aviation aftermarket. As of the latest market data available from multiple financial sources, MTU Aero Engines share price reflects a combination of cyclical aviation demand, program-specific headlines (notably around the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan), and long-term bets on sustainable propulsion.

Stock snapshot and performance context

Using real-time data from at least two major financial platforms, the most recent trading information shows MTU Aktie around its current market level with the quoted price and performance based on the last available trading session. Where markets are closed, investors rely on the last close price as the reference point. That price bakes in:

Short-term sentiment around engine reliability issues on specific fleets and how those impact MTUs MRO volumes and warranty exposure.

Medium-term expectations for narrowbody and regional jet recovery, where MTU Aero Engines has strong positioning.

Long-term optimism about the companys role in GTF evolutions, European defense programs, and next-generation sustainable propulsion.

How the product portfolio feeds into valuation

From an investor lens, MTU Aero Engines product and technology footprint translates into several key drivers for MTU Aktie:

Embeddedness in key fleets – participation in major narrowbody platforms via GTF and legacy programs provides a long runway of flight hours and, therefore, service revenue.

MRO as a stabilizer – even during downturns, engines must be maintained. That makes the aftermarket a partial hedge against new-build volatility.

Upside from sustainability – if regulators tighten emissions rules faster than expected, demand for more efficient engines and upgrades accelerates. MTU Aero Engines stands to benefit from that pressure rather than be harmed by it.

Defense diversification – military engine and service programs provide counter-cyclical ballast, smoothing the earnings profile that underpins MTU Aktie.

In other words, when investors buy MTU Aktie, they are not just buying a German industrial name; they are buying into a specific thesis: that propulsion will remain the choke point of aviation efficiency and that MTU Aero Engines will stay at the center of that bottleneck, monetizing both incremental improvements and disruptive shifts.

The bottom line

MTU Aero Engines is not the flashiest brand in aviation, but it is one of the most strategically placed. Its mix of high-value engine modules, deep MRO infrastructure, and credible R&D roadmap for sustainable propulsion gives it a competitive edge against more vertically integrated giants. For airlines, that translates into better fuel economics and lifecycle reliability. For investors in MTU Aktie, it represents a focused, technology-driven way to participate in the next chapters of global aviation.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405041_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 01:57:37.922582

Rising electricity demand, climate imperatives, and shifting global energy markets are converging at a moment when decisions taken today will shape our economic resilience, competitiveness, and energy security for decades to come.

For a country that depends on imported fuels for close to 90 per cent of its energy needs, the global energy landscape is not an abstract concern — it is felt directly in electricity bills, transportation costs, food prices, and the overall cost of living. The challenge therefore is clear: How do we secure reliable, affordable energy today while building a cleaner more sustainable system for tomorrow?

Emerging from a year marked by price volatility, geopolitical shocks, and seismic swings in global market sentiment, Jamaica’s oil and gas sector enters 2026 with cautious optimism, aided by growing confidence in emerging energy-source options and the continued rise in electricity demand.

Internationally, the oil and gas market remains volatile. Geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and shifting trade policies continue to inject uncertainty into price forecasts. While analysts expect only modest demand growth in 2026, supply dynamics and geopolitical risks mean that price stability is far from guaranteed.

For Jamaica, this volatility matters. Our energy security is tightly linked to global markets, and we are therefore exposed to shocks beyond our control. As the country’s primary petroleum supplier, Petrojam carries a national responsibility to ensure reliable fuel supply, even in turbulent global conditions. At the same time, we are accelerating efforts to reduce carbon intensity and support the country’s long-term transition to cleaner energy.

ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO WATCH IN 2026

Renewable energy is poised to continue its growth as one of the world’s fast-growing energy sources, and Jamaica is firmly aligned with this trend. Solar and wind already play an important role in our electricity mix and further expansion is expected.

Petrojam is pursuing multiple initiatives to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix aligned to the country’s move towards cleaner, more sustainable energy. Petrojam is also playing an enabling role in facilitating the adoption and blending of low-carbon fuels, and helping to create the necessary infrastructure and regulatory alignment to accelerate this transition to cleaner energy.

While not a renewable, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is emerging as a critical transition fuel for Jamaica. It offers lower emissions than heavy fuel oil and diesel, greater price stability, and strong potential for use across electricity generation, manufacturing, and public transportation.

Petrojam is positioning itself to play a key role in LNG supply and distribution, supporting the shift of power generation and industrial users to cleaner fuels. LNG will be a key bridge between today’s petroleum-based system and tomorrow’s low-carbon energy future.

Advanced biofuels derived from sustainable biomass, agricultural residues, and solid waste are also gaining traction globally. These fuels offer real potential to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors.

Of note is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can significantly lower the carbon footprint of air travel. As a major tourism destination and aviation hub, Jamaica stands to benefit strategically from early engagement in SAF development. Renewable diesel and green methanol for marine transport are also emerging opportunities as the shipping sector moves toward decarbonisation.

EMERGING FRONTIERS: NUCLEAR AND HYDROGEN

Globally, there is renewed interest in nuclear energy, particularly as a reliable, carbon-free base load power source for energy-intensive activities such as data centres supporting artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Advances in small modular reactors (SMRs) are making nuclear more accessible to smaller economies.

In Jamaica, nuclear energy remains at the exploratory stage. Petrojam has been invited to be a part of the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences (ICENS) Working Group, which is examining the potential role of nuclear in a low-carbon energy future, including its application in electricity generation and pink hydrogen production (hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water using nuclear energy).

Nuclear energy offers low operating costs and high reliability once online, delivering large volumes of carbon-free electricity at stable and predictable prices. By reducing exposure to fuel price volatility it has the potential to support economic development and help level the playing field between high- and low-income countries.

Meaningful consideration of nuclear must be balanced and aligned with safety standards, regulatory readiness, waste management, and public acceptance. The objective at this stage is knowledge preparedness and informed national dialogue.

ENERGY SUBSTITUTION: A GRADUAL REALITY

While the global conversation often suggests rapid substitution away from fossil fuels, the reality for small, developing economies is more complex. Infrastructure constraints, financing requirements, and the need for system reliability mean that energy transition must be carefully managed.

For Jamaica, the path forward is not abrupt replacement but strategic diversification — layering renewables, LNG, and emerging fuels alongside existing petroleum supply to ensure reliability, affordability, and resilience.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance is no longer optional; it is increasingly a prerequisite for attracting capital, maintaining regulatory credibility, and building public trust.

In 2026 Petrojam will be further strengthening its ESG framework, with particular focus on reducing our carbon footprint, enhancing transparency, and improving governance systems. As Jamaica explores offshore oil potential, a strong ESG foundation will be essential to guide responsible development, environmental protection, and stakeholder confidence.

JAMAICA’S REGIONAL ROLE

Beyond domestic supply, Petrojam continues to support regional energy resilience through trade. By refining and supplying high-quality fuels to Caricom member states, we contribute to economic stability and regional integration. 2026 presents an opportunity to further define Jamaica’s role as a regional energy hub- leveraging our infrastructure, logistics capability, and strategic location to support neighbouring economies.

Jamaica’s energy future will be determined not only by technology choices, but by the value we deliver, the depth of our sustainability efforts, and the speed at which we adapt. The energy transition is not just an environmental imperative — it is an economic strategy, a competitiveness issue, and a national resilience priority.

Petrojam stands at the centre of this transition, repositioning to become Jamaica’s multi-energy innovator supporting renewables, advancing LNG, enabling biofuels and SAF, and preparing for emerging technologies. By acting early, building digital and operational resilience, forging strategic alliances, and staying ahead of global energy trends, Jamaica can secure a future that is cleaner, more affordable, and more resilient.

The decisions we take in 2026 will shape our energy security for a generation. If we get them right, Jamaica will not only meet its energy needs but will lead in building a modern, sustainable energy system for the Caribbean.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/image_1-193-1024x576.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 00:56:37.048948

As the world acknowledges that reducing emissions alone will not solve climate change, carbon capture has become essential infrastructure for a sustainable future. These ten startups represent the cutting edge of technologies designed to either prevent industrial emissions from reaching the atmosphere or remove carbon dioxide that is already there.

Understanding carbon capture requires recognizing it encompasses multiple approaches. Point-source capture attaches to industrial facilities like cement plants or steel mills where emissions are concentrated. Direct air capture extracts carbon dioxide from ambient air where it exists at just over four hundred parts per million. Other methods accelerate natural mineralization processes or use biological systems to sequester carbon. Each approach has distinct advantages regarding cost, energy requirements, storage permanence, and scalability.

1. Climeworks: Direct Air Capture Pioneer

Climeworks has become synonymous with direct air capture technology, operating the world’s largest facilities for removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The Swiss company’s technology uses large fans to draw air through filters containing materials that selectively bind with carbon dioxide molecules. Once saturated, the system heats these filters to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage or utilization.

The company’s Orca and Mammoth facilities in Iceland, developed in partnership with Carbfix, represent the state of the art in permanent carbon removal. They capture carbon dioxide from the air and inject it deep underground into basalt rock formations where it mineralizes into solid carbonate within a few years. This permanence addresses a critical challenge in carbon removal by ensuring captured carbon cannot leak back into the atmosphere.

Climeworks has attracted major corporate customers including Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify who purchase carbon removal credits. While costs remain high, the company has demonstrated a clear pathway for price reductions as production scales, similar to how solar panel costs declined dramatically over decades of manufacturing improvements.

2.Carbon Engineering: Synthetic Fuels from Air

Carbon Engineering pursues direct air capture with a focus on creating useful products rather than just storing carbon underground. The Canadian company, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Occidental Petroleum, captures atmospheric carbon dioxide and combines it with hydrogen to create synthetic liquid fuels suitable for vehicles and aircraft.

This approach addresses aviation’s unique challenge. Unlike automobiles that can transition to batteries, aircraft require energy-dense liquid fuels for long-distance flight. Carbon Engineering’s fuels are essentially carbon-neutral because emissions from burning them equal the carbon captured from air to make them, creating a closed loop rather than adding new atmospheric carbon.

The company’s first commercial-scale facility in Texas aims to demonstrate that synthetic fuels can compete economically with conventional petroleum. This project represents a crucial test of whether direct air capture can move beyond niche applications into mainstream energy markets.

3. Carbfix: Permanent Mineralization Storage

Carbfix accelerates a natural geological process that ordinarily takes thousands of years. The Icelandic company injects carbon dioxide dissolved in water deep underground into basalt rock formations where it reacts with minerals to form stable carbonates. Essentially, they convert gaseous pollution into permanent stone.

The elegance of this approach lies in its security. Once mineralized, carbon cannot leak back regardless of surface conditions, unlike storage in porous reservoirs where gas might escape through geological faults. The transformation is chemical and permanent, requiring extreme heat to reverse.

While Carbfix benefits from Iceland’s unique geology and abundant geothermal energy, the company works to demonstrate that similar basalt formations exist worldwide. Partnerships with Climeworks and industrial emitters showcase the technology’s versatility for both air-captured and point-source carbon.

4. Charm Industrial: Agricultural Waste to Carbon Storage

Charm Industrial recognized that agricultural waste represents carbon recently pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Rather than letting crop residues decompose and release this carbon, Charm converts them into stable bio-oil through pyrolysis, then permanently stores this liquid underground.

The company collects agricultural residues like corn stalks and forest thinnings, heats them in low-oxygen environments, and produces carbon-rich bio-oil suitable for geological storage. This approach addresses multiple challenges simultaneously by providing waste management solutions for farmers while creating carbon removal revenue streams.

Charm’s distributed model uses mobile pyrolysis units transported to biomass sources, avoiding expensive centralized infrastructure and transportation emissions. The company has delivered carbon removal credits to corporate buyers and continues expanding across agricultural regions.

5. LanzaTech: Microbes Transform Industrial Emissions

LanzaTech developed a biological carbon capture approach using engineered microorganisms that consume carbon-rich industrial waste gases and convert them into valuable chemicals and fuels. The process resembles industrial-scale fermentation where specialized bacteria metabolize carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from steel mills or chemical plants.

The company captures gases that would otherwise be flared or vented, flowing them through bioreactors containing proprietary bacteria that produce ethanol and other chemicals. This ethanol becomes fuel or building blocks for plastics, cosmetics, and textiles. Major brands including Zara and Lululemon have incorporated LanzaTech materials into their products.

With commercial facilities operating across China, India, and Belgium, LanzaTech has proven that captured industrial carbon can genuinely compete with virgin fossil resources in global supply chains while generating economic value beyond environmental benefits.

6. Heirloom Carbon: Enhanced Mineral Weathering

Heirloom Carbon Technologies accelerates mineral weathering, a natural process where rocks absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide over geological timescales. The company speeds this from thousands of years to days using engineered limestone materials optimized for carbon uptake.

The process crushes limestone into fine powder spread across trays exposed to air. High surface area enables rapid carbon dioxide absorption. Once saturated, Heirloom heats the material using renewable energy to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage while regenerating the limestone for reuse.

By working with abundant, well-understood materials already produced at massive scales for construction and agriculture, Heirloom taps into existing supply chains rather than building entirely new industrial ecosystems. The company has demonstrated its technology in California and attracted significant climate investment.

7. Verdox: Electrochemical Carbon Capture

Emerging from Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, Verdox developed an electrochemical approach that dramatically reduces energy requirements compared to conventional thermal processes. Instead of using heat to release captured carbon dioxide, the technology uses electricity to switch specialized materials between carbon-absorbing and carbon-releasing states.

The company’s capture cells contain electrode materials that bind carbon dioxide when voltage flows in one direction and release it when reversed. This electrochemical swing requires significantly less energy than heating materials to high temperatures and runs on renewable electricity rather than requiring heat sources.

Verdox targets industrial facilities with concentrated carbon dioxide streams in exhaust gases, focusing initially on cement plants, steel mills, and other heavy industrial sources difficult to decarbonize through other means. The company has raised substantial funding and works toward commercial-scale demonstration projects.

8. CarbonCure Technologies: Carbon-Storing Concrete

CarbonCure developed an elegantly simple approach by injecting carbon dioxide into concrete during mixing. The carbon reacts with calcium in cement to form calcium carbonate minerals that permanently embed in the concrete while improving compressive strength.

This addresses a crucial challenge since concrete production generates roughly eight percent of global emissions yet remains essential for construction. CarbonCure enables concrete producers to reduce cement content while simultaneously storing captured carbon dioxide. The mineralized carbon becomes part of building structures for their entire lifespan.

The technology retrofits onto existing concrete mixing equipment with minimal workflow changes, enabling rapid adoption across hundreds of facilities. Major projects by Microsoft and Amazon have incorporated CarbonCure concrete, demonstrating market acceptance for carbon-storing building materials.

9. Running Tide: Ocean-Based Carbon Sequestration

Running Tide enhances natural ocean carbon cycles through systems that deploy biomass into deep waters for long-term sequestration. Founded by commercial fishermen and engineers, the company grows kelp and other fast-growing biomass, then sinks it to ocean depths where extremely slow decomposition rates keep carbon stored for centuries or millennia.

The approach also incorporates alkalinity enhancement using limestone to counteract ocean acidification while enhancing carbon storage potential. Running Tide conducts extensive monitoring using autonomous vessels and sensors to verify carbon sequestration and avoid unintended ecological impacts.

Ocean-based carbon removal faces unique verification challenges since tracking deep ocean carbon is inherently difficult. Running Tide has invested heavily in developing monitoring methodologies that provide confidence to carbon credit buyers while satisfying scientific scrutiny.

10. Twelve: Electrochemical Carbon Conversion

Twelve developed an electrochemical process converting carbon dioxide and water into useful chemicals including ethylene for plastics and jet fuel components. The technology uses renewable electricity to drive chemical reactions that transform captured carbon into products replacing those currently made from fossil fuels.

The company’s reactors employ specialized catalysts and electrode designs to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into target molecules. This represents circular carbon use where the same atoms cycle through the economy multiple times rather than following a one-way path from underground reserves to the atmosphere.

Partnerships with Alaska Airlines for sustainable aviation fuel and consumer goods companies demonstrate that carbon-based products can meet quality standards of conventional fossil-derived materials while offering superior environmental profiles.

The Future of Carbon Capture

These ten companies represent diverse philosophies for addressing the same urgent challenge: removing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide and preventing new emissions. Some focus on permanent geological or mineralized storage, others pursue utilization pathways creating economic value, and still others enhance natural carbon cycling processes.

This diversity reflects reality. No single solution will address the massive scale of climate challenges. We will likely need all these technologies deployed across different contexts where each approach’s particular strengths align with local conditions and requirements. Direct air capture suits locations with abundant renewable energy and suitable geology. Point-source capture fits industries continuing emissions during energy transition. Utilization pathways create economic incentives accelerating deployment.",https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Just-Explore-27.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:54.153039

Jakarta, HAI SAWIT – Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional atau International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resmi menyetujui limbah cair sawit sebagai bahan baku bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan pada akhir November 2025 lalu.

Keputusan besar ini menempatkan Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) sebagai instrumen kunci mitigasi emisi aviasi global. Indonesia kini memiliki peluang besar menjadi produsen utama bahan bakar pesawat rendah karbon dunia.

Dilansir dari laman Indonesia Palm Oil Strategic Studies (IPOSS), Minggu (11/01/2026), proses pengakuan ini memakan waktu satu tahun melalui pengusulan nilai ambang batas emisi karbon pada dokumen resmi Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Keunggulan Emisi POME

Data teknis menunjukkan keunggulan signifikan limbah cair sawit dalam menekan polusi udara dari sektor penerbangan. Berikut adalah fakta angka hasil perhitungan yang telah disetujui secara internasional:

Nilai emisi POME ditetapkan sebesar 18.1 gCO2e/MJ.

Angka tersebut 79,6 persen lebih rendah daripada emisi avtur fosil konvensional.

POME kini berstatus bahan bakar aviasi rendah karbon bersertifikat internasional.

Pertumbuhan penumpang pesawat global yang diprediksi menembus 8 miliar orang pada 2041 memicu lonjakan emisi luar biasa. Tanpa intervensi bahan bakar hijau, emisi sektor aviasi bisa mencapai 21,2 gigaton karbon dioksida.

Indonesia sendiri memproyeksikan jumlah penumpang mencapai 390 juta orang pada 2037. Kondisi ini menuntut penyesuaian cepat terhadap standar penerbangan berkelanjutan melalui pemanfaatan potensi industri Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) nasional secara masif.

Peran Strategis IPOSS dan Tripatra

Keberhasilan ini merupakan hasil kolaborasi teknis antara pemerintah dengan berbagai pihak pendukung. IPOSS bertindak selaku lembaga pemikir kebijakan sawit yang mengawal perhitungan nilai emisi hingga negosiasi pada tingkat teknis di markas ICAO.

Sementara itu, Tripatra berperan melakukan penghitungan nilai Life Cycle Emissions (LCA) serta menyusun rencana investasi perdana pembuatan SAF berbasis POME. Langkah ini memastikan setiap data teknis memiliki bukti akurat yang dapat diterima dunia.

Persetujuan internasional ini memberikan landasan regulasi kuat bagi implementasi mandatori SAF pada industri penerbangan domestik maupun internasional. Indonesia memiliki modal bahan baku beragam yang sudah diakui secara global saat ini.

Selain POME, bahan baku lain seperti minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) menjadi tumpuan. Gabungan potensi ini mampu menyuplai kebutuhan bahan bakar pesawat dalam jumlah besar.

Total potensi suplai mencapai 2 hingga 3 juta kiloliter SAF.

Pemerintah mendorong implementasi mandatori sebesar 5 persen pada tahun 2030.

Maskapai kini lebih mudah mengklaim pengurangan emisi melalui skema CORSIA.

Limbah sawit yang sebelumnya terbuang kini berubah menjadi komoditas sarat devisa bagi negara. Pemanfaatan POME sebagai bahan baku SAF secara hukum internasional kini sudah sah dan memiliki kepastian pasar jangka panjang.

Strategi ini memperkuat posisi Indonesia dalam persaingan energi hijau global di masa depan. Sertifikasi rendah karbon ini sekaligus menepis anggapan negatif mengenai keberlanjutan produk turunan kelapa sawit di mata masyarakat internasional.***

TARAKAN – Dukungan Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) unit di bawah Kementerian Keuangan yang mengelola dana perkebun terhadap sektor hilir, kembali nyata dirasakan di Bumi Benuanta.

Melalui kemitraan strategis, BPDP menyokong penuh gelaran Workshop Pengolahan Minyak dan Limbah Kelapa Sawit bagi UMKM yang dilaksanakan di Ballroom Hotel Lotus Panaya, Jumat (9/1/26).

Kegiatan ini dihadiri jajaran petinggi daerah, termasuk Kepala Dinas Pertanian dan Ketahanan Pangan Kaltara, Ir. Heri Rudiyono, M.Si, serta Kepala Disperindagkop UKM Kaltara, Dr. Hj. Hasriyani, SH., MM, bersama puluhan petani dan pelaku usaha kecil dari berbagai kabupaten/kota.

Ketua Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah (DPW) APKASINDO Kaltara, Muhammad Khoiruddin, menekankan dukungan BPDP adalah momentum emas bagi petani sawit Kaltara untuk berhenti menjadi “penonton” di tanah sendiri.

“Kami di DPW APKASINDO Kaltara melihat bahwa selama ini petani kita terlalu bergantung pada fluktuasi harga TBS (Tandan Buah Segar). Dengan dukungan BPDPKS dalam workshop ini, kita ingin mengubah pola pikir itu. Petani harus mulai melirik potensi hilirisasi. Jangan hanya menjual buah mentah, kita harus mampu mengolahnya menjadi minyak goreng atau produk turunan lainnya dalam skala UMKM,” tegas Khoiruddin.

Ia juga menambahkan Kaltara memiliki potensi CPO dan PKO yang sangat melimpah, namun belum tergarap maksimal oleh tangan-tangan lokal.

“Masalah utama kita adalah teknologi dan pengetahuan. Lewat workshop ini, kami ingin memastikan UMKM di Kaltara punya daya saing. Kita ingin di masa depan, ada merek minyak goreng lokal atau pupuk organik hasil limbah sawit asli produksi petani Kaltara yang beredar di pasar. Ini bukan sekadar pelatihan, ini adalah langkah menuju kedaulatan ekonomi petani sawit,” imbuhnya.

Senada dengan hal tersebut, Sekretaris Jenderal (Sekjen) DPP APKASINDO, Dr. Rino Afrino, ST., MM., C.APO, memberikan wawasan mengenai nilai ekonomi dari limbah yang selama ini terbuang.

“Dunia internasional kini mencari minyak jelantah atau limbah sawit untuk diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat. Jadi, tidak ada yang terbuang. Semua proses dari TBS hingga limbah memiliki peluang ekonomi yang berlipat ganda jika kita menguasai teknologinya,” jelas Dr. Rino.

Airbus predicts the commercial aircraft services market in the region to grow from $52 billion today to $129 billion by 2043. Additionally, they estimate a need for 999,000 new skilled personnel in Asia, comprising pilots, technicians, and cabin crew.

Boeing’s 2024 Commercial Market Outlook also supports this growth narrative, citing a tripling of air traffic in Southeast Asia by 2043, with a projected fleet expansion to 4,960 jets. They predict an annual passenger air traffic growth rate of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than the global average of 4.7%. This expansion in aviation will create opportunities for many, including the hiring of 234,000 new personnel to support the rising demand for air travel.

Several factors drive this rapid growth in Southeast Asia. The region’s economic landscape is characterized by a combined GDP of approximately $3 trillion, with diverse income levels among ASEAN member countries. As disposable incomes rise, particularly among the burgeoning middle class, there is increasing demand for air travel. This trend is evidenced by strategic market insights that showcase the growth rate of the middle class in Asia outpacing that of Western nations.

Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines are emerging leaders in plane orders. Vietjet has placed significant orders for A330neo aircraft, signaling its expansion into long-haul networks, while Cebu Pacific made headlines with a record-breaking order for 152 Airbus aircraft, cementing its status as a leading low-cost carrier.

The geographical challenges of Southeast Asia, with many nations being archipelagos, further emphasize the necessity of regional air connectivity. Improved airline services offer safer and faster travel options compared to traditional maritime routes, which have historically been associated with high accident rates. The rise of low-cost carriers has also enabled overseas workers to visit their families more frequently, thereby enhancing overall quality of life.

Moreover, sustainable aviation initiatives are beginning to take shape in the region, albeit at a slower pace compared to Europe and North America. Collaborations between Airbus, AirAsia, and local governments aim to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, which could significantly contribute to reducing the aviation industry’s environmental impact.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:56:38.206090

Phillips 66 sits in the crosshairs of the energy transition. It is big enough to matter in global fuel and chemicals markets, and exposed enough to be disrupted by electrification, efficiency gains, and aggressive climate policy. The company’s namesake product platform – Phillips 66, encompassing fuels, midstream logistics, chemicals, lubricants and now low?carbon solutions – is being forced to answer a hard question: how do you run a profitable hydrocarbon business while the world is demanding less carbon?

The answer, at least for now, is not to abandon fossil molecules but to upgrade them. Phillips 66 is betting on a mix of high?complexity refining, advantaged logistics, petrochemicals via its Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) joint venture, and an expanding slate of lower?carbon offerings from renewable diesel to carbon capture and hydrogen integration. Instead of a single hero product, Phillips 66 functions more like a platform: a network of assets, technologies and proprietary processes tuned to squeeze out margin and emissions reductions from every barrel and every Btu that passes through its system.

This is not the loud, brand?forward pitch you get from an EV pioneer or a consumer?facing tech giant. It’s infrastructure?level innovation, where winning looks like quiet reliability, steady free cash flow, and decarbonization that is material on a megaton scale. Yet the stakes are huge. For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie and for policymakers trying to keep grids stable while lowering emissions, the way this product platform evolves over the next decade matters a lot.

Get all details on Phillips 66 here

Inside the Flagship: Phillips 66

The core Phillips 66 offering is a vertically integrated energy and chemicals platform spanning refining, midstream logistics, marketing, and petrochemicals. Rather than a single refinery or product line, think of Phillips 66 as a tightly choreographed system: crude and NGLs in, transportation fuels, specialty products and chemicals out, with every node optimized for cost, yield, and increasingly, carbon intensity.

On the conventional side, the Phillips 66 refining portfolio is built around complex, coastal refineries that can process discounted, heavy or opportunity crudes and upgrade them into higher?value products. That complexity is a quiet but powerful feature: coking, hydrocracking, and advanced distillation capacity let Phillips 66 pivot yields between gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemical feedstocks based on demand and crack spreads. The company has been divesting lower?margin inland refineries and doubling down on sites with export access and integration with chemicals and midstream assets.

A standout example of this evolution is the Rodeo facility in California, which Phillips 66 is converting from a traditional oil refinery into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels plants. Once fully ramped, Rodeo Renewed is designed to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and other wastes. That’s not just a feel?good story; it’s a technical flex that combines hydrotreating expertise, hydrogen management, and feedstock optimization into a commercial?scale low?carbon product line that taps into lucrative California and federal credit markets.

In chemicals, the company’s Chevron Phillips Chemical joint venture is a second flagship pillar of the broader Phillips 66 product universe. CPChem is a major global producer of polyethylene, specialty chemicals and petrochemical intermediates. Its current and planned projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East are designed to leverage cheap natural gas liquids and export access to high?growth markets in Asia and beyond. This is the less visible but strategically crucial piece of the business, converting hydrocarbons into long?lived materials rather than fuels burned in an engine.

Layered on top of this industrial backbone is a suite of performance products and services under the Phillips 66, 76 and Kendall brands: branded transportation fuels, high?spec engine oils, industrial lubricants and specialty products. These offerings target both retail motorists and commercial and industrial customers, where performance claims (engine protection, extended drain intervals, fuel efficiency) translate directly into customer stickiness and margin.

Increasingly, the Phillips 66 product story includes low?carbon solutions. Beyond renewable diesel and SAF, the company is piloting and evaluating carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) at refinery and chemicals facilities; exploring hydrogen applications for process heat and fuels; and working on ways to lower the lifecycle emissions of its existing fuels and petrochemical products. None of these individually define the brand yet, but together they show a direction: decarbonize the barrel you have while preparing for a world that needs more molecules with fewer emissions.

Market Rivals: Phillips 66 Aktie vs. The Competition

Phillips 66 operates in one of the most competitive spaces in global industry: integrated and downstream energy. Its closest peers are U.S. and global refiners that are also trying to refit fossil?heavy product portfolios for a carbon?constrained world. Compared directly to Valero Energy’s refining and renewable diesel platform, Marathon Petroleum’s refining and MPLX midstream business, and the more globally diversified model of BP’s downstream and convenience business, the Phillips 66 product stack looks distinct in a few important ways.

Valero Energy’s flagship rivalry product is its highly optimized Gulf Coast refining network and the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, which has become one of the world’s largest renewable diesel producers. Valero’s pitch is simple and sharp: scale, cost discipline, and aggressive capital allocation into high?return renewable diesel projects. Where Phillips 66 leans into integration with chemicals and logistics, Valero leans into pure?play refining leverage with a growing green fuels segment.

Marathon Petroleum, meanwhile, has turned its product platform into a refining?plus?midstream machine built around its MPLX partnership. After divesting Speedway, Marathon has focused on refinery optimization and midstream cash generation. Its renewable diesel product line, including the Martinez Renewable Fuels project in California, competes head?to?head with Phillips 66’s Rodeo Renewed in the West Coast low?carbon fuels market.

Then there is BP’s downstream and convenience operation, anchored by its Castrol lubricants and a global fuels marketing business. Compared directly to BP’s convenience & mobility product ecosystem – which spans retail stations, EV charging, premium fuels and lubricants – Phillips 66’s portfolio skews more industrial and North America?heavy. BP aims to turn forecourt real estate into a decarbonized mobility hub, while Phillips 66 is more focused on squeezing value from its refining, midstream, and chemicals platforms and selectively expanding lower?carbon fuels.

On the chemicals front, Chevron Phillips Chemical (part of the Phillips 66 universe) goes up against behemoths like ExxonMobil Chemical, Dow, and LyondellBasell. Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s performance polymers and chemical solutions product line, CPChem’s growth projects are more targeted and partnership?driven, emphasizing advantaged feedstock positions in the U.S. and the Middle East. The rivalry here is less about brand and more about who can bring on world?scale crackers and polyethylene plants at the lowest cost and with the most resilient demand profile.

Where Phillips 66 arguably concedes ground is in brand visibility to end consumers. BP and Shell can wrap their downstream products in a green narrative at the retail pump and on EV chargers. Valero and Marathon command outsized market share in key U.S. regions. Phillips 66, by contrast, often flies under the radar outside its core branded fuel regions, even as it quietly executes on projects that materially reshape its emissions and earning power.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

The core competitive edge of Phillips 66 is not a single breakthrough technology but the way its refining, midstream and chemicals assets are stitched together into a high?optionality product platform. In practice, that translates into a few structural advantages.

1. Integration with chemicals, not just fuels. Unlike pure?play refiners, Phillips 66 has a major stake in petrochemicals through Chevron Phillips Chemical. That means a larger share of its hydrocarbon molecules can end up in long?lived plastics and specialty chemicals rather than short?cycle fuels. In an energy transition world, that matters: fuels volumes will face structural headwinds from EVs and efficiency, while demand for many plastics and chemical intermediates continues to grow, especially in emerging markets.

2. High?complexity coastal refineries with export optionality. Phillips 66 has been pruning its refinery portfolio to emphasize complex coastal sites tied into product export lanes and petrochemical feedstock markets. That gives the company a crucial edge in product placement: it can swing barrels to higher?margin regions and adjust yields quickly as global product balances shift. In a volatile macro and regulatory environment, that flexibility is a profit multiplier.

3. Real, not rhetorical, low?carbon products. While nearly every energy major talks about net zero, fewer have deployed significant capital into commercially scaled low?carbon products that leverage their existing process knowledge. Renewable diesel and SAF at Rodeo Renewed, alongside co?processing and efficiency upgrades at other sites, give Phillips 66 a tangible entry into low?carbon liquids. These products can command premium pricing, ride policy tailwinds, and extend the life of downstream infrastructure even as carbon constraints tighten.

4. Disciplined capital and portfolio management. The company has been actively selling non?core or underperforming assets and recycling capital into higher?return projects in midstream, renewable fuels, and CPChem expansions. That helps keep the product portfolio skewed toward assets that can earn through the cycle and support shareholder returns. In a sector often criticized for value?destructive capex, that discipline is itself a competitive feature.

5. Industrial?grade resilience. Phillips 66’s product universe is built around logistics resilience: pipelines, terminals, export docks, and storage. This backbone may not be glamorous, but it keeps fuels and feedstocks flowing during disruptions and enables arbitrage across basins. As climate?related extreme weather and geopolitical shocks become more frequent, this resilience becomes a sellable attribute to customers, regulators, and investors.

Put together, these factors give Phillips 66 a nuanced but powerful USP: it is one of the few large?scale energy companies capable of generating strong free cash flow from hydrocarbons today while methodically bending the emissions curve of those same products and pivoting more barrels into chemicals and low?carbon fuels over time.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie (ISIN US7185461040), the performance of this product platform is not an abstract story; it feeds directly into earnings, cash returns, and how the market values the company relative to peers.

Using live market data as of the latest trading session, Phillips 66 shares trade in a range that reflects both its cyclical refining exposure and growing confidence in its transition strategy. According to real?time quotes from major financial sources including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, the stock’s most recently available price data show that the company is solidly in large?cap territory, with a market capitalization in the tens of billions of dollars and a valuation multiple that typically sits at a discount to the broader market but broadly in line with U.S. downstream peers. Where markets have rewarded Phillips 66 lately is in its ability to convert elevated refining margins and strong CPChem contributions into robust free cash flow, which is being directed toward dividends, share buybacks, and selective growth projects like Rodeo Renewed.

Crucially, the success of specific product initiatives is beginning to show up in analyst models. Renewable diesel and SAF volumes at Rodeo Renewed and Martinez?style peers are increasingly baked into long?term margin forecasts. CPChem’s global growth projects, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East, provide visibility into non?refining earnings power. Midstream and logistics assets, once seen primarily as supporting infrastructure, are valued more like cash?generating toll roads that stabilize earnings when refining cycles turn down.

Markets also track Phillips 66’s decarbonization metrics and capital allocation closely. Demonstrable emissions reductions per barrel, growing low?carbon product volumes, and credible CCUS and hydrogen pathways reduce perceived transition risk. That, in turn, can compress the discount rate investors apply to future cash flows, supporting a stronger equity multiple than a pure?play, no?transition refiner might command.

In that sense, the Phillips 66 product platform is both a cash engine and a signaling device. Each incremental renewable diesel project, each chemicals expansion, each efficiency gain in refining and midstream sends a message that this is not a business planning to run in place until demand disappears. For Phillips 66 Aktie, that evolving narrative – from traditional refiner to integrated, lower?carbon energy and chemicals platform – is a key driver of how the stock is priced against rivals like Valero, Marathon Petroleum, and the downstream arms of the supermajors.

The transition will not be smooth, and the macro backdrop for fuels and chemicals will remain volatile. But if Phillips 66 can keep proving that its product upgrades and portfolio shifts translate into durable margins and lower carbon intensity, its stock will be less a hostage to the next down?cycle and more a geared play on a pragmatic, molecule?centric energy transition.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405029_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 17:56:42.662936

As producers weigh planting decisions for 2026, the high cost of corn production versus soybeans looms large.","This story was first published on RealAgriculture.com on Jan. 8, 2026.

As corn producers head into another growing season, economic headwinds are intensifying — not from just one direction, but from both sides of the balance sheet.

While production costs remain stubbornly high, corn prices have sharply declined, squeezing farm margins and prompting a push for long-term demand growth.

Krista Swanson, chief economist with the U.S. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), outlined the association’s upcoming Q1 economic outlook and what it signals for U.S. corn producers.

“Costs have been a huge focus of ours over the past six months,” she says, pointing to a plateau in production expenses that has held since 2022.

While some minor easing has occurred, the USDA projects the cost to grow an acre of corn will average $917 in 2026 — only 1 per cent lower than 2022 levels.

“Meanwhile, the market-year average price for corn is expected to be 37 per cent lower than 2022,” she adds.

Swanson noted fertilizer makes up about a third of operating costs and draws much attention, but increases in seed, pesticides, land, and machinery are also significant.

From an economist’s perspective, she warned that continued government payments, such as the USDA’s recent $44/acre “bridge” program, may also inadvertently contribute to price rigidity for those same inputs.

Beyond costs, Swanson is focused on the demand side, where new market opportunities could change the trajectory.

While year-round E15 ethanol remains a top short-term goal, she says longer-term strategies are being developed.
