Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans.
“It’s a perfect storm of ugly.” Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country.
“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said.
“We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.” Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S.","ST. PAUL, Minn. — Prior to attending the 40th Farm Aid benefit concert Sept. 20 in Minneapolis, Sen. Amy Klobuchar felt that perhaps the emerging crisis unfolding in the farm economy had fallen on deaf ears across the country.

Not so, Klobuchar said during a visit to the Tyler, Minn., farm of Joel Schreurs, a director with the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association (MSGA).

The dire message is being received.

“After Farm Aid, I think people are waking up to how bad it is right now (in agriculture),” she said during a roundtable discussion in Schreurs’ garage, where she was flanked by Schreurs and MSGA Director Bob Worth. “It’s gotten into their psyche, and I think they’re starting to see it.”

Worth said the current economic landscape reminded him of conditions that led to the creation of Farm Aid four decades ago.

“This is the 1980s farm crisis all over again,” Worth said.

Tariffs on many of U.S. soy’s largest trading partners have wreaked havoc on not just producers, but the entire ag supply chain. Since April 2025, when trade tensions between China and the U.S. began increasing, China has effectively stopped purchasing U.S. soybeans. In the 2023/2024 marketing year, China imported over $13 billion in U.S. soybeans. Replacing that market takes years, not weeks or months. Additionally, in contrast to the 2018-2019 trade war, tariffs have gone beyond China to affect U.S. soy customers across the globe. Combine low commodity prices with a widening basis and input costs that remain stubbornly high, and it’s hard to look for a bright economic spot as farmers head out into the fields to harvest what’s predicted to be a near-record soybean crop.

“It’s a weird combination of bad circumstances,” Klobuchar said, adding, “We’ve got to find a way out.”

Matt Schreurs, Joel’s cousin and vice president of ag lending with First Farmers and Merchant Bank, explained to the senator that the numbers aren’t adding up for producers in his region. Some growers are seeing losses totaling $180 per acre.

“I’m looking at a lot of red ink,” said Matt Schreurs, a member of MSGA. “It’s a perfect storm of ugly.”

Joel Schreurs underscored the importance of agriculture to rural towns throughout Minnesota and the country. He’s also concerned how younger farmers will be impacted.

“When ag does well in southwest Minnesota, so does our local economy,” he said.

Instead of wallowing in bad news, Joel, Matt, Worth and Executive Director Joe Smentek offered a series of recommendations to Sen. Klobuchar that could lead to economic improvement across farm country in the months ahead:

Removal of tariffs on U.S. soybeans through negotiations

Unfreeze USAID funding. Food aid programs through USAID help build a positive, long-tern reputation for U.S. agriculture across decades. In FY2024, about $110 million worth of U.S. soy was purchased by USAID for Food for Peace

Passing a skinny Farm Bill before year’s end to ensure critical programs continue to receive funding

Supporting renewable fuels through higher blends of biodiesel and using soybean oil as a primary feedstock in sustainable aviation fuel

“There’s got to be some sort of resolution,” Klobuchar said.

Without a trade deal with China, the farmers agreed, financial assistance will likely be warranted to prevent a full-blown catastrophe in the ag economy.

“Farmers want open markets more than anything, but the current situation is unsustainable,” Joel Schreurs said. “We’re going to lose a lot of good farmers without an assistance package.”

Joel Schreurs, who sits on the board of the U.S. Soybean Export Council (USSEC), thanked the senator, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, for supporting policies that are helping to grow market access beyond China and invited her to visit emerging markets that are working with USSEC through the Soy Excellence Center.

“We had great discussions and let her know what we’re thinking and where we want to go from here,” he said.

Schreurs’ efforts to grow markets continue. On Sept. 30, he’s hosting a Southeast Asian trade delegation alongside Northern Soy Marketing.

La inversión prevista supera los 100 millones de euros, según informó la compañía.

El proyecto se plantea como una instalación de transición energética preparada para adaptarse a la evolución normativa, del mercado y de la demanda industrial. La terminal estaría habilitada para operar con productos convencionales y combustibles sostenibles como amoniaco renovable, CO₂ capturado, metanol verde, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) y biocarburantes.

El diseño contempla una capacidad aproximada de 165.000 metros cúbicos, distribuidos en varios tanques atmosféricos, criogénicos y presurizados, ubicados en dos parcelas diferenciadas pero conectadas. Estos equipos permitirán almacenar combustibles de bajas emisiones, productos químicos, amoniaco y CO₂. La infraestructura incluiría un cargadero ferroviario de ancho ibérico con conexión directa a la red nacional, enlaces a dos atraques para buques mediante una red de tuberías y bombas de gran capacidad, además de isletas de carga para camiones cisterna y sistemas auxiliares de seguridad y operación.

Las actividades previstas abarcan el almacenamiento, mezcla y expedición de biodiésel, HVO, bioetanol, metanol, naftas, SAF, materias primas para biocombustibles e hidrocarburos tradicionales, así como operaciones de blending y distribución multimodal. En el caso del CO₂ criogénico, la planta está concebida para su recepción, almacenamiento en condiciones presurizadas y refrigeradas, y expedición tanto marítima como terrestre, con opción de conexión futura por ducto. El amoniaco podría llegar por vía marítima o terrestre, almacenarse en tanques criogénicos y distribuirse mediante distintos medios de transporte.

El proyecto busca configurarse como una infraestructura logística multimodal e integrada, orientada a optimizar el sistema logístico regional, incrementar la eficiencia operativa y garantizar un suministro energético seguro y sostenible en Galicia y el noroeste peninsular.

Debido a la complejidad de la instalación y a la diversidad de productos que manejará, la entrada en funcionamiento será escalonada. Exolum prevé iniciar las operaciones en 2029.

La compañía considera que la futura terminal reforzará la posición del Puerto de A Coruña como nodo logístico de referencia en Europa, con conexiones hacia el norte del continente, América, el sur de Europa y Oriente Medio.

Jorge Guillén, Aviation & Spain Network Lead de Exolum, explicó que la iniciativa responde a la necesidad de nuevas infraestructuras logísticas que acompañen la transición energética. También señaló que el Puerto Exterior de A Coruña ofrece condiciones operativas, accesibilidad marítima y conexiones multimodales adecuadas para este tipo de proyectos.

-OneArabia

The UAE recently celebrated the winners of the third Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Aviation Award (SMBR), distributing a total prize of USD 1 million. This award recognises excellence in aviation, with a focus on sustainability and innovation. The event highlighted the UAE's commitment to advancing global civil aviation through research and development.

Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy and Tourism and Chairman of the UAE General Civil Aviation Authority (GCAA), stated: ""The SMBR Global Aviation Award embodies the UAE’s commitment to supporting research and innovation, motivating young talents and research institutions to develop practical and sustainable solutions that will shape the future of global civil aviation.""

The third edition of the award concentrated on sustainability, particularly sustainable aviation fuel solutions. This aligns with international goals for carbon neutrality by 2050. The UAE's role in fostering innovation and global cooperation was evident through this initiative. The award is organised every three years in collaboration with ICAO, having been launched in 2016.

Winners in the Academic Research and Development category hailed from universities in Brazil, the United States, and Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) secured victory in the Research Institutions category. These achievements underscore the global reach and impact of the award.

During the 42nd Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), Abdulla Al Marri delivered an official statement emphasising aviation as a bridge for human communication. He noted that under UAE leadership, aviation has become central to national vision and global mission, with 189 air service agreements reflecting open skies as key to shared prosperity.

Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi, Director General of the GCAA, remarked: ""We are proud to host this reception as a platform to honor innovators and showcase their achievements to global aviation leaders. The SMBR Global Aviation Award reflects the UAE’s pioneering role in supporting the aviation industry and enhancing its position as an incubator for initiatives that inspire the world and advance sustainability.""

Commitment to Global Cooperation

The UAE has implemented significant measures towards sustainability, including a roadmap for sustainable aviation fuel production. Initiatives like a digital platform for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) have been developed alongside establishing the Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace (GSAM).

Al Marri further stated: ""The UAE believes that progress in aviation cannot be achieved unless it includes everyone, and sustainability can only be realized through investment in human capital. To this end, the UAE has developed several initiatives to build sector competencies in collaboration with its international partners.""

The evening saw an official state reception hosted by the UAE in Montreal as part of ICAO assembly protocol. This event blended formalities with cultural elements, attended by ministers, civil aviation directors from ICAO member states, and officials from regional and international organisations.

He added: ""The UAE has repeatedly opened its doors to host the world, serving as a hub for partners, a supportive voice for international cooperation, and a bridge between regions as a trusted and constructive ally."" This highlights their ongoing dedication to fostering international partnerships within aviation.

The gathering highlighted the need for good governance, strategic planning and inclusive policies to ensure that tourism’s benefits reach local communities while protecting cultural and natural heritage.

Malaysia used the occasion to showcase its own initiatives — from expanding high-value tourism segments and digital nomad hubs to investing in sustainable aviation fuel and community-led ecotourism. It also announced plans to join the UN Tourism International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO) with a pilot project in Mersing, Johor, reinforcing its commitment to measuring and managing tourism’s impact.

“World Tourism Day 2025 in Melaka has shown the world that tourism can be a force for good when guided by sustainability and inclusivity,” UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said. “By working together, we can transform tourism into a tool for empowerment, cultural preservation, and environmental protection.”

Speakers throughout the day emphasized the pillars of sustainable transformation: investing in education and skills, especially for women, youth, and marginalized groups; accelerating innovation and digital transformation by supporting start-ups and closing the “digital gap”; promoting micro and small enterprises to strengthen local economies; and preserving cultural heritage as a cornerstone of authentic travel experiences.

“Tourism is a powerful driver of transformation,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres in his official message. “It creates jobs, fuels local economies, and builds bridges across cultures. Yet, it must be sustainable to protect the very places and communities it celebrates.”

Looking ahead, UN Tourism’s secretary-general, Pololikashvili, stressed that World Tourism Day 2025 marks the start of a new chapter for the sector.

Malaysia formally handed over the hosting of World Tourism Day to El Salvador for 2026, which will take place under the theme “Digital Agenda and Artificial Intelligence to Redesign Tourism”, setting the stage for the industry’s next wave of innovation and transformation.

New Activist Reports

Morpheus Research published a 14,222-word report on Brunello Cucinelli (Milan: BC — EUR5.67 billion), a luxury Italian clothing brand. Morpheus largely alleged that Brunello Cucinelli was violating EU sanctions on the sale of luxury goods to Russia based on import data, interviews with former executives, and photos from secret shoppers showing the company’s active presence in Russia.

Morpheus also said that Brunello Cucinelli “has resorted to aggressive discounting to manage bloated inventory” and “trades at ~46x next year’s earnings, a higher multiple than any luxury peer, despite slowing revenue growth, average operating margins, and rising competition.”

Blue Orca Capital published on Aya Gold & Silver (Toronto: AYA — CAD$2.08 billion), a Canadian silver mining company with operations in Morocco. Blue Orca alleged that “there is overwhelming evidence that Aya inflated its silver resource at Zgounder, its only producing asset, by over 100%, potentially reflecting as many as 50+ million phantom ounces.” Blue Orca specifically raised concerns about the legitimacy of a bullish December 2021 resource estimate report for the company’s mine. Blue Orca alleged that the resource estimate was “created by a conflicted geologist who appears to be a close business partner of the CEO” and had other anomalies which suggest the report data was manipulated to show artificially inflated silver reserves.

Jehoshaphat Research published a 54-page report on goeasy (Toronto: GSY — CAD$2.80 billion), a Canadian subprime lender. Jehoshaphat alleged the company “is sitting on ~$300m worth of improperly delayed credit losses and unreported serious delinquencies that have been buried in the balance sheet like dead bodies in the snow.” Jehoshaphat highlighted that the company has recently “changed its accounting rules for charge-offs, credit risk scoring, and expense recognition,” which has “pushed hundreds of millions worth of bad debt and other expenses into the future.” Jehoshaphat also raised concerns about the recent departures of the company’s CEO and CFO, as well as high insider selling by company executives.

Fugazi Research published on Brera Holdings (NASDAQ: BREA — $75 million), an Irish holding company that owns four association soccer clubs and one volleyball club. Fugazi raised concerns about the company’s recent pivot to a “digital asset treasury” model that would likely lead to high levels of shareholder dilution.

BMF Reports published on US Gold Corp (NASDAQ: USAU — $233 million), a Nevada-based gold miner that BMF alleged is engaged in paid stock promotion and has “heavy dilution risk ahead.”

Recent Resignations

Notable executive departures disclosed in the past week include:

CEO of Portillo’s (NASDAQ: PTLO — $476 million) “departed the company as President and CEO and as a member of the Board of Directors” with immediate effect after seven years. In June 2024, the company’s Chief Operating Officer departed after three years. The company is down ~85% since its October 2021 IPO.

Ms. Safra Catz, who served as CEO and CFO of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL — $806 billion), “will take on a new role as Executive Vice Chair of the Board” after 11 years of leadership. Oracle stock rose by over 600% during her tenure.

Board member of XCF Global (NASDAQ: SAFX — $221 million), Ms. Anne Anderson, resigned effective immediately after just three months “for personal reasons.” The sustainable aviation fuel company is down ~85% since its June 2025 SPAC merger.

Chair of S&T Bancorp (NASDAQ: STBA — $1.47 billion) resigned after seven years following “her confirmation as an ambassador to Sweden by the United States Senate.”

TruAlt Bioenergy IPO Details

TruAlt Bioenergy Share Price Target Tomorrow (Listing day price)

The company controls its costs well, which helps it earn more money. It still has some debt, but its savings and reserves are increasing, making its financial position stronger. Cash coming in from its services shows the company is managing its business smoothly. Overall, it is becoming financially stronger with growing revenue, higher profits, and better efficiency, though it needs to carefully manage its debt.

TruAlt Bioenergy Share Price Target 2025

It is one of India’s main ethanol producers. Its factories work almost at full capacity, supplying a large part of the ethanol used in India. This allows the company to meet the growing demand for ethanol, which is supported by government programs to reduce oil use. It earns a steady income and strengthens its position in India’s biofuel industry. In 2025, its share price target would be ₹865, as per stock market analysts.

According to stock market analysts, its share price would be between ₹347 to ₹865 in 2025.

TruAlt Bioenergy share price Target 2026

It runs several distillery plants in Karnataka, mainly using molasses, a thick syrup left after sugar is made from sugarcane, and sugar syrup as raw materials. Its location helps the company to get these materials and keep production running smoothly. Relying on these materials also helps maintain high quality, meet industry standards, and provide ethanol for different uses, such as blending with fuel and other industrial purposes. In 2026, its share price target would be ₹1352, as per stock market analysts.

Its share price would be between ₹830 to ₹1352 in 2026, as per stock market analysts.

Share price Target 2027

The company gets its raw materials, sugar syrup, sugarcane juice, and molasses from sugar plants owned by its promoter group. The large use of these materials shows the company’s large production scale. It depends less on outside sources and can keep costs stable, which is important since raw material prices can affect profits by managing its own supply. This approach makes the company stronger, more reliable, and better prepared for the future. In 2027, its share price target would be ₹1882, as per stock market analysts.

It received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot – 87 – short of the 93 required.","[SINGAPORE] The city-state has once again been elected to the council of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), garnering the highest number of votes of any council member thus far.

Singapore was voted in at the 42nd session of the ICAO held in Montreal, Canada, on Saturday (Sep 27) evening. The country was represented by a delegation led by Acting Minister for Transport Jeffrey Siow.

In a media statement on Sunday, Siow said: “Singapore is honoured to be re-elected to the ICAO council. The strong international leadership by ICAO, with support from member states and industry, will enable governments, industry and international organisations to work together to address challenges ahead.”

In a LinkedIn post on Sunday morning, he added that Singapore had been re-elected with “a record number of votes”.

Siow, who is also senior minister of state for Finance, said: “In a world where rules matter less and small countries find it harder to exert influence, we have to work harder with like-minded partners to secure our interests. Well functioning international organisations like ICAO remain important platforms for us to build a world that Singapore can continue to do well and prosper.”

The city-state was first elected to the ICAO council in 2003 and has been a member of the body ever since.

ICAO is an agency of the United Nations that is responsible for developing and maintaining the standards for aviation, including those related to safety, air navigation and security.

Formed in 1944, it became the UN’s official aviation standards agency in 1947.

The ICAO assembly is its policymaking entity. It is made up of representatives from ICAO’s 193 member states and gathers every three years to further the organisation’s broader work, such as adopting resolutions and deciding its priorities.

The assembly also votes on the ICAO council, which is the organisation’s permanent governing body that continually sets direction and adopts standards, amongst other work.

Singapore led with 176 votes

Balloting for the council is held three times for different categories:

Countries of chief importance in air transport

Countries that make the largest contribution to the provision of facilities for international civil air navigation

States ensuring geographic representation.

The first two sections of balloting have concluded, with 22 of the 36-seat council now elected. The remainder will be voted in with the final ballot on Sep 30.

Singapore, eligible for election under the second ballot, won with 176 votes. Saudi Arabia was the second highest with 175, and Brazil was third with 167.

Russia failed to be elected. It received the lowest number of votes in the first ballot – 87 – short of the 93 required. It lost its spot in 2022, following the outbreak of the Ukraine war.

At the opening of the assembly on Sep 23, ICAO council president, Salvatore Sciacchitano, reiterated the need for strengthening oversight, modernising infrastructure and implementing the organisation’s standards, as well as accelerating towards its 2050 goal of net-zero carbon emissions.

“A system currently built to serve 4.6 billion passengers will not accommodate three times that number, unless we ensure its transformation,” he said.",https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/businesstimes/df32406a617c1a0ce3d090e3300c5494d8749248aea9f9560058a94582695f0e?w=1200&f=webp,N,,2025-09-28 06:56:41.664822

Currently, most commercial SAF production relies on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts waste oils into fuel.
He urged industry stakeholders to accelerate investments and build the infrastructure necessary to scale up SAF production rapidly.
Energy producers and investors are called upon to align their strategies with global decarbonization goals to ensure the rapid commercialization of SAF technologies.
The study serves as a critical reminder that while SAF feedstocks are abundant, turning this potential into actual production hinges on the acceleration of technologies, infrastructure readiness, and cross-sector collaboration.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in collaboration with Worley Consulting, released a study on September 23, 2025, confirming that the main barrier to achieving the airline industry’s goal of net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 is not a shortage of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock but rather the slow pace of rollout for SAF production technologies. According to the study, sufficient sustainable feedstock exists globally, meeting strict environmental standards without causing adverse land use changes, to support the required 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050.

Currently, most commercial SAF production relies on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology, which converts waste oils into fuel. The study pointed out the need to accelerate the development of new technologies to diversify SAF production methods, especially power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies that rely on renewable electricity, green hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure. It also highlighted competition for biomass feedstock among various hard-to-decarbonize sectors, stressing the importance of prioritizing aviation in feedstock allocation.

IATA’s Director General, Willie Walsh, emphasized that feedstock availability should no longer be viewed as a limiting factor. He urged industry stakeholders to accelerate investments and build the infrastructure necessary to scale up SAF production rapidly. “We now have unequivocal evidence that the challenge lies in technology deployment, not feedstock,” Walsh said. “To meet net zero goals by 2050, shovels must be in the ground now.”

The study projects that biomass feedstock could sustainably supply over 300 million tonnes of bio-SAF annually by mid-century, with the remainder of the 500 million tonnes coming from PtL fuels. However, unlocking the full potential will require coordinated global policies, enhanced supply chain logistics, infrastructure investment, and technological innovation.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted SAF’s potential to create jobs, boost local economies, and support energy security. She stressed the critical need for governments, investors, and industry stakeholders to collaborate on policy frameworks and investment incentives to de-risk projects and hasten the development of a fully functioning SAF market.

The report underscores regional leadership from key global players such as North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN countries as vital to scaling up production and meeting global demand. Energy producers and investors are called upon to align their strategies with global decarbonization goals to ensure the rapid commercialization of SAF technologies.

The study serves as a critical reminder that while SAF feedstocks are abundant, turning this potential into actual production hinges on the acceleration of technologies, infrastructure readiness, and cross-sector collaboration. With only 25 years remaining to meet the ambitious net zero target, timely action and focused investments are paramount to decarbonizing the aviation sector and securing a sustainable future for air travel.",https://capitalethiopia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Iata-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 06:56:53.049911

This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks,” Mr Galligan said.
“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels.
Towns like Cairns, Mackay, Bundaberg, Townsville, Childers and Tully could become bio precinct hubs, producing clean liquid fuels, biogas and renewable electricity.
The sugar industry already supports 20,000 jobs and contributes $4.4 billion annually to the economy, and can grow even further.","The government’s new 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program commits $1.1 billion “to help unlock the vast economic opportunities on offer from low carbon liquid fuels” such as biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

Canegrowers chief executive officer Dan Galligan said Queensland sugar was ahead of the game, with sustainability and infrastructure advantages already locked in.

“Almost half of Queensland’s sugarcane is recognised by the world’s three biggest sustainability gatekeepers as a global leader in sustainable farming. This gives immediate confidence to airlines, freight and heavy industry that local feedstocks meet global benchmarks,” Mr Galligan said.

He also highlighted the industry’s infrastructure advantage, saying Queensland’s cane rail network could be the backbone of a bioeconomy that could collect and process feedstocks from right across the state.

“Our growing region stretches along the Queensland coastline, alongside major population hubs. We also have a cane rail network stretching thousands of kilometres, linking farms to mills and multiple deep-water ports,” Mr Galligan said.

“This footprint shortens supply chains, cuts costs, and de-risks a rapid scale-up of domestic low-carbon liquid fuels. “ With sugarcane feedstock alone, Queensland could deliver more than 30% of Australia’s aviation fuel demand.

“This is about positioning Queensland as the nation’s biofuels hub. It means cleaner fuels for airlines and motorists, thousands of new jobs, and billions in regional investment.”

Australian Sugar Manufacturers (ASM) chief executive officer Ash Salardini said the Federal Government deserved credit for seizing the moment.

“The government must be commended for grabbing this once-in-a-generation opportunity with both hands,” he said.

“We have to get the foundations right on biofuels. The challenge isn’t technology anymore – it’s standing up a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective supply chain.

“This agenda requires a laser-like focus on targeted support for feedstock logistics and infrastructure. Without it, we risk building a biorefining capability that relies on imported feedstock – swapping our reliance on imported liquid fossil fuels with a vulnerability for imported bioethanol from places like Brazil and India.”

Both Canegrowers and ASM said the benefits for Queensland were enormous if government and industry got the model right.

Towns like Cairns, Mackay, Bundaberg, Townsville, Childers and Tully could become bio precinct hubs, producing clean liquid fuels, biogas and renewable electricity.

Feedstock supply chains would be the source of tens of thousands of new jobs in farming, transport, processing, manufacturing and logistics.

The sugar industry already supports 20,000 jobs and contributes $4.4 billion annually to the economy, and can grow even further.

“If we get it right, we’ll unlock thousands of jobs across regional Queensland and beyond, demonstrating that the net-zero ambition will bring good paying jobs to regional communities across Australia,” Mr Salardini said.",https://mareebaexpress-4634.kxcdn.com/img/containers/assets/news/lan_sugar-biofuel-1758520674.jpg/c2244eb03b0d2d5057cdf317b99ee4f4.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 06:57:01.211671

This isn't the first time Jenner has faced criticism for her private jet use.
While people are urged to recycle, conserve water, and switch to reusable bags, the emissions from a single private flight can outweigh the lifetime impact of those daily choices.
Still, many argue that meaningful change requires policy shifts — from taxing private jet travel to investing in greener alternatives that make sustainable choices accessible to everyone.","Kylie Jenner is once again under fire for her use of private jets — and this time, the backlash is tied to flight data that has left social media users stunned.

A TikTok from Monique and Alfredo (@dr.a1andmonique) broke down the reality star's Sept. 7 trips to Budapest and Paris, noting that the journey racked up an estimated $31,000 in fuel costs and a hefty carbon footprint.

The video uses public flight radar data to track Jenner's travel, pointing out that both her private jet and one belonging to Travis Scott landed back in Los Angeles within hours of each other. The pair have two children together from an on-off romantic relationship.

This isn't the first time Jenner has faced criticism for her private jet use. In 2022, she drew similar backlash, posting an Instagram picture with the caption ""You wanna take mine or yours?"" in reference to her plane and Scott's.

Short-haul flights are especially problematic because takeoffs and landings create disproportionately high emissions, making them far more polluting per mile than commercial flights. They also carry far fewer passengers, resulting in a significantly higher pollution-per-passenger ratio.

The outrage online is tied to a bigger concern: Luxury air travel by celebrities contributes massively to the release of planet-warming pollution while ordinary people are being encouraged to reduce energy use, drive electric cars, or fly less.

By contrast, more sustainable options are increasingly available — like commercial airlines investing in cleaner fuels, or even eco-conscious flight alternatives such as high-speed rail.

Critics have pointed out that the issue isn't just about one celebrity — it reflects a growing gap between individual climate responsibility and the behavior of the ultra-wealthy.

While people are urged to recycle, conserve water, and switch to reusable bags, the emissions from a single private flight can outweigh the lifetime impact of those daily choices. That imbalance fuels frustration and calls for stronger regulations on private aviation.

There are solutions on the horizon, though. Some airlines and innovators are exploring sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and electric short-haul planes, while improved public transportation options could also help reduce transportation pollution.

Still, many argue that meaningful change requires policy shifts — from taxing private jet travel to investing in greener alternatives that make sustainable choices accessible to everyone.

On TikTok, viewers expressed frustration.

One commenter wrote: ""It's so wasteful.""

Another joked: ""Don't worry I've already offset the emissions with my paper straw.""

Lebih dari 40 ribu Perwira (sebutan bagi pekerja Pertamina) kini tersebar dari Sabang sampai Merauke hingga ke luar negeri.

Para Perwira Pertamina bertugas memastikan kebutuhan energi di Indonesia selalu terpenuhi.

Menurut Vice President Corporate Communication Pertamina, Fadjar Djoko Santoso, kehadiran operasional Pertamina di seluruh penjuru Nusantara membuat kebutuhan tenaga kerja tak bisa dihindari.

Untuk itu, Pertamina secara konsisten membuka rekrutmen putra-putri terbaik daerah demi menjaga produktivitas dan keandalan operasional.

“Kami menyadari, energi merupakan kebutuhan dasar dan hajat hidup orang banyak. Pertamina mempersiapkan Perwira, tak hanya sigap menghadapi tantangan energi, tetapi juga melayani pelanggan dengan lebih baik,” ujarnya lewat keterangan resmi, Sabtu 27 September 2025.

Layanan Energi 24 Jam

Pertamina berkomitmen memberikan layanan energi tanpa henti, 24 jam sehari. Mulai dari sektor hulu, pengolahan, distribusi, hingga garda depan penjualan, seluruh Perwira memahami pentingnya pelayanan optimal bagi masyarakat.

Salah satu inovasi layanan dapat ditemui di SPBU Signature yang berlokasi di Jalan Sultan Iskandar Muda, Jakarta Selatan. Konsumen kini bisa merasakan pengalaman baru saat mengisi bahan bakar, mulai dari fasilitas ibadah yang lengkap, toilet bersih, hingga layanan tambahan seperti paket semir ban gratis dari operator SPBU.

Tak berhenti di situ, Pertamina juga memperluas jaringan gas rumah tangga, memudahkan masyarakat dalam mengakses energi yang lebih efisien.

Pertamina aktif berinovasi di sektor energi transisi. Produk ramah lingkungan seperti Biosolar, Pertamax Green, hingga Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) menjadi bukti nyata komitmen perusahaan dalam menjaga keberlanjutan lingkungan.

Langkah ini dianggap sejalan dengan target pemerintah menuju net zero emission (NZE) 2060 serta penerapan Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) di seluruh lini bisnis Pertamina.

Rekrutmen Ribuan Talenta Muda

Pertamina terus membuka peluang kerja bagi generasi muda. Sepanjang 2024, tercatat 1.603 talenta baru bergabung. Mereka tak hanya direkrut, tapi juga dibekali keterampilan agar produktivitas terus meningkat.

“Beberapa tahun terakhir, Pertamina terus melakukan rekrutmen pekerja baru. Hal ini untuk menjaga produktivitas, kaderisasi, sekaligus menghadirkan talenta-talenta yang mendukung peningkatan layanan Pertamina,” tambah Fadjar.

Kisah Perwira di Ujung Timur Indonesia

Dedikasi para Perwira terlihat nyata lewat kisah Ferdy Saputra, yang kini bertugas di Kilang Pertamina Internasional Refinery Unit VII Kasim, Papua. Hampir dua tahun ia meninggalkan keluarga di Jakarta demi memastikan pasokan energi di Papua Barat Daya tetap terjaga.

“Perwira Kasim punya tanggung jawab besar, bukan hanya menjaga operasional kilang, tapi juga membangun stabilitas sosial dengan masyarakat. Saya bangga bisa berkontribusi bagi ekonomi Papua sekaligus kebutuhan energi nasional,” ungkap Ferdy.

Lewat berbagai langkah, mulai dari penguatan layanan, rekrutmen talenta muda, hingga inovasi energi ramah lingkungan, Pertamina menegaskan posisinya sebagai tulang punggung energi nasional sekaligus motor transisi energi menuju masa depan berkelanjutan.

Pertamina Pastikan Stok BBM Tiba, Kolaborasi dengan Swasta Berlanjut

Pertamina Patra Niaga (PPN) memastikan kargo base fuel telah tiba di Jakarta, Selasa 24 September 2025.

Kehadiran kargo ini menjadi tindak lanjut arahan pemerintah melalui Menteri ESDM Bahlil Lahadalia, dalam mendorong kolaborasi pemenuhan kebutuhan BBM antara Pertamina dan badan usaha (BU) swasta.

Sebelumnya, Pertamina bersama BU swasta telah menggelar dua kali pertemuan, yakni pada 19 dan 23 September lalu.

Dalam pertemuan perdana, BU atau penyedia BBM swasta menyatakan kesediaan untuk membeli produk BBM berbasis base fuel yakni BBM yang belum dicampur aditif maupun zat pewarna.

Kesepakatan juga tercapai terkait mekanisme harga menggunakan sistem open book, serta pelibatan pihak independen atau join surveyor guna memastikan kualitas produk bahan bakar yang hendak diperjual belikan. Langkah ini dinilai penting untuk menjamin transparansi dan kepastian pasokan di lapangan.

Pertamina Buka Ruang Kolaborasi

Pj. Corporate Secretary Pertamina Patra Niaga, Roberth MV Dumatubun mengatakan, Pertaminq telah membuka ruang kolaborasi dengan semangat saling menghormati aturan dan tata kelola.

“Pertamina Patra Niaga menawarkan mekanisme penyediaan pasokan dengan menggunakan prosedur yang ada. Harapan kami, BU swasta dapat berkolaborasi dengan niat baik, sambil tetap menghormati aturan dan aspek kepatuhan yang berlaku di BUMN,” jelas Roberth lewat keterangan pers, Rabu 24 September 2025.

Ia menambahkan, seluruh aspek komersial dengan pihak terkait akan dibahas lebih lanjut. Hal ini difokuskan agar mekanisme tetap berada dalam koridor hukum, regulasi pemerintah, serta prinsip good corporate governance.

BU Swasta Siap Lanjutkan Proses

Dalam pertemuan kedua pada Selasa silam, seluruh BU swasta hadir, termasuk Vivo, AKR, Exxon, BP, dan Shell. Beberapa di antaranya masih membutuhkan waktu berkoordinasi dengan kantor pusat global.

Segenap pihak BU swasta juga tetap menyatakan komitmennya untuk segera menyampaikan kebutuhan kuota tambahan.

Lebih lanjut, Pertamina Patra Niaga turut memastikan kargo base fuel yang dibutuhkan telah tiba sesuai spesifikasi Direktorat Jenderal Minyak dan Gas Bumi (Ditjen Migas).

Adapun kualitas pasokan akan dipastikan melalui join surveyor, disertai pertemuan satu per satu dengan masing-masing BU swasta untuk membahas lebih detail soal kebutuhan dan rencana distribusi ke masyarakat.

Roberth menegaskan, seluruh rangkaian pertemuan dilakukan atas dasar niat baik dan semangat kolaborasi dalam menjaga ketersediaan energi bagi masyarakat.

“Harapan kami adalah segera mendapatkan informasi kebutuhan pasokan dari BU swasta, sehingga penyaluran ke masyarakat bisa berjalan lancar. Langkah ini sejalan dengan arahan Menteri ESDM agar stok BBM, baik subsidi maupun nonsubsidi, dapat segera tersedia sesuai kebutuhan masyarakat,” tutupnya.

The stock just hit a new 52-week high, riding a wave of optimism driven by management’s aggressive share buyback plan and a boost in analyst outlooks. Adding to the momentum, the company is benefiting from broader market tailwinds, including a reduction in Russian petroleum exports that has shaken up the sector and put a spotlight on domestic players like Par Pacific. Looking back over the past year, Par Pacific Holdings has delivered a standout run fueled by rising investor confidence. The share price has climbed over 108% during this stretch and more than quadrupled over five years, which is a stark contrast to its sharp, short-term swings. This recent surge follows a season of upbeat analyst commentary and signals that momentum, at least for now, is building. But here is the real question: after such a substantial run, does Par Pacific still have room to grow, or has the market already priced in all the good news?

Most Popular Narrative: 12.6% Overvalued

The most widely followed narrative concludes that Par Pacific Holdings is trading above its fair value. This collective outlook signals concern that recent gains may have gone too far ahead of the company's fundamentals.

The strategic partnership with Mitsubishi and ENEOS, along with the upcoming SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) project launch, positions Par Pacific for growth in renewable fuels. This enhances market access, leverages global feedstock procurement expertise, and is expected to positively contribute to earnings and net margin expansion starting in 2026.

Ready to see what powers this market call? There is a surprising mix of aggressive margin expansion, rapid profit transformation, and a significant multiple uplift driving analyst conviction here. Ever wondered which specific improvements underpin this swift turn toward profitability? Discover which bold projections are behind the “overvalued” label in the full narrative.

Result: Fair Value of $33 (OVERVALUED)

However, operational concentration in Hawaii and aging refinery assets could quickly undermine the upbeat forecasts if disruptions or costly outages occur.

Another View: Discounted Cash Flow Model

Looking at things from a different angle, our DCF model currently sees Par Pacific shares as trading above fair value. This takes into account expected future cash flows and not just earnings multiples. Could market optimism be running too far ahead, or is something being missed?

The global celebration brought together leaders, policymakers, and industry experts to discuss strategies for building a more resilient and inclusive tourism sector.

The event was hosted in collaboration with Malaysia’s Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture and coincided with the 7th World Tourism Conference. Delegates from across the globe gathered in the historic city to share innovative ideas and showcase sustainable practices that align with global tourism development goals.

Global Leaders Call for Sustainable Transformation

The opening ceremony featured remarks from Malaysian officials and international representatives. Malaysia’s Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture, H.E. Dato Sri Tiong King Sing, welcomed participants and underscored the importance of tourism in promoting resilience and inclusivity. The Right Honourable Dato’ Sri Haji Fadillah bin Yusof, Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, officiated the opening on behalf of the Prime Minister, stressing the need for sustainable growth supported by innovation and cooperation.

In his official address, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres stated, “Tourism is a powerful driver of transformation. It creates jobs, fuels local economies, and builds bridges across cultures. Yet, it must be sustainable to protect the very places and communities it celebrates. Let’s harness tourism as a force for resilience, sustainability, and shared progress.”

UN Tourism Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili emphasized the global significance of the Melaka gathering. “World Tourism Day 2025 in Melaka has shown the world that tourism can be a force for good when guided by sustainability and inclusivity. By working together, we can transform tourism into a tool for empowerment, cultural preservation, and environmental protection,” he said.

Malaysia Showcases Initiatives and Joins INSTO

The Deputy Prime Minister highlighted Malaysia’s initiatives to balance economic development with environmental and social responsibility. He pointed to projects that expand high-value tourism segments, create digital nomad hubs, and invest in sustainable aviation fuel. He also cited Malaysia’s efforts to promote community-led ecotourism and announced that Malaysia will join the UN Tourism International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO) with a pilot project in Mersing, Johor.

The celebrations in Melaka included panel discussions, cultural showcases, and exhibitions focusing on sustainable tourism strategies. These sessions emphasized the importance of investing in education and skills development, particularly for women, youth, and marginalized communities. Delegates also discussed accelerating digital transformation in tourism, supporting local economies, and reinforcing cultural heritage through tourism-driven exchange.

“Growth must be inclusive and resilient, underpinned by sustainability, innovation, and global cooperation,” said the Deputy Prime Minister, noting that Malaysia aims to serve as a model for responsible tourism development in the Asia-Pacific region.

World Tourism Conference 2025 and Future Outlook

The 7th World Tourism Conference, held alongside the World Tourism Day celebrations, provided a framework for international collaboration on sustainable tourism. Discussions centered on digital transformation, community-based tourism, and climate-neutral travel solutions, aligning with the year’s theme of “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation.” The conference also highlighted how technology and innovation can address challenges in tourism while expanding opportunities for growth.

Delegates stressed the importance of supporting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises to ensure tourism benefits reach local communities. The event also featured cultural performances and culinary showcases that reinforced tourism’s role in preserving traditions while fostering global understanding.

At the closing session, Malaysia formally handed over the hosting of World Tourism Day to El Salvador. World Tourism Day 2026 will be held under the theme “Digital Agenda and Artificial Intelligence to redesign tourism,” focusing on how digital transformation and AI can reshape the global tourism industry.

Aero, a boutique airline, now offers a 12-passenger Gulfstream IV flight from Van Nuys to Kahului at a starting price of $5,495 each way.

The flights operate as ""scheduled charters,"" a loophole that allows Aero to sidestep Van Nuys Airport's ban on scheduled service. The airport, considered a haven for private jet users, has long been shielded from commercial operations. That exclusivity is part of why the move has sparked backlash, with some wealthy jet owners and residents worried about increased traffic.

Critics point out that small-scale charter flights contribute to aviation's already hefty environmental footprint. Private and semi-private flights emit more planet-warming carbon pollution per passenger than commercial airlines. And with AI-fueled tech expansions driving electricity demand and rising temperatures across the globe, lavish short-haul flights highlight a disconnect between luxury and sustainability.

Communities have seen similar battles before. For example, JSX's operations in New Jersey's Teterboro Airport prompted regulatory pushback, while airlines like Southwest and American have lobbied against scheduled charters to protect their turf.

View From The Wing argues that smaller part 135 carriers could be a gateway to the development of electric planes. On the other hand, multiple news outlets have covered the reactions of those living near Van Nuys Airport, with many of them saying the pollution is worsening their health. In fact, the California EPA found that children living in Lake Balboa near Van Nuys Airport are in the 90th percentile of lead exposure in the state.

While Aero's flights may appeal to a small, affluent audience, the controversy underscores the need for better climate-friendly aviation policies. Alternatives, such as electric planes and investments in sustainable aviation fuel, could make a difference.

The airline, which had been navigating a post-pandemic recovery, now faces new headwinds as it seeks to restore operational stability and passenger confidence.

Labour Dispute hits Peak Travel Season

The strike by cabin crew union CUPE in August led to the cancellation of over 3,000 flights, impacting both domestic and international schedules during the critical summer travel window. Passengers faced delays, refunds, and re-bookings, while the airline scrambled to mitigate reputational fallout. Although the labour dispute has since moved to binding arbitration, the operational and financial effects were swift and severe.

Revised Outlook Reflects Caution

Air Canada has now revised its expectations for the remainder of 2025. While the airline stopped short of painting a bleak picture, it acknowledged that the disruption forced a rethink of capacity plans and cost forecasts. Executives pointed to continued strength in passenger demand but noted rising unit costs and lower-than-expected cash flow projections. The carrier is taking a more measured approach to network growth heading into the winter season.

Updated guidance now pegs full-year adjusted EBITDA between $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion, down from an earlier range of $3.2 billion to $3.6 billion. Capacity growth has been revised to 0.5% to 1.5%, while unit costs are expected to rise to 14.60 to 14.70 cents per seat mile. Free cash flow is projected between $50 million and $150 million, with the labour disruption estimated to have cost the airline $375 million.

Focus Shifts to Recovery and Stability

Despite the setback, Air Canada remains focused on long-term recovery. Management highlighted ongoing investments in fleet modernisation and digital infrastructure. However, rebuilding customer trust and avoiding further industrial unrest will be key as the airline looks to end the year on steadier ground.

Lebih dari 40 ribu putra-putri bangsa, bernaung di Pertamina Group. Perwira (sebutan bagi Pekerja Pertamina) berkarya dari Sabang sampai Merauke, bahkan hingga ke wilayah kerja Pertamina di luar negeri, untuk memastikan tersedianya energi di Indonesia.

Vice President Corporate Communication PT Pertamina (Persero) Fadjar Djoko Santoso mengungkapkan, wilayah operasional Pertamina yang berada di seluruh Nusantara menjadi bagian tak terpisahkan dari kebutuhan tenaga kerja. Untuk memenuhi kebutuhan tersebut, Pertamina secara berkala merekrut putra-putri daerah, guna menjalankan bisnis serta memastikan produktivitas dan kehandalan operasional berjalan dengan baik.

“Kami menyadari, energi merupakan kebutuhan dasar dan hajat hidup orang banyak. Sehingga, Pertamina mempersiapkan Perwira, tak hanya untuk sigap dalam menghadapi tantangan energi, juga melayani pelanggan dan konsumen Pertamina dengan lebih baik,” jelas Fadjar.

Peningkatan layanan terus dilakukan dengan berbagai perbaikan, agar dapat memenuhi kebutuhan energi selama 24 jam per hari, dari berbagai aspek. Perwira dari sektor hulu, pengolahan, distribusi, hingga berada di garda depan penjualan ke konsumen, memahami pentingnya layanan terbaik bagi masyarakat.

Salah satu contoh peningkatan layanan melalui SPBU Signature, yang memberikan pengalaman baru bagi konsumen saat mengisi bahan bakar.

Berlokasi di Jalan Sultan Iskandar Muda, Jakarta Selatan ini memilik fasilitas umum yang lengkap, mulai dari musala bersih dengan perlengkapan salat (mukena, sarung, dan Al-Quran), area wudhu, hingga toilet yang bersih. Selain itu, keramahan Operator SPBU makin terasa karena Operator dapat menawarkan paket semir ban gratis.

Pertamina juga terus memperluas jaringan gas rumah tangga, sebagai diversifikasi energi yang dapat mempermudah masyarakat menggunakan gas alam untuk huniannya.

Pertamina juga berinovasi pada energi transisi dan ramah lingkungan seperti Biosolar, Pertamax Green, hingga yang terbaru Sustainable Aviation Fuel, menjadi langkah Pertamina untuk menjaga kelestarian lingkungan.

Seiring dengan meningkatnya kebutuhan energi, Pertamina bahkan terus membuka lapangan kerja sejalan pengembangan fasilitas-fasilitas operasi Pertamina. Sepanjang tahun 2024, Pertamina menjaring 1.603 talenta baru yang tak sekedar bekerja, namun terus dibekali pemahaman dan keterampilan sehingga produktivitasnya selalu meningkat.

“Beberapa tahun terakhir, Pertamina terus melakukan rekrutmen pekerja baru. Hal ini dimaksudkan untuk menjaga tingkat produktivitas, kaderisasi dan memastikan hadirnya talenta-talenta untuk mendukung peningkatan layanan Pertamina kepada masyarakat,” ujar Fadjar.

Salah seorang Perwira yakni Ferdy Saputra, saat ini bertugas di Kilang Pertamina Internasional Refinery Unit VII Kasim (Papua). Sudah hampir dua tahun, ia meninggalkan keluarganya yang tinggal di Jakarta, untuk mengabdikan dirinya di wilayah timur Indonesia.

Bekerja jauh, ia tak leluasa untuk sering pulang. Dalam satu bulan, Ferdy hanya bisa sekali pulang ke Jakarta, sesuai ketentuan Perusahaan. Namun, ijin libur tak serta merta diberikan terutama bila operasional kilang ataupun situasi tidak memungkinkan.

“Saya memahami pentingnya keberlangsungan energi, terutama di Kilang Kasim yang kapasitas pengolahannya terbatas namun sangat diperlukan untuk menopang suplai energi di Papua. Tanggung jawab berada disini cukup besar, Perwira Kasim harus menjaga operasional sekaligus menjaga stabilitas sosial dengan masyarakat,” jelasnya.

Yang terpenting baginya, Ferdy menambahkan, adalah menjaga keandalan operasional kilang untuk berjalan aman, lancar dan berproduksi optimal meskipun berada jauh dari perkotaan. Ia pun bangga, dapat berkontribusi bagi masyarakat, turut membangun ekonomi di Papua Barat Daya, serta memberi energi bagi kebutuhan nasional.

Pertamina sebagai perusahaan pemimpin di bidang transisi energi, berkomitmen dalam mendukung target net zero emission 2060 dengan terus mendorong program-program yang berdampak langsung pada capaian Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

“Very soon we will be putting up coal blocks with potential for underground coal gasification up for auction,” said Additional Coal Secretary Rupinder Brar, highlighting the government’s intent to integrate UCG into India’s commercial coal mining ecosystem.

These blocks will be offered under the Commercial Coal Mine Auction regime, marking a significant policy shift towards enabling in-situ gasification of deep-seated coal reserves.

UCG: A Cleaner Way to Tap Deep Coal Reserves

With nearly 43% of India’s coal reserves located at depths greater than 300 meters, UCG presents a viable method to convert otherwise unmineable coal into syngas, which can be processed into hydrogen, methanol, ethanol, synthetic diesel, SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel), and petrochemical feedstocks.

UCG involves the controlled combustion of coal seams underground using oxidants like air or oxygen, eliminating the need for traditional mining. The government is targeting gasification of 100 million tonnes of coal by 2030, positioning UCG as a cornerstone of its energy strategy.

Inter-Ministerial Committee to Oversee UCG Guidelines

To facilitate this transformation, an inter-ministerial committee has been established to draft mining guidelines and integrate UCG into the auction process. The committee comprises experts from the Coal Ministry, DGH, DGMS, Central Ground Water Board, CMPDIL, and the Coal Controller Organisation (CCO).

Coal Gasification Incentive Scheme: Rs 2,500 Cr RfP to be Issued

In parallel, the Ministry of Coal will issue a Request for Proposal (RfP) next week to allocate the remaining Rs 2,500 crore under its Rs 8,500 crore coal gasification incentive scheme. The scheme, launched in 2023, has already allocated around Rs 6,000 crore across three project categories:

Category I (PSU/JVs):

Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Ltd (CIL-BHEL JV) – Rs 1,350 crore for Lakhanpur, Odisha

CIL-GAIL JV – Rs 1,350 crore for Sonepur Bazari, West Bengal

Category II (Private and PSU Projects):

New Era Cleantech Solution Pvt Ltd

Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL)

Greta Energy Ltd

Category III (Demonstration Projects):

New Era Cleantech’s coal-to-ethanol project in Chandrapur, Maharashtra – Rs 100 crore

Challenges Remain, But Opportunities Expand

While underground coal gasification remains technologically complex and capital-intensive, the government believes the auction of UCG-designated blocks will unlock private sector innovation and investments in large-scale gasification technologies.

Though India has yet to commission a commercial-scale UCG plant, the recent pilot project at Kasta coal block in Jharkhand—executed by Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) in collaboration with Canada’s Ergo Exergy Technologies Inc (EETI)—is a key step in demonstrating UCG’s feasibility.

Now, that incredible journey has officially come to an end. Boeing has closed the production line of this iconic jet, marking the conclusion of one of the most successful widebody aircraft programs in aviation history.

A Historic Chapter Closes

According to Boeing’s 2024 delivery records, the company handed over just one final 777-300ER this year. That delivery quietly closed the book on a legendary aircraft that has shaped commercial aviation since its debut in 2004.

The development was first reported by The Air Current and represents a major milestone—not only for Boeing, but for the entire airline industry.

The Aircraft That Changed the Game

When the 777-300ER entered service two decades ago, it revolutionized long-haul air travel. With a remarkable range of 7,370 nautical miles, powered by the mighty General Electric GE90 engines, it delivered what airlines had long been waiting for: a reliable, fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft that could carry nearly 400 passengers across oceans with ease.

It quickly became the world’s best-selling widebody aircraft. Carriers from every corner of the globe added it to their fleets, cementing Boeing’s reputation for engineering innovation and market foresight. Its balance of performance, passenger comfort, and operational efficiency made it the backbone of international routes for years.

The Shift Toward the 777X

Despite Boeing Commercial Airplanes CEO Stephanie Pope’s announcement in December about resuming production across several aircraft lines following a machinists’ strike, the 777-300ER will no longer roll off the assembly line.

The future now belongs to the 777X, Boeing’s next-generation widebody that carries forward the 777 legacy with new technology, improved aerodynamics, and advanced passenger comfort features.

Certification Challenges Ahead

Even as Boeing celebrates the legacy of the 777-300ER, the company faces ongoing regulatory hurdles. It has requested relief through October 2028 to achieve full compliance and retrofit delivered aircraft. These certification delays mirror challenges with the 737 Max 7 and Max 10 variants.

A key part of this process involves safety systems. While all 737 Max aircraft use similar Stall Management Yaw Damper (SMYD) systems, the Max 10 introduces an Enhanced Angle of Attack (EAOA) feature.

This improvement, designed in the aftermath of earlier Max accidents, aims to boost error detection in angle-of-attack data across the fleet. Boeing argues that without regulatory exemptions, its ability to roll out these safety upgrades could be slowed—leaving uncertainty around FAA decisions and timelines.

A Legacy That Will Endure

With the last 777-300ER now delivered, the aircraft takes its place in history as one of Boeing’s greatest successes. For airlines, crews, and millions of passengers who have flown aboard it, the jet represents more than just engineering excellence—it represents reliability, progress, and the thrill of global connection.

The skies may no longer see new 777-300ERs taking flight, but its legacy will live on for decades, both through the aircraft still in service and the new 777X generation it inspired.",https://i0.wp.com/jetlinemarvel.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/boeing-777x-production_70961.jpg?resize=800%2C532&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-27 23:56:21.179848

Speaking at the opening of World Tourism Day (WTD) 2025 and the seventh World Tourism Conference (WTC) 2025, Fadillah, who represented Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, announced that the country’s first biomass-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility is scheduled to begin operations in 2027.

“The elephant in the room is tourism emissions, especially from aviation, which accounts for half of the sector’s direct emissions. No country can shift an industry of this scale alone, so multilateral cooperation is crucial for a sustainable future,” he said in his keynote address at a hotel in Taman Melaka Raya.

Tourism, Arts and Culture Minister Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing and Melaka Chief Minister Datuk Seri Ab Rauf Yusoh were also present.

SAF, produced from waste oils and agricultural residues, is seen as a key tool in cutting aviation emissions. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates global production will double to two million tonnes this year, but that still makes up less than 1% of total airline fuel use.

Fadillah said Malaysia’s tourism strategy places environmental protection at its core. As one of the world’s 12 megadiverse nations, Malaysia is home to more than 15,000 plant species and 175,000 fauna species. “We must protect rainforests, mangroves and coral reefs not only as a national duty but a global responsibility,” he said, adding that healthy ecosystems also attract visitors and support local livelihoods.

Highlighting Johor’s Mersing as a success story, he said the former fishing village is now a pioneer of sustainable coastal tourism and will soon host Malaysia’s first UN Tourism-recognised observatory under the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO).

He said the country is prioritising high-value tourism segments such as nature-based travel, adventure tourism, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness tourism, educational journeys, business events and digital nomad hubs. “The backbone of our plan is to grow meaningfully, sustainably and with resilience,” he added.

Meanwhile, Tiong urged the industry to move beyond rhetoric. “This cannot be another feel-good meeting where we shake hands, make statements and return a year later to the same unresolved issues and call it ‘progress’,” he said.

Tiong stressed that innovation and measurable outcomes are essential to tackle issues such as over-tourism, inequality and environmental strain. He pointed to local models such as Sabah’s Miso Walai Homestay, which safeguards rainforests while supporting 350 families, and Penang’s conservation-driven initiatives, including the Penang Heritage Trust.

To strengthen accountability, he said his ministry is working with the Statistics Department to pilot UN Tourism’s sustainability indicators and embed them in the Tourism Satellite Account. Businesses are also being encouraged to adopt benchmarks such as GSTC, ESG, B-Corp and INSTO.

This year, five Malaysian hotels won ASEAN Green Hotel Awards. “Growth alone is no longer enough. We must protect ecosystems, ease congestion, spread visitor flows and ensure value stays with local communities.

Operated by a cooperative of local farmers, the plant will use pig and cattle manure along with other agricultural residues from the region. It is designed to process around 370,000 tonnes of feedstock every year. “With this project, we are fostering rural development and unlocking the potential of bioenergy production for transport, maritime, and industry sectors,” said Tomas Carlmon of BVS. He added that the plant would help make “Fully Green LBG” available across the Nordics.

The facility will feature five digesters with a total capacity of nearly 32,000 cubic metres. Each digester will handle feedstocks separately to ensure optimal processing. To maintain hygiene, the digestate will undergo heating at over 52°C for ten hours before storage. Heat exchangers and industrial heat pumps will improve energy efficiency by recycling heat, which also helps lower the carbon intensity of the biomethane.

The project also includes cooperation with Dutch bio-LNG specialist Nordsol. EnviTec’s EnviThan technology will upgrade biomethane to 98% methane, while Nordsol’s patented Flash-2-Sweep process will purify and liquefy it into bio-LNG without using chemicals or molecular sieves.

Finnair’s Innovation in Ancillary Bundles

In May 2025, Finnair became the first airline to fully implement Amadeus’ ‘native order’ technology, replacing legacy systems with a single integrated customer record. This shift enables more sophisticated, retail-style offers and marks a milestone in Finnair retail innovation 2025.

The airline introduced its first ancillary bundles in September. The debut package pairs seat selection with in-flight Wi-Fi connection at discounted rates during booking. The rollout will begin in selected European markets before expanding across all Finnair routes later this autumn.

While airlines offer bundles in various forms, they key innovation is Finnair’s use of the new-generation booking platform to create dynamic and personalised product combinations. Future bundles are expected to include lounge access, meals and priority boarding.

How it worked before

Previously, airlines relied on multiple records for a single journey: A Passenger Name Record (PNR) for bookings, an electronic ticket for the flight, and separate documents for every add-on, such as: baggage, meals, or Wi-Fi. This fragmented system was inefficient. If a flight changed, multiple records had to be updated manually, slowing the process for both passengers and airlines.

How it works now

Simpler self-service: Passengers can add extras like baggage or upgrades directly into the same record.

A future ‘journey pass’: One digital file could eventually replace tickets, boarding passes and receipts.

Better support during delays: With the full trip stored in one order, Finnair can rebook flights and update connecting services, such as taxis and hotels, more efficiently.

Personalised bundles: Airlines can combine products in flexible ways, similar to online shopping. For Example, the Finnair ancillary bundle pairing seat selection with in-flight Wi-Fi at a discounted price.

With the new system, everything is combined into a single ‘order’, recording different elements into one place for the entire journey. This make it easier to manage information and allowing the integration of more personalised services.

Finnair is Scaling Up SAF investment

In parallel with its retail initiatives like ancillary bundles, Finnair is expanding its Sustainable Aviation Fuel program, aiming to boost voluntary SAF purchases by 50% in 2025, while meeting the EU’s 2% SAF blending requirement. The mandate requires fuel suppliers must mix a minimum of 2% SAF into the aviation fuel supplied at EU airports starting in 2025, with the requirement set to rise progressively to 70% by 2050.

Passengers can also contribute directly. Since late 2024, Finnair has offered customers the option to co-fund SAF during the booing process. The first passenger-supported fuel purchase was completed in July 2025.

In September, the airline expanded its reach with the Finnair for Business SAF service, giving corporate and cargo clients the ability to co-invest in SAF. Using a ‘book-and-claim’ system, companies receive audited certificates for their sustainability reporting, aligning with Finnair SAF investment strategy goals.

Finnair is also engaged in SAF innovation. In August, the carrier partnered with Finnish technology company Liquid Sun, along with ABB, Fortum and Finavia, on a demonstration pilot to produce eSAF, a synthetic fuel made from atmospheric carbon and solar power.

Revenue Opportunities and Emission Commitment

The twin strategy of retail innovation and sustainability are closely linked. By introducing ancillary bundles, Finnair is opening new revenue channels, while its expanded SAF program underpins its Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) goals.

Finnair aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, relying on a mix of increased SAF use, operational efficiencies and eventual fleet renewal. By aligning retail innovation with its SAF investment strategy, the airline is working to balance commercial growth with long-term climate commitments in aviation.

He said nature-based tourism is among the high-value segments Malaysia is prioritising, alongside adventure travel, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness offerings, educational journeys, business events and digital-nomad hub.

""The backbone of our plan is to grow meaningfully, sustainably and with resilience"" he added.

Meanwhile, Tiong, in his address, warned that the sector must confront hard truths and deliver measurable outcomes.

“This cannot be another feel-good meeting where we shake hands, make statements and return a year later to the same unresolved issues and call it ‘progress’.

""The WTD and WTC 2025 must break from old approaches. We cannot rely on yesterday’s methods to solve today’s problems.

""Innovation is no longer a luxury but it's a necessity,” he said.

He said global tourism faces mounting pressures, among others, over-tourism strains fragile sites, inequality limits local benefits and competitiveness now hinges on real change.

Tiong said solutions are already taking shape at home.

In Sabah, he said the Miso Walai Homestay safeguards rainforest ecosystems while supporting over 350 families.

""Penang's habitat reinvests tourism receipts into conservation and training, while the Penang Heritage Trust protects living heritage.

""Mersing’s upcoming UN-recognised observatory will add data-driven oversight to coastal sustainability efforts,"" he said.

Tiong said to track progress nationally, his ministry with the Statistics Department is piloting UN Tourism’s sustainability indicators (MST) with plans to embed them in the Tourism Satellite Account.

He encouraged businesses to adopt international benchmarks such as GSTC, ESG, B-Corp and INSTO participation, noting that five Malaysian hotels received Asean Green Hotel Awards this year.

“Growth alone is no longer enough. We must protect ecosystems, ease congestion, spread visitor flows and ensure value stays with local communities. Sustainable, inclusive transformation is not optional but essential,"" he added.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2025/09/27/3542575.JPG,N,,2025-09-27 10:56:53.792088

NEW YORK, USA – His Majesty the King has expressed appreciation for American investors endorsing Eswatini as an ideal investment destination.

This too place yesterday during a business seminarhosted by the Ministry of Commerce, Trade and Industry, held on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly.

Facilitated by the Eswatini Investment promotion Authority (EIPA), the seminar featured testimonials from US companies, highlighting Eswatini’s stable environment and high-return potential. His Majesty praised the commitments as a vote of confidence in the Kingdom’s vision for economic growth.

The Vice President for Global Public Policy, Environmental Sustainability, and Social Impact at The Coca-Cola Company, Michael Goltzman, delivered a strong endorsement. “It is a pleasure to be here on behalf of The Coca-Cola Company and our system, including 30 authorised franchise bottlers across Africa,” he said.

“Founded in the US, we have grown globally, producing and distributing locally. We have been in Africa since 1928 and in Eswatini for four decades. In 2024, our system contributed over US$10 billion in added value to African economies, supporting more than one million jobs through local sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution,” he said.

He noted Coca-Cola’s state-of-the-art facility in Eswatini, which manufactures and exports concentrates to over 24 African countries, employing more than 200 locals. “Eswatini offers efficient logistics, infrastructure, and ease of capital movement. Eswatini’s growth represents our growth, and we are thankful for the government’s support. We encourage others to explore these opportunities ” he urged.

Several US firms announced investment intentions, underscoring Eswatini’s appeal.

A representative from Powerlink International said: “We will bring micro-hydro units to Eswatini’s canal systems, which are among the most pristine assessed globally. Eswatini is our preferred place for micro-hydro and wave energy solutions.”

A member of Sun Africa added: “As the largest solar energy company operating abroad, we are working with the Minister of Electricity on comprehensive renewable energy projects to support energy and water sustainability, security and growth.”

A representative from GTI Energy, stated: “We are pleased to bring specialised technology converting waste into valuable products like power, fuels, chemicals, and ammonia, offering these to Eswatini.”

Wilson from Barr Global said: “As an advisory firm, we secure capital to ensure projects work economically and financially. We are honoured to participate and look forward to collective success.”

Alan Kessler, CEO of African Food Security, said: “We are an agricultural trading, processing, and farming company. We look forward to collaborating with the Ministry of Agriculture, the African Development Bank and the US Government to drive primary agriculture, introducing Michigan State University for smallholder farmer support and advancing cotton, barley, and sugar derivatives. Eswatini’s stability under the monarchy makes it our focus in Africa.”

Yad Amad, President of Avalon Energy Group, presented: “We have 30 years’ experience building eco-industrial parks. Our US$418 million project, developed with EIPA and others, will produce sustainable aviation fuel and biodiesel from non-edible crops, integrated with agriculture. This will reverse oil import dependency, supplying regional needs and powering the airport fully from local fuels, impacting GDP by 3.9%.”

In his address, His Majesty expressed appreciation at the endorsements. “Our trade with the US, shaped by the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) until September 30, 2025, benefits from a 10 per cent tax tariff from the US, making Eswatini prime for accessing US and African markets.”

He outlined Eswatini’s offerings as a business-friendly environment with progressive policies, streamlined regulations, and robust property rights. “We have launched a one-stop shop, reformed immigration for residency-by-investment, extended border hours to 24/7, established a commercial court, updated the Companies Act and digitised registration,” he shared.

He described the country as having top regional infratsructure road networks, efficient ports access, a local airline, nationwide internet, reliable water and electricity. “We invite US companies to establish an American industrial park with allocated land and expedited approvals,” he said.

“We thank Coca-Cola for their decades-long experience and welcome new commitments. Our team is ready for discussions. Invest in Eswatini—you will not be disappointed. Our New York mission is available for follow-ups,” he concluded.

Minister Savannah Maziya says investors won’t regret.

Minister for Information, Communications and Technology, Savannah Maziya, turned on the charm to woo US investors to the kingdom. Given a brief moment by Commerce Minister Manqoba Khumalo, Maziya described the country as 1.2 million strong, land-linked with access to 100 million people in SADC, 150 million in COMESA, and a billion in Africa, which is set to be 25 per cent of the world’s 10 billion people in 20 years.

“We must position as Africa’s gateway, not a secret. In ICT, we installed nationwide microwave connectivity last year and are expanding fibre optics with World Bank help to attract data centres and manufacturing,” she said.

She emphasised cost-effective data, green power abundance, and partnerships like Starlink and SpaceX discussions as some of the country’s best offerings. “The Royal Science and Technology Park is our engine for robotics, biotechnology, and large language models,” she shared, adding that investors seek reliable utilities, talent, friendly legislation, peace, and consistent leadership, all of which are present under His Majesty’s vision.

Cabinet Ministers’ Presentations

Ernest Mkhonta, CEO of the Eswatini Electricity Company, also had an opportunity to outline energy opportunities: “We import 70% of electricity, generating only 30% locally (60 MW hydro, 10 MW solar). We need 250 MW; opportunities in geothermal, coal, mini-hydros (10 MW), Maguga Expansion (30 MW), and a new dam (120 MW), requiring US$130 million,” he explained.

The Minister for Agriculture, Mandla Tshawuka, highlighted agri-opportunities: “We upscale food production for security and exports, focusing on wheat and soybeans. Investors can engage in processing, cold storage at the airport, mechanisation, irrigation, and finance. A major dam project is underway to integrate agriculture, energy, and tourism,” he said. The CEO of EIPA, Sibani Mngomezulu, went into detail regarding the opportunities available in the kingdom.",https://eswatinipositivenews.online/storage/2025/09/00-169.png,N,,2025-09-27 14:56:19.884016

Speaking on the second day of the International Conference on Bio-energy and Technologies’ (IBET) ‘Transition to Net Zero’ session at Yashobhoomi, the Minister stressed the unique potential of bio-energy to be a pillar of energy security, create rural jobs, and drive climate action.

A message conveyed via video conference at IBET 2025 from Hardeep Singh Puri, Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas, reaffirmed the commitment to the 500 GW non-fossil fuel capacity goal, confirming that as of September 2025, India has already installed 251.5 GW of this capacity.

Bio-energy, Naik explained, is the critical missing links that can help India achieve its clean energy transition while simultaneously empowering its vast agricultural sector. By converting surplus agricultural residue, animal dung, and municipal waste into energy, the sector embodies a true ‘waste-to-wealth’ model, effectively turning farmers from traditional food providers (Annadata) into energy providers (Urjadata).

The Minister highlighted the remarkable progress already achieved under the Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership. He stated that India has already surpassed one of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets years ahead of schedule.

“Currently, 50 per cent of country’s installed power capacity now comes from non-fossil fuel sources, placing India among the top renewable energy markets globally. Despite this early success, he cautioned that this momentum must be scaled up significantly. He underscored, “Reaching 500 gigawatts of renewable energy by 2030 and net zero by 2070 requires bio-energy to play its full role.”

The Minister specifically urged policymakers, industries, innovators, and farmers to immediately scale up technologies, strengthen research and development (R&D), and ensure fair and robust biomass supply chains.

The core message from the conference was that bio-energy represents more than just a climate solution; it is a model for inclusive and sustainable growth. Investing in biogas and biomass projects directly empowers rural communities, Naik stated.

“By supporting these projects, we provide clean cooking solutions, involve women in sustainable livelihoods, and turn agricultural residues and waste into both energy and income.”

To accelerate this national transformation, the Government of India has launched a series of flagship initiatives. These include the National Bio-energy Programme, the Sustainable Alternative Towards Affordable Transportation (SATAT) scheme, the Galvanizing Organic Bio-Agro Resources Dhan (GOBAR-Dhan) initiative, the National Green Hydrogen Mission, and the SAMARTH Mission.

These programmes are designed to drive massive investment, foster innovation, and fast-track the adoption of bio-energy across the country. The Minister also noted India’s leading role internationally, actively engaging with BRICS, ASEAN, and the Global Biofuel Alliance, positioning the nation as a global hub for sustainable biofuels.

The conference also detailed the immense environmental benefits of advanced biofuels. Dr. SSV Ramakumar, Chairperson of IFGE (Sustainable Aviation Fuel Forum), discussed the significant carbon reduction potential of next-generation ethanol. He pointed out that while first-generation ethanol reduces the carbon footprint from 94 CO2 equivalents per megajoule to 55, “with second-generation ethanol, the carbon footprint will come down to below 20 CO2 equivalent per megajoule of energy.” This vastly increases its power in achieving net-zero goals.

Datuk Seri Fadillah Yusof, the Deputy Prime Minister, has emphasized the importance of these initiatives and the need to address tourism-related emissions, especially those from aviation, which accounts for a significant amount of the sector’s direct emissions. With a bold plan in place, Malaysia hopes to take the lead in developing eco-friendly travel options and promote economic expansion by generating green jobs.

A Bold Step Towards Sustainable Aviation

The Malaysian government has set a landmark goal for the aviation sector by announcing the creation of the country’s first biomass-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) facility, which is slated to begin operations in 2027. SAF, produced from sustainable resources such as waste oils and agricultural residues, holds the key to reducing aviation emissions, with the fuel being considered one of the most crucial decarbonisation tools in the industry.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the global SAF output is expected to double in 2025, though it currently accounts for only 0.7% of total airline fuel use. Malaysia’s investment in SAF production will not only provide a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuels but also create a new sector within the economy, leading to high-value jobs and sustainable industry growth.

The Deputy Prime Minister further highlighted that collaboration on a multilateral scale is essential for the successful decarbonisation of the global aviation industry. Malaysia’s role in this larger context is crucial, as no single nation can shift an industry of aviation’s magnitude alone. Fadillah stressed that such efforts are necessary not only for the country’s sustainable future but for the global community.

Nature as the Cornerstone of Malaysia’s Tourism Strategy

Tourism in Malaysia is intrinsically linked to its abundant natural resources, with the country being one of the world’s 12 megadiverse nations. Malaysia is home to over 15,000 plant species and 175,000 species of fauna, which make it an unparalleled destination for nature-based tourism. Fadillah emphasized the importance of protecting the country’s rainforests, mangroves, and coral reefs, not only for national pride but also as a shared global responsibility. These ecosystems, when preserved, become powerful magnets for tourists, while supporting the livelihoods of local communities.

The government has also made it clear that tourism in Malaysia will be shaped around sustainability and environmental stewardship. This approach is already being implemented through several pioneering initiatives, including sustainable coastal tourism projects in Mersing, Johor. Once a modest fishing village, Mersing has transformed into a leader in sustainable tourism practices. The village is now preparing to host Malaysia’s first UN-recognised sustainable tourism observatory under the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories.

Embracing Nature-Based Tourism

Malaysia is focusing on nature-based tourism as one of its high-priority segments. This approach taps into the growing demand for eco-tourism, which is seen as a way to protect natural heritage while providing meaningful travel experiences. Along with nature tourism, the country is also investing in other promising travel segments, including adventure tourism, Muslim-friendly services, medical and wellness tourism, educational journeys, business events, and digital-nomad hubs. These initiatives reflect Malaysia’s commitment to creating diverse, sustainable tourism experiences that benefit both visitors and local communities.

Innovation in Sustainable Tourism Practices

Minister of Tourism, Arts and Culture Datuk Seri Tiong King Sing, in his address at the World Tourism Day (WTD) and World Tourism Conference (WTC) 2025, called for a more proactive approach in addressing global tourism challenges. He pointed out that the sector must confront hard truths and avoid the trap of merely making statements without delivering tangible outcomes. He stressed that innovation in tourism is not a luxury but a necessity, as global tourism faces several pressures such as over-tourism, inequality in tourism benefits, and environmental sustainability challenges.

Malaysia has already begun implementing innovative solutions to address these concerns. For instance, in Sabah, the Miso Walai Homestay is not only preserving rainforest ecosystems but also supporting over 350 families. In Penang, the reinvestment of tourism receipts into conservation and local training programs further highlights the country’s focus on sustainable development. Meanwhile, the Mersing tourism observatory is expected to provide valuable data-driven insights into coastal sustainability efforts, allowing for better management and more informed decision-making in the future.

National Sustainability Indicators for Tourism

To ensure that sustainability efforts are on track, the Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture is piloting the United Nations Tourism Sustainability Indicators (MST). This initiative is part of Malaysia’s commitment to embedding sustainability measures into the Tourism Satellite Account, a tool used to track the economic and environmental performance of the tourism sector. With these indicators, Malaysia aims to achieve transparent, measurable progress on its sustainability goals, ensuring that tourism growth does not come at the expense of the environment or local communities.

Commitment to Green Certifications and International Standards

In line with global efforts, Malaysia encourages businesses in the tourism sector to adopt international sustainability benchmarks such as the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles, B-Corp certification, and participation in the International Network of Sustainable Tourism Observatories (INSTO). Malaysia’s recognition of five hotels with ASEAN Green Hotel Awards this year reflects the growing emphasis on sustainability within the local hospitality industry.

The Path Forward: Inclusive Growth with Environmental Responsibility

The government of Malaysia is clear about its priorities as it continues to steer the country toward sustainable tourism and aviation. In addition to increasing tourism, the objective is to do so in a way that benefits local communities, is inclusive, and is environmentally conscious. According to Tiong, sustainable growth in the tourism industry is crucial for the long-term well-being of both the industry and the environment.

To sum up, Malaysia has a bold, multipronged strategy for sustainable tourism and aviation that incorporates community engagement, innovation, and environmental preservation. The nation is establishing itself as a global leader in the development of sustainable tourism as it strives to reach its 2027 SAF milestone and expands its ecotourism offerings. In addition to protecting Malaysia’s natural beauty, this dedication to sustainability will provide its people with long-term economic opportunities, guaranteeing that tourism will flourish for many more generations.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Malaysia-60.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 10:57:15.423461

After a decade of turbulence, the flag carrier has entered what it calls a ""commercial elevation journey,"" opening new routes, modernising its fleet, and betting on premium service over low-cost competition.

Dersenish Aresandiran, chief commercial officer of Airlines at Malaysia Aviation Group, believes the airline has entered a bold new era of transformation, one defined by premium service, sustainability, and a return to global prominence. In this exclusive interview with The Daily Star's Commercial Editor Ehsanur Raza, he explains how Bangladesh and South Asia are at the heart of that comeback story.

Global Strategy & Recovery

The Daily Star (TDS): Malaysia Airlines has navigated a demanding decade. What is the current vision for its global brand positioning, and how do you see the airline competing against aggressive Gulf and low-cost carriers?

Dersenish Aresandiran (DA): We have entered a new phase of transformation. Our ""commercial elevation journey"" has seen nine new routes launched in just 24 months, a strong rebound in premium demand, and a clear shift from low-fare competition. Today, our vision is simple yet bold: to return Malaysia Airlines to the global top 10 by 2030, driven by network expansion, brand rejuvenation, and an elevated customer experience.

We are no longer competing head-to-head with low-cost carriers. Instead, we offer a full-service, high-value proposition anchored in authentic Malaysian Hospitality, supported by modern in-flight offerings and seamless connectivity via Kuala Lumpur. In competitive markets such as Bangladesh, where passengers prioritise reliability, comfort, and cost efficiency, this premium positioning truly sets us apart.

TDS: With sustainability now driving aviation strategy, what commitments or innovations are Malaysia Airlines pursuing to reduce carbon emissions?

DA: Sustainability is central to our growth model. We are rolling out fuel-efficient A330neos and expanding the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with plans to scale up local production by 2027.

We also enhance operational efficiencies through optimised flight planning, and the use of biodiesel for ground vehicles. For environmentally conscious travellers and corporate partners, especially in markets like Bangladesh, we offer carbon-offsetting options and will soon introduce a Corporate Carbon Programme to align business travel with sustainability goals.

TDS: How has customer behaviour shifted post-pandemic, and how is the airline tailoring its services to meet these evolving expectations?

DA: Post-pandemic, travellers are seeking greater flexibility, safety, and personalisation. In response, we have enhanced hygiene protocols, introduced more adaptable fare options, and invested heavily in digital tools across the customer journey.

In markets such as Bangladesh, this translates into smoother booking processes, enhanced in-flight comfort, and digital experiences designed to deliver both convenience and care.

Regional Positioning (South & Southeast Asia)

TDS: How important is South Asia, particularly Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, in your route network strategy?

DA: South Asia lies at the heart of our ambition. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan are key growth drivers. These are generating strong demand across education, VFR (visiting friends and relatives), and business travel segments. In response, we have expanded our regional footprint and introduced new routes including Krabi (KBV), Siem Reap (SAI), Cebu (CEB) via Firefly, and Chengdu Tianfu (TFU) via Malaysia Airlines. These additions reflect our commitment to improving accessibility and offering greater choice, all while maintaining that premium edge that defines Malaysia Airlines.

TDS: Are there plans to expand partnerships or codeshares that improve connectivity from Bangladesh to key hubs in ASEAN, the Middle East, and beyond?

DA: Absolutely. Through oneworld and our regional partnerships including collaborations with carriers such as IndiGo, we are enhancing connectivity for Bangladeshi passengers to ASEAN, the Middle East, and Europe. Our goal is to deliver seamless and convenient global access, underpinned by the trusted service that Malaysia Airlines is known for.

Bangladesh Market Focus

TDS: Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur is one of the busiest regional routes, with high passenger demand. How does Malaysia Airlines see this corridor evolving in terms of passenger growth and yield management?

DA: The Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur corridor remains one of our busiest routes. From 5 November 2025, we will increase to three daily flights, 21 per week to meet growing demand and enhance onward connectivity to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and across ASEAN.

This increased capacity allows us to offer competitive fares while optimising yield through premium service and digital personalisation. This aims to deliver value for both conscious travellers and those seeking a superior travel experience.

TDS: Malaysia is home to a large Bangladeshi diaspora. How is the airline catering to migrant workers while balancing the premium segment of students, business travellers, and tourists?

DA: We are proud to serve all segments of Bangladeshi travellers. For migrant workers, we provide reliable and affordable service that meet their essential travel needs. Simultaneously, we cater to students, business travellers, and tourists with enhanced comfort and upgraded services. This balanced approach allows us to honour both the practical and aspirational travel requirements of this important market.

TDS: Many Bangladeshi passengers are extremely price-sensitive. What strategies do you have to balance affordability with the premium service experience Malaysia Airlines is known for?

DA: We offer tiered fares and flexible packages, ensuring affordability without compromising the travel experience. One standout offering is our Bonus Side Trip programme which allows passengers transiting through Kuala Lumpur to explore up to seven domestic destinations, including Langkawi or Penang by paying only the applicable taxes. This delivers premium value while adding a sense of discovery to their journey.

TDS: Cargo plays a vital role for Bangladesh's economy, especially RMG (ready-made garments). How significant is freight uplift from Bangladesh to your overall business strategy?

DA: Cargo is key to our business model, and Bangladesh's RMG exports are pivotal. Our Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur route not only supports fast, secure garment exports but also strengthens onward connectivity to global markets. Reliable schedules and modern freighters ensure we deliver both speed and dependability that are critical to Bangladeshi exporters.

Customer Experience & Innovation

TDS: Digital booking and ancillary services are growing rapidly. What investments has Malaysia Airlines made in technology to enhance the customer journey, especially for emerging markets like Bangladesh?

DA: We have invested significantly in mobile-first booking platforms, self-service tools, and personalised ancillaries. This allows travellers to manage seats, baggage, meals, and more through digital touchpoints. These tools simplify the journey for tech-savvy Bangladeshi users, while our signature Malaysian Hospitality ensures that even digital interactions feel warm and human.

TDS: Will we see more collaborations with Bangladeshi banks, mobile wallets, or fintechs for easier payment options?

DA: Yes, payments remain a key focus area. We are actively pursuing partnerships with Bangladeshi banks, mobile wallets, and fintech providers to make booking simpler, faster, and more secure. These collaborations will ensure that our services remain accessible and convenient for local travellers.

Future Outlook

TDS: Where do you see Malaysia Airlines in five years in terms of global ranking, fleet modernization, and network coverage?

DA: Our ambition is clear, to be firmly back among the global top 10 airlines by 2030, powered by one of the youngest, most efficient fleets in the region. We will continue to expand our network by strengthening key corridors such as Dhaka–Kuala Lumpur and opening new routes across Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and beyond. By combining premium service, sustainability, and innovation, we are positioning Malaysia Airlines as a trusted global connector for travellers from Bangladesh and across the world.

On 25 September 2025, the United States scrambled four F-16 fighter jets, four KC-135 tankers, and an E-3 Sentry airborne early warning aircraft to intercept two Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers and two Su-35 fighter jets operating inside the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ).

The interception came as President Donald Trump urged NATO to “shoot down Russian jets violating its airspace,” against the backdrop of what many officials describe as an intensifying Russian hybrid campaign against NATO.

Russia’s escalating violation of NATO airspace

Russian aircraft have repeatedly tested NATO airspace boundaries in recent years. Crewed fighters have entered the skies over Sweden, Norway, and Estonia, while drones have violated the airspace of Poland, Romania, and Lithuania.

One of the most serious incidents occurred a week ago, when three armed MiG-31s penetrated Estonian airspace for more than 12 minutes. Italian F-35s were dispatched to intercept. Norway has separately reported that Russian military aircraft have breached its airspace three times so far in 2025.

Sweden, which formally joined NATO in March 2024, experienced its first violation just months later when Russian Su-24 Fencers crossed into its airspace. Images released by the Swedish Air Force in September 2025 show Russian MiG-31s operating inside Estonian territory, underscoring the increasing frequency of such incursions.

Bloomberg has reported that several European governments have privately warned Moscow that they are prepared to shoot down intruding jets. Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson has stated publicly that his country is ready to take that step if necessary.

Russia’s aerial capabilities vs NATO

Despite its large notional inventory, Russia’s air force has struggled to gain air superiority in Ukraine and has suffered heavy losses. The Oryx open-source database estimates that Russia has lost well over 100 fixed-wing combat aircraft since the full-scale invasion began.

Many of the platforms deployed on NATO border patrols, including Su-24s, Su-27s, and MiG-31s, are older models largely absent from frontline missions.

By contrast, NATO air forces field a mix of advanced F-35s, Rafales, and Typhoons. Western analysts argue that Russia’s flights near NATO borders are less about projecting combat power and more about probing Alliance resolve.

Russia’s use of drones to violate NATO airspace

The aerial challenge is not confined to manned aircraft. Earlier this month, Poland reported that approximately 19 Russian drones deliberately crossed into its territory. Dutch F-35s and Polish F-16s shot down the drones in what NATO described as the first kinetic defence of European airspace by its fighters.

Russian one-way-attack drones recently violating Romanian airspace were escorted by scrambled Romanian F-16s until they crossed back into Ukraine.

In Denmark, officials are investigating drone activity near four civilian airports, describing the events as the “work of a professional actor.” While attribution remains uncertain, suspicion has again fallen on Moscow, which is known to use modified cargo ships as drone launch platforms.

Russia’s hybrid war against NATO

Airspace violations form just one part of a wider Russian hybrid campaign against NATO members. Cyberattacks have long been a feature: in 2022, the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre attributed a Europe-wide attack to Russian actors.

One of the most reported other forms of Russia’s hybrid war is jamming/GPS spoofing. This particularly affects areas in Nordic Europe, the Baltic states, and Poland near Russia and Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave. GPS spoofing has affected many flights for years and has forced some flights to be cancelled.

Perhaps one of the most audacious stories of Russian hybrid warfare came in November 2024, when the New York Times reported Russia was plotting to “place incendiary devices on cargo planes in Europe.” The publication said Russia’s military intelligence agency, the GRU, was orchestrating the plots.

Russia went as far as performing a test run in the summer of 2024, setting off fires at shipping hubs in the United Kingdom and Germany. This included logistics hubs belonging to DHL.

Disinformation remains a persistent vector. Russia exploits the West’s open information space to spread narratives aimed at undermining democratic institutions, while suppressing dissent at home. In 2024, Romania’s Constitutional Court annulled the presidential election after ruling that Russian interference had compromised the vote. Moldova continues to be a prime target of destabilisation efforts.

The eastern country of Moldova is particularly targeted by Russian campaigns in an attempt to destabilise the fragile country and remove its Europe-friendly government.

Russia’s disinformation campaigns against Ukraine, NATO, and the French in Africa

In Russia, there is little freedom of speech. Many international social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp are blocked, while others like YouTube are difficult to use. People in Russia are not permitted to speak out against the war. According to Reuters, everything from perceived “discrediting the military” to “childfree propaganda” is banned.

But Russia is known to take advantage of the free speech of the West to spread its narratives, disinformation, paint distorted images of Russia, and unmine the credibility of Western institutions.

Western countries are between a proverbial rock and a hard place, trying to find a balance between free speech and preventing foreign actors from taking advantage of that freedom to undermine their democracies.

The African Defence Forum points out that one of the most extreme Russian disinformation propaganda campaigns is in the small African country of Burkina Faso. There, disinformation is used to justify the Russian-backed coup and create the illusion that the country’s economy is booming due to kicking the colonial French out.

In reality, Russia has taken over the exploitation of the country’s resources, and its Africa Corps acts as a sort of Pretorian Guard protecting the junta from another coup or the people.

At the same time, the ruling military junta continues to lose ground against advanced jihadist forces, and deaths from an ever-worsening security situation are skyrocketing. Around 30% of the territory is entirely outside its control, with the remaining 70% contested.

Burkina Faso is a comparatively small country in West Africa. However, it is being used by Russia to foment more instability across Africa, particularly against the French, and to allow Russia to fill the ensuing void.

Another mark of success in Russia’s hybrid war against the West came in 2024 when the US had to shut down its drone base in Niger, as reported by Reuters.

Testing NATO and risking retaliation

From Alaska to the Baltics, Russia’s actions are widely seen as deliberate tests of NATO’s readiness and resolve. So far, these encounters have been contained through professional intercepts, but officials caution that Moscow is edging ever closer to the line — and a single misstep could escalate quickly.

That risk sharpened yesterday, when the Kremlin warned that any attempt to shoot down Russian aircraft would “mean war.” While framed as a response to Western rhetoric rather than an imminent threat, the message underscored the dangers of miscalculation: what begins as routine interception could, with one wrong move, ignite a wider confrontation.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sukhoi-Su-30-by-Sergey-Krivchikov.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:56:12.212059

This landmark Boeing 737 order, announced on September 26, 2025, from the airline's headquarters in Fornebu, Norway, underscores a strategic pivot toward aggressive fleet expansion amid surging demand for affordable transatlantic and intra-European flights. Norwegian Air, renowned for its pioneering role in budget air travel, first inked a base agreement in May 2022 for 50 of these fuel-efficient workhorses, complete with the flexibility to add 30 more, a clause the carrier has now activated on highly attractive terms that remain undisclosed but are believed to leverage favorable financing amid Boeing's production ramp-up. This Norwegian Air Boeing deal not only revitalizes a partnership dormant since 2017 but also positions the airline as a frontrunner in sustainable aviation, with the 737 MAX 8's advanced aerodynamics promising up to 20% reductions in fuel consumption and carbon emissions compared to older models. For travelers eyeing cheap flights to Oslo, London, or New York, this infusion of modern aircraft heralds enhanced reliability, more seat availability, and potentially lower fares as Norwegian Air bolsters its network across Scandinavia and beyond.

The genesis of this expanded Boeing 737 MAX order traces back to Norwegian Air's storied history with single-aisle jets, a lineage that began in 2007 when the carrier placed its inaugural order for Next-Generation 737-800s, transforming it from a modest regional player into a global low-cost aviation titan. Fast-forward to 2017, and Norwegian made aviation headlines as the first European airline to take delivery of the 737 MAX, swiftly deploying it on historic transatlantic routes that democratized long-haul travel for budget-conscious passengers. Yet, the path hasn't been without turbulence: a near-bankruptcy in 2020 amid COVID-19 groundings forced a painful restructuring, slashing long-haul ambitions and refocusing on short- and medium-haul efficiency. Today's commitment to 30 more 737 MAX 8s, bringing the fleet horizon to over 150 Boeing narrowbodies by 2031, marks a triumphant return to growth. Adjusted delivery slots, negotiated alongside the option exercise, stretch from 2025 through 2031, allowing Norwegian Air to phase in replacements for its aging 737-800s while scaling operations. CEO Geir Karlsen hailed the pact as a ""milestone"" that fortifies the airline's resilience, emphasizing how these jets' LEAP-1B engines and composite wings will slash operating costs, enabling competitive pricing on high-frequency routes like Copenhagen to Barcelona or Stockholm to Madrid. In essence, this Norwegian Air fleet expansion is less about sheer volume and more about precision-engineered scalability in an era where low-cost carriers must balance profitability with passenger expectations for greener, faster service.

Environmentally conscious travelers and industry watchers alike will applaud the sustainability edge embedded in this Boeing 737 acquisition, as the MAX 8's design inherently aligns with Europe's stringent emissions targets under the EU's Green Deal. Each aircraft in this 30-jet addendum boasts a 14% smaller carbon footprint per seat than its predecessors, thanks to innovations like split-tip winglets that optimize airflow and reduce drag, features that Norwegian Air plans to pair with its ongoing investments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives. With 2024 seeing the carrier ferry 22.6 million passengers on a fleet of 86 Boeing 737 variants, this order promises to amplify capacity without proportionally hiking emissions, supporting Norwegian's pledge to net-zero operations by 2050. Moreover, the all-economy cabin layout, a hallmark of Norwegian Air's 737 MAX deployments, maximizes accessibility for leisure flyers seeking affordable European getaways or Nordic escapes, while quieter cabins enhance the onboard experience. Boeing's commercial chief, Ihssane Mounir, echoed this synergy, noting that the 737 family empowers airlines like Norwegian to ""expand networks sustainably across Europe and beyond,"" hinting at potential revivals of long-haul dreams deferred by past crises. As low-cost airlines grapple with supply chain snarls and rising fuel prices, Norwegian's proactive Boeing 737 order exemplifies how forward-thinking procurement can turn environmental imperatives into competitive advantages, drawing eco-aware millennials and families to its roster of direct flights from hubs like Oslo Gardermoen.

Looking ahead, this infusion of 30 additional Boeing 737 MAX 8s catapults Norwegian Air into a phase of unbridled ambition, potentially reshaping the low-cost carrier landscape from the fjords of Norway to the sun-soaked coasts of Spain. By 2031, with deliveries trickling in steadily, the airline anticipates not just fleet modernization but a surge in route density, think more daily hops between Helsinki and Paris, or expanded feeders to secondary airports that keep fares low and accessibility high. This growth trajectory, fueled by a workforce of 4,700 dedicated professionals under the broader Norwegian Group umbrella (which includes regional arm Widerøe), could see passenger numbers climb toward 30 million annually, bolstering market share against rivals like Ryanair and easyJet. Yet, challenges loom: Boeing's ongoing quality scrutiny post-737 MAX grounding demands vigilant oversight, and macroeconomic headwinds like inflation could test the ""attractive terms"" of the deal. Still, for Norwegian Air, this order is a clarion call of resurgence, affirming its ethos of making air travel an everyday luxury. As the aviation world watches, this Boeing 737 commitment positions the carrier as the go-to for budget-savvy explorers plotting their next Norwegian Air adventure, be it chasing auroras in Tromsø or tapas in Málaga, proving that in the skies, bold bets on efficiency and expansion pay dividends for passengers and planet alike.",https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiKBtzVQ_Gh1RR4Vh5pg0uv7ZBQIGkCauPCHPef2A1UMY8SA91O5pJnLIfQ-UpYzPqHeSqutQoTnbeS-7iDPBcYcMZsOW42fPVL5l0N-O15w08HE6ycIspKEQ-lPR_1o5Q83CLTWR-cHXUzzvQZ2Hlec48ITMFwHpHIHx2rtUXnQfgZody0-gP3G-6PwwuJ/w1600/NorweginAir_Boeing_Order.png,N,,2025-09-27 10:58:35.877749

Underground coal gasification

India, which holds the world’s fifth-largest coal reserves, is banking on gasification to continue using coal in a cleaner way over the coming decades. Government officials estimate that nearly 43 percent of India’s reserves lie at depths greater than 300 metres, making them suitable for underground gasification rather than conventional mining. UCG involves converting unmineable coal seams in-situ into syngas using oxidants such as air, oxygen or steam. The process can produce hydrogen and liquid fuels such as methanol, ethanol, synthetic diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as feedstock for chemicals, fertilisers and petrochemicals. India plans to achieve gasification of 100 MT of coal by 2030.

The first-ever pilot project for underground coal gasification (UCG) in the country was launched in June 2024 at the Kasta coal block in Jharkhand. The project is being executed by Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), a subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL), along with the Canadian firm Ergo Exergy Technologies Inc (EETI).

Coal gasification financial incentive scheme: Rfp to be floated next week

Brar also said that the ministry will float a Request for Proposal (RfP) next week to allocate the remaining Rs 2,500 crore under its coal gasification financial incentive scheme. The scheme was announced last year with a total financial outlay of Rs 8,500 crore. Of the Rs 8,500 crore, about Rs 6,000 crore has already been allocated across three categories of projects.

Under Category I, which includes PSUs / joint ventures of PSUs, Bharat Coal Gasification and Chemicals Limited (BCGCL), a joint venture of CIL-BHEL has been awarded Rs 1,350 crore for its coal gasification project in Lakhanpur, Orissa. Another JV formed between CIL and GAIL for setting up a coal gasification project in Sonepur Bazari, West Bengal, has been awarded Rs 1,350 crore of financial incentive under the scheme.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) is taking part in the 42nd Session of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Assembly, hosted in Montreal, Canada.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, stated that safety, sustainability, and operational efficiency are the Association’s top priorities during this session.

Walsh emphasised the importance of securing stronger support for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and enhancing the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), describing them as two essential elements for achieving the industry’s commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

He warned against the risks posed by some states continuing to impose national or regional taxes and levies on aviation, which contradict the spirit of the Chicago Convention. Such measures, he noted, create a patchwork of regulations that hinder air transport and inconvenience passengers without meaningfully contributing to sustainability.

Walsh also highlighted the need to strengthen safety by ensuring timely publication of accident reports, addressing interference with satellite-based navigation systems, and safeguarding critical radio spectrum essential to aviation safety.

He stressed that global standards – many of which are developed within ICAO in collaboration with governments – remain the cornerstone of safe, efficient, and sustainable aviation worldwide.

Walsh added that the Assembly provides an opportunity for states to align ICAO’s work programmes with the most pressing issues facing the sector.

He pointed out that many of IATA’s working papers call only for the implementation of commitments already made by states themselves. The coming weeks in Montreal, he said, will be decisive in setting the agenda, while the following three years will be even more crucial in delivering on agreed objectives.

Through its submissions, IATA is urging governments to review targets for SAF deployment, taking into account the cost implications of mandatory obligations without parallel increases in production. The Association also calls for enhanced economic incentives for fuel producers and corrective policy measures to address market distortions.",https://egyptian-gazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2adbbaf7-145e-4723-8a42-e4cf872c24e2.webp,N,,2025-09-27 01:56:08.227903

The agreement represents the group’s first direct Boeing order since 2017 and increases their 737 MAX order book to 80 airplanes.

“This milestone aircraft order is on attractive terms and secures our fleet growth in a way that supports our planned growth and sustainability targets. By exercising the options and adjusting the delivery profile, we maintain flexibility while reinforcing our commitment to operating one of the most modern and fuel-efficient fleets in Europe,” said Geir Karlsen, CEO of Norwegian. “These aircraft will not only lower emissions but also provide our customers with an even better travel experience. We are pleased to extend our solid long-term partnership with Boeing through this order.”

Norwegian has predominantly operated Boeing single-aisle airplanes since placing its first order for the Next-Generation 737-800 in 2007. It was the first European airline to take delivery of the 737 MAX in 2017 and was also the first airline to operate the 737-8 model on transatlantic routes between Europe and the U.S.

In 2022, Norwegian restructured its order book, firming its commitment to 50 737-8s with options for an additional 30 airplanes.

“Norwegian’s impressive performance over the past few years has demonstrated the strength of their network, business model and strategy. Today’s agreement for an additional 30 737-8s will support their ambition to be the airline of choice in Scandinavia, providing flexibility to expand across Europe and beyond,” said Brad McMullen, Boeing senior vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing. “Norwegian has been a great partner to the 737 program, having placed over 200 orders for the 737 NG and MAX since 2007. We are honored that Norwegian continues to place its trust in our 737 team to grow its business.”

The 737-8 model can carry up to 200 passengers depending on configuration, with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,480 km). The 737 MAX family is well-suited to support airline fleet modernization by reducing fuel use and carbon emissions by 20% compared to the airplanes they replace.

bio-energy IBET 2025 conference in the national Capital on Friday.

While India boasts a proven capacity for next-generation bio-fuels, speakers emphasised that a lack of coherent, long-term global and domestic policy visibility is preventing the industry from taking off.

The final day of the International Conference on Bio-energy and Technologies Transition to Net Zero, held at Yashobhoomi, Dwarka, highlighted that policy flux is the biggest hurdle.

“We are at a critical juncture where the strong demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is colliding with a profound policy and economic uncertainty, fundamentally stalling commitment and growth,” said Isha Mittal, Project Leader at Boston Consulting Group. She underscored the need for coherent policy instruments, such as insurance or five-year planning visibility, to unlock financing for SAF development.

This policy inconsistency spans major markets, with fluctuating Green House Gas (GHG) reduction norms and changing acceptable feedstocks. This creates “deep uneasiness for producers” and prevents airlines from making the long-term commitments essential for net-zero targets.

The issue of cost competitiveness was also central to the discussion on the broader bioenergy sector. Samyak Pandey, Editor of Global Biofuels and Agriculture Markets at S&P Global, noted that for the Global South, the biggest hurdle is not the lack of feedstock, but its availability “at a certain price point” that makes it difficult for downstream suppliers.

A significant shift in the global market was also highlighted: Asian giants are pivoting. They are moving away from exporting raw, upstream feedstocks to instead focusing on exporting value-added downstream bio-products to Western markets.

Despite the challenges, speakers highlighted India’s immense potential. In the ethanol sector, India has moved from scarcity to abundance, holding over 2,100 crore litres of capacity with surplus sugar, corn, and rice. Harjeet Singh, Executive Director at Hero MotoCorp, termed India’s ethanol blending programme a “360-degree win-win,” citing benefits for farmers, reduced oil imports, and lower emissions. Ravi Gupta, Chairman of IFGE, called scaling flexible fuel vehicles the “low-hanging fruit” for the next phase of India’s green mobility.

For Compressed Biogas (CBG), India is seeing momentum. Inderjit Singh, Director, UPNEDA, announced that his agency has received around 700 applications for various bio-plants, with 45 already installed and 61 CBG projects under construction. Uttar Pradesh, in

particular, is exploring biomass-based green hydrogen as a cheaper alternative to electrolyser-based production, which could significantly reduce import dependence.

However, State policies add layers of complexity. Narendra Bhooshan, Additional Chief Secretary, Energy & Additional Sources of Energy Department, Government of Uttar Pradesh, pointed out that current policies limit subsidies to one CBG plant per location.

This is necessary to safeguard biomass supply, reserving 60 per cent for farmers' needs. He stressed that first-come, first-serve licensing and predominantly private fertile land require careful governance and “innovative pricing” to make CBG projects viable.

Financing institutions are stepping up. Dr RK Singh, CGM, Green Vertical, SIDBI, shared that as an accredited entity of the Green Climate Fund, SIDBI is blending $200 million from the Fund with $800 million from the market to support Indian MSMEs transitioning to green energy.

The conference ultimately underscored that while India possesses the biomass, technology, and policy intention, a globally and domestically aligned, long-term policy framework remains critical to unlock the massive capital required to move from potential to large-scale, net-zero reality.",https://www.dailypioneer.com/uploads/2025/story/images/big/experts-warn-of----chaotic-global-landscape-----for-sustainable-aviation-fuel-at-ibet-2025-2025-09-27.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 21:56:16.742256

Regional business and public sector leaders outlined near-term airport upgrades, long range growth plans, and workforce partnerships during the Seattle Southside Chamber of Commerce’s annual SEA Airport Luncheon, held Sept. 19 at Sea-Tac Airport.

Chamber President and CEO Samantha Le opened the program by highlighting a recent partnership with SEA Airport and Port Jobs that brought 30 Highline and Tukwila high school students to explore careers on the airfield and in airport operations.

“We come together to connect, to learn, and to strengthen the partnerships that keep our economy moving forward,” Le said in her opening remarks (full video below).

SeaTac Economic Development Manager Alexsandr Yeremeyev

City of SeaTac Economic Development Manager Alexsandr Yeremeyev told attendees that South King County’s transportation access continues to draw investment and that market certainty helps businesses make informed decisions.

““As the world changes and as a lot of things feel uncertain, there are certain things that are certain,” Yeremeyev said. “And when we can anchor ourselves and our decisions to those things that are … that adds predictability and a sense of confidence that that is very important to business investment.”

Port Executive Director Steve Metruck

Port of Seattle Executive Director Steve Metruck said the port operates under a “triple bottom line” that balances business performance, equitable opportunity, and sustainability. He noted SEA’s role in jobs and commerce, citing about 175,000 jobs in 2023, $10.5 billion dollars in wages and benefits, and $33 billion dollars in business output, based on figures he shared at the luncheon. Metruck said the port’s goal is to be the greenest port in North America and that the organization rebuilt systems after a 2024 ransomware attack without paying a ransom.

He too mentioned the perils of uncertainty and inflation on the federal level.

“We’re also navigating some uncertainty within our operations,” Metruck said. “And I’m sure all the business leaders here can feel the same thing… we’re looking at different policies from the federal level… inflation is mixed into this as well and then international travel’s mixed into this too.”

Metruck detailed construction aimed at easing congestion and improving the traveler experience as SEA traffic sets new records. Projects include the relocated Checkpoint 1 on the baggage level, a C Concourse expansion targeted for 2026 with more than 30 dining and retail options and an all electric design with rooftop solar, a Gateway ticketing and art upgrade on the terminal’s north end, roadway widening and a new bus canopy beginning this winter with paving after the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and a South Concourse modernization with major construction forecast for 2027. He said planning continues on the Sustainable Airport Master Plan, which contemplates a second terminal with 19 gates and an automated people mover linking the rental car facility, the new terminal, and the main terminal.

On air service and tourism, Metruck said cruise activity has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, driving visitor spending across the region, and that by 2026 SEA expects about 60 international routes to 36 destinations on roughly 30 airlines. He also pointed to the port’s push for sustainable aviation fuel, with an aim for at least a 10 percent blend on flights fueled at SEA by 2028, while acknowledging supply and cost remain challenges.

Alaska Airlines Managing Director Ben Brookman

Alaska Airlines Managing Director of Airport Affairs Ben Brookman told attendees that SEA is Alaska’s largest hub and that the carrier is investing alongside the port to improve throughput. Brookman previewed a new lobby targeted for early 2026, praised the new checkpoint, and said Alaska is developing a 40,000 square foot lounge in the C Concourse building. He said Alaska is adding widebody 787 aircraft to launch new long haul routes, with Tokyo already started and Reykjavik, London, and Rome slated for spring 2026. Brookman said customers “demand a more upscale and premium product” and that Alaska plans to grow to at least a dozen transoceanic destinations by the end of the decade while integrating operations with Hawaiian Airlines under a two brand strategy.

FIFA World Cup Coming in 2026

Looking ahead to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the port said it is coordinating with Sound Transit and encouraging cities and business districts to apply for economic development and activation grants tied to visitor readiness.

The 2026 FIFA World Cup™ is coming, and our region’s businesses have a chance to shine. The Port of Seattle and King County are proud to partner and support the Seattle Metro Chamber’s Community Business Connector program, which has launched Game Ready Activation Grants. This grant program supports local organizations in creating inclusive, family-friendly events, including cultural festivals, watch parties and community promotions.

Awards of $5,000, $10,000 or $20,000 will be granted, and this is open to business districts, cultural organizations, merchant associations and small businesses in King County. Applications will be reviewed on a rolling basis through Nov. 10 or until funds are exhausted.

Port Seeking Public Input on SEA Airport Leadership Search

The Port of Seattle is asking residents and travelers to share input on what qualities they want to see in the next Managing Director of Sea-Tac Airport (Previous Director Lance Lyttle left in March to take the same job in Orlando).

Community feedback will help shape the search for a leader to oversee daily airport operations, customer service, and long-term improvements at SEA, the Port said.

Visit the Port’s community feedback webpage to take a brief survey or email your feedback to AVDirectorSearch@portseattle.org.

Background on the use of SAF and the Lufthansa Group’s climate project portfolio

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called “drop-in” fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be easily blended with it. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is mixed with fossil aviation fuel (blending) or produced through co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with crude oil) and then transported to airports in Europe where the Lufthansa Group refuels large quantities of kerosene. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group’s flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire lifecycle, the SAF used by the Lufthansa Group from biogenic residues has a CO2 footprint at least 80 percent lower than conventional kerosene from fossil crude oil.

The Lufthansa Group relies on a differentiated climate project portfolio for CO2 compensation. It is continuously developed and currently includes 18 projects. These are included in the portfolio in varying proportions and costs. The providers are myclimate, Climate Austria, SQUAKE, Ceezer, and ClimatePartner. All projects are certified according to the highest available standards, such as the Gold Standard. In addition to nature-based projects, the portfolio also includes three technology based projects: One project for the capture of CO₂ and long-term storage in concrete and two projects for CO2 removal with biochar. In this way, the Lufthansa Group aims to promote the development of the CO2 compensation market towards new technologies and offers with technically induced long-term binding of CO2.",https://loyaltylobby.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lufthansa-747.png,N,,2025-09-27 01:56:33.805839

The slow rollout of production technology to take advantage of this feedstock is the main barrier to scaling up supply, however, with HEFA technology, which converts used cooking oil into SAF, currently the only available production type.

Other technologies

While HEFA will continue to play a role in the future SAF production matrix, other technologies will accelerate the aviation industry’s road to net zero, including biomass, which has the potential to produce more than 300 Mt of bio-SAF annually by 2050.

‘This potential could be expanded by unlocking additional feedstocks or through efficiency gains and technology improvements over intervening decades,’ the report noted.

Elsewhere, power-to-liquid (PtL) fuels, which will require large-scale access to renewable energy, hydrogen and carbon capture infrastructure, will be needed to reach 500 Mt of SAF production annually by 2050.

The report calls for action on a number of fronts, including strengthening feedstock supply chains, improving conversion efficiencies, scaling up new production methods, and aligning government and private-sector investment. On a regional basis, North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China and ASEAN have been identified as ‘key drivers’ of global SAF output.

‘Major acceleration’

“We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation,” commented Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general.

“There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050.

In the context of emission reduction, SAF also became one of the topics that received serious attention at the 2nd Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Civil Aviation in New Delhi, September 10-13, where the author was a member of the delegation.

This conference agreed on the 2024 Delhi Ministerial Declaration concerning aviation safety and security, navigation, facilitation, gender equality in the aviation world, resource provision, as well as the ratification of international air agreements to achieve civil aviation that is safe, secure, efficient, economically viable, and environmentally responsible.

In the medium term, there are at least three main components/actors that will shape the sustainable aviation (industry/business) ecosystem: SAF providers, airport operators, and airlines.

SAF/bioavtur manufacturer

During the transition period and in the medium term, SAF is seen as a solution to significantly reduce carbon emissions without fundamentally changing aircraft technology/engines, airport infrastructure, or the supply chain.

Bioavtur meets those requirements, whereas the direct use of hydrogen as a fuel gas for conventional aircraft still requires further research and testing related to engine modifications and safe storage tanks on the aircraft.

Recently, Pertamina received its first international trust to supply SAF to a foreign airline, Virgin Australia. During the BIAS 2024 event series, Pertamina supplied 160 kilograms of SAF to a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by Virgin for departure from Ngurah Rai International Airport on August 18-19.

The SAF produced by Pertamina is a mixture of synthetic fuel processed from used cooking oil and conventional aviation fuel (fossil-based) with proportions of approximately 38 and 62 percent, respectively. This proportion of SAF is considered high compared to Singapore Airlines, which only uses 1 percent SAF.

However, there is no doubt that this Pertamina product has been certified by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) through the CORSIA (carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation) scheme as a fuel that meets global requirements/standards. Pertamina's SAF product also meets the standards of the US, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.

Previously, last year, Garuda Indonesia completed the first commercial flight trial using SAF, a mixture of biofuel and conventional aviation fuel. The biofuel was processed from palm oil.

The achievement of SAF Indonesia's products has gone through a fairly long process. For that, Pertamina deserves a thumbs up.

In the article “Flight Tariff Intervention” (Kompas, 9/5/2019) the author criticized the large dependence on imported petroleum, including kerosene for aviation fuel, so that when the rupiah is weak, aviation fuel prices soar, and airline ticket prices skyrocket. In fact, we have abundant potential for green aviation fuel raw materials.

Initiated since 2010, Pertamina conducted research to develop products and catalysts. In 2021, PT Kilang Pertamina Internasional RU IV Cilacap successfully produced SAF J2.4 with co-processing technology from palm kernel oil raw materials that have undergone a bleaching process, fatty acid removal, odor-free, with a capacity of 1,350 kiloliters per day.

Through collaboration with related parties, this SAF product was then tested through a series of trials on engines and aircraft units. In addition to Pertamina, the development and testing involved Garuda Maintenance Facility, Garuda Indonesia, PT Dirgantara Indonesia, and ITB, until the successful flight test of Garuda's commercial aircraft on October 4, 2023 with a Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft.

Supported by the availability of abundant raw materials, Pertamina is ready to be part of the sustainable aviation ecosystem as a supplier of SAF. Indonesia has the opportunity to become the world's leading producer and exporter of SAF.

In the BIAS 2024 series, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between PT Pertamina and Airbus to cooperate in the development of SAF. Various international certifications for Pertamina's SAF products, SAF supplies to Virgin Australia aircraft, and development cooperation with Airbus will increase trust and demand for Indonesian SAF in the international market.

Indonesia must be able to manage the palm oil agro-industry well, to meet domestic consumption/exports of cooking oil, industrial raw materials, biofuel, and SAF as well as environmental protection. Palm oil will become an increasingly strategic material/commodity, such as nickel, bauxite, quartz sand, phosphate, and others.

All airports in Indonesia, especially those with international hub status, need to transform into green airports as an important part of the sustainable aviation ecosystem.

The airport ecosystem has a number of stakeholders, such as aircraft passengers, fuel providers, ground handlers, cargo operators, airlines, airport operators, airport retailers/SMEs, catering services, and transportation providers from/to the airport.

To form a green airport ecosystem, stakeholders need to play their respective roles with low-emission activities.

Airport operators implement best practices for green airport management, including using new and renewable energy (EBT)-based electricity such as rooftop solar power plants (PLTS), battery-based electric operational vehicles/hydrogen fuel cells, smart building systems, circular economy water management (especially for watering gardens), 3R waste handling systems and compost processing units, providing charging stations to recharge electric vehicles in the airport area.

Pertamina needs to build storage infrastructure for SAF distribution in the airport area, in the form of depots/storage tanks and SAF hydrant systems and/or electric/hydrogen fuel cell trucks to fill SAF into aircraft. The option is to mix SAF with conventional avtur at Pertamina's refinery or directly at the airport, depending on safety considerations and equipment completeness.

The development of SAF infrastructure at airports needs to be planned at all airports in Indonesia, both international and domestic.

Based on the Decree of the Minister of Transportation No. 31/2024 concerning the Determination of International Airports, April 2, 2024, there are 17 airports with international airport status in Indonesia. These international airports include Kualanamu (Medan), Hang Nadim (Batam), Soekarno-Hatta (Banten), Kertajati (Majalengka), Kulon Progo/YIA (DIY), Juanda (Sidoarjo), I Gusti Ngurah Rai (Bali), Sultan Hasanuddin (Maros), and Komodo (NTT).

Currently, 37 airports are under PT Angkasa Pura Indonesia, a subsidiary of InJourney. Two international airports, namely Kualanamu and Hang Nadim, have the potential to be developed into ASEAN regional international hubs in the future.

The potential is supported by its strategic position in the northern region of Indonesia, close to ASEAN economic centers. So far, a number of international airports in Indonesia have only been feeders for Changi Airport, Singapore.

SAF usage policies can be determined at the airline or government level. Approaching 2030, many countries around the world are starting to require SAF usage by airlines in their respective countries, in line with the ICAO Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels, Low Carbon Aviation Fuels, and other cleaner aviation energies.

The European Union (EU) requires all EU airports to supply aviation fuel with a minimum SAF content of 2 percent starting in 2025. This mandatory percentage will continue to increase to 6 percent (2030), 20 percent (2035), and 70 percent (2050), applicable to all flights departing from the EU and to any destination.

In BIAS 2024, the Coordinating Minister for Investment and Maritime Affairs launched the SAF Roadmap Action Plan, which focuses on developing SAF to achieve net zero aviation by 2050, earlier than the 2060 target. This roadmap is a guiding framework to ensure greener Indonesian aviation.

At the airline level, Lion Air Group will require the use of SAF on all airline fleets starting in 2030. InJourney, after the effective joining of Garuda, can take a more progressive step in the use of SAF.

In the medium term until 2030, the initial stage in building a sustainable aviation ecosystem focuses on the development/use of SAF and the development of a green airport ecosystem by gradually shifting to EBT in airport operations and all activities of airport stakeholders, including airport MSMEs.

Airlines certainly hope that Pertamina's SAF price is competitive with the price of traditional fossil-based aviation fuel. The relatively high SAF price will affect the ticket price that consumers/passengers must pay.

The use of hydrogen as the SAF for conventional aircraft, and as the SAF for hydrogen fuel cell aircraft, has implications for changes in aircraft technology and its supporting infrastructure that will take place in the longer term.

Likewise, the use of all-electric aircraft and autonomous flying taxis. All of this still requires research, development, and testing, especially regarding flight safety and fuel efficiency.

Potential pathway to decarbonise aviation and shipping, sectors responsible for more than 5% of global CO₂ emissions.

Amsterdam bets on flexible carbon capture

Dutch climate tech company Brineworks has raised €6.8 million (US $7.3 million) in fresh funding to advance a new form of Direct Air Capture (DAC) technology designed to deliver carbon removal at below €100 per ton. The round, led by SeaX Ventures with participation from Pale Blue Dot, First Momentum, AiiM Partners, Energie360°, and Katapult, comes as policymakers and investors intensify scrutiny of aviation and shipping emissions.

The company, founded in 2023, is targeting commercial readiness by 2026 with a system that also produces hydrogen, the essential input for e-fuels. Earlier this year, Brineworks secured a €1.8 million grant from the European Innovation Council’s Accelerator program to accelerate pilot deployment.

DAC paired with hydrogen

At the core of Brineworks’ approach is a patented electrolyzer engineered to operate flexibly with renewable power. Unlike conventional systems, which degrade when turned on and off, the unit is designed to start and pause in sync with solar and wind availability.

“We’ve proven a clear path to capturing CO₂ directly from air at below $100 per ton,” said Joseph Perryman, co-founder and CTO. “That’s the threshold the world has been waiting for, and now the scale-up begins.”

The technology enables DAC and hydrogen co-production. Together, these streams provide the building blocks for synthetic fuels such as e-methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For airlines and shipping companies under pressure from regulators and investors, the economics of such a system could provide a lifeline.

Aviation and shipping in focus

Aviation accounts for roughly 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, while maritime shipping contributes more than 3%. Both industries face limited options to decarbonise at scale. Synthetic fuels offer a potential solution, but costs have remained prohibitive.

“Renewable energy is becoming cheaper faster than anyone predicted. The bottleneck now is technology that can use this power flexibly and affordably,” said CEO Gudfinnur Sveinsson. “That’s exactly what we’ve built.”

By aligning DAC with renewable generation, Brineworks aims to localise production of carbon-neutral fuels. If the model proves viable, it could allow countries to produce e-fuels domestically, reducing import dependency while contributing to climate targets.

Investor confidence in science-led solutions

Investors describe Brineworks’ approach as a step-change in carbon removal economics. “We’re always looking for visionary founders solving massive problems with science-backed solutions, and Brineworks is exactly that,” said Kid Parchariyanon, managing partner at SeaX Ventures. He added that supporting the company aligns with the fund’s goal of helping to cut 1% of the world’s carbon footprint.

The financing reflects a broader wave of venture and public funding moving into engineered carbon removal. European institutions, including the EIC, are prioritising projects that pair carbon capture with synthetic fuels, in part to meet transport decarbonisation targets set by Brussels.

Policy and market implications

If Brineworks achieves its target of commercial readiness by 2026, airlines could begin sourcing carbon-neutral fuel before 2030, supporting compliance with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate and the International Maritime Organization’s decarbonisation strategy.

The sub-€100 per ton capture benchmark is particularly relevant to investors. Current DAC systems often operate at two to four times that cost, limiting their integration into fuel production at scale. Achieving that threshold would make DAC competitive with established offset markets while offering a verifiable, technology-based pathway.

Looking ahead

The next phase for Brineworks is scaling its electrolyzer-DAC system to pilot level, with demonstration projects expected in the next 18 months. For global energy and transport leaders, the outcome will be closely watched. Success could reshape the economics of synthetic fuels and offer a scalable solution to two of the hardest-to-abate sectors.

For investors and policymakers, Brineworks highlights the growing intersection of renewable integration, carbon removal, and industrial decarbonization. As nations look to secure domestic energy supplies while meeting net-zero commitments, technologies that merge these goals are gaining strategic importance.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Dutch-Startup-Brineworks-Secures-7.3M-to-Scale-Direct-Air-Capture-for-e-Fuels.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 16:56:08.836412

Using circular economy principles and energy-neutral processes, the technology converts animal manure and agricultural residues into valuable commodities with minimal environmental impact. The modular BCT system, now in its fifth generation after 15 years of development, can be rapidly deployed. Each module, shipped in ten containers, can be assembled in under a month and processes 36 tonnes of dry biomass per day with negligible emissions and no residual waste.

Verdus said the system works efficiently on a smaller, decentralised scale, making it suitable for farms, forests, and industrial sites. It can process feedstocks including cattle manure, poultry litter, crop residues, and municipal solid waste, transforming them into more than 200 marketable products such as renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biochar, green fertilisers, organic pesticides and herbicides, bio-oils, electricity, and carbon credits.

Biochar alone can sequester three tonnes of CO₂ per tonne applied to soil and reduce methane emissions from cattle by up to 22%. Overall, Verdus claims its solutions can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 187%.

The company has partnered with governments, primary producers, energy firms, and waste managers, and plans rapid international expansion given the over 20 million tonnes of annual feedstock surplus in New Zealand and growing global demand.

Kevin Smith, President and COO, said the technology has already proven commercially. “Version 4.0 has been operating for over two years, producing carbon fuel pellets for a major mining company. Rollout of V5.0 begins in Q4 2025, with production in North America scheduled for 2026.” He added, “Verdus Energy is not just addressing waste—it is creating a new model for resource recovery, climate resilience, and economic regeneration.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Biomass-6.png,N,,2025-09-26 12:56:59.596160

USFWS Offers Voluntary Lead-free Ammo Incentive Program for 2025-26 Season

La Crosse, Wis. — The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is extending the Voluntary Lead-Free Hunting Ammunition Incentive Program for the 2025-26 hunting season in the National Wildlife Refuge System. The decision follows a successful pilot program and survey results indicating that hunters are more likely to use lead-free ammunition on national wildlife refuges when an incentive program is available. The program will include 25 hunting seasons at 13 refuges in 11 states.

Locally, the program is offered to those hunting deer on the Trempealeau National Wildlife Refuge.

The program also is being offered at refuges in Maryland, Idaho, West Virginia, New Jersey, New Hampshire, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, North Carolina, and Oregon.

“We are committed to providing access to quality hunting experiences on national wildlife refuges and supporting the contributions of the hunting community to wildlife conservation,” said USFWS Director Brian Nesvik. “Our analysis after the first year of the pilot indicates most hunters were satisfied with the program and we are pleased to expand it to accommodate more hunters.”

The lead-free program was launched in 2024 at seven national wildlife refuges and encourages voluntary adoption of lead-free ammunition as a non-regulatory means of addressing lead ingestion by wildlife on federal lands. The USFWS collaborated on program recommendations from the Hunting and Wildlife Conservation Council as well as from states, non-governmental groups, industry partners and the public. The HWCC is a federal advisory committee established by the Secretaries of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture.

This voluntary lead-free hunting ammunition incentive program offers hunters an opportunity to try ammunition types that reduce the risk of unintentional lead ingestion by scavenging wildlife. Participating hunters at each refuge will benefit from an incentivized rebate program that includes prepaid debit cards for reimbursement of the cost of lead-free ammunition with proof of purchase and other refuge-specific verifications. Participating hunters will receive up to $50 per box of rifle ammunition and $25 per box for shotgun or muzzleloader, for up to two boxes.

Under the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act of 1997, the USFWS allows hunting, within specified limits, on more than 430 refuge units. There are 573 national wildlife refuges and 38 wetland management districts.

(NASDAQ:SAFX), a small-cap renewable energy company with a market capitalization of $125.66 million, has signed a Letter of Intent with Posh Energy to explore deploying Flex-Fuel Gensets at its New Rise Renewables Reno facility, according to a press release statement issued Friday.

The proposed project aims to convert byproducts from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel production into zero-carbon electricity, potentially creating additional revenue streams for the company. This initiative comes as XCF Global’s stock trades at $1.35, near its 52-week low of $1.16, following a challenging year that saw an 87% decline in share value. InvestingPro analysis reveals additional growth metrics and valuation insights for subscribers.

The initiative is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot deployment to validate performance using New Rise Reno’s byproduct streams, followed by a modular expansion targeting up to 10-MW capacity.

Posh Energy’s proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams from fuel production into electricity. The companies plan to publish a white paper in the coming weeks detailing the technology.

The project could qualify for multiple incentives, including the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit for hydrogen produced by the system and Renewable Energy Credits for the electricity generated. These credits could either reduce the carbon intensity of New Rise Reno’s fuels or be sold to meet clean energy demands in Nevada’s Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center.

""Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams,"" said Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global, in the announcement. The company’s financial stability metrics, available on InvestingPro, indicate a relatively low beta of 0.3, suggesting lower volatility compared to the broader market, despite recent earnings per share of -$0.57.

The non-binding LOI remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements between the parties.

Abstract

The increasing carbon footprint of civil aviation has made the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) a strategic necessity in line with the sector’s sustainability goals. This study evaluates the existing SAF types based on environmental, economic, technical and social criteria, determines the criteria weights with Fuzzy-Step-Wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (F-SWARA) and selects the most suitable alternative through Spherical Fuzzy-Multi Objective Optimization on the basis of Ratio Analysis plus full MULTIplicative form (SF-MULTIMOORA) method. The alternative evaluation process was carried out on a Python-based online platform and sensitivity analysis was performed on five different scenarios. According to the findings, the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK) alternative stands out as the most suitable option in all scenarios, followed by the Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK) alternative. In contrast, Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ-SPK) and Power-to-Liquid (PtL) options seem to be more variable and less stable. The study provides methodological contributions for the evaluation of SAF alternatives with fuzzy multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods and provides strategic implications for manufacturers and airlines in achieving the low-carbon targets of the aviation sector.

One disappointing truth: carbon capture was supposed to save us by now, and we have only managed to reach 50 million tonnes of global CO2 storage per year with where we needed to be at 1 billion tonnes by 2030.

As CCUS projects continue to face delays and climate change continues to accelerate, the technology that was supposed to be our salvation is desperately racing against time. CCUS technology is one of the most promising runners in this race, but there’s still a lot to catch up on.

In this article, we will break down the phenomenon of CCUS, define the carbon capture processes, understand what happens after capture, and see the role carbon tracking plays. We will also try to answer a question: Is CCUS a promising technology? Let’s start by defining it.

What is CCUS (carbon capture, utilisation, and storage)?

Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a form of technology that captures CO2 emissions from industrial sources and power plants or directly from the atmosphere.

According to the EU Science Hub, at the EU level, 30% of CO2 emissions come from fossil-fuel combustion in power generation and energy-intensive industries, such as cement and steel. The process consists of three parts: the capture of CO2 from the source, transporting it to a storage site via pipelines or ships, and permanently storing it below ground or utilizing it to create another product.

The history of carbon capture goes back to the 1920s, and now, around the globe, the International Energy Agency reports that CCUS capacity has grown to just over 50 Mt of operational capacity as of 2025, with the expectation of growing to 430 Mt by 2030. However, developers are now also focusing more on advancing existing projects, with 60% of the pipeline in advanced development stages blocked.

Difference between CCS and CCU

Within the wider framework of CCUS’s emissions reduction technology, there are two separate approaches - CCS and CCU. They differ in some notable aspects:

Goal. CCS permanently stores CO2 underground to stop emissions, with cleanenergywire.org noting it's ""essential for achieving climate goals, particularly for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2°C."" CCU turns captured CO2 into useful products, with CO2 Value Europe stating it will reduce EU emissions by 250Mt by 2050.

Challenges. CCS needs suitable underground storage sites - IOGP Europe shows projects like Norway's Smeaheia (5 Mtpa planned 2028) require specific porous rock with impermeable caps above. CCU faces high conversion costs, with projects like 4AirCRAFT (completed 2024) demonstrating synthetic kerosene production but requiring significant energy input.

Project types. CCS targets heavy industry - examples include Belgium's ArcelorMittal (0.125 Mtpa, operational since 2022) and Germany's Cemex cement plant (0.146 Mtpa, planned for 2026). CCU covers diverse sectors: aviation fuels (4AirCRAFT), building materials (Spain's AGGREGACO2), and chemicals (France's ABACUS algae project, completed 2020).

Carbon uses. CCS utilizes old oil/gas fields (like Croatia's CO2 EOR project, running since 2014) as well as saline formations (Denmark's Greensand, with a claim of .4 Mtpa by 2025). CCU uses different conversions: catalytically (4AirCRAFT for jet fuel), biologically (ABACUS algae-to-chemicals), or mineralisation (AGGREGACO2 for carbon-negative concrete).

Impact on timelines. CCS allows for immediate permanent removal, i.e., Iceland's Orca facility (0.004 Mtpa, operational), which is permanently storing underground CO2. CCU allows for temporary storage, in that most products will re-release the CO2, with the exception of the mineralized building materials, which CO2 Value Europe claims is permanently stores 8% of the overall carbon that is captured.

Current scale. CCS has scaled up to sizeable operational projects (Norway's Sleipner (1 Mtpa since 1996) and Longship (1.5 Mtpa, 2024). CCU remains at a modest scale, with most of the relevant projects having demonstrated proof-of-concept or pilot phase, with CO2 Value Europe projecting some 173Mt of utilization by 2050.

Business model. CCS cannot make money from enhanced CO2 storage; thus, it needs government support from carbon capture public companies, such as the UK's Net Zero Teesside (with 2 Mtpa in 2027), which is advancing under a ""policy backing"" only. CCU can sell products for profit, i.e., CO2 Value Europe indicates about 50% of utilization will become transport fuels and 42% chemicals, thus building market value.

With these differences in place, CCUS projects influence varied industries altogether. One of the most important ones is done for the airline industry.

How does CCUS impact the airline industry?

Aviation is coming under increasing pressure to decarbonize. The International Energy Agency reported that aviation accounted for 2.5% of global energy-related CO2 emissions in 2023, almost 950 Mt CO2, as travel demand rebounded to almost 90% of pre-pandemic levels. If the ICAO forecasts hold true, the European Commission adds that emissions from aviation could triple by 2050 compared to 2015 levels. To respond to growing sustainable travel trends, potential CCUS technologies provide a number of pathways for the aviation industry to reach its net-zero commitment.

Noteworthy benefits of carbon capture and storage for aviation:

Sustainable aviation fuel. CCUS is enabling the production of synthetic fuels for aviation. Projects, such as 4AirCRAFT, have showcased the potential of producing synthetic aviation fuels, specifically kerosene. This would provide airlines with alternatives to fossil-based fuels.

Cost-competitive CCUS infrastructure. Initiatives, such as CO2 Hub in Zeebrugge, Belgium (planned for 20 Mtpa capture capacity by 2030), leverage shared infrastructure for carbon management strategies that airlines may be able to access.

Carbon offsetting. According to IATA, CCUS technology has the potential to capture 90% of carbon dioxide emissions from industrial processes. Direct Air Capture, a CCUS technology, can offer a way to remove carbon dioxide permanently, which meets aviation's additionality and permanent requirement for emission reductions.

Assist with regulatory compliance. Airlines are currently bound to adhere to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), whose full auctioning of allowances will increase by 2026. Credits that are derived from CCUS offerings may be beneficial compliance instruments.

In its report, the IPCC recognizes that ""CCUS will be critical to limit global warming to 1.5°C"" and that the target ""cannot be met"" without the use of such technologies. The International Energy Agency (IEA) calculates that CCUS could reduce global CO2 emissions by as much as 19%.

In terms of aviation, IATA states that CCUS, coupled with renewable biomass, could operate in ""carbon-negative"" mode, actually removing CO2 from the atmosphere while producing sustainable aviation fuels and making it essential to achieve net-zero ambitions.

How do carbon capture technologies work?

Point source carbon capture involves capturing CO2 emissions at their source, usually at industrial sources of energy generation, such as power plants or cement plants, or that create large quantities of CO2 (such as carbon capture for cars that produce 81% of non-industrial emissions) before the CO2 is released into the air. To understand how capture works, let’s break it into several types and describe each one with its goals, benefits, and real projects.

Post-combustion capture

Post-combustion CO2 utilization technology captures carbon dioxide from flue gases after the combustion of fossil fuels, with chemical solvents (generally amine-based solutions or carbon capture fertilizers, like those offered by the Fertilizers Europe project). This approach allows components to be replaced without impacting the operations of the power plant. Furthermore, the phased introduction of this technology facilitates a reduction in operational disruption and investment risk, as the post-combustion CCUS value chain applies to pre-existing plants.

Europe's first fully operational post-combustion carbon capture plant is the Eni Casalborsetti natural gas treatment plant near Ravenna, Italy, shows the technology's capabilities while utilizing Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' KM CDR Process™ to capture around 25,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The facility has an impressive 90% CO2 reduction rate, with peaks of 96% efficiency, before transporting captured CO2 via reconverted gas pipelines to a depleted offshore gas field for permanent storage.

The technology is viable for decarbonizing existing industrial infrastructure worldwide using advanced solvent technologies such as, but not limited to, the KS-21™ system, with 18 commercial plants already deployed.

Pre-combustion capture

Pre-combustion capture technology (PCC) targets the CO2 in synthetic gas (syngas) prior to combustion. This CCUS technology uses acid gas removal technologies, which have been used across many industrial sectors for decades. The Global CCS Institute describes PCC as working under pressure (> 40 bar, for example), the increased pressure allows the use of physical solvents like Selexol to promote CO2 regeneration in a flash drum, while also reducing the power requirement for the absorption system.

The process itself involves converting syngas to hydrogen and CO2 through one or more water-gas shift reactions before separating the CO2 using chemical or physical absorbents, which dissolve acid gases, achieving CO2 removal rates of >90% in practice.

Applications for the technology are found in natural gas processing, hydrogen production, and coal gasification, with its commercially mature distilable gas separation technology. The DECARBit CCUS project of the European Commission aims to reduce the price of PCC to 15 euros per captured ton. Axens states that for processes with high-pressure syngas treatment (15-20% CO2 at 20-30 bar), physical solvents become the best option for investing in carbon capture technology in industrial applications, such as fertilizer producers and refineries.

Oxyfuel combustion

Oxy-fuel combustion involves burning air that has been stripped of nitrogen and argon to produce high concentrations of oxygen that combust with fuel (coal or natural gas) in the combustor, producing steam and CO2 for gas turbine efficiency and power generation.

According to the technology study by Southwest Research Institute, scrubbed CO2 is taken in a power plant, with a capture rate above 90% and with the CO2 being used again, as it can be used in refrigeration manufacturing, carbonation of drinks, or oil and gas applications. In particular, there are advantages of carbon capture for the use of traditional fuels, such as coal, which is typically considered a high-emission fuel. Oxy-fuel conditions allow coal to burn cleaner and at the same time maintaining the abundant feedstock.

The Callide Oxyfuel Project at Callide A Power Station achieved more than 10,000 hours of oxy-combustion and 5,000 hours of carbon uses. Southwest Research Institute continues to research direct-fired supercritical CO2 (sCO2) power cycles, by combining sCO2 technology with oxy-combustion, and is able to achieve nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency. It also partnered with the U.S. Department of Energy in the development of megawatt-scale demonstration equipment for power plant carbon capture.

Digital solutions for CCUS

Digital technologies are removing cost barriers that have previously limited CO2 utilization technology adoption. In remarks made by Prateek Bumb, co-founder and CTO of Carbon Clean, capture rates can ""substantially exceed"" 90-95%, but cost has historically been a barrier to adoption as ""the operating costs for large conventional plants with high columns are difficult to justify for many emitters, especially small-to-mid-size companies.""

Advanced digital technologies have the potential to be used to reduce the carbon capture costs through optimization and prediction.

Integrated management platforms that visualize the entire CCUS value chain and enable CO2 supply-demand matching, e.g., Mitsubishi's CO2NNEX® we mentioned.

Digital twins for monitoring CO2 pipeline flows in real time and optimizing energy consumption in power systems.

AI and machine learning, with anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and process optimization that match theoretical operating conditions with operational realities.

Process control systems for carbon capture equipment, e.g., AspenTech's Aspen solution that we described above.

Advanced simulation tools, such as SLB's Intersect simulator, for improved subsurface modeling and characterization of CO2 storage sites.

Now that we have sorted out the carbon capture methods, let’s focus on the next steps that are equally important.

Utilization and storage: What happens after capture?

Capture, as complex as it is, is just the first step of CCUS. CO2 utilization technology is extremely diverse and important as well. Let’s now understand what happens after carbon has been captured.

Carbon utilization strategies: fuels, building materials, chemicals

Following CO2 capture, there are several main pathways for carbon utilization. The main idea remains the same, however, to transform captured carbon into useful products. These pathways generalize over 25 other ways, which could represent substantial carbon capture and sequestration market opportunities by 2040.

Utilization of fuels and chemicals.

For chemical processes, CO2 is utilized via reaction with hydrogen to produce fuels and chemicals. According to the Planete Energies group, the chemical sector currently uses:

100 million tons of CO2/year for producing fertilizers based on urea.

130-280 Mt CO2/year for e-methanol, one of the few commercially viable products, as demonstrated by plant developments such as Topsoe's facility in Spain, which produces 40,000 tons annually of e-methanol and captures 56,000 tons of CO2.

E-kerosene for aviation presents a great market for carbon uses, estimated to be between 50-150 Mt CO2/year, but without regulatory incentives, its adoption is slow..

Both e-methanol and e-kerosene share the opportunity to establish biogenic CO2 scarcity constraints, while they both provide closed carbon cycles that only emit the amount of CO2 they captured to produce the fuels.

Construction applications.

Construction materials have the greatest CO2 utilization potential, with construction aggregates capable of utilizing 0.5-2 Gt CO2/year, according to extensive research. However, low product value makes economic competitiveness questionable.

CO2-cured concrete is a smaller option of carbon reduction technologies, but has stronger revenue potential (40-70 Mt CO2/year), and the technology is nearly ready for commercialization (as shown by the Carbon Upcycling projects).

Materials systems such as CarboPac-C from Bright Renewables are also examining how to capture CO2 from flue gas to produce either liquid or gaseous CO2 for construction applications.

The construction utilization pathway represents a market opportunity value of $400 billion with the potential to reduce CO2 emissions by as much as 3 Gt/year by 2030.

Biological utilization with microalgae and cyanobacteria.

Biological utilization is based on photosynthetically functioning organisms using large amounts of CO2 to support growth. The cultivation of microalgae has achieved commercial maturity for producing high-value products, including pigments and omega-3 fatty acids.

Green algae contain 50-70% protein on a dry weight basis, providing opportunities for the peri-urban agriculture application of animal feed with reduced land allocation. Commercial viability has already been established with the production of astaxanthin. The pathway for microalgal-to-ethanol conversion demonstrated that cyanobacteria were more readily genetically manipulated than green algae.

Engineered cyanobacterial strains have been developed to produce ethanol, fatty acids (which can be consumed by animals), 2,3-butanediol, and other chemicals, although a majority of commercially relevant products are still not yet economically viable.

Carbon storage solutions: geological formations, saline aquifers

After CO2 capture, permanent geological storage is the next most effective long-term climate change mitigation option on an economical scale. Deep saline aquifers and geological formations represent substantial geological storage potential through proven methods, with commercial viability demonstrated in numerous deployment examples.

Deep saline aquifers.

According to research published on MDPI, deep saline aquifers have the greatest estimated storage capacity, ranging from 400 to upwards of 10,000 gigatonnes of CO2. Underground saline aquifers can provide all the conditions for permanent CO2 storage through pressure increase, structural, residual, solubility, and mineral trapping. Pioneering CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers provides commercial feasibility examples such as Australia's Gorgon project, at up to 4 million tonnes per year in the Dupuy saline formation.

Geological formations.

Depleted oil and natural gas reservoirs offer the advantage among other carbon capture materials as they provide a proven storage with existing natural infrastructure.

CO2-Enhanced Oil Recovery (CO2-EOR) captures value from two sources: injecting 300-600 kg of CO2 per recovered barrel of oil, and it achieves permanent storage for the majority of injected CO2 underground.

Carbon Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CSEGR) in depleted natural gas fields allows for the permanent storage of CO2 while capturing remaining natural gas resources potential with negligible possibility of leakage, because the depleted natural gas fields and overlying geology have proven containment capabilities.

In regard to the technical basis, if site selection and management protocols follow the IPCC assessments of geological storage, the majority of the CO2 can be retained for longer than 1,000 years with a 99% or better certainty for permanent retention.

Risk management and monitoring of stored CO₂

Risk management is essential to the safe geological storage of CO2 and must be continuously monitored for the duration of the life of the project. The European Commission CCS Directive states that effective storage requires permanent containment, and associated health and environmental risks of any CCUS technology should be as low as reasonably practical.

It defines the following considerations for risk management and monitoring:

Risk assessment should be based on site-specific risk screening that uses likelihood categories and consequence rating criteria for human and environmental health.

The hazard identification approach should identify all potential hazards associated with CO2 leakage pathways, formation fluid displacement, and induced seismicity.

A risk management monitoring program should be organized, documented, and related to the project-specific risks as effectively as possible within budget.

A typical commercial project (≥1 Mt CO2/year) should have an annual monitoring budget of US$1-4 million, which is based on <5% total project costs (IEA Technology Collaboration Programme).

A monitoring approach should adopt a mix of monitoring technologies capable of detecting any leakage or assessing CO2 migration, and ensuring regulatory compliance.

Current operational projects showcase a strong level of faith in the monitoring technologies currently available, with better efficiency achieved by incorporating risk-based methods. Carbon offset companies like Terrapas and CarbonClick facilitate the commercial viability and cost-efficiency pros of carbon capture, allowing the sale of carbon credits for tax reduction and showcasing sustainability initiatives. None of this would be possible without carbon tracking.

How does carbon tracking enhance CCUS performance?

To see how carbon tracking approaches enhance carbon utilization and capture, let’s review how each specific type of technology influences the development of this industry.

Emissions calculators.

Emissions calculators are necessary tools for measuring carbon footprints using internationally accepted methodologies. They enable businesses to accurately measure carbon footprint of their travel with a data-driven approach and provide a solid foundation for sustainable decision-making and identifying improvements. This, in turn, allows organisations to set realistic emissions reduction targets and build cultures of sustainability within their organisations. Apart from assisting businesses with green initiatives, personal carbon capture devices like CarbinX help use the converted carbon into energy for residential buildings.

Dashboards with real-time CO2 analytics.

Real-time CO2 analytics dashboards and carbon reporting software, such as those offered through StormGeo and Sievo CO2 provide better access to carbon emissions data and insight. These dashboards bring together the organization’s CO2 emission data and metrics, give a complete overview of the organization’s environmental impacts, and provide more visibility by mapping the spent data with emission data. The dashboards allow users to create customized reports that allow unlimited collaboration, while the totals are being updated in real-time.

Carbon emission budgeting.

Carbon emission budgeting involves creating measurable emission targets that are specific to an organization's sustainability goals. When used effectively, it can develop a framework for decreasing environmental impact while incorporating and utilizing sustainable travel practices. Ultimately, organizations are perceiving carbon emissions budgeting as an investment towards future business continuity, allowing them to maintain a place on the leading edge of responsible environmental activity.

Emissions visibility while flight shopping.

Transparency while booking flights creates awareness of the emissions associated with flights and other travel options. When carbon footprints are shown next to every flight option, it allows travelers to make informed decisions about their travel choices consistent with environmentally friendly or sustainable practices. In addition, selecting airlines with robust sustainability credentials (like Wizz Air and Air France-KLM) that use airline digital solutions reinforces responsible travel practices and supports business travel that has less impact on the planet.

Individual emissions visibility.

Individual emissions tracking displays a detailed breakdown of personal travel selections and the carbon emissions related to those selections. Armed with this level of detail, people can figure out exactly what they can change in that travel selection to lower their environmental impact. Acting on emission visibility accomplishes two things: One, it allows individuals to act on that visible impact, and, more importantly, it creates awareness and a corresponding shift in collective action within an organization.

Environmental initiatives and carbon offsetting.

Investing in high-quality carbon credits offsets unavoidable emissions and gets you certified greenhouse gas reductions through a project-based certification system. Contributing to global research and development projects that focus on environmental protection can establish a global positive ripple effect. This is more than just carbon offsets - this is about supporting organizations that model and promote corporate responsibility and community development.

Technology and modern approaches help support CCUS projects and the related benefits they bring.

What is their role in CCUS?

Transportation causes nearly 20% of global CO2 emissions (out of 36.7 billion tons globally; Ritchie, Science Direct). As such, there is significant potential for reductions in carbon emissions in this sector to fit into the context of carbon capture, utilization.

Carbon tracking applications help identify emissions sources, calculate the associated emissions impact, and provide a basis for behavioural change to intentionally reduce the total carbon to capture and store.

In fact, research suggests that by using carbon footprint tracking apps, emissions could be reduced by as much as 23% through continuous feedback (Hoffmann et al., Science Direct). However, the relative impact will vary - mobility reported a 12% reduction, and household activities had up to a 35% reduction.

The evidence of success is real, particularly concerning tourism in Ireland. The Fáilte Ireland Carbon Calculator has involved over 500 businesses to measure and collectively reduce emissions, which shows how tracking technologies can provide a means of bridging the information gap for sustainable decision-making.

Best carbon tracking tools

To reduce their carbon footprint, companies and individuals can use carbon tracking tools that allow them to easily monitor daily emissions. Let’s review the top carbon capture technologies you can use.

The future of CCUS in climate strategy

The UK government's CCUS investor roadmap establishes its national commitment to CCUS development, which advises the establishment of four CCUS low-carbon industrial clusters that are expected to capture between 20-30MtCO2 per year by 2030. The UK is now in a unique position in that the estimated 78Gt of CO2 storage potential in the UK Continental Shelf will potentially provide one of the largest and most available CO2 storage capacities in Europe.

Also, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report confirms CCUS technology can support global climate aims such as the 1.5°C warming targets and must go hand-in-hand with rapid emission reductions to be able to achieve net-zero emissions. It’s particularly important for hard-to-abate sectors like cement, where CCUS will be “essential to avoid emissions from the limestone calcination process.”

Integration with hydrogen production and DAC (Direct Air Capture)

The combination of CCUS technology and hydrogen production brings one step closer to net-zero emissions through applications like ""blue hydrogen"" using natural gas reforming. Hongfang Lu outlined this pathway in a paper, ""Hydrogen production in integration with CCUS,"" published in Science Direct. This pathway provides immediate access to clean hydrogen while using current industrial infrastructure and expertise. Here is the possible workflow and results:

Capture integration. Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is directly integrated into grey hydrogen production processes using absorption, adsorption, and DAC; it is estimated that current technology has a 10-20% increased energy demand relative to the grey hydrogen production chain.

Economic optimization. Large-scale implementation gives CCUS companies the ability to achieve cost reductions of approximately 30-40% over smaller installations. Blue hydrogen production could be achieved for 1.2-2.1 USD/kg, assuming natural gas prices are in the range of 1.4-6.3 USD/GJ.

Infrastructure development. The required shared transport and storage infrastructure is allowed by the regional clustering of hydrogen production, storage, and transport. With projects like Northern Lights, infrastructure development reduces the costs for each hydrogen project.

Catalyst performance. Investing in the development of high-performance catalysts, higher selectivity, and improved resistance to carbon deposition and materials sintering. Especially, alkali metals provide improved catalytic performance.

Policy support. Implementation will need government policies that include carbon taxes, market incentives, and industry engagement models that capture, transport, utilize, and store projects and development.

Apart from hydrogen production, direct air capture is another useful complementary technology to point-source CO2 capture because it removes atmospheric CO2 directly. Specialized DAC technology exists that is also capable of integrating with facilities with low-concentration CO2 waste emissions, lessening the boundary condition for mass and thermal transport.

Use of a contactor system designed for CO2 adsorption-desorption using solid-amine materials for atmospheric CO2 capture.

Use of waste heat and recoverable energy from co-located industrial facilities to lower operational costs

Integration of low-concentration CO2 streams from industrial vents to improve the efficiency of the overall system.

Creation of commercial systems based on actual field-testing data, for use internationally.

Production of concentrated (>99%) CO2 that is suitable for either utilization or storage.

The DAC RECO2UP project, finalized in July 2024, shows how technology enhances the advantages of carbon capture storage. As the first direct air capture system, the project conducted five testing campaigns and over 3,300 operational hours. The project demonstrated a reduction in the cost required to capture CO2, produced concentrated CO2 streams with a purity of >99%, and achieved more than what was originally requested. The project also verified that DAC technology has commercial promise around cost.

Innovation trends and emerging technologies

The CCUS industry is at a turning point as the world moves toward net-zero emissions targets. After demonstrating technological feasibility, the sector has large hurdles remaining in order to scale up to the immense deployment needs for global decarbonization.

Some innovative trends help move this industry forward:

AI is changing the game with respect to finding suitable CCUS storage sites. It can quickly analyze potential aquifers and adjacent geological features, identifying site potential rapidly. AI can 'see' the presence of faults and honeycombed fractures much more clearly than traditional methods. Using an AI model, location screening of storage sites can happen rapidly before any excavation, and to understand whether there is trap and seal integrity in the site.

The hub & network model

of creating larger CCUS hubs and networks has led from isolated projects to integrated systems of infrastructure that support multiple emitters from different industrial sectors.

Standardization helps as the sector is approaching a shift from customized processes and CCUS equipment being designed for a specific site, to standardized equipment and mass manufacture as a low-cost option that speeds up deployment.

Cross-sectoral integration, or the delivery of CO₂ from gas processing to the hard-to-evade sectors of cement, steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and waste.

Shared-infrastructure development causes regional economic and industrial clusters to facilitate multiple emitters utilizing shared CO₂ transport and storage infrastructure.

Advanced business structures make risk management more attractive for private investment, developing market acceptance for CCUS projects to set commercial viability.

Improved storage technology helps drive geological storage technology to deliver the massive amounts of CO₂ in the net-zero scenarios.

The main problems with carbon capture and storage are high costs, regulatory ambiguities, and bespoke manufacturing models that limit scale. However, some emerging trends are promising, such as more robust policy instruments, particularly the reformed EU's Emissions Trading System and the Clean Industrial Deal.",https://www.hospitalitynet.org/picture/153185082.jpg?t=1751881108,N,,2025-09-26 10:57:28.539506

Layered Credit Advantage - Hydrogen produced is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Tax Credits, while the clean power generated can reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's fuels, boosting the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits, or be sold into the local energy grid to meet rising demand for renewable energy.

Scalable Roadmap - The project is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot and expand to modular 250-kW units, building toward multi-megawatt capacity.

HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / September 26, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (""XCF"") (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (""SAF""), announces that it has signed a Letter of Intent (""LOI"") with Posh Robotics (""Posh"" dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno, LLC (""New Rise Reno"") to explore deploying Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh's Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce Renewable Energy Credits (""RECs""). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno's SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region's expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world's largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno's byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

""XCF's mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem. Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.""

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

""Posh Energy's Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power. Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.""

Ani Dasgupta, president and CEO of the WRI, was commenting following several new countries outlining their climate commitments through to 2035, at the close of the UN Secretary-General’s Climate Summit.

Well short

The latest announcements will feed into the UN’s forthcoming NDC Synthesis Report, which is scheduled for release ahead of COP30 in Brazil in November. However, Dasgupta warned that global efforts continue to fall well short of what’s required.

“We cannot sugarcoat it: these new climate plans do not put us anywhere near on track for a safe future,” he said. “The lack of ambition so far from most major emitters, barring a few, underscores the immense political challenge countries face in transforming their entire economy. Yet vulnerable countries continue to step up with bold climate leadership.

“Countries’ last round of NDCs put the world on track for up to 2.8°C of warming, already exposing billions of people to more frequent and intense heatwaves, wildfires, storms and floods. By 2035, the world needs to cut 31.2 gigatons of emissions to stay on track for 1.5°C, or 20.2 Gt for 2°C. The NDCs and announcements so far would reduce that by just 2 gigatons — only 6% of what’s needed for 1.5°C and 10% for 2°C.”

Greater ambition

With COP30 now just around the corner, Dasgupta said that it was “critical” that all nations – including major emitters – deliver the most ambitious possible climate plans.

“Some countries are taking steps to transform key sectors of their economy,” he said. “Falling costs are accelerating this momentum: clean energy, heat pumps, and electric vehicles are now the lowest cost option in many parts of the world — creating jobs, boosting countries’ growth and competitiveness, securing reliable clean energy, and improving people’s quality of life.

“Countries need to do much more to seize this momentum and scale up renewable energy and clean transport solutions.”

As the WRI noted, in 2024, climate-related disasters were estimated to cost the global economy at least $300 billion, and without more ambitious action, “these losses will continue to escalate. By COP30, all countries must present a clear response and double down on solutions within our grasp to cut emissions and build adequate resilience.”

North America is projected to lead with more than 100 Mt of potential SAF by 2050, supported by abundant biomass feedstocks and proven incentive-based policy frameworks.

Central & South America, North Asia, and South Asia are also expected to contribute significantly, driven by strong biomass resources and leadership from Brazil, China, and India.

The Middle East & North Africa also show substantial potential, while Central Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more modestly. These lower projected volumes reflect infrastructure gaps, limited supply chain readiness, and less mature policy frameworks. However, both regions hold untapped feedstock resources that could enable higher contributions if the right conditions are established.

Globally, the main bottleneck is not feedstock availability, but the pace of technology rollout. Scaling up both bio-SAF and e-SAF will require multiple technology routes.

The Downstream Solutions Challenge spotlights scalable innovations across design, collaboration, logistics and finance.

This year’s winners – Schneider Electric, Vestas, DHL and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria – show how business can deliver systemic change.

Tackling climate change requires bold action on Scope 3 downstream emissions, which typically include those generated during the use of sold products, the end-of-life treatment of sold products, downstream transportation and distribution, the processing of sold products and investments.

Understanding and addressing Scope 3 downstream emissions is increasingly significant in sustainability and climate reporting, as these emissions often represent the largest share of a company’s total carbon footprint.

By measuring and managing these emissions, organizations can identify opportunities for product innovation, engage with value chain partners and contribute to global climate goals.

For the 133 members of the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, Scope 3 downstream accounts for 67% of their value chain emissions, equivalent to 3.5 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2e) equivalent, roughly the same as India’s annual CO2e emissions (from fossil fuels and industry only, as per Our World in Data figures with further BCG Analysis).

The Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders’ Downstream Solutions Challenge aimed to highlight companies that are pioneering scalable, innovative and collaborative approaches to Scope 3 downstream decarbonization.

By focusing on four categories – sustainable design, collaboration, smart logistics and financing – the challenge highlights solutions that not only reduce emissions but also unlock business value, resilience and long-term competitiveness.

Sustainable design: Schneider Electric

Product design is where downstream impact often begins. The materials chosen, the way systems are powered and how they are maintained or recycled all shape emissions across the entire lifecycle. Sustainable design can deliver exponential benefits, including lowering costs, enhancing safety, ensuring regulatory compliance and reducing Scope 3 emissions.

Schneider Electric’s AirSeT technology is a breakthrough in medium-voltage switchgear, replacing sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a greenhouse gas with 24,300 times the global warming potential of CO2, with pure air and vacuum technology.

Unlike incremental improvements, AirSeT eliminates SF6, reducing regulatory risks, lowering long-term costs and improving worker safety.

To date, AirSeT has avoided more than 1.2 million tons of CO2e, contributing to Schneider’s goal of saving or avoiding 800 million tons of CO2 by 2025. Fully compatible with existing infrastructure, digitally integrated and externally audited, AirSeT is not just a product; it is a scalable solution for climate-resilient energy systems.

Collaboration: Vestas

No company can decarbonize its value chain alone. Collaboration between suppliers, customers and industry peers is essential for scaling new technologies and aligning market incentives. In hard-to-abate materials such as steel, joint action can break cost barriers, reduce investment risks and send powerful demand signals that reshape entire industries.

Vestas has embraced this challenge by pioneering the use of low-emission steel in wind turbine towers, produced in partnership with ArcelorMittal using scrap and renewable electricity.

With steel representing up to 50% of a turbine’s lifecycle emissions, this innovation, it says, cuts emissions by 66% per kilogram of steel, achieving up to 52% reductions in onshore towers and up to 26% reductions in offshore towers.

By engaging both suppliers and customers, such as Baltic Power and Vattenfall, Vestas created a self-reinforcing demand signal that accelerates the adoption of its products. This initiative shows how collaboration can extend beyond pilots to systemic change.

Smart logistics: DHL

Transportation and distribution are among the most visible sources of downstream emissions. Every product that reaches a customer carries a carbon footprint associated with its transportation.

As global supply chains expand, sustainable logistics has become a decisive lever, not just to reduce emissions but also to meet procurement requirements, strengthen brand reputation and improve air quality in cities.

DHL’s GoGreen Plus is reshaping logistics by embedding sustainability across air, ocean, road and warehousing. By using sustainable aviation fuel, bio-LNG (liquefied natural gas), hydro-treated vegetable oil and battery-electric vehicles, the programme enables insetting, cutting emissions directly within the supply chain.

In 2024 alone, GoGreen Plus reduced 1,598 kilotons of CO2e, verified by independent third parties. Its book-and-claim model makes the solution globally scalable, already used by more than 300,000 customers.

Partnerships such as Formula 1 have amplified its visibility worldwide, accelerating adoption and setting a new industry standard for sustainable logistics, already used by more than 300,000 customers of all sizes and across all industry sectors.

Financing: BBVA

Even the best technologies cannot scale without capital. Financing plays a catalytic role in downstream decarbonization, enabling suppliers and customers to invest in cleaner processes, equipment and systems. By embedding climate ambition into financial products, banks can unlock transformation across entire value chains.

BBVA’s Sustainable Ecosystems initiative integrates advisory services, supplier classification and targeted financing to accelerate Scope 3 reductions. It helps clients diagnose emissions and then mobilize funding to address them, bridging the gap between ambition and implementation.

For instance, in the automotive coatings sector, BBVA structured financing that enabled downstream garages to install solar panels and adopt energy-efficient equipment. This not only reduced emissions but also improved competitiveness and resilience across the value chain. Globally deployable and sector-agnostic, the model exemplifies how finance can turn climate commitments into measurable results.

IATA says SAF feedstock enough for net-zero by 2050

The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has published a study confirming that sufficient sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock exists to enable the airline industry to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. All feedstocks considered meet strict sustainability requirements, avoiding any impact on land use.

The report concludes that the availability of raw material will not be a limiting factor, but stresses that rapid acceleration of SAF production is critical. Current commercial facilities rely almost exclusively on HEFA technology, which converts waste oils into fuel. Scaling up new technologies, such as power-to-liquid (PtL), will be essential to achieve the 500 million tonnes of SAF annually required under IATA’s Net Zero Roadmap. Biomass has the potential to provide more than 300 million tonnes a year, while PtL would supply the balance, supported by advances in renewable energy, hydrogen and carbon capture.

Key challenges identified include the slow pace of technology deployment, competition for feedstocks with other hard-to-abate sectors, and insufficient infrastructure to support large-scale production. The report stresses that investment in supply chain logistics, conversion efficiency, and commercial-scale facilities across all regions is necessary if aviation is to meet its climate commitments.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said the findings offered “unequivocal evidence” that feedstock availability is not a barrier but warned that “we need shovels in the ground now”. Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Chief Economist, highlighted the potential for SAF production to stimulate economies and support energy security, but called for urgent cross-sector collaboration to de-risk investment and ensure policy stability.

The study identifies North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China and ASEAN as crucial to future SAF output, and urges governments and the energy sector to act decisively. According to IATA, the next 25 years will determine whether aviation can turn this proven potential into reality.

Available to members of the Finnair for Business program, the new SAF service allows companies to monitor the flight emissions that their business trips generate. They can then buy SAF environmental attributes (the quantified benefits of using sustainable aviation fuel rather than conventional jet fuel) to help lower the carbon footprint of flying.

Using a book-and-claim model, companies can make an associated claim to the environmental benefit their purchased attributes represent. This means the actual emission reduction does not necessarily take place on the flight their employees travel on, as the fuel they purchase is not physically loaded into the aircraft.

The achieved reduction in greenhouse gas emissions related to sustainable aviation fuel use is verified by a third party, with the company receiving an audited SAF certificate that can be used for its sustainability reporting.

“We want to develop flying in a more sustainable direction and are now taking steps on several different fronts. We believe that the most effective solutions can be found at the system level and require cooperation not only between decision-makers and energy producers, but also between airlines and customers. With the Finnair for Business SAF service, we want to accelerate the adoption of alternative aviation fuel made from renewable raw materials,” said Tuomo Karppinen, Finnair’s Head of Environment.

In 2024, approximately 0.5% of the aviation fuel procured by Finnair was SAF, with the airline planning to grow that number to 1.5% this year.

“The greenhouse gas emissions reduction in sustainable aviation fuel is significant,” said Karppinen. “However, the aviation fuel we use will not be fully renewable for a long time, since SAF is blended with fossil fuels. But the more we use renewable fuel, the greater the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions we will achieve.”

Regional leaders and laggards Although every region has some role to play in SAF production, a handful of countries are expected to lead the charge.
Power-to-Liquid must expand more rapidly, supported by the growth of renewable energy and flexible rules governing CO₂ sources.
A cautious optimism The Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production paints a picture of both daunting challenges and enormous opportunities.","The scale-up required over the next 25 years is extraordinary, and a new study conducted by IATA and Worley Consulting suggests that even under ambitious assumptions, output is likely to fall short of expectations. Their Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production forecasts that the world could realistically produce approximately 400 million tons of SAF by 2050. While this would mark a remarkable leap forward, it still leaves a 100 Mt gap to net zero.

A race against time

What emerges most clearly from the report is that time, rather than resources, is the fundamental constraint. On paper, the world has sufficient feedstock to support the growth of SAF. By mid-century, global biomass potential is expected to exceed 12,000 million tons, yet much of this will be consumed by other industries or be unsuitable for fuel.

After subtracting competing uses, just 1,580 Mt could be directed toward SAF production. This would be enough for slightly more than 300 Mt of bio-based SAF. The remainder must come from synthetic fuels produced through Power-to-Liquid (PtL) processes, which combine renewable electricity, hydrogen, and captured carbon dioxide.

The challenge is not that the raw materials do not exist. The problem is that the technologies required to turn them into jet fuel are not scaling up fast enough. Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), the only pathway currently operating at commercial maturity, will continue to dominate production in the near term. However, HEFA is constrained by the limited supply of waste oils and fats.

Other routes, such as ethanol-to-jet (EtJ), Fischer-Tropsch (FT) gasification of residues, and PtL e-fuels, are progressing; however, most remain at the demonstration or early commercial stages. Unless these emerging pathways accelerate rapidly, the sector will remain unable to exploit the potential of available feedstocks fully.

The shifting balance of feedstocks

The report highlights that the composition of SAF feedstocks will undergo significant changes over time. Today, most production relies on waste oils, animal fats, and virgin vegetable oils. By 2050, however, agricultural residues are expected to provide nearly 60% of biomass-based SAF, while forestry residues and municipal solid waste are expected to play growing roles. Waste oils and crops will represent only a small fraction, reflecting both sustainability constraints and limited scalability.

This transition will not be straightforward. Agricultural residues, for instance, are abundant but difficult to collect. They are often scattered across vast rural landscapes, subject to seasonal availability, and tied up in competing uses such as soil enrichment or animal feed.

Municipal waste, meanwhile, offers low-cost potential but suffers from inconsistent quality and high processing demands. Even as technical pathways mature, these logistical barriers will require investment in infrastructure, aggregation hubs, and supply chain coordination.

Power-to-Liquid pathways offer an alternative that bypasses these supply chain complexities. By utilising renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and combining it with captured CO₂, e-SAF could theoretically provide more than 170 million tonnes by 2050. Yet this pathway comes with its own obstacles: high costs, dependence on a massive expansion of renewable energy, and the need for global carbon capture infrastructure. Without doubling renewable capacity and rapidly scaling electrolysis, e-SAF will struggle to deliver its potential.

Regional leaders and laggards

Although every region has some role to play in SAF production, a handful of countries are expected to lead the charge. North America is forecast to emerge as the largest producer, thanks to its robust agricultural base, strong incentives, and established biofuel sector. Brazil will be another heavyweight, leveraging its ethanol industry and energy crops to supply large volumes through the EtJ pathway. Europe, while limited by strict land-use rules, will continue to play a leading role in policy and regulation, particularly in advancing waste- and residue-based fuels.

Asia is set to become increasingly important. China and India both have vast agricultural residues and expanding renewable energy capacity, making them prime candidates for scaling SAF. The Middle East and Africa, meanwhile, will likely contribute smaller but still significant volumes, particularly from residues and waste streams. The study emphasises that these regions will require substantial infrastructure investment to unlock their full potential.

By 2050, the US, Brazil, China, India, and Europe are expected to account for the bulk of global output, with smaller but vital contributions from Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. This uneven geography reflects both the distribution of natural resources and the policy frameworks in place to support investment.

The role of policy

Perhaps the most important conclusion of the assessment is that policy will determine success or failure. Unlike solar or wind power, which now compete with fossil fuels on price, SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. In the case of e-SAF, costs are currently four to five times higher. Without strong policy frameworks, private investors are unlikely to take the risks required to fund large-scale plants.

The report identifies several levers for success. Financial incentives, such as tax credits, subsidies, and contracts for difference, can reduce costs and attract investment. Blending mandates, when carefully designed, create demand certainty and give producers confidence to expand.

Infrastructure investment—through public-private partnerships—can address bottlenecks in logistics, collection, and processing. Research and development funding will also be critical for bringing newer pathways, such as cellulosic ethanol and advanced PtL, to maturity.

Crucially, policies must prioritise aviation over other sectors that have easier decarbonisation options. Road transport, for example, can shift toward electrification, whereas aviation is likely to require liquid fuels for the foreseeable future. If governments fail to allocate scarce biomass and synthetic fuel capacity strategically, airlines may be left competing with road or marine transport for the same feedstocks.

Closing the gap to 500 Mt

Even with favourable conditions, the report’s core forecast falls 100 Mt short of the 2050 target. Bridging this gap will require bold action. Technology deployment must accelerate dramatically, shortening the journey from pilot projects to commercial scale.

Energy crops grown on degraded land could add new volumes of oil and cellulose without displacing food. Power-to-Liquid must expand more rapidly, supported by the growth of renewable energy and flexible rules governing CO₂ sources. International collaboration will also be essential, both to harmonise standards and to prevent a fragmented market that favours only a few regions.

The authors stress that meeting the target is possible, but only if the industry, governments, and investors act in concert. Airlines will need to sign long-term offtake agreements to de-risk projects. Governments must provide financial certainty and policy clarity to ensure stability. Producers will need to deliver scalable and replicable plant designs to accelerate rollout. Without these measures, the industry risks failing to meet its climate commitments.

A cautious optimism

The Global Feedstock Assessment for SAF Production paints a picture of both daunting challenges and enormous opportunities. Achieving 400 Mt of SAF by 2050 would represent a transformation of aviation energy supply on a scale comparable to the rise of renewables in the electricity sector. Yet the shortfall reminds us that ambition alone is not enough.

What is required now is focus and urgency. The feedstocks exist, the technologies are within reach, and the policy tools are well understood. The question is whether the world can mobilise fast enough to deliver. For an industry that has little time to waste, the coming two decades will decide whether sustainable aviation fuel becomes the backbone of decarbonised flight or remains a promise unfulfilled.",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/09/24/iStock-1333311294-scaled-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 07:56:39.674472

“The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals.
The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA), in partnership with Worley Consulting, has confirmed that the aviation industry has enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The study found that all considered feedstocks meet strict sustainability standards and do not require changes in land use.

However, the report highlights significant barriers to large-scale SAF production. Current technologies, such as HEFA which converts used cooking oil into SAF, are limited in scale, and competition for feedstocks with other sectors may restrict availability.

To meet the net zero target, airlines will need 500 million tonnes of SAF annually by 2050. Biomass could provide over 300 million tonnes each year, while power-to-liquid (PtL) technologies will be essential to produce the remaining volume. Expanding production will require improvements in conversion efficiency, faster technology rollout, enhanced feedstock logistics, and upgraded infrastructure across regions.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh emphasised the urgency of action. “We now have unequivocal evidence that if SAF production is prioritised then feedstock availability is not a barrier in the industry’s path to decarbonisation. There is enough potential feedstock from sustainable sources to reach net zero carbon emissions in 2050. However, this will only be accomplished with a major acceleration of the SAF industry’s growth. We need shovels in the ground now,” he said.

The report also identified key challenges, including scaling up new SAF production technologies, ensuring feedstocks are available to the aviation sector, securing low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure for PtL, and achieving coordinated government policies to foster innovation and investment. Regional leadership from North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN will be critical to global SAF output.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist, highlighted the broader benefits of SAF. “The report highlights the local and regional opportunities for SAF production to create jobs, stimulate economies and support energy security goals. Governments, energy producers, investors, and the aviation sector must work together, de-risk investment, and accelerate rollout. Policy certainty and cross-sector collaboration are essential to unlock the scale we need. The time to act is now, delays will only make the challenge harder,” she said.

Walsh added, “With this study it becomes clear that we can make SAF the solution it needs to be for aviation’s decarbonisation. The potential to turn SAF feedstock into real SAF production is in the hands of policymakers and business leaders, particularly in the energy sector. The conclusion of this study is an urgent call to action. We have just 25 years to turn this proven potential into reality.”",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/09/26/86777-saf-adobestock465019242.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 04:56:36.023773

Zero Pollution Action Plan

The Ambient Air Quality Directive forms part of the EU’s Zero Pollution Action Plan, which aims to reduce premature deaths from air pollution by 55% by 2030.

As the EPA noted, Ireland is currently projected to achieve 93% compliance with the fine particulate matter standard (PM2.5) and 78% compliance with nitrogen dioxide limits, and also continues to fall ‘well short’ of more stringent World Health Organization (WHO) health-based 2040 guidelines for several key pollutants.

Solid fuel burning and traffic emissions are the primary sources of air pollution in Ireland, the report found, with the European Environment Agency estimating that approximately 1,700 premature deaths occur each year in Ireland as a result of poor air quality.

‘Healthier air and healthier lives’

“Many of us have grown up with the comfort of an open fire and limited alternatives to travelling by car—but these familiar habits contribute to poor air quality,” commented Pat Byrne, director of the EPA’s Office of Radiation Protection and Environmental Monitoring. “Supporting people to shift towards cleaner heating and more sustainable travel isn’t about giving something up—it’s about gaining healthier air and healthier lives.”

Backed by Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, IAG (British Airways, Iberia, Vueling, Aer Lingus, and LEVEL), Cathay Pacific, and Japan Airlines, have thrown in a total of $150 million to fund the programme. This has also been backed by a Star Alliance airline member, Singapore Airlines.

A Partnership With Breakthrough Energy Ventures

Announced on September 17, in Dallas, Texas, the oneworld alliance, and member airlines (plus SQ), have forged a partnership with Breakthrough Energy Ventures, an umbrella company founded by Bill Gates ten years ago (2015), with a vision to accelerate innovation through sustainable energy, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through new technologies.

The partnership will launch a new investment fund that is specifically designed to address the high costs and scarce availability of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This fund, which is led by Alaska Airlines and American Airlines as 'cornerstone investors', will bid to accelerate the development of longer-term aviation fuel solutions at scale. Robert Isom, chief executive officer of American Airlines and chairman of oneworld, explained:

“By investing in the SAF technologies of the future, American and our oneworld partners are making this business decision to unlock novel technologies with the potential to reach larger scale at lower prices than current technologies can achieve.

""We believe reducing the emissions from our operation meets the demands of our customers, will make our business more competitive, and will enable us to continue to deliver the enormous economic benefits of commercial aviation for generations to come.”

Understanding The BEV Fund:

The structure of the Breakthrough Energy Venures (BEV) fund, is set to provide global development of fuel solutions that are cost effective, long-term, lower emmission fuels when compared with traditional jet-fuel. This will be developed by investing in new neovel, next generation fuel technologies, while supporting the growth of alternative fuel markets.

It's no secret that the aviation industry must look to adapt to new ways of thinking and operating, with alternative, more sustainable fuel options. The BEV fund is expected to create economic value for all of its investors and the regions in the world to which its airline partners operate.

Alaska Airlines, a cornerstone investor, has already noted its excitement to partner with this innovative fund to contribute to the development of innovative SAF technology. Its partnership with BEV will bring the scientific, technical, and commercial expertise required to help develop next-generation fuels for the decades ahead.

Next-Generation Thinking For the Aviation Industry

As analysed by oneworld, the global aviation industry generates more than $4.1 trillion in economic activity around the world, and as a result supports more than 85 million jobs. However, the industry accounts for around 2-3% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally, in addition to other environmental impacts.

Airlines are now looking to address how they can limit their footprint on the environment by investing in more modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. Demand for air travel shows no signs of slowing and is expected to rise. As a result, sustainable aviation fuel is necessary to be the tool to limit continued environmental impacts.

Using SAF can decrease carbon dioxide emissions significantly; however, the fuel is yet to attract the necessary investment to scale production at competitive prices. oneworlds bold step, will be a new chapter in this story, with the alliance airlines partners, focussed on supporting the initative.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2671682753-1.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-26 04:56:45.399184

This move aligns with South Korea’s broader environmental goals, reinforcing the country’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector. By integrating SAF into its flights from Incheon to Kobe and Gimpo to Osaka, Korean Air is leading the way in sustainable travel, helping to shape a greener future for global air travel. This expansion is not only a crucial step for the airline but also supports the global push for decarbonization in aviation.

Korean Air has significantly advanced its commitment to sustainability by expanding the use of domestically produced Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on its flights connecting Incheon to Kobe and Gimpo to Osaka, Japan. This move comes as part of the airline’s broader initiative to reduce its carbon footprint and contribute to the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts. SAF has become a crucial element in the global push to make air travel more sustainable, and Korean Air is leading the way in integrating this innovative fuel into its operations.

In August 2024, Korean Air first began testing the performance and safety of domestically produced SAF on its Incheon-Haneda route. The trial was a resounding success, confirming that the fuel could be safely and effectively used on long-haul flights. Following the successful trial, the airline decided to extend its use of SAF to two additional routes: Incheon to Kobe (KE731) and Gimpo to Osaka (KE2117), which started on 19 September 2025. The implementation of SAF on these routes is part of the airline’s ongoing commitment to sustainable aviation and its support for the global goal of achieving carbon neutrality in the aviation sector.

The benefits of SAF in comparison to traditional jet fuel are significant. One of the most important advantages of SAF is its potential to reduce life-cycle carbon emissions by up to 80%. This reduction is achieved because SAF is made from sustainable feedstocks, such as used cooking oil (UCO), and has a much lower carbon intensity than conventional jet fuel. By using SAF, airlines can drastically decrease the environmental impact of their operations without sacrificing performance or safety.

Korean Air’s use of SAF on the Kobe and Osaka routes will involve a 1% SAF blend, a percentage that aligns with the industry’s initial phase of SAF adoption. The airline plans to incorporate this blend into approximately 90 flights on the Kobe route and 26 flights on the Osaka route through 31 December 2026. While the 1% blend is relatively modest, it is an important first step toward increasing the use of SAF in the airline’s fleet. As technology advances and SAF production becomes more widespread, Korean Air expects to increase the proportion of SAF in its fuel blend, contributing further to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from its operations.

The SAF being used by Korean Air is sourced from two domestic suppliers, HD Hyundai Oilbank and GS Caltex, both of which are key players in South Korea’s energy and fuel production industries. These suppliers are producing SAF from used cooking oil, a renewable feedstock that helps reduce waste while providing a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. The SAF produced by these suppliers has been certified under the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s (ICAO) Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This certification ensures that the fuel meets the rigorous sustainability and carbon reduction standards required by the aviation industry.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions, the use of SAF is also expected to have other positive environmental impacts. By supporting the development and deployment of SAF, Korean Air is contributing to the growth of the biofuels industry in South Korea. This industry has the potential to generate significant economic and environmental benefits, as it reduces the country’s dependence on imported fossil fuels and helps stimulate green innovation in various sectors, including transportation and energy.

This initiative reflects Korean Air’s broader strategy to support sustainable aviation and help meet global environmental goals. The airline has been increasingly active in incorporating green technologies into its operations, with the use of SAF representing just one part of its larger sustainability efforts. Other initiatives include the introduction of more fuel-efficient aircraft, the use of sustainable ground handling equipment, and the development of energy-saving operational procedures. By adopting SAF on key international routes, Korean Air is positioning itself as a leader in the effort to decarbonize the aviation industry.

Korean Air’s commitment to sustainability also extends beyond its use of SAF. The airline has been working closely with global organizations and regulatory bodies to ensure that its sustainability practices align with international standards and best practices. This includes participation in the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) efforts to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint and ongoing investments in research and development for alternative fuels and technologies. The adoption of SAF is an essential part of Korean Air’s long-term strategy to reduce its overall carbon emissions and contribute to the aviation industry’s overall sustainability goals.

The expanded use of SAF by Korean Air is a significant milestone in the airline’s ongoing sustainability journey. By using SAF on high-traffic routes to Japan, Korean Air is demonstrating that sustainable aviation is both achievable and practical in the short term. This move also sets a precedent for other airlines in the region and beyond, highlighting the potential for SAF to play a crucial role in reducing the environmental impact of air travel.

Looking ahead, the airline plans to increase its use of SAF as more sustainable fuel production facilities are built and as the global supply of SAF becomes more readily available. In addition to its environmental benefits, SAF offers the potential to enhance the long-term viability of the aviation industry by reducing its dependence on fossil fuels and promoting a more sustainable future for air travel.

South Korea is advancing its sustainable aviation efforts by expanding Korean Air’s use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on key routes to Japan. This move aligns with the country’s environmental goals and supports the global push for greener air travel.

Korean Air’s use of domestically produced SAF on its routes to Kobe and Osaka is a crucial step forward in the airline’s commitment to sustainability. The airline’s leadership in adopting SAF and its continued efforts to drive innovation in sustainable aviation will likely inspire other carriers to follow suit, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry in the years to come.

As part of the $200 million project, Ryanair plans to operate 23 routes, including 11 new connections to major European destinations such as London, Bratislava, Stockholm and Brussels. The plan will also focus on increased domestic flights to cities like Verona, Pescara and Bari.

The million-dollar expansion is forecast to create more than 800 local jobs and handle over one million passengers annually.

The airlines also plan to improve year-round connectivity for Sicilian residents and tourists through a 10% increase in capacity on routes to Milan and Rome.

Eddie Wilson, Ryanair CEO, stated that the new base in Trapani-Marsala represents a long-term commitment to Sicily.

“By connecting Trapani with nine countries and key Italian cities, we are ensuring the island benefits from sustained economic growth, greater tourism and consistent year-round access,” he stated.

Municipal Tax Reforms in Sicily Driving Growth

The project focusing on the new base at Trapani-Marsala Airport, leading to its revival, comes after years of challenges, including the absence of Ryanair services for a decade. Local authorities credit the abolishment of the Municipal Tax as a decisive factor in attracting investment back to the region.

Regional President Renato Schifani’s government has positioned the elimination of the tax as a cornerstone of its strategy to enhance air travel across Sicily.

Officials stated that the removal of the surcharge encourages airlines to expand and makes secondary airports more competitive.

“The elimination of the surtax could attract up to five million additional passengers to Sicilian airports. This will not only lower fares but also strengthen our regional economy and tourism,” said Alessandro Arico, Sicily’s Councillor for Infrastructure and Mobility.

Calling Ryanair’s return “the milestone” of Trapani-Marsala Airport’s revival, Airgest President Salvatore Ombra, whose team oversees Trapani’s Vincenzo Florio airport, stated, “After a 10-year absence, we are seeing the results of our determination and the government’s support.”

“This is just the beginning of further modernisation plans,” he added.

After successful exports to Japanese carriers last year, Hyundai Oilbank now begins regular supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel for the Korean Air route between Incheon and Kobe. The program will fuel ninety aircraft movements through twenty twenty six, giving the airline an immediate reduction in lifecycle emissions without altering equipment or schedules.

Innovative Production Platform

The refinery produces one hundred thirty thousand tonnes of biodiesel each year and applies advanced supercritical processing that works under elevated temperature and pressure while avoiding chemical catalysts. This approach accepts high acid, non edible feedstocks that do not compete with food markets. By simplifying purification steps, the method cuts both operating cost and waste generation, positioning the plant to scale additional aviation volumes rapidly.

Expansion to Blue Water Fleets

Hyundai Oilbank has already supplied ultra low sulfur biofuel to domestic and international shipping lines, demonstrating that the same infrastructure can serve multiple hard to abate sectors. The dual

market strategy diversifies revenue, strengthens supply chain resilience, and creates consistent demand for domestic feedstock growers.

Non-obvious Insight

The adoption of supercritical technology delivers an often overlooked benefit: it allows producers to swap feedstocks seasonally based on price and availability without lengthy reconfiguration. This flexibility transforms feedstock procurement from a fixed cost into a dynamic optimisation lever, enabling margin protection during volatile commodity cycles.

The Boeing 777X offers this comfort at scale, with hundreds of seats per flight.
Here are some specifications from the Boeing 777-8 from manufacturer Boeing: Beyond flight operation, commonality exists between the Boeing 777X and existing Boeing 777 maintenance networks, allowing the aircraft to easily integrate into the fleets of legacy Boeing 777 operators.
So, What Is The Bottom Line When It Comes To The Boeing 777X?
At the end of the day, the Boeing 777X will fundamentally change the aviation industry when it enters service.","The Boeing 777X is the latest-generation widebody to be brought to the market by US-based manufacturer Boeing (NYSE: BA). The aircraft is designed to replace the Boeing 777-300ER and capture very long-haul missions with lower fuel burn and higher seating density. The aircraft comes in two variants: the high-capacity Boeing 777-9, geared towards trunk routes, and the ultra-long-range Boeing 777-8, geared towards the ultra-long-range segment. The aircraft features new carbon-fiber composite wings and folding wingtips, which extend the aircraft's range and cruise efficiency. These wingtips also allow the aircraft to comfortably fit into Code-E gates. The jet's GE9X engines will be the largest ever to enter commercial service with a passenger airline.

The aircraft's cabin borrows a number of features from the earlier Boeing 787, including larger windows, improved pressurization and humidity, and wide cabins that support competitive business class layouts. The Boeing 777-9 seats between 380 and 420 passengers in a three-class configuration with a range of around 7,200 to 7,300 nautical miles. The Boeing 777-8 targets around 350 seats over an 8,700 nautical mile range, making it more ideal for thinner, ultra-long-range sectors. Current major customers for the model include Emirates, Qatar Airways, Lufthansa, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, ANA, Etihad, and Singapore Airlines.

A Breakthrough In Gate-Fitting Technology

The Boeing 777X's folding wingtips allow Boeing to offer a high-aspect-ratio composite wing, which provides exceptional efficiency while in cruise control. However, the manufacturer still wants operators to be able to park the aircraft at Code-E gates when the tips fold on the ground. This single design choice drastically changes airport math. Carriers chase long-haul route economics without triggering costly aircraft stands or requiring widened taxiways. From an operational perspective, this leverages advanced technology to provide flexibility for operators unlike anything ever seen before.

This is exceptionally valuable for operators that fly in and out of slot-constrained hub facilities. Some airports, like London Heathrow Airport (LHR), are pretty much already operating at maximum capacity, with little room for additional flights. As a result, airlines are in a position where they are required to purchase landing slots in order to gain access to the airport, and some of these slots can go for millions of dollars. At these kinds of slot-constrained hubs, the Boeing 777-9 can deliver Boeing 777-300ER-level capacity and range using existing airport infrastructure.

For airports, this is a hedge. The aircraft ensures that it can expand capacity without having to invest in the expensive development of wider gates that can accommodate its exceptional wingspan. Over time, this gate-fit innovation will gradually become a template for others to follow, as continuing to modify airports to fit larger and wider aircraft is both expensive and inefficient. Expanding some gates means eliminating others, something very unpopular at airports that continue to become increasingly crowded each year.

A New Frontier In Long-Haul Unit Costs

The Boeing 777X pushes down long-haul costs per seat while preserving the Boeing 777's belly cargo space and maintaining the same amount of premium cabin real estate. This ensures that the aircraft can offer an efficient gauge on sectors that have flight times between 8 and 14 hours. On trunk routes, the aircraft can consolidate off-peak demand into a single departure with more seats, offering better per-seat economics and a stronger premium density, something valuable to today's hub carriers that operate out of slot-constrained hubs.

On thinner, long sectors, the Boeing 777-8's payload-range profile supports city pairs that push the Boeing 787-10 to its limits, but don't require the hefty gauge of an Airbus A380. This enabled new on-stop-to-nonstop upgrades and robust winter schedules. The aircraft's geometry also shifts for alliances, with more seats at competitive unit costs allowing the airline to sustain corporate contracts without adding frequencies that erode aircraft yields. In leisure-heavy markets, lower per-seat-mile costs improve off-season viability, allowing airlines to use the jet to stabilize off-season connectivity.

The aircraft's floor plan also caters to premium-friendly operations, with wide aisles and big galleys. Business class suites with closing doors, true premium economy depth, and a healthy economy cabin are all options, allowing airlines to balance yield mix and scale as desired. The net effect of this aircraft entering service will be a valuable fleet tool that widens the profitability envelope for airlines on all kinds of high-density routes.

A Quieter, Calmer Long-Haul: Cabin And Comfort Upgrades

Borrowing from the Boeing 787's cabin design, the Boeing 777X offers improved pressurization and humidity, ensuring that passengers can relax in a quieter environment with a wider fuselage cross-section. This supports roomier aisles and more generous shoulder space for passengers. The aircraft is a canvas on which airlines can install next-generation business class suites, most of which feature doors, in addition to large premium economy seats with layouts that allow credible seat width. This reduces anticipated passenger fatigue on 10 and 15-hour segments.

More aerodynamically clean wings and modern flight control systems reduce turbulence during flights, resulting in improved sleep quality for passengers. Cabins are also insulated to reduce overall noise, and LED lighting is reduced to improve circadian rhythms. Improved airflow control reduces perceived jet lag and enhances meal pacing without leading to clogs in galleys.

For passengers who are interested in remaining fully connected while on the go with abundant power and reliable Bluetooth audio, the experience can feel less like an endurance test and more like a productive work block or restful overnight travel. The Boeing 777X offers this comfort at scale, with hundreds of seats per flight. This combination of quiet operations and a comfortable environment will set a new standard for long-haul comfort, pushing operators to match this new exceedingly high bar in order to ensure the most comfortable experience possible for their passengers.

Fuel Burn And A Path To Lower Carbon Emissions

The Boeing 777X's efficiency story involves blending carbon-fiber wings and advanced aerodynamics with GE9X engines that use ceramic-matrix composites and lean-burn combustors. This ensures that a very high bypass ratio is utilized as it will reduce fuel consumption. For airlines, this offers lower trip costs and lower fuel burn per seat, something which is compounded by carbon pricing and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending mandates, which continue to rise. Overall, community noise footprints continue to shrink, easing night-bank operations and slot negotiations at major hubs.

Aircraft compatibility with high-blend sustainable aviation fuel helps airlines decarbonize quicker, with aircraft efficiency preserving range and payload when SAF energy density or supply drives contract margins. Fewer flights can carry the same number of passengers due to the aircraft's higher gauge, reducing overall movements and associated carbon emissions in the market. Here are some specifications from the Boeing 777-8 from manufacturer Boeing:

Beyond flight operation, commonality exists between the Boeing 777X and existing Boeing 777 maintenance networks, allowing the aircraft to easily integrate into the fleets of legacy Boeing 777 operators. With a fleet life measured in decades, these incremental fuel gains certainly compound, especially on the world's highest-demand flagship sectors where marginal drag and increased engine efficiency matter the most. The outcome, in the end, is not a single silver bullet but a credible step down the emissions curve that scales at a global level.

Ripple Effects Across The Industry

Because the Boeing 777X is an update of the popular Boeing 777 family, airlines can use the same pilots, procedures, and maintenance setup that they already have in place. This makes it faster to put into service and less risky than a brand-new model.

Aircraft training is relatively simpler too, as crews can easily move between Boeing 777 versions in order to cover busy seasons or disruptions. This allows them to keep schedules steady and maintain costs in check. While on the ground, a large, modern Boeing 777 fleet supports spare parts suppliers and repair shops, lowering maintenance time frames across an entire fleet.

The Boeing 777X also accommodates a large amount of belly cargo without compromising passenger cabin space, making it ideal for e-commerce and pharmaceuticals on longer routes. Regulators will also set clear rules for folding wingtips and similar aircraft features, paving the way for more efficiency gains in the long run. Passengers can also get used to seeing this at airports.

So, What Is The Bottom Line When It Comes To The Boeing 777X?

At the end of the day, the Boeing 777X will fundamentally change the aviation industry when it enters service. The era of large-capacity widebody jets like the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 747 may be over.

However, the introduction of new, capable models with long-range capabilities that have the appealing operating economics of twin-engine aircraft will become more popular than ever. Jets like the Boeing 777X continue to be among the most innovative aircraft on the market and operators anxiously await their entry into service.

Ensuring that models like the Boeing 777X not only enter service cleanly but are able to have an extensive impact on the market will prove essential for operators. The jet will become a common sight at airports, and it will offer an exceptional passenger experience with unbeatable economics for airlines.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/476589458_1048570050648136_4205377480146556987_n.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 23:56:45.858573

1) A Decisive Decade Begins

Every industrial transition arrives in two movements: first, a proof of possibility; then, a proof of inevitability. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) cleared the first bar over the last fifteen years - multiple ASTM pathways, early flights, and the birth of book-and-claim markets. Now we enter the second movement, where the question is not whether we can decarbonize aviation, but how fast we can scale the molecules that will do it.

The IATA - Worley global feedstock assessment removes any remaining ambiguity about the starting point for this decade: waste and residue lipids are the most bankable, sustainable, and immediately scalable feedstocks, and HEFA is the pathway that can turn them into certified jet fuel at the speed policy now demands. That is the thesis of this article - and the strategic reason to situate our flagship HEFA SAF refinery in Port Klang, Malaysia.

2) What the IATA - Worley Assessment Actually Says

The assessment frames Asia - Pacific - and especially ASEAN - as one of the world’s richest biomass theaters for SAF, but it also cautions against magical thinking. It quantifies a vast regional feedstock base and clarifies the shares by category through 2030 and 2050, with agricultural residues as the single largest pool and oil-based wastes/residues (UCO, tallow, PFAD) forming a consistently material share of what is both available and practical to mobilize in the near term. In ASEAN & Pacific, unlocking oil-based and agroforestry residues could yield ~112 Mt of SAF biomass feedstock by 2030, increasing to ~129 Mt by 2050—a resource platform that is both diversified and adaptable to multiple pathways.

Crucially for Malaysia’s positioning, the report recognizes ASEAN’s dominant oil-based feedstock capability, led by Malaysia and Indonesia, and underscores that the region is currently focusing on maximizing HEFA production thanks to established lipid supply chains and installed industrial competence—cues investors should not ignore.

3) The Strategic Logic of HEFA - Now

HEFA is not merely an ASTM annex or a chemistry set; it is a commercial ecosystem with proven performance, certified sustainability routes, and real production plants. That matters when you must approve capex at scale. While e-SAF (PtL), ATJ, and FT are essential for the 2030s–2040s, the 2020s are HEFA’s decade - the bridge that lets aviation post real decarbonization tonnage while the rest of the portfolio matures. The assessment validates this hierarchy implicitly: crop-based scaling is constrained by land - use and food security, whereas wastes and residues - notably UCO and lipid side - streams - are the sustainable growth lane the world can accept politically and accelerate industrially.

This isn’t about “picking winners”; it’s about sequencing. We scale the bankable pathway first (HEFA from wastes/residues) to unlock policy credibility, offtake discipline, and supply - chain muscle memory. That sequencing lowers perceived risk and brings the cost delta down sooner, which in turn makes later-decade pathways financeable at scale.

4) Why Waste & Residue Lipids Are the Best Near - Term Bet

Waste and residue lipids—UCO, tallow, PFAD, selected processing residues—uniquely satisfy sustainability, carbon-intensity, and social acceptance requirements:

High sustainability integrity: They avoid the land-use change and food security debates that shadow crop oils. The assessment is explicit that crop-based pathways offer limited scalability under real-world land and food constraints; scaling should focus on wastes/residues.

Systems readiness: ASEAN already runs large, sophisticated lipid supply chains (oleochemicals, palm derivates), and Malaysia/Indonesia lead this domain, shortening the learning curve for SAF-grade logistics, pretreatment, and QA/QC.

Immediate carbon benefit: UCO-HEFA typically delivers significant lifecycle CO₂ reductions (depending on system boundaries), with transparent certification possible through ISCC/CORSIA frameworks and digital chain-of-custody—precisely the sort of proof airlines and corporate buyers require.

The practical obstacles are not about what to use; they’re about how to mobilize it. The assessment details the logistics and aggregation challenges that slow waste/residue flows—fragmented production, scattered generation sites, seasonal availability, lack of storage, and limited standardized collection practices. It calls for intermediary aggregation hubs, cooperative models, and digital coordination tools to ensure consistent, year-round supply—exactly the system design FatHopes Energy has built for a decade.

5) Malaysia’s Native Advantages - Made for HEFA

Geography, industry, and know-how combine to give Malaysia a rare trifecta:

Port Klang on the Straits of Malacca—one of the world’s busiest maritime corridors—lets us aggregate feedstock regionally and export liquid molecules effortlessly, a crucial advantage given how book-and-claim and physical blending will co-evolve this decade.

Industrial and talent depth: Our oleochemical and palm industry base trains engineers, chemists, operators, and quality managers in lipid systems, catalysis, and large-scale processing—capabilities that translate directly to HEFA.

Feedstock theater: The assessment identifies ASEAN (Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines) as the regional nucleus for biomass, with oil-based streams a persistent share of the total potential through 2030–2050.

Policy leverage: With ASEAN chairmanship, Malaysia can harmonize fragmented national plans, moving from uncoordinated targets to a regional SAF platform that standardizes certification, accounting, and cross-border logistics.

6) The ASEAN Feedstock Map - Where the Tonnes Live

The assessment’s blueprint for East Asia & Pacific excludes Japan, Korea, Singapore from primary feedstock sourcing (they are expected importers) and centers the biomass story on ASEAN + Australia. It projects ~10% of the region’s unconstrained feedstock potential by 2030 dedicated to SAF (rising slightly by 2050), with agricultural residues ~60–64%, MSW ~13%, and oil-based ~9–13%—a composition that stays remarkably stable across the time horizon. This anchor is why we argue for a portfolio mindset with HEFA as the near-term backbone.

The document also emphasizes residue classes—rice straw, husks, mill by-products, forestry and wood waste—plus MSW, whose combustibles will grow with urbanization. These pools matter for ATJ/FT down the line, but require supply-chain formalization and waste-management upgrades before they can reliably feed commercial SAF at scale—another reason to lead with HEFA now while building the residue/MSW pipelines for the 2030s.

7) Designing Port Klang as Malaysia’s HEFA Lighthouse

A Port Klang HEFA refinery should be engineered around three reinforcing design pillars:

(i) Feedstock-first design Build pretreatment and hydrotreating trains that are lipid-agnostic within the waste/residue family: UCO, tallow, PFAD, selected side-streams. Engineer for contaminant robustness (metals, water, FFA variability), and data-rich receiving that ties every batch to a traceability ledger. The assessment highlights exactly this need for intermediary hubs, storage, preprocessing, and digital coordination to overcome scattered supply. Our design institutionalizes those hubs at the terminal-refinery interface.

(ii) Digital chain-of-custody as core infrastructure Treat traceability as a plant utility, not an optional bolt-on. A refinery that can generate auditable, real-time chain-of-custody compliant with ISCC/CORSIA will command a premium from airlines and corporate buyers. The assessment’s repeated warning about fragmented, decentralized supply points straight at the solution: digitize collection, aggregation, validation, and mass balance, then lock it with third-party certs.

(iii) Export-ready liquids & regional integration Engineer the site as a regional molecule hub, capable of book-and-claim enablement and physical shipments aligned with contracts. Port Klang’s maritime scale means SAF/renewable naphtha/diesel coproducts can move fluidly to ASEAN, India, Middle East, and even Europe—turning sustainability into export earnings while undergirding aviation’s decarbonization.

8) The Finance Case - Why HEFA Clears Investment Committees

Investors fund de-risked pathways. HEFA’s advantages are pragmatic:

Proven capex & opex envelope: Reference plants and licensors exist.

Certifications and buyers: ASTM pathway maturity + airline offtake culture = bankable revenue visibility.

Policy alignment: Near-term mandates/levies and incentive frameworks reward early tonnes.

Digital premium: Verifiable chain-of-custody can command price premiums and unlock Scope 3 credit demand from corporate travel buyers.

The IATA–Worley document’s central caution is not that feedstock is lacking, but that supply chains are messy and under-organized. That is a solvable, investable problem—especially in Malaysia, whose private sector has already built collection networks, depot infrastructure, and data systems for exacting international buyers.

9) The Policy Design - How Malaysia Leads at Home and in ASEAN

To turn assessment insights into national advantage, Malaysia should adopt six policy levers:

A Malaysia SAF Roadmap with clear HEFA-first sequencing, blending targets, and a long-dated incentive runway to derisk capital.

Creditable carbon accounting & book-and-claim standardization so that every tonne uplifted anywhere can be claimed everywhere—within a harmonized ASEAN framework. The assessment notes regional policy fragmentation; chairmanship is our window to set the standard.

Aggregation infrastructure finance—storage, preprocessing, rural collection roads—precisely the bottlenecks identified in the report.

Fast-track permitting for HEFA and mutual recognition of certifications across ASEAN to shorten time-to-tonnes.

Cooperative vendor models for smallholders and MSMEs that formalize supply without excluding the informal sector—answering the assessment’s call for intermediary hubs and coordination.

Export ambition—treat SAF as a strategic liquid export alongside petrochemicals and oleochemicals; Port Klang becomes the green molecules pier of ASEAN.

10) Addressing the Hard Questions - Upfront

Q: Will wastes and residues be “enough”? A: Alone, no—portfolio thinking is essential. But wastes/residues are enough to justify a decade of HEFA scale-up, which buys time for ATJ/FT to mature on residues/MSW and for PtL to ride the hydrogen-and-power cost curve. The assessment’s composition shares (residues largest, oil-based consistently material, MSW growing) match that portfolio logic.

Q: What about sustainability controversies around palm derivatives? A: The assessment is explicit: any expansion that triggers LUC/deforestation is constrained. Our strategy centers wastes and residues (UCO, PFAD side-streams where permissible, and mill residues), not primary crop expansion. We must hard-wire traceability and prefer UCO as the signature feedstock—socially acceptable, circular, and already flowing through compliant supply chains.

Q: Is MSW or forestry residue a faster route than HEFA? A: Not in this decade. The assessment notes collection complexity, competing uses, and logistics that require targeted investments and systems reform before MSW/forestry can behave like bankable SAF feedstock at scale. Hence HEFA-first, then residue/MSW-based ATJ/FT as the 2030s workhorses.

Q: How does PtL/e-SAF fit? A: It’s essential—but power-constrained. The assessment underlines that PtL depends on renewable power, electrolyzers, CO₂ capture logistics, and grid build-out. It is the late-decade scaler; betting the 2020s on it would delay real tonnes now.

11) Building the Malaysian Playbook - From UCO to SAF at Scale

Step 1: Lock the collection flywheel. Scale UCO aggregation across HORECA and food manufacturing, integrate household flows via ranger/consumer nodes, and formalize POME/PFAD side-streams where they meet best-practice sustainability. The assessment’s diagnosis—fragmented generation, seasonal flows, and weak storage—is exactly the problem set our digital stack solves.

Step 2: Engineer pretreatment resilience. Design for contaminant variability and rapid feedstock switching. Use data to triage batches before hydrotreating. This is where Port Klang’s terminal footprint can host quality-indexed storage and continuous QA—a physical expression of mass balance you can audit.

Step 3: Institutionalize trust. Make chain-of-custody a product. Airlines and corporate buyers are not just buying fuel; they are buying auditable emissions math. Bake ISCC/CORSIA workflows into operations; expose buyer dashboards with real-time batch lineage.

Step 4: Export competence. Use Port Klang’s shipping lanes to move SAF, renewable diesel, and co-products. Link physical flows with book-and-claim registries accepted across ASEAN and beyond.

12) ASEAN as a Coordinated SAF Basin

The report’s regional lens makes one policy message unmistakable: coordination beats fragmentation. With Malaysia in the chair, ASEAN can:

Standardize certification & accounting so a tonne from Malaysia can be recognized seamlessly in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, the Philippines.

Pool aggregation infrastructure—cross-border depots and preprocessing—targeted exactly where the assessment finds today’s bottlenecks.

Prioritize wastes/residues first, while co-funding residue/MSW formalization to prepare ATJ/FT for the 2030s.

13) The Social Contract - Waste to Wealth

A HEFA strategy built on wastes and residues carries a pragmatic social dividend: it pays households, hawkers, small eateries, and MSMEs for what was once a nuisance stream; it cuts improper disposal and landfill pressure; and it transforms women- and family-run micro-businesses into feedstock entrepreneurs—precisely the intermediary hubs the assessment says are required for reliable year-round supply.

14) Risk, Managed - How We Keep the License to Operate

Three guardrails keep this strategy future-proof:

No new land-use; waste & residue-only growth. This aligns with the assessment’s sustainability boundary and avoids the policy backlash that derails investor confidence.

Digital transparency. The supply chain is only as strong as its weakest ledger. Make the ledger public (within commercial bounds), certify continuously, and punish non-compliance.

Portfolio evolution. Treat HEFA as necessary but not sufficient; begin residue/MSW pilots for ATJ/FT and lay the power foundations for PtL, consistent with the assessment’s view of feedstock classes and PtL prerequisites.

15) The Investor’s Summary - Why This Works in Malaysia

Resource certainty: ASEAN biomass base, with oil-based wastes/residues a steady slice through 2050.

Operational competence: Malaysia’s lipid industries + Port Klang logistics.

Demand pull: Global mandates and voluntary markets; buyers prefer traceable waste-based SAF.

Policy window: ASEAN chairmanship to harmonize rules and reduce cross-border friction.

Scalable narrative: A refinery designed as infrastructure + information system will earn a trust premium in book-and-claim markets.

16) The Call to Action - Time to Choose Speed

The IATA–Worley assessment is not a promise; it is a map. Maps don’t move you—leaders do. Malaysia’s choice is stark: either treat this decade as a pilot program and watch others seize the export geography, or build Port Klang into ASEAN’s green molecules pier and lead the most investable phase of aviation decarbonization.

To Government: Publish a Malaysia SAF Roadmap with HEFA-first sequencing, incentives through 2035, and ASEAN-wide certification harmonization. Fund aggregation infrastructure where the assessment identifies the bottlenecks—storage, preprocessing, rural roads, and digital coordination.

To Investors: Back the Port Klang HEFA refinery now. Bankability rests on pathway maturity, feedstock realism, and verifiable accounting. This is the combination Malaysia uniquely offers.

To Airlines: Anchor financing with multi-year offtakes and commit to book-and-claim at scale. Demand waste-residue provenance and real-time chain-of-custody—force a race to the top on transparency.

To ASEAN Partners: Use Malaysia’s chair to adopt a regional SAF standard and shared infrastructure toolkit. Coordinate targets to avoid policy whiplash and drive pooled procurement.

To the Public: Your household UCO is climate infrastructure. Return it through formal channels; insist on transparent collection; and recognize that every liter kept out of drains and landfills is one step closer to clean flight.

17) Closing : Malaysia’s HEFA Mandate

Aviation’s decarbonization will be written, in no small part, by the places that can organize waste & residue lipids into auditable molecules at scale. The IATA–Worley assessment is clear about the resource base, honest about the logistics constraints, and optimistic about what coordination and infrastructure can unlock. That is Malaysia’s brief. That is Port Klang’s opportunity.

We predicted this decade. Now we must build it—with the HEFA refinery, the digital ledger, and the regional standard that lets the world trust every tonne we ship. The window is open. Let’s move.

Bangchak’s transition is anchored in its BCP 316 NET strategy, a plan that commits the group to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Bangchak’s rise highlights the opportunities and tensions facing Southeast Asia’s energy incumbents.
As Southeast Asia’s energy transition accelerates, Bangchak’s evolution from national refiner to regional clean energy contender shows how even mid-sized players can carve out leadership positions.","For much of its four-decade history, Bangchak Corporation was regarded as a mid-sized Thai refiner with a strong domestic brand. Today, the company is seeking to punch above its weight, presenting itself as a regional champion of sustainable energy through a growing portfolio of renewable power, biofuels and next-generation fuels.

Bangchak’s transition is anchored in its BCP 316 NET strategy, a plan that commits the group to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The strategy reflects a balancing act: using cash flows from its refining and retail network to bankroll a rapid expansion into green projects across Southeast Asia. Executives argue that this dual model allows Bangchak to maintain financial resilience while positioning itself at the forefront of the region’s decarbonisation agenda.

The company’s most visible international success is the Monsoon wind project in Laos, one of the largest in Southeast Asia, which has begun exporting power to Vietnam. The project not only diversifies Bangchak’s portfolio beyond its home market but also underscores its role in cross-border energy integration, a priority for ASEAN governments as they seek to build a regional power grid. In Taiwan, Bangchak is pressing ahead with two new solar farms of more than 100MW combined, expanding its presence in one of Asia’s most advanced renewable markets.

These projects are complemented by domestic innovation. In Thailand, Bangchak has piloted solar-plus-battery storage for agricultural cooperatives, a model that could become a template for distributed power generation in rural communities. Its investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with a unit capable of producing up to one million litres a day, positions the company as one of the few Asian producers ready to supply airlines once mandates are introduced. While the regulatory framework remains uncertain, the project illustrates Bangchak’s willingness to take early risks in areas that could become central to the energy transition.

Beyond scale, the group is trying to differentiate itself through circular economy initiatives. Its “Fry to Fly” programme, which turns used cooking oil into jet fuel, has earned environmental awards and strengthened its ESG profile. These initiatives help Bangchak appeal to global investors increasingly focused on sustainability metrics, while reinforcing its domestic reputation as an innovator.

Regional competition is intensifying. Malaysia’s Petronas has launched Gentari, a clean energy subsidiary with multi-gigawatt ambitions. Indonesia’s Pertamina is leveraging its geothermal reserves, and Thailand’s state-backed PTT is deploying capital into hydrogen and electric vehicle infrastructure. Compared with these giants, Bangchak is modest in size. Yet analysts argue that its agility and focus on niche segments such as SAF and community-based renewables allow it to move faster and demonstrate results sooner.

The company’s trajectory has already attracted recognition. It has received awards for environmental compliance at its refinery, as well as accolades for climate leadership. More importantly, it has begun to draw interest from green finance markets, where access to capital increasingly depends on credible transition plans. By embedding ESG objectives into board-level strategy and project design, Bangchak is making the case that it is more than a refiner in transition — it is a regional energy player in its own right.

Bangchak’s rise highlights the opportunities and tensions facing Southeast Asia’s energy incumbents. Demand for fossil fuels remains strong, yet climate commitments and investor pressure are forcing companies to pivot. For Bangchak, the challenge is to scale its clean energy ventures quickly enough to offset future declines in refining revenues, while competing against larger state-backed rivals.

What distinguishes the company is its willingness to reinvent itself. From pioneering biofuels in Thailand to investing in wind in Laos and solar in Taiwan, and now moving into sustainable aviation fuel, Bangchak has repeatedly anticipated policy and market shifts. In doing so, it has crafted a narrative of transformation that resonates beyond its domestic base.

As Southeast Asia’s energy transition accelerates, Bangchak’s evolution from national refiner to regional clean energy contender shows how even mid-sized players can carve out leadership positions. The outcome of its gamble will depend on execution, policy support and market dynamics, but the company has already secured something more immediate: a reputation as one of the region’s most forward-looking energy groups.",https://www.atalayar.com/media/atalayar/images/2025/09/25/2025092516070742666.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 02:56:25.992341

By choosing to fly more sustainably, customers can now achieve the desired frequent flyer status more quickly.

Since 2023, Miles & More members have been able to earn extra miles and Points when booking the Green Fares tariff. This is now also possible with CO2-offsetting packages, which can also be redeemed with miles that have already been earned. With this step, Miles & More aims to encourage its customers to make more sustainable travel choices and thus contribute personally to climate protection.

“Responding to our passengers' wishes with a wide range of services”

The offers include the full offset of calculated individual flight-related CO2 emissions: through the subsequent use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and a contribution to the Lufthansa Group's high-quality climate project portfolio. Depending on the SAF share booked, up to 80 percent more Points and Qualifying Points and up to 20 percent more HON Circle Points can be collected when choosing a CO2-offseting package in addition to the Points credited for the flight. The higher the SAF proportion, the more Points are credited. Additionally, members can earn up to 6 miles per 1 euro spent. This allows them to reach their status or desired reward faster. The new offering complements the awarding of miles and Points for the Green Fares, which have been bookable since 2023: When booking this flight tariff, Miles & More members benefit from up to 20 percent additional miles and Points already today.

“We want to further raise awareness among our customers for more sustainable flying,” says Dieter Vranckx, Chief Commercial Officer Lufthansa Group. “Our goal is to respond to our passengers' wishes with a wide range of offers and to provide them with attractive benefits.

Flexibility and ease of use

CO2-offseting packages can be booked directly during flight booking, before departure in the personal booking area, and even after the flight on the websites of Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Lufthansa, and SWISS. They can also be booked after the flight via the Miles & More app or on miles-and-more.com. Additional miles and Points are now automatically awarded for all newly booked additional packages. If Miles & More members booked a CO2-offseting package for their flights since January 2025, the corresponding miles and Points will also be credited retroactively. This offers Miles & More customers maximum flexibility.

Both the CO2-offseting packages and the Green Fares as a separate tariff option enable passengers to offset their calculated flight-related CO2 emissions through the subsequent use of SAF and a contribution to the Lufthansa Group's high-quality climate project portfolio. The calculation of flight-related emissions per passenger considers various factors such as flight distance, average fuel consumption, travel class, and load factor. Increasingly, guests are choosing the Lufthansa Group's diverse offerings for more sustainable travel: currently, nearly five percent.

Background on the use of SAF and the Lufthansa Group's climate project portfolio

There is no refueling of individual flights with pure SAF. As a so-called ""drop-in"" fuel, SAF is compatible with fossil kerosene and can be easily blended with it. Before being transported to the airport, SAF is mixed with fossil aviation fuel (blending) or produced through co-processing (joint processing of biogenic residues with crude oil) and then transported to airports in Europe where the Lufthansa Group refuels large quantities of kerosene. The Lufthansa Group ensures that the amount of SAF required to offset individual CO2 emissions is fed into the Lufthansa Group's flight operations within six months of purchase. Over its entire lifecycle, the SAF used by the Lufthansa Group from biogenic residues has a CO2 footprint at least 80 percent lower than conventional kerosene from fossil crude oil.",https://content.presspage.com/uploads/2888/be9aa416-f4a7-442b-85c1-e64d795b2a92/1920_20250925_lhg_foto_01_miles_more_setzt_neue_anreize_fuumlr_nachhaltigeres_fliegen.jpg?10000,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:08.054937

This dissertation evaluates the economic viability of a large-scale SAF production project in Brazil, using Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, leveraging the country’s abundant lipid-based feedstocks and evolving regulatory support. To capture the uncertainty surrounding the SAF market, a risk analysis framework combining Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) modelling with Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) is applied, enabling a probabilistic assessment of financial performance, thereby offering a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding than traditional deterministic methods. Moreover, it can be used to support decision-making from a risk-adjusted perspective. Sensitivity, break-even, certainty equivalent and scenario analyses are conducted. The findings indicate that, although the project shows potential for economic feasibility, it is highly exposed to various sources of risk. Particularly, regarding SAF market premiums, primarily driven by regulatory frameworks, and feedstock prices, influenced by availability and demand from the global biofuels market. The future evolution of these factors remains highly uncertain, reflecting a complex interplay between the evolving regulatory landscape, supply-demand dynamics and market maturity. As a result, the project’s viability depends on broader market developments, sustained market prices and the progression of supportive policy frameworks. Furthermore, the results highlight that financial support mechanisms, particularly capital grants, play an important role in improving the economic attractiveness of such capital-intensive projects. This dissertation provides insights for investors and policymakers, emphasising the need for a balance between robust risk mitigation strategies and supportive regulatory efforts to facilitate the commercial-scale deployment of SAF. It contributes to a deeper comprehension of the economic viability and main risk drivers shaping the future of the SAF market.",https://thesis.dial.uclouvain.be/assets/images/dspace-cris-logo-hd.png,N,,2025-09-25 20:56:49.305355

Collectively, these laws reflect a shift toward increasing corporate accountability for human rights, labor conditions, and environmental sustainability within supply chains.
Cohesive due diligence legislation across the union could be similarly helpful for large European firms.
Moreover, the CSDDD requires European firms to put forth climate transition plans that align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement.
The battery passport, an idea developed by the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), would provide each battery with a digital tracking of its supply chain.","Over the past decade, as the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has become more salient, public opinion in Europe has shifted in favor of more sustainable consumption choices. Between 2011 and 2019, Europeans not only showed a continuous increase in support for more sustainable practices, but also reported taking more actions to “help tackle climate change” (European Commission, 2023a). This shift in public opinion has exerted significant pressure on policymakers and firms to push for and adopt more sustainable practices, culminating in the introduction of national-level supply chain due diligence laws as early as 2015. However, with the promulgation of multiple laws across national jurisdictions, a clear need arose to harmonize these regulations.

Thus, in 2024, the European Union adopted the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as part of a broader regulatory effort undertaken by EU policymakers to improve the coherence of its sustainability policies and address human rights abuses in the supply chain of European firms. The directive, similar to many of the individual laws already adopted by certain member states, serves a dual purpose: (a) addressing human rights violations stemming from the activities of large multinational firms abroad and (b) limiting the environmental impacts of those activities (European Commission, 2025b; White & Case, 2025). The date initially set for member states to implement it into national law was 2026.

Although the directive applies broadly to large firms operating within the European Union in various industries, its implications are particularly significant for sectors reliant on critical minerals, especially under the concurrent push for the green transition. Critical minerals such as lithium and cobalt are key to battery energy storage technologies that enable renewable energy generation and the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). However, many critical minerals are extracted and processed in developing countries, often with adverse socioeconomic impacts on local communities and ecosystems (International Energy Agency (IEA), 2025; Stimson Center, 2023; World Economic Forum, 2024).

Though several regulations for battery and critical materials have already been introduced in the European Union, we suggest that, despite the recent Omnibus proposal limiting its scope, the CSDDD remains a useful framework for harmonizing existing national-level regulations. We explore existing and potential measures of adjustment by affected companies, and the requirements for a successful implementation of the regulation.

These import dependencies create significant vulnerabilities for the European Union’s industrial strategy, especially as demand for EVs and battery materials accelerates. While the CRMA aims to increase self-sufficiency—setting targets like 40 percent domestic processing and 10 percent extraction by 2030—there is no dedicated funding to achieve these goals (European Court of Auditors, 2023). As a result, the European Union is pursuing new trade partnerships and is attempting to diversify supply through agreements with countries including Chile, Argentina, and Indonesia, while simultaneously investing in recycling technologies.

Several regulations for batteries and critical materials have already been introduced in the European Union. The Battery Directive (Directive 2006/66/EC) from 2006 aimed to reduce the amount of hazardous materials in batteries and increase battery recycling rates. This was replaced in 2023 by the New Batteries Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1542), under the auspices of the broader European Green Deal political strategy (European Commission, 2025a). This regulation aimed to minimize the environmental impact of batteries throughout their entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal, including carbon footprint requirements and minimum recycled content requirements (by weight) for cobalt, lead, lithium, and nickel. This regulation also implemented a “battery passport” to ensure compliance and better transparency and tracking of those battery contents.

Furthermore, the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/821) was promulgated in 2021, aiming to stem trade in tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold, sales of which have historically been used in part to finance armed conflicts. Lastly, the EU Deforestation-Free Products Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2023/1115), adopted in 2023, asks firms to prove that commodities, including critical minerals, are not sourced from deforested land.

Thus, directives like the CSDDD work to ensure that materials sourced for products sold in the European Union achieve the standards desired by consumers in the region, thereby supporting the focus on sustainable sourcing of imported critical minerals.

The United Kingdom was the first country to promulgate such a law, with the Modern Slavery Act in effect since 2015. This was the first law to mandate that large businesses disclose their efforts in addressing modern slavery within their supply chains. The act requires companies to publish annual statements on their actions. While there are no criminal penalties for noncompliance, the government can seek injunctions to enforce reporting requirements. Though the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union in 2016, fully exiting in 2020, this law helped spur momentum for supply chain due diligence in the greater region (UK Parliament, 2015).

Since 2017, France’s Duty of Vigilance Law has required large companies to develop due diligence plans that identify and assess social and environmental risks in their operations and supply chains. These plans must include risk mitigation strategies, and companies can be held legally accountable for damages resulting from insufficient implementation, facing potential civil penalties (Latham & Watkins LLP, 2024).

The Netherlands’ Child Labor Due Diligence Act, adopted in 2019, requires companies to investigate child labor risks in their supply chains and to declare that they have exercised due diligence in addressing them. Noncompliance can result in administrative fines, and repeat violations may lead to criminal sanctions for company directors, including imprisonment (Littenberg and Binder, 2019). However, the law is not yet in full effect.

Norway’s Transparency and Human Rights Act, enacted in 2021, requires large enterprises to carry out due diligence in line with the OECD Guidelines and report publicly on these efforts. The law also grants individuals the right to request information on how companies manage human rights risks. Companies that fail to comply may face enforcement orders and coercive fines imposed by the Norwegian Consumer Authority (DNV, 2025).

Switzerland’s supply chain due diligence regulation, enacted in 2022, requires companies to implement measures to ensure responsible sourcing. Firms must evaluate their supply chains for compliance with human rights standards related to conflict minerals and child labor risks (EY Switzerland, 2025).

Germany’s Supply Chain Act (Lieferkettensorgfaltspflichtengesetz, or LkSG), which took effect in January 2023, mandates that companies with at least 3,000 employees (starting in 2024, at least 1,000) establish supplier risk management systems. These systems must address concerns such as child labor, unsafe working conditions, and environmental harm. Companies that fail to comply may face fines of up to 2 percent of their annual revenue and be barred from public tenders for up to three years. Firms are required to conduct risk assessments, implement mitigation measures, set up complaint mechanisms, and publish annual reports on their due diligence efforts (Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, 2023).

Collectively, these laws reflect a shift toward increasing corporate accountability for human rights, labor conditions, and environmental sustainability within supply chains. However, it is important to note that none of these laws have specific targets or deliverables, other than publishing annual plans outlining the steps taken by firms to monitor their supply chains. Hence, the primary channels through which the laws operate are (a) increasing the salience of this topic in public discourse and (b) providing interested groups and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) legal grounds to go after noncompliant firms.

The European Commission surveyed business executives, industry organizations, and civil society, to document the perceived motivation for conducting supply-chain due diligence after the introduction of these laws. Interestingly, business executives ranked reputational concerns, investor relations, and consumer preferences the highest, while not placing a large weight on sanctions and fines or judicial oversight stemming from those regulations. On the other hand, civil society and NGO groups seem to be overly optimistic about the legislative power of these laws, despite the lack of specific thresholds and guidelines (European Commission, 2020).

Yet, while reputational concerns seem to be enough of an incentive for businesses to respond to such legislation, multinational companies in particular grapple with differing requirements and restrictions across different countries. This is a primary concern in the European Union more generally and has led to the introduction of laws that attempt to harmonize disparate national approaches in order to lower the barriers to trade within the larger internal market. Cohesive due diligence legislation across the union could be similarly helpful for large European firms.

Most of the national laws referenced in the previous section apply broadly to large companies across various sectors but do not specifically mention automotive supply chains. However, given the significance of the automotive industry in Germany, the LkSG has direct implications for automotive manufacturers and suppliers. Companies are required to assess and address risks related to child labor and forced labor in the extraction of raw materials, such as cobalt and lithium, essential for EV batteries. They are also required to address issues of environmental degradation, including pollution and deforestation, associated with mining and production processes. Lastly, they need to address occupational health and safety violations in manufacturing facilities (Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS), 2023).

Switzerland’s Ordinance on Conflict Minerals and Child Labor also directly affects supply chains in the automotive sector. It requires companies to establish a supply chain traceability system, with specific obligations for each category. Firms must document product details, trade names, and information about suppliers and production sites when there is reasonable suspicion that child labor was employed. As for conflict minerals, companies dealing with 3TG (tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold) sourced from high-risk areas must record details such as mineral descriptions, supplier information, country of origin, and, for metals, data on smelters and refiners. If risks are identified, additional information—including mine of origin, processing locations, and tax payments—must be documented. By-products are traceable only up to the point where they are initially separated from primary minerals or metals (Swiss Confederation, 2022).

The main purpose of the CSDDD is to standardize the requirements to comply with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)’s “Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct,” ideally helping multinational companies to homogenize their reporting and sustainability requirements across the European Union. Moreover, the CSDDD requires European firms to put forth climate transition plans that align with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. Lastly, it aims to homogenize the individual laws that European countries adopted at different times (KPMG in Finland, 2024).

Specifically, while the directive entered into force on July 25, 2024, required compliance was delayed due to negotiations. Companies with a global turnover of more than €1.5 billion and more than 5,000 employees in the EU must comply within three years, by 2027. Those with a turnover exceeding €900 million and more than 3,000 employees have four years, until 2028, and companies with a turnover above €450 million and more than 1,000 employees are granted five years, with compliance required by 2029 (European Commission, 2025c). However, the proposal has been criticized as “onerous and in need of simplification,” given the extensive reporting required across the supply chain (Runyon, 2025).

The criticisms leveled against the CSDDD led to intensive lobbying efforts that resulted in the introduction in February 2025 of what came to be known as the Omnibus proposals. The proposals were a set of amendments aiming to simplify and streamline sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements. While these proposals were intended to reduce administrative burdens and enhance competitiveness, concerns have been raised that they could dilute both existing national regulations and the initial CSDDD proposal (KPMG International, 2025).

There are five main ways in which existing national regulations might be diluted. First, the Omnibus proposals suggest that CSDDD would now apply only to Tier 1 (i.e., direct) business partners and not the entire supply chain. Secondly, the required reporting would be carried out only every five years, as opposed to annually, as is the case in much current national legislation. Third, current legislation requires that firms terminate relationships with business partners for which risks have been identified; the proposal suggests removing this requirement. Additionally, the proposal would exclude financial institutions, such that they would no longer be required to decide investments based on similar guidelines. Lastly, the proposal includes a one-year postponement of the effective date of the law (July 2028) (Ropes & Gray LLP, 2024; PwC United States, 2024).

In recent years, European automotive multinationals have made several efforts to invest in sustainability and rights-focused projects in developing countries. For example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, BMW and BASF, in partnership with Samsung and GIZ, launched the “Cobalt for Development” initiative in 2019. The project aimed to improve labor conditions and implement responsible mining practices in artisanal cobalt extraction (BMW Group, 2019; BASF SE, 2019). These efforts directly address labor and human rights risks, including child labor and unsafe working conditions. In 2021, Volkswagen Group, the second largest automotive manufacturer worldwide, headquartered in Germany, recognized their “responsibility along the entire supply chain, including their human rights due diligence for raw material sourcing and production” (Volkswagen Group, 2021). As a result, the company, along with a consortium of other large car manufacturers, set up the Responsible Lithium Partnership, an organization to foster sustainable lithium extraction in the area of the Atacama Salt Flat in Chile (Volkswagen Group, 2021; Factory Warranty List, 2023; Mercedes-Benz Group, 2024).

Renault, meanwhile, entered a 2022 partnership with Morocco’s Managem Group to secure low-carbon, traceable cobalt for its EV batteries. The agreement includes a new refinery powered 80 percent by wind energy, thereby contributing to both climate and sourcing goals (Renault Group, 2022). In 2023 the Volkswagen Group announced a €1 billion investment in Brazil to expand its electric and flex-fuel vehicle lineup, as part of a broader zero-carbon mobility strategy (Volkswagen Group, 2023).

Similarly, BMW committed R4.2 billion in 2023 to electrify its Rosslyn plant in South Africa for the production of plug-in hybrid vehicles, explicitly supporting the country’s green transition (BMW Group, 2023). Sweden-based Volvo announced a €160 million investment to expand its Hosakote truck and bus manufacturing facility in India. The new plant will prioritize clean mobility and support India’s growing demand for sustainable transport solutions (Volvo Group India, 2025).

These investments illustrate that leading European automotive firms are beginning to invest in green technologies, environmental protection, and the improvement of labor conditions in developing countries. However, whether these actions were a direct result of the due diligence requirements imposed across the European Union is unclear.

The capital investments outlined above mainly concern new projects, and while they are focused on the use of renewable energy and sustainable sourcing, they do not directly deal with the activity of suppliers and subcontractors. To obtain a sense of the specific actions taken by automotive firms to monitor their supply chains, we reviewed their annually published reports (an obligation stemming from due diligence laws) and we summarize the key takeaways for Stellantis and Volkswagen Groups.

Between 2017 and 2023, Stellantis—through its legacy firms Groupe PSA and FCA—built a progressively more robust supplier due diligence system grounded in risk assessment, third-party audits, and digital monitoring tools. Initially, both PSA and FCA relied on corporate social responsibility-based evaluations covering over 90 percent of their procurement volumes, complemented by corrective action plans and basic supplier codes of conduct banning forced labor and environmental negligence. Over time, they expanded these systems. PSA introduced sustainability indices and whistleblowing mechanisms, while FCA integrated conflict mineral tracking and launched a supplier compliance platform. After the Stellantis merger, these efforts scaled significantly. By 2023, the group was assessing over 100,000 suppliers using EcoVadis (a global assessment platform that rates businesses’ sustainability based on environmental impact, labor, and human rights standards) and had rolled out a real-time digital compliance tracking system. Supplier contracts were updated to mandate carbon footprint reduction, circular economy integration, and adherence to International Labour Organization standards, with high-risk suppliers subject to independent third-party audits (Stellantis N.V., 2025).

The Volkswagen Group followed a similar path. In 2017, the group implemented a supplier code of conduct and carried out basic sustainability audits. Over the next several years, it introduced digital risk mapping tools, expanded audit programs to cover over 90 percent of procurement spending, and integrated AI-based systems to detect violations. By 2023, Volkswagen was auditing over 4,000 suppliers annually, had trained nearly 8,000 direct suppliers on sustainability requirements, and imposed financial penalties for noncompliance. Volkswagen significantly strengthened its labor rights enforcement, with annual human rights risk assessments and targeted monitoring in high-risk sectors like cobalt mining. It also intensified its environmental responsibility, requiring major suppliers to commit to carbon neutrality and renewable energy sourcing, and to integrate recycled materials under expanded circular economy policies (Volkswagen Group, 2025).

Though companies are taking action to improve the sustainability of their sourced materials through capital expenditures and monitoring activities, due diligence is often challenging to verify.

For mineral sourcing in particular, tracking mineral flows from the mine to the buyer is crucial. One approach that mining companies have taken to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability is their voluntary adoption of or inclusion in sustainability certification mechanisms, such as the Copper Mark, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM)’s principles, the Initiative for Responsible Mining Assurance (IRMA) standard, and Toward Sustainable Mining (TSM). Other voluntary certification programs exist, yet many have been accused of greenwashing (see, for example, Zharfpeykan (2021); Kippenberg and Wilde-Ramsing (2025)). The challenge is that each of these programs approaches assessing and/or certifying the sustainability of mines differently, and the rigor with which they proclaim sustainability at the mine varies widely (Hiete et al., 2019; Tröster and Hiete, 2019). In the context of the European Union’s supply chain due diligence laws, Human Rights Watch (2023) expressed concern about companies relying upon voluntary audits and certifications as compliance mechanisms, as some of these certifications do not guarantee environmental or social sustainability. In sum, reliance upon voluntary sustainability certifications or audits as a simple way of demonstrating sustainability may not actually result in improved outcomes at the mine.

Even in cases where automotive firms respond to the laws and put procedures in place to hold their suppliers to higher standards for human rights and environmental practices, it is virtually impossible for lawmakers to obtain an accurate understanding of the impact of those activities and, in turn, the effectiveness of the laws in improving outcomes at the supplying mines.

Given the challenges of verifying due diligence activities across fragmented supply chains, moving beyond procedural reporting to instituting quantifiable, performance-based metrics against which compliance can be meaningfully assessed would be more likely to improve outcomes. While developing such metrics may require additional mediation so they could emerge through the negotiation process, existing goals and regulations (e.g., the Critical Raw Materials Act, the battery passport) that can be built upon may prove to be a helpful starting point. Relying solely on commitments or audit participation offers limited insight into actual supplier behavior. Instead, due diligence frameworks could require companies to consistently report specific indicators such as carbon emissions per unit of output, volume of water consumed per product, or percentage of electricity sourced from renewable generation, for example. A benefit of these metrics is that they can be tracked across time and compared across suppliers to assess not just compliance, but progress. For labor-related aspects, metrics could include the percentage of workers covered by collective bargaining agreements, number of occupational health and safety incidents per 100 full-time employees, or the ratio of the average wage to the local living wage benchmark.

Importantly, sector-specific metrics reflect the material risks and environmental or social footprints of each industry. For example, in the automotive sector, relevant environmental indicators may include life cycle emissions of battery components, percentage of recycled materials used in vehicle production, or share of cobalt and lithium sourced from certified conflict-free zones. Tailoring metrics to sectoral realities could ensure that due diligence is both effective and proportionate, supporting meaningful oversight and credible enforcement.

Given the challenges in enforcement and the ability of manufacturers to fully quantify the impact of their supply chains on environmental and social sustainability, whether the CSDDD, as written and influenced by the Omnibus regulation, will result in measurable environmental and social improvements at the mine level is an open question. Estimating the impact of the policy will be key to understanding its effectiveness, the costs it imposes on manufacturers and consumers, and the impacts it has on vehicle decarbonization pathways.

There are two ways in which the CSDDD could affect the costs of decarbonization pathways. The first is through increased compliance costs, including administrative costs of compliance and fixed costs of shifting suppliers (Joshi et al., 2001; Kinderman, 2020). These manufacturer costs could be estimated with economic vehicle market models that leverage information on vehicle prices and demand (such as the one utilized in Linn (2022)). Alternatively, exploring public filings from companies or conducting interviews could elicit information about the extent to which the CSDDD impacts manufacturing costs; however, companies have generally kept this type of information confidential, so acquiring the information could be challenging. The European Commission predicted a relatively low cost of compliance with the CSDDD—about 0.13 percent of shareholder payouts made in 2023 (European Commission, 2022; van Teeffelen and de Leth, 2025)—although conducting an ex post analysis as described above would be prudent to ensure that these compliance costs remain low.

The second way in which the CSDDD may affect the costs of decarbonization is that improvements in sustainability at the mine extraction and processing points may increase the cost of procuring the minerals. If environmentally and socially sustainable minerals are more expensive, the cost of EVs could increase measurably, potentially slowing down their adoption. Identifying the impact of the CSDDD on mineral prices is thus a first step to understanding how the policy will impact EV adoption.

Importantly, sustainability is a positive good that many consumers value, yet for that value to be realized, vehicle buyers must be made aware of the environmental impacts of their purchases. Consumers’ knowledge that their vehicles were made in a sustainable manner may boost their willingness to pay (Jupiter Chevrolet, 2025); without verifiable information, however, this benefit is lost (Costa et al., 2019). One solution that could support this effort is the battery passport. The battery passport, an idea developed by the Global Battery Alliance (GBA), would provide each battery with a digital tracking of its supply chain. The idea behind the passport is that consumers would have visibility into the sustainability (or lack thereof) of the batteries in their EVs. So far, the GBA has implemented two pilots of the battery passport, which resulted in the release of rulebooks that cover greenhouse gas emissions, labor concerns, biodiversity, and indigenous peoples’ rights. See https://www.globalbattery.org/battery-passport-mvp-pilots/. If implemented and adopted, these passports could increase willingness to pay for sustainable battery extraction, and reduce the consumer welfare impacts that increased prices would create. Ultimately, however, the battery passport cannot eliminate the challenges of tracking and tracing the minerals across the supply chain.

The European Union’s CSDDD represents a significant shift in the regulatory landscape governing global supply chains, particularly for industries such as automotive manufacturing that rely heavily on imported critical minerals. While the directive aims to harmonize national laws and elevate environmental and human rights standards across company operations and supply chains, its effectiveness hinges on the ability of firms and regulators to monitor, verify, and enforce compliance. As illustrated by the practices of companies like Stellantis and Volkswagen, industry leaders are already implementing digital compliance tools, supplier audits, and risk mapping strategies in response to reputational and regulatory pressures. However, many of these efforts remain difficult to quantify, and the lack of standardized metrics limits transparency and comparability across firms.

To address this, future success will depend not only on the adoption of comprehensive legislation but also on the integration of measurable, sector-specific performance indicators. Without such concrete metrics and independent verification systems, laws risk becoming procedural rather than transformative. Moreover, given the potential for increased compliance costs to affect consumer prices and slow the green transition, especially in the EV market, tools like the battery passport and better consumer awareness may help align sustainability goals with market incentives. Ultimately, the CSDDD offers a framework with the potential to drive real change—but only if implemented with rigor, data transparency, and meaningful accountability, for which further regulatory steps are needed.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_1368334982.width-600.png,N,,2025-09-25 21:56:11.631743

By leveraging patented circular economy principles and energyneutral processes, Verdus turns animal manure and agricultural residues into a powerful engine for ecological and economic transformation.

The company supplies a modular BCT system— developed over 15 years and now in its fifth generation— which is a plug-and-play solution that arrives in 10 shipping containers and can be assembled in under a month. Each module processes 36 tonnes of dry biomass per day, producing negligible emissions and leaving no residual waste. Unlike competitors who require 500 tonnes daily to operate, Verdus achieves superior efficiency with a fraction of the input, making it ideal for decentralized deployment across farms, forests, and industrial sites.

Verdus Energy’s technology transforms feedstocks such as cattle manure, poultry litter, crop residues, and even municipal solid waste into over 200 marketable products. These include renewable diesel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), Biochar, green fertilisers, organic pesticides and herbicides, bio-oils, electricity, and carbon credits. The environmental impact is profound: Biochar alone sequesters three tonnes of CO₂ per tonne applied to soil, and when fed to cattle, it reduces methane emissions by up to 22%. Combined, Verdus’ solutions can achieve a staggering 187% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.

The company’s ESG alignment is equally compelling. Environmentally, Verdus eliminates landfills, cleans up rural pollution, and replaces petrochemical inputs with natural alternatives. Socially, it protects ecosystems, enhances food safety, and revitalises degraded land. From a governance perspective, Verdus empowers responsible management through traceable carbon credits and sustainable procurement.

Verdus Energy says its business model is built on strategic partnerships with governments, primary producers, energy companies, and waste managers. With feedstock surpluses exceeding 20 million tonnes annually in New Zealand alone, and strong global demand for its offtake products, Verdus says it is well-positioned to scale rapidly.

Kevin Smith, President and Chief Operating Officer of Verdus says the company’s technology has already proven itself in commercial settings.

“Version 4.0 has been successfully operating for over two years, producing carbon fuel pellets for one of the world’s largest mining companies. The current rollout of V5.0, will start in Q4 2025 and production is planned to commence in North America in 2026.”
