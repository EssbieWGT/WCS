That’s all part of the governor’s tax bill, HF2437, which is being carried by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and was presented to the House Taxes Committee on Wednesday.

The committee laid the bill over, as amended, and will consider its provisions for possible omnibus bill inclusion.

“In light of very tough budget times, this is a responsible and practical tax bill,” said Revenue Commissioner Paul Marquart. “It really looks to create a more fair and stable tax system while also creating new economic development and new jobs.”

In addition to changes it would make to individual income taxes, corporate franchise taxes, property taxes, and local government aids, the bill would make accounting services, banking and brokerage services, and legal services all subject to sales taxes. And it would lower the state’s effective general sales tax rate to 6.8% from its current 6.875%.

The bill would also:

expand the tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel;

repeal the option to assign a refund in advance of claiming the K-12 education credit on a tax return;

eliminate the political contribution refund;

make the research credit partially refundable;

modify transfer provisions for the short line railroad credit;

establish a specific tax levy for airlines;

clarify the definitions of electrical attachments and appurtenances for property taxes;

modify provisions for leased tax-exempt property;

reduce the appropriation for aquatic invasive species prevention aid by 50%;

reduce payment in lieu of tax amounts by 34% and clarify there are no cost-of-living adjustments;

modify provisions for certificates of rent paid;

reduce the annual per acre payment for land enrolled in the sustainable forest incentive program;

repeal local government cannabis aid and partial cannabis tax revenue dedication; and

repeal provisions related to tax filing modernization.

The Revenue Department estimates that if the provisions are adopted it would increase revenue by $60.7 million in fiscal year 2026, that number growing to $136.8 million in fiscal year 2027.

The expansion of taxes on accounting, banking, brokerage and legal services is projected to add $136.3 million to the General Fund in fiscal year 2026, while the reduction in the state’s general sales tax rate would reduce it by an estimated $61.9 million.

Among the 19 testifiers on the bill, there were considerably more negative comments than positive, particularly from those in the financial planning, banking and legal industries who expressed disapproval with the idea of raising taxes on their services.

And those speaking for the state’s counties expressed strong concern that the reduction in payments in lieu of taxes (or PILT) amounts will cause a larger burden to fall upon the state’s counties and, consequently, its property taxpayers.",,N,,2025-04-02 21:56:27.550433

On approach to environmental targets in the aviation sector in 2025

Lauren Riley: There is no lack of change here in the United States, but it’s not just in the United States, it’s also in other regions around the world like the EU and the UK and elsewhere. They’re looking at adding different policies that address sustainability in aviation. Change is happening everywhere. Fundamental to United commitment to net zero by 2050 is that it’s anchored in our business strategy today.

Fuel is our number two operational cost right behind labor and we don’t hedge on fuel purchase…what’s interesting about sustainable aviation fuel and why we’re also anchored in investing in this space is that it gives us line of sight to be able to stabilize the cost of a very volatile cost to United’s operation…*

We do want to drive the emissions out of our supply chain. When we made our commitment to net zero a couple of years ago, we did it without relying on the use of carbon offsets. And really that was our declaration from a somewhat principled point of view that we have to focus on permanent reductions and that’s why we’re so bullish about sustainable aviation fuels...

Robert Horton: We’ve intentionally engineered externalities out of the equation. Last year we [Dallas Fort Worth International Airport] celebrated 50 years as an airport. That’s a few changes of administration, but the way that we frame environmental or sustainable goals is that it is the right thing to do. It is also good from a business perspective.

For example, if we look at the last 15 – 20 years, we’ve reduced our energy costs by almost 40% and our annual spending on energy by almost 40%. And that’s significant because as you reduce or engineer the waste out of your systems, you’re also reducing your environmental footprint.

The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) conversation is a lot more challenging for us as an airport because airports don’t really purchase fuel. That’s mainly the airlines or consortiums, but we are intentional about supporting or enabling that. For example, we’ve done a lot of pilots with used cooking oil, collecting that, and then routing that to recyclers to refine and convert it into sustainable fuels…

On affordability and accessibility of SAF

Charlotte Lollar: Sustainable aviation fuel is very expensive. It’s also very necessary. When you ask a question about whose responsibility it is, it’s kind of the responsibility [of all of us]. There are a lot of players in this value chain and it’s a shared risk model. There is a premium associated with it. There is a necessary step change that has to happen in the technology in order to scale and make it more affordable.

I think we often have conversations about parity and we’re really kind of focused on the end costs and really it’s about affordability, but it’s also economies of scale and getting the tech there. And so it’s kind of a shared responsibility…

Adam Klauber: As a business, we have to sell where we get the highest price, however it makes most sense to reduce the logistics costs that’s associated. There are emissions there too. Even pipelines have emissions. Can we deliver to the closest, the nearest airport to our production capacity? That is really what makes sense.

In terms of another way for us to address some of the price premium is to be transparent with pricing. Our model is to have what we call a cost plus or contract for differences model where we have all the incentives stacked and we show our customers what they are, and we think that this is an important way to get buy-in. The customers understand there’s a fixed margin, but all the rest can fluctuate according to market conditions.

EU publishes CO2 car standard tweak proposal

Brussels, 1 April (Argus) — The European Commission has published the long-awaited proposal to give automobile manufacturers more flexibility in complying with the bloc's CO2 reduction targets for cars and passenger vehicles in 2025, 2026 and 2027. Those three years would be assessed jointly, rather than annually, averaging out fleet emission performance. EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra said the additional compliance flexibility shows that the commission has ""listened"" but the EU is still maintaining its zero-emission targets [for new vehicles from 2035]. ""Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments,"" said Hoekstra. The commission urged the European Parliament and EU member states to reach agreement on the targeted amendment ""without delay"". German centre-right member Jens Gieseke said there is a ""broad majority"" in parliament to fast-track approval for May. He noted that the car industry faces over €15bn ($16bn) in penalties for non-compliance with the CO2 standards. A member of parliament's largest EPP group, Gieseke also called for the commission to go further towards technological neutrality. ""We need different kinds of fuels, e-fuels, biofuels, every fuel which could help to reduce CO2 should be recognized,"" he added. This second step, withdrawing the phase-out of internal combustion engines (ICE) from 2035 onwards, Gieseke noted, should come in the last quarter of 2025. German Green MEP Michael Bloss disputed the figure of €15bn in potential fines put forward by automotive industry association ACEA. ""Even in the worst-case scenario, the total fines for all car manufacturers would not exceed €1bn,"" said Bloss. ""Car manufacturers have had enough time to adjust their production planning. Many have done so,"" Bloss said, pointing to Automaker Volvo. Under the current 2019 regulation, fines should be imposed on manufacturers for each year in 2025–2029 when they do not reach their specific fleet-wide target CO2 reductions, compared to 2021 values. But manufacturers have the option to form compliance pools with other firms. ""European car manufacturers are already talking to Tesla or Chinese manufacturers about so-called pooling, which must be stopped quickly,"" said EPP climate and environment spokesman Peter Liese. ""We want to maintain climate targets, but not make Elon Musk richer through European legislation,"" said Liese.

ISCC aware EU mulling certification recognition: Update

Adds comment from the European Commission London, 28 March (Argus) — The ISCC, an international certification system for sustainability, said today that it is aware of discussions in an EU committee about future recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels. It said there is no legal basis for any planned measures.

Market participants told Argus that discussions have centred around giving individual countries more choice. ""Other voluntary schemes would not be able to fill the gap.

Oil, biofuel groups meet to align on RFS policy

New York, 27 March (Argus) — Energy and farm groups met last week at the American Petroleum Institute to negotiate a joint request for President Donald Trump's administration as it develops new biofuel blend mandates, according to five people familiar with the matter. The private meeting involved groups from across the supply chain, including representatives of feedstock suppliers, biofuel producers, fuel marketers, and oil refiners with Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) obligations. The groups coordinated earlier this year around a letter to the Trump administration on the need to update the RFS and are now seeking agreement on other program elements. According to the people familiar with the matter, the groups agree on pushing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set higher blend mandates under the program's D4 biomass-based diesel and D5 advanced biofuel categories. Groups support slightly different volume targets that are nevertheless all in ""a rounding number of each other"" in the D4 category, according to one lobbyist. But there is still disagreement about whether to ramp up mandates quickly in 2026 or provide a longer runway to higher volumes. Clean Fuels Alliance America and farm groups have publicly supported a biomass-based diesel mandate of at least 5.25bn USG starting next year, which could justify a broader advanced biofuel mandate above 9bn USG, according to the people familiar, though others worry about fuel cost impacts if mandates spike so quickly. The current mandate for 2025 is 7.33bn USG in the advanced biofuels category, including a 3.35bn USG mandate for the biomass-based diesel subcategory, so the volumes being pushed for future years would be a steep increase. The RFS, highly influential for fuel and commodity crop prices, requires oil refiners and importers to blend annual amounts of biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those who do. The idea behind the groups' coordination is that the Trump administration might more quickly finalize RFS updates if lobbyists with a history of sparring over biofuel policy can articulate a shared vision of the program's future. One person familiar said the effort comes after the Trump administration directed industry to align biofuel policy goals, though others said they understood the coordination as largely voluntary. EPA did not provide comment. There is less agreement around the program's D6 conventional biofuel category, which is mostly met by corn ethanol. Oil groups have in the past criticized EPA for setting the implied D6 mandate at 15bn USG, above the amount of ethanol that can feasibly be blended into gasoline, though excess biofuels from lower-carbon categories can be used to meet conventional obligations. Ethanol interests support setting the D6 mandate even higher than 15bn USG, which could be a tough sell. The discussions to date have not involved targets for D3 cellulosic biofuels, a relatively small part of the program. A proposal to lower 2024 volumes has hurt D3 credit prices, signaling that future mandates are effectively optional, according to frustrated biogas executives , and has reduced the salience of the issue for other groups. A proposal from President Joe Biden's administration to create a new category called ""eRINs"" to credit biogas used to power electric vehicles has similarly not come up. ""We're not expecting to see any attempt to include eRINs in this next [RFS] proposal,"" Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper told Argus earlier this month. The meeting last week was largely oriented around the RFS, though a National Association of Truck Stop Operators representative raised the issue of tax policy too. The group has been frustrated by the expiration of a long-running blenders credit and the introduction this year of a less generous credit for refiners, which is only partially implemented and has spurred a sharp decline in biomass-based diesel production. But others involved in negotiations, while they acknowledge tax uncertainty could hurt their case for strong mandates, are trying to avoid contentious topics and focus mostly on volumes. Republican lawmakers are separately weighing whether to keep, repeal, or adjust that credit to help out fuel from domestic crops, and there is no telling how long that debate might take to resolve. Another thorny issue discussed at the meeting is RFS exemptions for small refineries. Biofuel producers strongly oppose such waivers and say that exempted volumes should at least be reallocated among facilities that still have obligations. Oil groups have their own views, though it is unclear how involved the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers — which represents some small refiners and has generally been more critical of the RFS than the American Petroleum Institute — are in discussions. EPA is aiming to finalize new volume mandates by the end of this year , people familiar with the administration's thinking have said, though timing for a proposal is still unclear. Future conversations among energy and farm groups to solidify points of unity — and strategize around how to downplay disagreements — are likely, lobbyists said. RIN prices rally Speculation over the trajectory of the RFS, and the potential for higher future volumes, supported soybean oil futures and widened the bean oil-heating oil (BOHO) spread. The BOHO spread maintains a positive correlation with D4 RIN prices as a widening value raises demand for D4 credits as biofuel producers look to offset higher production costs. Thursday's session ended with current-year ethanol D6 credits valued between 79¢/RIN and 82¢/RIN, while their D4 counterparts held at a premium and closed with a range of 84¢/RIN to 89¢/RIN.

Promoting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production can help Pakistan boost national energy security, large-scale economic activity, and foreign direct investment while reducing crop waste and air pollution, economic and energy experts and environmental activists said.

They said that Pakistan is uniquely positioned to harness its abundant agricultural resources and establish itself as a key player in SAF production. By leveraging its vast agricultural base, the country can simultaneously address four critical challenges: enhancing national energy security, stimulating large-scale economic activity, attracting foreign direct investment, and mitigating crop waste and the air pollution caused by its burning.

Speaking with The Express Tribune, they said that globally, nations across various industrial sectors are striving to reduce emissions, and the aviation industry is no exception. As efforts to mitigate the environmental impact of air travel gain momentum, sustainable aviation fuel is emerging as a transformative solution.

They noted that with mandates in the European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK), along with the United States' strategic initiatives driving SAF adoption, Pakistan can capitalise on SAF production while repurposing its crop residues. With global aviation fuel demand exceeding 250 million metric tonnes annually, the shift to SAF presents both a monumental challenge and a transformative opportunity.

SAF is a renewable, low-carbon alternative to conventional jet fuel, produced from sustainable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, and non-food biomass.

Commercially, two key technologies dominate SAF production: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ). The selection of technology depends on the type of biomass available for SAF production. HEFA technology is utilised for lipid-based feedstocks, such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils, while ATJ technology is best suited for sugar-based feedstocks, such as wheat straw, rice husks, and bagasse waste.

SAF produced through these two technologies provides a ""drop-in"" fuel that is fully compatible with existing jet engines and infrastructure. An emerging and highly promising third technology involves utilising carbon dioxide as a feedstock, though it is not yet commercially available.

Eminent energy scientist and expert in a circular economy Dr Adeel Ghayur said that commercial SAF technologies offer production capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to as much as one million tonnes annually.

He explained that refineries on the higher end of this spectrum require multibillion-dollar investments but have the potential to generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs, boosting economic activity in their regions.

He noted that currently, SAF is priced at approximately $2,500 per metric tonne, significantly higher than conventional aviation fuel, which costs around $700 per metric tonne.

As the international community tightens its regulatory frameworks for sustainable aviation, Pakistan is presented with a unique window of opportunity that represents both an environmental imperative and a tremendous economic prospect.

Crop residues burned during both winter and summer in Pakistan represent an underutilised resource with immense potential for SAF production. In Punjab alone, it is estimated that millions of tonnes of rice residue are burned each winter to prepare fields for the next planting season. Furthermore, additional crop residues become available during the wheat harvest. Together, these biomass resources hold the capacity to support the establishment of multiple SAF refineries, transforming a major environmental challenge into an economic and ecological opportunity.

He said, ""The starting point for Pakistan's SAF transformation lies in developing a well-rounded, multipronged strategy focused on attracting foreign investment, equipping local industries with the necessary knowledge, infrastructure, and skills, and fostering the development of robust indigenous research and development (R&D) capabilities. Strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia. This comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.""",https://i.tribune.com.pk/media/images/image-41743620911-0/image-41743620911-0.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 15:56:08.910128

That’s all part of the governor’s tax bill, HF2437, which is being carried by Rep. Greg Davids (R-Preston) and was presented to the House Taxes Committee on Wednesday.

The committee laid the bill over, as amended, and will consider its provisions for possible omnibus bill inclusion.

“In light of very tough budget times, this is a responsible and practical tax bill,” said Revenue Commissioner Paul Marquart. “It really looks to create a more fair and stable tax system while also creating new economic development and new jobs.”

In addition to changes it would make to individual income taxes, corporate franchise taxes, property taxes, and local government aids, the bill would make accounting services, banking and brokerage services, and legal services all subject to sales taxes. And it would lower the state’s effective general sales tax rate to 6.8% from its current 6.875%.

The bill would also:

expand the tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel;

repeal the option to assign a refund in advance of claiming the K-12 education credit on a tax return;

eliminate the political contribution refund;

make the research credit partially refundable;

modify transfer provisions for the short line railroad credit;

establish a specific tax levy for airlines;

clarify the definitions of electrical attachments and appurtenances for property taxes;

modify provisions for leased tax-exempt property;

reduce the appropriation for aquatic invasive species prevention aid by 50%;

reduce payment in lieu of tax amounts by 34% and clarify there are no cost-of-living adjustments;

modify provisions for certificates of rent paid;

reduce the annual per acre payment for land enrolled in the sustainable forest incentive program;

repeal local government cannabis aid and partial cannabis tax revenue dedication; and

repeal provisions related to tax filing modernization.

The Revenue Department estimates that if provisions are adopted it would increase revenue by $60.7 million in fiscal year 2026, that number growing to $136.8 million in fiscal year 2027.

The expansion of taxes on accounting, banking, brokerage and legal services is projected to add $136.3 million to the General Fund in fiscal year 2026, while the reduction in the state’s general sales tax rate would reduce it by an estimated $61.9 million.

Among the 19 testifiers on the bill, there were considerably more negative comments than positive, particularly from those in the financial planning, banking and legal industries who expressed disapproval with the idea of raising taxes on their services.

And those speaking for the state’s counties expressed strong concern that the reduction in payments in lieu of taxes (or PILT) amounts will cause a larger burden to fall upon the state’s counties and, consequently, its property taxpayers.",,N,,2025-04-02 14:56:42.360617

The new performance standards for new cars and vans will allow manufacturers greater flexibility in meeting vehicle emission targets between 2025 and 2027.

This proposal, part of the Industrial Action Plan for the European automotive sector unveiled on March 5, 2025, seeks to balance sustainability goals with industry realities.

Commenting on the proposal, President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said: “Our highly innovative automotive industry is decarbonising to contribute to the fight against climate change, but also to maintain its competitive edge on the world markets.

With today’s initiative, we grant more flexibility to this key sector, and at the same time, we stay the course of our climate goals. Together, we want to prove that decarbonisation and competitiveness can go hand in hand.”

Three-year averaging to ease compliance burden

Under the new framework, automakers will be assessed on their vehicle CO2 emissions performance over a three-year period rather than annually.

This means that any excess emissions in one year can be offset by outperforming targets in subsequent years.

The goal is to provide the industry with stability while still adhering to the 2025 emission targets and keeping the transition to zero-emission mobility on track.

A strategic step towards 2050 zero-emission goals

The amendment stems from extensive industry consultation following the launch of the Strategic Dialogue on the Future of the Automotive Industry by President von der Leyen on January 30, 2025.

This dialogue has been instrumental in shaping policies that consider both environmental imperatives and economic realities.

By maintaining long-term reductions in vehicle CO2 emissions, the EU aims to reinforce its position as a global leader in sustainable transport.

Wopke Hoekstra, Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean Growth, added: “Since the launch of the Automotive Strategic Dialogue at the end of January, we have worked closely with the industry on the road to the sector’s clean transition.

“This additional compliance flexibility shows that we have listened, understood the concerns, and are taking action to address them while maintaining our zero-emission targets. Predictability in the sector is crucial for long-term investments.”

Industry reaction: Flexibility welcomed, but more support needed

The automotive sector has largely welcomed the three-year averaging approach, viewing it as a pragmatic solution to ongoing market and geopolitical challenges.

However, industry leaders stress that regulatory flexibility must be paired with stronger incentives for electric vehicle adoption and enhanced charging infrastructure.

With battery electric vehicles (BEVs) currently making up just 15% of the market, additional measures will be crucial to accelerating the shift toward zero-emission transport.

Sigrid de Vries, Director General of the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA), explained: “We call on the European Parliament and Council to ensure the fast adoption of this amendment.

“The next important step is then to thoroughly assess the transformation’s overall progress, with a focus on refining the approach – not the end goal – where necessary.

Jeroen van Heiningen is the founder and managing director of 123Carbon. The company works with fuel suppliers and carriers to issue transparent and externally verified environmental attribute certificates, including SAF certificates, used by airlines and cargo operators to reduce their transport-related Scope 3 emissions.

Jeroen discusses the sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) market, focusing on carbon insetting, the role of SAF registries, and the importance of transparency and standardization in the industry. He explains how carbon insetting differs from carbon offsetting, emphasizing the need for companies to invest in their value chain de-carbonization. The discussion also covers the digital certificate process, the collaboration between 123Carbon and IATA, and future trends in the SAF market.

123Carbon’s registry is integrated with other IT systems and allows an airline to upload documents and manage its inventory of digital certificates online. It’s a multi-modal agnostic platform that can be branded. With the use of sustainable bio-fuel growing in the land and sea modes of transportation, the accounting needs to be integrated with air.

123Carbon recently introduced Carboninsets.com, a free service for forwarders and cargo owners that connects them with issuers on the registry.

Jeroen set-up and led Accenture’s Sustainability Services Benelux and wrote the CDP NL 50 report in 2010. He has 15 years of experience with multi-modal carbon insetting programs, covering both Air (KLM corporate biofuels Program) and Marine (the GoodShipping Program). He holds a master’s in business administration from Tilburg University.

Takeaways:

Carbon insetting is a more effective long-term approach than offsetting.

Companies are increasingly linked to net-zero targets managed by SBTi. (Science Based Targets initiative)

Standardization in the SAF market is crucial for transparency.

Digital certificates are essential for tracking SAF transactions.

Collaboration between registries helps prevent double counting of SAF.

The SAF market is evolving with a focus on multimodal transportation.

Demand and supply must be connected to stabilize SAF prices.

New services like CarbonInsets.com facilitate connections between issuers and buyers.

The aviation industry is leading in SAF adoption compared to other transport modes.

Future initiatives will focus on integrating various transportation modalities.

Allied Pilots Association Urges Passage of the Safer Skies Act of 2025

The Allied Pilots Association (APA), representing 16,000 American Airlines pilots, supports the bipartisan Safer Skies Act of 2025. The Act is “aimed at closing critical security loopholes in airport security,” according to U.S. Representative Nick Langworthy (NY-23), who introduced the legislation.

Langworthy says, “The Safer Skies Act will close a loophole that has allowed certain operators, like ticketed charter flights, to bypass the rigorous screening requirements that ensure the safety of all passengers. It is vital for protecting our skies and the lives of passengers and crew alike.”

“Specifically, the Safer Skies Act would require the TSA to update its security screening requirements for Part 135 [charter flights, air taxi services, and medical evacuation flights] and Part 380 [public charter flights] operators that offer individual seats in advance, provide publicly available schedules, and operate passenger seat configurations of more than nine seats.” It would “ensure that these operators are held to the same security standards as any other scheduled commercial airline.”

This legislation has also received support from the Airline Pilots Association, Intl., National Air Carrier Association, Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Association of Flight Attendants, Air Line Pilots Association, Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, Transport Workers Union, and the NetJets Association of Shared Aircraft Pilots.

ACI Europe, which represents airports, said they were doing ""more than their fair share"" in decarbonising aviation and accused IATA of shifting responsibility.","By Tim Hepher and Joanna Plucinska

PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) -Global airlines have issued their bluntest warning yet that efforts to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 are sliding off course, as the head of their main trade body accused oil firms and the rest of the aviation sector of dragging their feet.

Airlines agreed in 2021 to target net-zero emissions in 2050 based mainly on a gradual switch to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). But cracks have appeared as airlines clash with airports, manufacturers, air traffic control agencies and energy companies.

Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, told Reuters in an interview that airline bosses are increasingly alarmed at the unbalanced burden of the target.

""We don't see others playing their part. In fact, they're behind where they should be and moving in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""They're all committed, so long as we pay the bill. And that's just unacceptable.""

The outspoken former British Airways boss doubled down on recent comments, reported by Aviation Week, in which he predicted increasing pressure to reassess the target.

That marks a shift in tone from an IATA gathering just 10 months ago when Walsh described the target as ""existential not optional"" and hailed a ""fundamental consensus"" in aviation.

""We're going to have to reevaluate the commitment to net zero in 2050, because we're just not getting the support that the airlines require,"" he said.

""What I'm seeing now is more and more concern being expressed by airline CEOs that more is expected of the industry, which is going to cost even more than the eye-watering estimates that we've had.""

The next test could be IATA's annual meeting in New Delhi in June.

""It's not our intention to formally revisit (the target),"" he said. ""But it would not surprise me if we get calls from member airlines to look again at that commitment, because (it) was made on the basis that everybody would play their part.""

'PLAYING THEIR PART'

Walsh also dismissed an interim goal by governments to reduce emissions 5% by 2030 through the use of low-carbon fuels. IATA opposes interim targets, given there is enough SAF available for only 1% of today's fuel needs.

Walsh criticised fuel companies as the ""cause of the problem"", saying they had ignored their own SAF supply promises.

""They've got to start playing their part,"" he said, adding that airlines would spend an additional $3.8 billion on fuel this year due to government mandates and broader carbon emissions pledges.

FuelsEurope, which represents conventional and renewable energy firms, did not respond to a request for comment.

Airlines would also take stock of delays in new aircraft deliveries, Walsh said.

""It would be foolish for us not to flag these issues and foolish of us to believe that we are on track,"" he said.

Groups representing the aerospace industry in Brussels and Washington said manufacturers remain committed to supplying efficient new jets but face persistent supply chain issues.

Walsh also blamed airports and a stalled two-decade effort to reform airspace in Europe.

""These guys can't try and benefit from the halo effect of what the airlines are doing, if they're not prepared to commit to supporting the industry,"" he said.

ACI Europe, which represents airports, said they were doing ""more than their fair share"" in decarbonising aviation and accused IATA of shifting responsibility. CANSO, an air traffic control umbrella group, could not immediately be reached.

Walsh said airlines were not interested in a ""blame game"", but that, if net-zero goals were to be met, the entire sector needed to understand the state of play.

""It's reality. We're highlighting the nature (and) scale of the challenge,"" he said.

The initiative falls under Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, ensuring internationally recognized and verifiable emissions reductions.

A wide range of sectors—including solar thermal energy, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—are expected to benefit from JCM investments.

India can strategically direct these funds toward underdeveloped clean energy sectors, leveraging Japanese expertise to accelerate its transition to a low-carbon economy.

Japan has already established similar agreements with 11 other countries, including Indonesia, Kenya, and Vietnam.

However, negotiations with India have been ongoing since 2014, reflecting the complexity of such high-stakes climate agreements.

While the JCM promises significant environmental and economic benefits, challenges remain. Ensuring that emissions reductions are not double-counted will be critical to maintaining the mechanism’s credibility.

Additionally, India must develop the capacity to sustain and expand these technologies independently over time.

Souring Oil The gas boom is needed to replace the industry’s traditional oil business, which is struggling as China rapidly adopts EVs.","China’s energy giants are increasingly pivoting to natural gas to raise production, as demand for oil slows and global trade tensions heighten the risks of relying too heavily on imports.

The nation’s gas output is poised to surpass that of crude oil for the first time this year, with each of the three state-owned majors — PetroChina Co., Cnooc Ltd. and Sinopec — setting higher production targets for the cleaner-burning fuel. To deliver that growth, the firms are expanding into technically challenging areas including unconventional shale fields and deep-water reserves.

The shift to gas has been underway for years, initially spurred on by the government’s desire to clear the coal-fired smog that used to choke its megacities. But the transition has become more urgent as the electric-vehicle boom slams the brakes on oil consumption, leaving gas as the only upstream growth market for drillers.

“Buyers will take all the gas we produce — there’s tremendous growth potential,” Cnooc President Yan Hongtao said last week at the company’s annual earnings briefing.

The production push in the world’s largest gas importer threatens to add to a coming wave of global supply, led by new liquefied natural gas export plants that are due to come online in places like Qatar and the US over the next few years. More gas is also being piped overland from Central Asia and Russia, China’s strategic partner since the invasion of Ukraine.

With economic growth constrained by the slowdown in the real estate sector, Chinese energy firms are being forced to resell unneeded cargoes of the fuel to other buyers in Europe and Asia. Domestic gas prices in China are already showing signs of weakness. China produces enough gas to meet about 60% of its own consumption.

Difficult Drilling

Still, gas proved a major driver of record profits last year at PetroChina, the nation’s largest supplier of the fuel. Gas now accounts for 54% of the firm’s total output, Chairman Dai Houliang said at a briefing on Monday. Despite planned spending cuts this year, the firm intends to accelerate shale development, LNG terminal construction and pipeline expansion to support the boom.

“We will accelerate gas production in the next five years,” Vice President He Jiangchuan told the briefing. Output from shale could grow 31% in the next five years, while production from coal-rock formations could double this year, he said.

The focus on new, more technically challenging formations comes amid declining output from aging onshore wells that have been the industry’s mainstay for decades. Top refiner Sinopec, which already operates the nation’s largest shale gas field, recently announced a major shale oil discovery in Shandong province.

Meanwhile, offshore driller Cnooc is poised to lead production gains among the big three this year and next. It’s developed the Bohai Sea into the nation’s largest oil and gas field, and is moving into the trickier deeper waters of the South China Sea.

Souring Oil

The gas boom is needed to replace the industry’s traditional oil business, which is struggling as China rapidly adopts EVs. Refining profits last year were battered after overall oil consumption dropped 1.2% compared to a 7.3% rise in gas demand.

That shift has been particularly painful for Sinopec, the nation’s largest fuel maker, and the only one of the three majors to see net income shrink in 2024. That’s one reason the company pledged to keep domestic output stable this year despite cutting capital spending.

“We will not back down on upstream expansion,” Sinopec Vice Chairman Zhao Dong said at a briefing last week.

On the Wire

China’s steel exports could drop 9-14% this year, the first fall since 2020, as more trading partners step up anti-dumping controls, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.

China’s rising manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, to a March reading of 50.5, signals Beijing’s stimulus is delivering, with an incipient recovery in energy demand setting the tone, BI said.

Ships are the backbone of global trade, and Donald Trump is unhappy that most of them are made in China.

,,2025-04-02 10:51:23+00:00,www.consultancy.eu,Self-driving wheelchairs at Schiphol Airport: Behind the scenes with Arlande,"Consultancy.eu, www.consultancy.eu",,,,,https://www.consultancy.eu/news/11548/self-driving-wheelchairs-at-schiphol-airport-behind-the-scenes-with-arlande,"Schiphol made the headlines last year with the launch of a new pilot for self-driving wheelchairs, helping passengers with reduced mobility to their gate.
“The idea of self-driving wheelchairs came from the service owner of PRM.
“You have airlines, of course, who are responsible for requesting assistance for their passengers,” Wildenberg explains.
The technology has been provided by a Japanese company which already has experience with self-driving wheelchairs at other airports, including Tokyo, Miami and Los Angeles.
The first results of the pilot have been positive: passengers rated the self-driving wheelchairs with a score of 4.2 on a 5-point scale.","Schiphol made the headlines last year with the launch of a new pilot for self-driving wheelchairs, helping passengers with reduced mobility to their gate. Jasper Wildenberg, market lead for Aviation at Arlande, was responsible for the implementation of this innovation project from the start – we spoke with him on the project’s background, the challenges and Arlande’s role.

In 2024, 66.8 million people flew from, via or to Schiphol, making it the world’s fifth busiest airport. An increasing number of passengers require mobility support, and in order to better serve passengers with reduced mobility (PRM in aviation jargon), the airport set out to improve its services to this group of passengers.

“The question arose as to how we could improve our service for passengers who have difficulty walking and the long distances at Schiphol, and how autonomous and independent travel could be provided,” says Jasper Wildenberg. “The idea of self-driving wheelchairs came from the service owner of PRM. So the idea was already there, but there was no clear business case. Research was also needed into the technical feasibility.”

Wildenberg came on board the project as a consultant, just after the intention to test self-driving wheelchairs had been expressed.

Complex stakeholder landscape

One of the biggest challenges was the crowded stakeholder landscape at Schiphol. “You have airlines, of course, who are responsible for requesting assistance for their passengers,” Wildenberg explains. “The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management was also involved because of legislation and regulations. In addition, internal stakeholders, such as fire safety experts, also joined in due to the increasing number of batteries being charged in the terminal.”

Within this complex field of stakeholders, Wildenberg played a pivotal role. His task was to ensure that the project maintained momentum amid the complexity of operational interests at hand – keeping everyone well-informed, and rowing in the same direction with regards to the autonomous wheelchair pilot.

Focus on the passenger experience

With a robust and broadly supported plan, the project team managed to bring all parties on board. A crucial element of buy-in was the fact that the project was worth the investment because it contributes to a better experience for passengers with reduced mobility. They can still opt for personal support from the airport, but now also have an additional option of choosing to travel autonomous.

“They are always ready,” says Wildenberg. “Passengers can now be helped in the way they prefer. Due to this approach, Schiphol’s management ultimately chose for the importance of individual passenger experience and needs. Quality is the most important driver and that is what sets Schiphol apart from other airports, which are often more focused on efficiency.”

The pilot phase

During the pilot phase, 10 self-driving wheelchairs have been deployed across Schiphol. The technology has been provided by a Japanese company which already has experience with self-driving wheelchairs at other airports, including Tokyo, Miami and Los Angeles. “We went to Japan to see how the wheelchairs work and react to passengers there,” says Wildenberg.

The first results of the pilot have been positive: passengers rated the self-driving wheelchairs with a score of 4.2 on a 5-point scale. “Despite raising a few eyebrows among bystanders, when they drive back empty after a passenger has been dropped off at a gate”, highlights Wildenberg.

Also the airlines have reacted positive to the innovation. Passengers who have some form of disability, visible or invisible, are provided a better service.

The project has meanwhile caught the public imagination beyond the airport, too, featuring in a number of national news stories. Encouraged by the good reception, Schiphol is fully promoting its innovation, including through press releases and social media.

The next steps

As the pilot draws to a successful close, Wildenberg has drawn some important lessons from the experience. Most important, he says, is that it is “crucial to remain flexible” when implementing new ideas.

He expands, “If a stakeholder does not cooperate, you have to switch: either you have to adjust your goals, or you have to see if the project is still effective and feasible if such a stakeholder drops out.”

For Wildenberg, this is almost the end of his role. Reflecting on his contribution, he says he is proud to have worked on such an impactful project – because “as a consultant, you naturally want to make a difference”. Now thousands of passengers with reduces mobility will in the foreseeable future be able to enjoy a better travel experience.",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-04-02-104735247-2025-03-25-075027803-Zelfrijdende_rolstoelen_op_Schiphol-_Een_blik_achter_de_schermen_met_Arlande_spotlight.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 11:56:34.633220

The initiative aims to establish a robust supply chain for SAF feedstock derived from waste cooking oil.
This collaboration is a key step towards decarbonizing Thailand’s aviation sector and supporting the nation’s broader renewable energy objectives, reports Reccessary.
A significant aspect of this partnership is that many of the involved companies generate substantial quantities of waste cooking oil as a byproduct of their regular operations.

The initiative aims to establish a robust supply chain for SAF feedstock derived from waste cooking oil. This collaboration is a key step towards decarbonizing Thailand’s aviation sector and supporting the nation’s broader renewable energy objectives, reports Reccessary.

The Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM), under the MOI, hosted a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signing ceremony with the participating industry players on March 31st.

A significant aspect of this partnership is that many of the involved companies generate substantial quantities of waste cooking oil as a byproduct of their regular operations. This provides a “cost-effective and readily available source of raw material for SAF production.” Currently, high SAF prices are partly attributed to limited feedstock availability, making waste cooking oil a particularly “viable option to help bring down costs.”

The six major companies joining forces with the Thai government in this endeavor are Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Minister of Industry Akanat Promphan stated that “discussions regarding potential collaboration with Bangchak Corporation have already commenced.” The envisioned plan involves utilizing the collected waste cooking oil to produce SAF while simultaneously promoting the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model. According to the Minister, “this approach will enhance the value of waste, reduce carbon emissions from industries, and contribute to mitigating the impacts of climate change.”

Beyond establishing a system for sourcing waste cooking oil, the initiative also aims to increase public awareness and encourage participation through various “campaigns, educational programs, and network-building efforts,” ultimately guiding the economy towards a low-carbon and sustainable future.

Bangchak CEO Chaiwat Kovavisarach offered two crucial recommendations to the government. These include “expanding the range of suitable feedstocks for SAF production” and “establishing clear and consistent regulations regarding SAF blending mandates, coupled with investment incentives.” Mr. Kovavisarach believes that these measures will significantly boost investor confidence, attract long-term investments in the sector, and solidify Thailand’s position as a regional leader in the clean aviation fuel market.

As a pioneering force in Thailand’s SAF development, Bangchak is on track to commence production at its facility in Bangkok during the second quarter of 2025. The estimated daily output is expected to be around 1 million liters. The company has already secured confirmed customers, including Shell Eastern Trading in Singapore and Japan’s Cosmo Oil.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 08:56:29.857403

The growing demand for sustainable fuel in the aviation sector is driving the global need for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The adoption of SAF plays a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions. Governments worldwide are increasingly promoting sustainable development across various industries, which is expected to further accelerate the use of sustainable fuels in the coming years. An increase in investment in renewable energy, coupled with the implementation of stricter energy regulations, is anticipated to support the growth of the global SAF market. Leading SAF companies are shifting from crude oil processing to renewable fuels to expand their revenue streams and investing in carbon-neutral jet fuels to capture a larger market share.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a renewable or waste-derived fuel that meets sustainability standards. It can be produced from various sustainable resources such as agricultural and forestry waste, cooking oils, carbon captured from the atmosphere, and green hydrogen. SAF can be mixed with traditional jet fuel to reduce emissions and is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it can be used without requiring changes to aircraft or infrastructure. High-quality SAF plays a crucial role in cutting carbon dioxide emissions, with its emissions throughout production, distribution, transportation, and combustion being about 75% lower than those of fossil-based jet fuels. The potential for oil & gas refineries to integrate SAF technologies is vast, as SAF reduces harmful particulate and sulfur emissions by up to 90% and 100%, respectively.

Climate Change Concerns Driving the Demand for SAF

Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges, requiring collective efforts across governments, societies, and industries to address it. Aviation, along with sectors like cement, steel, plastics, trucking, and shipping, contributes to approximately 30% of global annual carbon emissions. The rise in aviation emissions is linked to the increase in air travel. Projections suggest that air passenger journeys could exceed 10 billion by 2050, and the aviation sector is expected to return to its pre-COVID share of about 3% of total global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Under a “business as usual” scenario, emissions could reach 21.2 gigatons of CO2 from 2021 to 2050.

Governments worldwide are adopting sustainable fuels and carbon capture technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, and the growing adoption of SAF is expected to help mitigate aviation sector emissions. SAF could reduce emissions by approximately 65%, helping the aviation industry reach its net-zero emissions target by 2050. The use of sustainable jet fuel is projected to increase in the 2030s as global policies support SAF and it becomes more competitive with fossil kerosene.

Expansion of SAF Deployment

Aviation companies are committed to reducing their net CO2 emissions by 2050. In October 2021, IATA member airlines pledged to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 during the 77th IATA Annual General Meeting in Boston. This commitment aligns the air transport sector with the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. Several countries are introducing energy regulations aimed at achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. However, the aviation sector is considered one of the most challenging to decarbonize, making SAF adoption one of the largest opportunities to help meet and exceed the industry’s 2050 goals. The sector is expected to require around 450-500 million tons of renewable jet fuel annually by 2050 to meet these targets.

Strong government support to channel feedstocks toward aviation, rather than other transport sectors, is expected to help address challenges in scaling up SAF use. In 2020, SAF cost $1.10 per liter compared to $0.50 per liter for conventional jet fuel. However, conventional jet fuel prices are projected to rise in the coming years, while SAF prices are expected to decrease. Market players are also likely to invest in the research and development of diverse feedstocks, including non-food crops, waste sources, and power-to-liquid fuels derived from recycled or directly captured CO2.

The Surge in Biofuel Adoption

The global sustainable aviation fuel market is divided into biofuels, power-to-liquid, and gas-to-liquid fuel types. The biofuel segment held the largest market share of 95.7% in 2021 and is expected to maintain dominance throughout the forecast period. Biofuels are derived directly or indirectly from organic materials, such as plant materials and animal waste. These fuels can deliver similar performance to petroleum-based jet fuels with a significantly lower carbon footprint. They can be produced from crops, forestry, agricultural waste, fishery products, or municipal waste.

The Growing Demand for HEFA-SPK Technology

The global SAF market is classified based on technology, including HEFA-SPK, FT-SPK, HFS-SIP, ATJ-SPK, and power-to-liquid. The HEFA-SPK segment dominated the market in 2021, accounting for 95.3% of the market share. The HEFA-SPK process uses fatty feedstocks, such as vegetable oils and waste fats, which undergo an oxygenation reaction followed by hydrogen addition to break down the fatty compounds into hydrocarbons. These compounds are then refined into various liquid fuels, which can be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

A notable transformation is underway in the global aviation sector. The formation of a new not-for-profit body, the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization based in Montreal, marks a significant step toward harmonizing and scaling the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel across the globe.

Establishing Trust with a Global SAF Registry

At the heart of this initiative is the upcoming launch of the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Registry. Designed to document and validate transactions of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, the registry aims to ensure transparency, traceability, and environmental credibility. The initiative emerges at a time when the industry demands infrastructure that not only supports compliance but also incentivizes cross-border collaboration.

From Infrastructure to Market Confidence

The registry addresses a longstanding issue: the highly fragmented supply and consumption patterns of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. By enabling the environmental attributes of the fuel to be claimed regardless of geographic limitations, the registry enhances flexibility and expands market participation. In this way, it does not merely serve as a technical solution but becomes a cornerstone for market liquidity and investor confidence.

A Platform for Collaboration

One of the most significant features of this initiative is its inclusivity. The governing body is open to participation from a broad spectrum of stakeholders. This includes producers, airlines, regulators, and even state actors. By doing so, it paves the way for an open, global dialogue that may eventually help unify principles across other regional and national registries.

Beyond Compliance Toward a Collective Goal

The establishment of this body reflects a broader mindset shift within aviation. No longer is the focus solely on compliance; the direction is now one of proactive alignment with climate goals. By separating the governance of the registry from its creators, the initiative builds a framework of accountability and neutrality, which is vital for fostering international trust.

Incentivizing Corporate Responsibility

In addition to helping airlines meet regulatory targets, the registry opens doors for corporate customers. Businesses that are eager to reduce their aviation-related emissions can now claim verified reductions in their own sustainability reports. This model aligns with voluntary decarbonization mechanisms and encourages joint investment into cleaner fuels.

A Forward-Thinking Economic Model

Participation in the registry is free until April of twenty twenty seven. Afterward, it will operate on a cost recovery basis. This approach ensures early adoption without financial barriers, while creating a path toward financial sustainability. It is a reminder that effective climate solutions do not always require profits at the outset—they require scale, credibility, and collective benefit.

Reimagining the Aviation Value Chain

With this initiative, aviation moves from a siloed model to an interconnected ecosystem. Fuel producers, airlines, freight operators, and governments now have a shared platform to record, verify, and exchange data. Such synergy helps reduce emissions across the value chain while making it easier for downstream customers to participate in aviation decarbonization.

Building the Foundations for Harmonization

While different countries and regions have begun creating their own registries and policies for cleaner fuels, the introduction of a global standard lays the groundwork for harmonization. A unified registry allows for better interoperability and reduces friction between regulatory frameworks. This contributes to market efficiency, simplifies compliance, and encourages innovation.

Conclusion

This development is more than the launch of a digital ledger. It is a visionary leap in how the aviation industry collaborates, innovates, and accelerates toward climate resilience. By providing structure to a sector that is often challenged by supply constraints and regulatory complexity, this registry becomes a powerful symbol of transformation. It demonstrates how operational transparency and stakeholder collaboration can unlock scalable, inclusive, and lasting change in aviation.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-10-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-02 06:56:26.031394

This year, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) released the 2024 reference prices for aviation fuels under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. More than a routine update, this pricing reveals a deeper narrative: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is no longer a future ambition—it is the present directive. As the EU’s SAF blending mandate kicks off with a 2 percent requirement, these reference prices are not just numbers. They are indicators of the complex interplay between policy, production, and market maturity.

More Than Market Trends

The reference prices extend beyond conventional fuels. While jet fuel and aviation biofuels are pegged to market rates, the new-generation fuels—synthetic, hydrogen-based, and recycled carbon—are benchmarked against estimated production costs. These include feedstock sourcing, energy input, and technological application. The price signals suggest progress in scale, yet underline the continued financial gap compared to fossil-based alternatives.

Notably, average prices for conventional fuels and biofuels have dropped. Conventional aviation fuel is down by 10 percent from last year, and aviation biofuels by a more substantial 25 percent. However, for newer SAF variants, costs are up across the board—recycled carbon fuels, advanced biofuels, synthetic fuels, and renewable hydrogen all saw increased estimated production costs for 2024.

Signals of Systemic Change

EASA’s pricing guide is more than economic insight—it forms a regulatory cornerstone. These estimates will shape penalties for non-compliance and influence subsidy allocation under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). As blending mandates tighten over the decades, price transparency becomes critical to fostering investment and supply chain confidence.

The 2024 update serves as a precursor to EASA’s full technical report due in September. That document will offer a comprehensive view of compliance among fuel suppliers, airports, and airlines—and provide a detailed account of SAF development across EU member states.

Navigating the SAF Transition

What makes the current moment especially noteworthy is the differentiated pricing for synthetic aviation fuels based on carbon sourcing. Fuel produced from atmospheric CO2 carries the highest cost—€8,470 per tonne—over eleven times the price of conventional fuel. Meanwhile, synthetic fuels sourced from industrial or biogenic CO2 remain marginally less expensive. These distinctions will matter increasingly as the sub-mandate for synthetic SAFs takes effect in 2030, starting at 1.2 percent and rising to 35 percent by 2050.

For renewable hydrogen, the picture is mixed. While its aviation-specific production cost rose to €7,520 per tonne, low-carbon hydrogen saw a marginal cost decrease. Such data points hint at potential efficiency gains or improved technological integration in select value chains.

Beyond Compliance: Strategy and Momentum

The progression of the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and its annual pricing reviews represents a structural shift in how Europe approaches aviation decarbonisation. With rising cost transparency, the groundwork is being laid for smarter procurement, long-term offtake agreements, and incentive structuring.

For operators, this means more than meeting compliance—it means planning investments and partnerships that match the pace of regulation. It also invites questions around procurement strategies: How can airlines hedge against rising SAF production costs? How can airports support supply chain readiness?

Conclusion

The 2024 EASA reference prices reflect both opportunity and challenge. They demonstrate that while conventional and biofuels are becoming slightly more affordable, new fuels remain on a steep pricing curve. But that curve is not a dead end—it is a blueprint.

Policy is working to accelerate the economics of SAF. The groundwork being laid today, in price-setting and compliance mechanisms, is a crucial enabler for reaching 70 percent SAF use by 2050. As EASA’s full report nears, stakeholders across the value chain will need to remain agile, informed, and ready to translate compliance into competitive advantage.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-5-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-02 06:56:36.595195

The Promise of Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Sustainable Aviation Fuel represents a revolutionary shift in how airlines can reduce their carbon footprint. Unlike traditional fossil fuels, SAF is produced from renewable resources, such as biomass waste, used cooking oil, and even municipal solid waste. This fuel not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also offers a pathway to cleaner air—a benefit that resonates strongly with cities battling pollution.

Turning Agricultural Waste into a Green Resource

India is blessed with an abundance of agricultural by-products. Every year, vast quantities of rice and wheat straws are burned, significantly contributing to air pollution, particularly in major cities like Delhi. However, these straws, along with other biomass wastes, can be transformed into a valuable feedstock for SAF production. This innovative approach not only mitigates environmental harm but also adds economic value to what was once considered waste.

India’s Strategic Advantages

Rich Feedstock Availability

Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR Development at Airbus, highlights India's enormous potential:

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock; there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste that can be recovered.""

From rice straws to wheat straws, India’s vast agricultural landscape provides an ideal raw material base for sustainable fuel production. This plentiful supply of feedstock offers a dual advantage—reducing harmful air pollution from open burning and creating a sustainable energy resource.

A Thriving Petrochemicals Industry

India's robust petrochemicals industry, combined with a strong network of refineries and engineering capabilities, creates a fertile ground for scaling up SAF production. These established industries can integrate with innovative fuel technologies, paving the way for a seamless transition from traditional fuels to greener alternatives.

Pioneering Partnerships: Airbus and IIP

Airbus, a global leader in aerospace, has been actively driving the transition towards sustainable aviation. Recognizing India's potential, Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) in Dehradun to explore new methods of SAF production. This collaboration aims to overcome technical hurdles and fast-track regulatory approvals, ensuring that India is not left behind in the race towards greener aviation.

Stimulating Global Demand

While Europe currently leads in SAF demand, Airbus is keen on expanding the market globally. By harnessing India's abundant resources, the partnership could significantly boost SAF production, making the fuel more competitive against conventional crude oil. This global shift is essential, as economies of scale can help reduce costs and drive widespread adoption.

Looking to the Future: Policy and Mass Scale Production

Despite its potential, SAF remains more expensive than traditional jet fuel. To truly unlock its benefits, governments worldwide—India included—must implement supportive policies. Whether through mandates or production incentives, policy frameworks will play a crucial role in achieving mass-scale production. Manhes envisions a future where, by 2040 or 2050, India could be producing close to 100 million tonnes of SAF, marking a significant leap forward in sustainable aviation.

The Road Ahead for India

With its fast-growing aviation market and proactive approach to sustainability, India stands at a pivotal juncture. By investing in renewable technologies and crafting forward-thinking policies, India can transition from being a major consumer of fossil fuels to a leading producer of green energy. This transformation holds the promise of cleaner skies, reduced pollution, and a more sustainable future for all.

Conclusion: Taking Flight Toward a Greener Tomorrow

India’s journey towards becoming a global SAF producer is not just about embracing a new technology—it’s about redefining an entire industry. The convergence of abundant agricultural waste, industrial expertise, and strategic international partnerships creates an inspiring blueprint for sustainable development. As policymakers, industry leaders, and innovators collaborate, the prospect of greener aviation isn’t just a dream—it’s a flight path toward a cleaner, brighter future.

The question remains: can India harness its natural and industrial wealth to lead the charge in sustainable aviation? The skies of tomorrow depend on it.

With Inputs from Reuters

IndiGo’s parent company, InterGlobe Aviation Limited, has recently found itself at the center of a tax controversy that is stirring up conversations among investors and industry watchers alike. The Income Tax Department has slapped a hefty penalty of Rs 944.20 crore for the assessment year 2021-22 under Section 270A of the Income Tax Act. But what exactly lies beneath this colossal figure?

The Penalty Breakdown

The penalty order is not based on a conventional mistake or oversight—it hinges on what IndiGo describes as an ""erroneous understanding"" by the tax authorities. According to the airline, the department mistakenly presumed that its appeal against a previous assessment order had been dismissed. However, the reality is quite different: the appeal is still pending before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals).

“The order for said penalty under Income Tax has been passed on the basis of an erroneous understanding that the appeal filed by the Company before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) against the Assessment Order under Section 143(3) has been dismissed, whereas the same is still alive and pending adjudication,” stated an IndiGo spokesperson.

A Battle of Interpretations

The Tax Authority's Perspective

From the tax department’s standpoint, the order was issued under strict adherence to Section 270A, which deals with penalties on underreported income. The authorities appear to have interpreted the status of the pending appeal as a dismissal, thus triggering the penalty.

IndiGo’s Counter-Argument

On the flip side, IndiGo is standing its ground by labeling the penalty as “erroneous and frivolous.” The company is not taking this allegation lightly—it plans to contest the ruling through legal channels. For IndiGo, the penalty is a product of misinterpretation rather than a justified punitive measure. This dispute not only reflects the complexities of tax regulations but also highlights the need for clarity in legal interpretations, especially in cases involving high-stake financial figures.

Impact on Business: More Hype Than Hindrance

Despite the sensational headline of a nearly Rs 944.20 crore penalty, IndiGo is quick to reassure its stakeholders. The company maintains that the ruling will not have a significant impact on its financials, operations, or overall business activities. The robust financial management and operational resilience of IndiGo continue to set a benchmark in the aviation industry, even as legal skirmishes emerge off the runway.

What’s Next in the Legal Arena?

The forthcoming legal battle is expected to be closely watched by both the industry and investors. As the case progresses, it will be interesting to see how the nuances of tax law are interpreted by the judicial system. The outcome could set a precedent for how pending appeals are treated in similar cases, thereby influencing future interactions between large corporations and tax authorities.

Final Thoughts: Navigating the Turbulence

While the tax penalty makes for a captivating headline, the situation serves as a reminder of the intricate dance between regulatory authorities and corporate entities. IndiGo’s confident approach in addressing what it deems an administrative misinterpretation underscores its readiness to navigate through regulatory turbulence. As the legal proceedings unfold, one can only watch with bated breath to see whether this will be a misadventure in bureaucratic oversight or a strategic maneuver by the tax department.

Founded by visionary Pramod Chaudhari, the company now offers cutting-edge sustainable marine and aviation fuel as part of its green product portfolio.

As Executive Chair, Chaudhari envisions more breakthroughs in the green energy space with innovations like biohydrogen and renewable polymers on the horizon. He acknowledges Praj’s impact on India’s bioenergy space is committed to sustaining that footprint.

In fact, he is particular about this. “For Praj, one parameter of success is definitely related to the legacy we leave for others to follow and to get inspired from,” he says.

Propelling progress

Chaudhari’s inspiration to set foot in the bioenergy industry came from Brazil.

“Brazil was the first country to go for biofuels after the first fuel crisis of 1973 hit the world,” Chaudhari explains. “India had a good sugarcane industry like Brazil, and we could learn from them.”

That led to the formation of Praj’s first ethanol plant. The ethanol plant was beneficial in more ways than one. It offered a solution to reduce the country’s dependence on fuel imports for one. It also caught on as a remunerative option for farmers.

Chaudhari explains another reason to push for biofuels that started emerging after the turn of the millennium was climate change.

“Ethanol blending is a good solution to control the climate because we are using carbon-neutral fuel,” he says.

This led Praj to expand its product base and start its research center to offer sustainable energy solutions. Among the co-products, it offers compressed biogas, bio-bitumen, biofertilizers and a range of proteins.

The latest in Praj’s portfolio is sustainable aviation fuel, a major milestone in the country’s push for biofuel.

“We partnered with Indian Oil Corporation Limited to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for a commercial flight operated by Air Asia,” Chaudhari reveals.

For the future, he sees sustainable marine fuels and biohydrogen as part of Praj’s products.

He also talks about exciting prospects in producing renewable polymers.

“There are two types of bioplastics – polylactic and polyhydroxyalkanoates. Then, there are paints, varnishes, and surface treatment solutions, which can be used to produce safe toys,” he says.

“The prospects are unlimited.”

Achieving Net Zero

Chaudhari emphasizes the need to create circular economies for a truly sustainable future.

“Climate is going to rule the whole gamut of businesses in the future. So, it makes sense to promote circular economies wherever possible,” he explains. “It is important to sensitize people about that.”

That is why net zero is taken very seriously at Praj.

“We talk about net zero in terms of climate, but we can have net zero for every aspect from water usage, steam usage and having zero defects in our designs and equipment. Zero should be our focus in all walks of life,” he says.

“I am not exaggerating when I say most of our departments are busy with zero. Really, Praj is obsessed with zero.”

As an initiative to promote awareness, Praj has also adopted a village to implement and demonstrate net zero practices.

“When you visit Pune, we’d be proud to take you to two places – the first would be our R&D center, while the second would be our net zero village,” Chaudhari says.

Praj includes suppliers in the circular economy, ensuring a green supply chain.

“We get our suppliers certified for a green supply chain. We rope them in to achieve a community effect that benefits them and us, and the community,” he explains.

‘Delight’ is a key word for the company, according to Chaudhari.

“Customer-centricity is key to Praj. We foster a warm and friendly atmosphere for our employees, who are our pride,” he says.

“We ensure delight for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.”",https://static.theceomagazine.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/02144922/Pramod-Chaudhari_PRAJ-INDUSTRIES_Sharing-1100x578.jpg,N,,2025-04-02 09:56:26.581329

The SBTi’s consultation survey on the Draft Standard is open until 1 June 2025.","Consultation on the Draft Standard

The SBTi first published its Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021. It has stated that this latest update was made to “align with the latest science and emerging best practice, and in response to stakeholder feedback”.

The Draft Standard contains the following key revisions:

Use of EACs (including carbon credits)

The Draft Standard contains updated provisions on the use of EACs. The approach as set out in the Draft Standard can be summarised as follows:

Scope 2

As in the existing standard, reporting entities will be able to use energy EACs to substantiate direct mitigation for scope 2 market-based targets. Now however, the Draft Standard proposes that entities must “procure contractual instruments conveying a zero-carbon electricity attribute [ie zero-carbon energy certificates] that match their operational electricity use both in time and geographic location”. This approach, linking the scope 2 emissions and energy EAC temporally and spatially, has been taken to increase the effectiveness of permissible EACs.

Scope 3

The Draft Standard proposes a more “nuanced approach” to scope 3 emissions mitigation to address traceability issues (see point 5). Where scope 3 emissions cannot be mitigated directly or via an “activity pool”, entities may use effective indirect mitigation measures on an interim basis. The SBTi’s guidance suggests this refers to energy and commodity certificates, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates.

If indirect mitigation measures are used, these must be reported separately from direct mitigation, and entities will be required to develop and implement policies to increase emissions mitigation within their value chain.

Residual emissions

Whilst the existing standard requires mitigation of residual emissions in the net zero year (and beyond), the Draft Standard proposes that companies address their scope 1 residual emissions in the years up to their net zero year.

The SBTi suggests three options for doing so which each involve carbon dioxide removals:

Requiring near-term and long-term removals targets up to the net zero year (the option currently included in the Draft Standard).

Recognising (but not requiring) near- term and long-term removals targets up to the net zero year.

A more flexible combination of removals and additional emissions mitigation, beyond that required by its 1.5oC aligned targets.

For these purposes, removals may be from pools and sinks within the reporting entity’s value chain or by purchasing removals credits from entities situated beyond the value chain of the company. Where companies use removal credits, these will need to be reported according to the removals project types.

The Draft Standard also introduces the concept of a “durability threshold” for removals targets, which can be applied using two options:

A like-for-like approach in which the specific greenhouse gases emitted by the entity are matched with removals projects whose durability aligns with the atmospheric lifetime of that greenhouse gas.

A gradual transition from less permanent removals (such as nature-based solutions), to more permanent removals (like carbon capture and storage).

Beyond value chain mitigation (BVCM)

The existing standard recommends that companies undertake BVCM to take responsibility for emissions released whilst a company is decarbonising. The Draft Standard seeks to provide additional recognition for companies that take this step (referred to in the Draft Standard as addressing “ongoing emissions”), by enabling them to publicly report on these actions.

As with the existing SBTi guidance on BVCM, the Draft Standard permits the use of “high-integrity carbon credits” for these purposes. As an interesting development, if an entity does use carbon credits for BVCM, the Draft Standard recommends the entity should aim to address 100 per cent of its ongoing emissions.

In relation to the above, the SBTi has explicitly reiterated that offsetting is still not permitted. It defines offsetting as purchasing carbon credits that do not originate from activities in the entity’s value chain to meet emission reduction targets.

Tailored requirements depending on company size and location

There will be two categories of companies under the Draft Standard:

Category A companies (large companies in all geographies, and medium-sized companies in higher income geographies).

Category B companies (medium-sized companies in lower income geographies and all small companies).

The proposed thresholds to categorise ‘large’, ‘medium’ and ‘small’ companies are as follows:

Company size Emissions Balance sheet* Net turnover worldwide* Number of employees Large

Satisfies at least one of the following thresholds. >450m

>1,000

Medium

Satisfies at least two of the following thresholds. >25m

50-450m 250-1,000

Small

Satisfies the emissions threshold and at least two other thresholds. <10,000 tCO2-e (scope1-2)

<25m

<50m

<250

*The currency for these thresholds is either US Dollars or Euros.

Category A companies will continue to be subject to the SBTi’s full criteria, however some elements of these requirements will be optional for Category B companies, in recognition of their size, resources and operating context. For example, Category B companies will not need to set scope 3 near-term targets.

Tougher initial commitment criteria

Under the current standard, as a first step, companies provide a private “commitment letter” to the SBTi in which they pledge to set science-based targets within 24 months.

The Draft Standard instead proposes that companies will need to publicly commit to being net zero by 2050 (or sooner). Category A companies then have 12 months to set their science-backed targets, whilst Category B companies will have 24 months to do this.

Improved accountability mechanisms

The Draft Standard proposes new mechanisms to recognise progress being made towards emissions reduction targets. This will involve more regular assessments, such as “renewal validations” when new targets are set at the end of a 5-year target cycle, and “spot checks”, which might be performed at any time.

Further, Category A companies will now need to obtain third-party assurance on their base year emissions inventory.

More flexible arrangements for setting scope 3 targets

While the current standard requires companies to adopt fixed scope 3 targets (67 per cent for the near-term and 90 per cent for the long-term), the Draft Standard “explicitly incentivizes companies to prioritize action on the most relevant sources of emissions in their value chain”. This means a shift away from rigid targets so that companies will have more freedom to set their own targets.

Moreover, while companies will need to continue reporting all scope 1 and 2 emissions on an annual basis, only “relevant” scope 3 emissions will need to be reported annually. Relevant scope 3 emissions are defined as: emissions sources representing more than 5 per cent of total scope 3 emissions; and emissions-intensive activities representing at least 1 per cent or 10,000 tCO2-e of the entity’s scope 3 emissions.

A more “nuanced approach” to substantiating emissions reduction progress

Although the Draft Standard requires companies to continue prioritising direct mitigation, it permits entities to rely on emissions data and interventions at the “activity pool” level, where it is not possible to identify specific emission sources along a value chain.

The SBTi provides that an “activity pool” represents a set of emissions sources that may physically serve the reporting entity but lack specific traceability to individual sources. For example, a “downstream activity pool” could be the electricity grid powering the products that a company brings to market, where it does not have the actual data on these emissions.

As above, where traceability barriers persist, indirect mitigation measures (such as energy and commodity certificates) will be permitted.

The SBTi’s consultation survey on the Draft Standard is open until 1 June 2025.

We anticipate that further amendments will be made before an additional consultation period and, eventually, final approval.

Paris, March 31, 2025 – The ongoing conversion of the Grandpuits refinery is entering a key phase. Over 1,200 people are working on the project, which includes the launch of an advanced plastics recycling unit, the first in France to use this particular technology, and the construction of a biorefinery for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). Once completed, this vast project will be the Company’s first zero-crude platform.

The complex construction operation, for which as much of the site's equipment as possible is reused, requires the mobilization and expertise of all the employees who know the Grandpuits site. Some projects due to arrive in the second phase — biogas and mechanical recycling — have been suspended and the employees who were to join them are assigned, with their agreement, to the success of the first two major projects. In line with its plans at the outset of the project in 2020, TotalEnergies confirms that 250 jobs will be maintained at Grandpuits following the conversion.

Within a few months, Grandpuits will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year of pyrolysis oil from recycled plastic, and from the beginning of 2026, up to 230,000 tons a year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

To speed up the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the Thai government, through the Ministry of Industry (MOI), is partnering with six major local companies and their affiliates to establish a waste cooking oil-based SAF feedstock supply chain. This collaboration aims to help decarbonize Thailand’s aviation sector and support the country’s renewable energy goals.

Thailand targets feedstock supply to boost SAF growth

Thailand’s Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) held a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signing event with industry players on March 31.

Many of these companies generate significant amounts of waste cooking oil as a byproduct of their operations, providing a cost-effective and readily available feedstock for SAF production. High SAF prices are partly due to limited supply, and waste cooking oil is seen as one of the most viable raw materials to help lower costs.

The six companies partnering with the Thai government in this initiative are Central Group, Thai Beverage, Charoen Pokphand Foods, Thai President Foods, the Thai Food Processors Association, and Bangchak Corporation.

Minister of Industry Akanat Promphan stated that discussions with Bangchak Corporation on potential cooperation have already begun. The plan is to use collected waste cooking oil to produce SAF while promoting the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) economic model. This approach enhances waste value, reduces industrial carbon emissions, and supports climate change mitigation efforts.

Bangchak CEO urges feedstock expansion and clear regulations

Beyond setting up a waste cooking oil supply system, the initiative also seeks to raise public awareness and participation through campaigns, education and network-building, steering the economy toward a low-carbon, sustainable future.

Bangchak CEO Chaiwat Kovavisarach proposed two key recommendations to the government: expanding the variety of SAF feedstocks and establishing clear regulations on SAF blending mandates along with investment incentives. He believes these measures will boost investor confidence, attract long-term investments, and strengthen Thailand’s position as a regional leader in clean aviation fuel.

CEO Patrick Gruber discussed the company’s proposed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in South Dakota during a fourth quarter earnings call, held March 27, indicating financial close could be achieved by year-end.

The 60 MMgy proposed SAF project, planned for development near Lake Preston, South Dakota, received a conditional commitment for the U.S. Department of Energy loan guarantee last year. Gruber said Gevo continues to collaborate with the DOE loan office as the company moves forward to achieve the financial goals for the project.

According to Gruber, the company wants to see what Summit Carbon Solutions does regarding its planned CO2 pipeline project before it finalizes economics for the proposed SAF plant. South Dakota recently enacted a low prohibiting the use of eminent domain in the development of CO2 pipeline projects in the state, prompting Summit to ask the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission to pause its pending pipeline permit application. Lawmakers in Iowa are working to implement a similar law banning the use of eminent domain on agricultural lands for CO2 pipeline projects. Despite those setbacks, Gruber said Summit has told Gevo the company still strongly believes “that the pipeline is going to get done.”

Gruber also stressed the proposed SAF project could move forward without the Summit pipeline. Gevo’s recently acquired ethanol plant in North Dakota has its own CO2 sequestration site, which could take in CO2 generated at the proposed SAF plant. “If we went this route, the project returns for [the] South Dakota plant would still be attractive,” Gruber said. Financial close for the South Dakota is currently targeted for year-end, Gruber added.

Engineering work is also underway for the development of SAF capacity at the recently acquired North Dakota ethanol plant. Gruber said development of that project can be expedited by levering work already done for the South Dakota facility.

Gevo also has several other business segments, including a renewable natural gas (RNG) project in Iowa. The company sold 366,557 MMBtu of RNG last year. On a standalone basis, the RNG subsidiary generated $15.8 million in revenue last year. This reflects an increase of $300,000 compared to the previous year, primarily due to higher sales of environmental attributes from the RNG project. Gevo expects to receive a final pathway approval under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program in early 2025, which will allow the company to capitalize on a lower carbon intensity (CI) score.

For the fourth quarter, Gevo reported $8.9 million in combined operating revenue and investment income. Loss from operations was $19.6 million. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $11.3 million.

From 2040, medium-haul aircraft (100 to 250 seats) could use hydrogen on flights lasting 60 to 150 minutes.","At this week’s Hysky conference in Marseille, Airbus’ long-time rival Boeing presented its vision for hydrogen and its derivatives. Instead of tuning in to Airbus’ own online event, the Airbus Summit, attendees had the opportunity to hear about Boeing’s roadmap.

Representing the American aircraft manufacturer was Steven Gillard, who oversees sustainability efforts in Europe. He highlighted Boeing’s long-standing experience with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), noting that the company conducted its first SAF test flight in 2008 with Virgin Atlantic. In 2010, a blend of SAF and kerosene was tested on a US Navy F/A-18 fighter jet. More recently, Boeing supported the first commercial SAF-powered flight in 2018, operated by FedEx.

A Longstanding Commitment to SAF

In 2021, Boeing pledged to make all its aircraft 100% SAF-compatible by 2030—a goal similar to Airbus’. By 2024, the company had purchased a total of 23.8 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel. Boeing is also engaged in research on SAF’s atmospheric impact alongside NASA, the FAA, and DLR. Additionally, it has partnered with European and Middle Eastern entities, including Masdar and Zero Petroleum, to advance SAF production. The company is also investing in biofuels through agreements with firms like SkyNRG and Wagner.

Boeing’s Experience with Hydrogen

Beyond SAF, Boeing has a history with hydrogen, particularly from its work in rocketry. However, its involvement in hydrogen-powered aviation also dates back several years. In 2008, it tested fuel cells in a two-seater aircraft, followed by their integration as auxiliary power units aboard a 737. In 2012, Boeing flew its Phantom Eye aircraft using liquid hydrogen. It later incorporated hydrogen-powered batteries into drones in 2015 and 2020. More recently, in 2021, the company developed a cryogenic hydrogen tank for the aerospace sector.

At Hysky, Steven Gillard commented on Airbus’ timeline for hydrogen aviation, saying he was unsurprised by the projected delays. He noted that significant challenges remain in scaling hydrogen from the demonstrator phase to commercially viable aircraft—particularly regarding hydrogen production.

Long-Haul Hydrogen Flights After 2050?

A slide shared with the audience outlined Boeing’s hydrogen timeline, based on industry projections from the ATAG Waypoint report. According to this estimate:

Hydrogen could begin powering small commuter aircraft (9 to 50 seats) on flights under an hour from 2025.

From 2030, it could be used in regional aircraft (50 to 100 seats) on flights lasting 30 to 90 minutes.

By 2035, hydrogen might be viable for short-haul flights (100 to 150 seats) lasting 45 to 120 minutes.

From 2040, medium-haul aircraft (100 to 250 seats) could use hydrogen on flights lasting 60 to 150 minutes.

However, for long-haul flights in 2045 and 2050, hydrogen was notably absent from Boeing’s projections. Instead, SAF remains the primary candidate for decarbonising long-distance air travel.

How It Works

The photothermocatalytic reactor uses a specialized solar absorber (silicon, germanium, gold, and silver) to capture sunlight and generate heat (120–249°C) without fossil fuels or electricity. This heat drives an ethylene oligomerization process, transforming simple hydrocarbons into long-chain molecules ideal for jet fuel. Unlike traditional methods, the system operates on atmospheric CO₂-derived feedstocks, creating a closed carbon loop.

Scalability Advantages

- Modular design ensures temperature uniformity at scale.

- No solar tracking reduces costs and complexity vs. concentrated solar.

- Compatible with existing fuel infrastructure, easing adoption.

Environmental Impact

Trials show SAF can slash aviation’s climate footprint by:

- 26% reduction in contrail warming effect

- 100% lower CO₂ emissions (when using captured carbon)

- Reduced soot and sulfur pollutants

This innovation complements large-scale solar fuel projects like ETH Zurich’s solar tower but targets regions where concentrated solar farms aren’t feasible.

The Road Ahead

While challenges remain in scaling production, the reactor marks a critical step toward net-zero aviation. By harnessing sunlight to power both heat and chemistry, it offers a template for fossil-free fuel synthesis—and a cleaner future for air travel.",https://energycentral.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_meta/public/ece/node_main/2025/4/screenshot202025-04-0120at204_12_42e280afpm.png?itok=EDuLqyjf,N,,2025-04-01 15:56:11.659131

Digitalization: The Future of Air Cargo The strength of e-commerce will represent a growing portion of air cargo business.
Risk & Resilience: Navigating Global Uncertainty Geopolitical risks remain a wildcard for air cargo.
Recent IATA data suggests a similar pattern, with December air cargo rates from Asia to the U.S. rising 8%.
The question is not whether air cargo needs can navigate the current environment, but how quickly it can adapt to new global realities.","Air cargo was a standout performer in 2024, growing 11.3%—outpacing passenger demand. E-commerce expansion and disruptions in sea shipping kept demand high, with yields 39% above 2019 levels. Looking ahead, 2025 is set for another 5.8% growth, but challenges loom: geopolitical uncertainty, inflation, and potential U.S. policy shifts, including new tariffs.

These pressing issues will take center stage at the IATA World Cargo Symposium (WCS) 2025 in Dubai from the 15-17 April. Industry leaders will explore how air cargo can navigate an increasingly complex global trade environment. The symposium will feature plenary sessions, specialized tracks, workshops, and executive summits, addressing:

Digitalization: The role of AI and automation in the future of air cargo.

Sustainability: Strategies for decarbonization, reducing single-use plastics and ESG reporting.

Risk & Resilience: Navigating geopolitical uncertainty, regulatory shifts, and supply chain disruptions.

Digitalization: The Future of Air Cargo

The strength of e-commerce will represent a growing portion of air cargo business. Currently, e-commerce averages about 20% of cargo business industry wide, but it is expected to grow to at least a third of all cargo shipments. Given that, by 2027, e-commerce is expected to be an $8 trillion market segment, the sector stands to reap a significant reward if it can get its product correct.

The Digitalization Stream at WCS will explore how digital solutions are adapting to meet this demand and reshape the industry. Executives will open discussions with keynotes on implementing digital strategies, followed by a fireside chat on IATA’s Digitalization Leadership Charter, which was established to accelerate and sustain the industry's digital transformation. As of December 2024, 17 organizations had signed on.

In addition, a panel will explore the challenges and opportunities as the industry moves towards its target for the adoption deadline for ONE Record by January 1, 2026—a major milestone in data standardization. Spotlight sessions will highlight the power of data transparency, workflow optimization and AI-driven innovations to enhance efficiency and accuracy.

Sustainability: Building a Greener Air Cargo Industry

Digitalization and sustainability go hand in hand. With half of all air cargo traveling on passenger aircraft, sustainability efforts will significantly impact the industry's environmental goals. Reducing paper usage, optimizing cargo space and minimizing single-use plastics are priorities. Circularity initiatives—such as recycling Unit Load Devices (ULDs) and increasing the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—are critical to reducing air cargo’s carbon footprint.

WCS 2025 will feature:

A keynote on accelerating SAF adoption.

A panel discussion on CO₂ reduction strategies.

Sessions on mitigating supply chain sustainability risks, leveraging data and innovation, and promoting circularity in operations.

A dedicated spotlight on sustainable pharmaceutical logistics, addressing trends, challenges, and best practices.

The day will conclude with real-world case studies, providing actionable insights into enhancing transparency in environmental reporting and social impacts.

Risk & Resilience: Navigating Global Uncertainty

Geopolitical risks remain a wildcard for air cargo. Potential U.S. tariffs could create short-term spikes in demand—just as seen during the 2018–2019 U.S.-China trade war when businesses rushed to move goods before new duties took effect. Recent IATA data suggests a similar pattern, with December air cargo rates from Asia to the U.S. rising 8%.

However, the long-term effects could be more disruptive. Higher costs may weaken demand, drive regional sourcing or push volumes toward ocean freight. Stricter e-commerce regulations, including changes to de minimis exemptions, could further complicate cross-border trade.

At WCS 2025, industry experts will discuss strategies to enhance resilience—from adapting to shifting trade policies and regulatory environments to strengthening supply chain security in an evolving threat landscape.

Workshops

To support the industry’s goals, WCS will also feature workshops on key industry topics, including:

Future Talent: Developing the next generation of air cargo leaders at the Future Air Cargo Executives Summit (FACES).

The Mandate requires greater use of sustainable aviation fuels to secure a growing demand for SAF by: Obligating the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix; and Incentivising SAF supply through the award of tradeable certificates with a cash value.
The percentage of sustainable aviation fuel as a total of UK jet fuel will increase to 22 per cent by 2040.
Gas safety considerations Gas safety is a key safety consideration relating to SAF and is a useful example to explore to better illustrate and understand the challenges involved.
Pathways to sustainable aviation fuel There are three recognised pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel.","The topic of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has been garnering increasing attention over recent years. Currently used as a partial replacement for conventional jet fuel, it is a form of biofuel made from waste products, such as used cooking oil, algae, biowaste and other forms of municipal waste, and which offers significant potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

SAF was brought into sharp focus at the beginning of the year following the introduction of the UK Government’s SAF Mandate, which came into effect on 1 January. The Mandate requires greater use of sustainable aviation fuels to secure a growing demand for SAF by:

Obligating the supply of an increasing amount of SAF in the overall UK aviation fuel mix; and

Incentivising SAF supply through the award of tradeable certificates with a cash value.

Over the coming years, the percentage of SAF as a total of UK jet fuel will steadily increase, starting at two per cent this year, reaching 10 per cent by 2030 and increasing to 22 per cent by 2040. It is hoped that the use of SAF could deliver up to 6.3 mega tonnes of carbon savings per year by 2040.

This is a significant development for UK industry, affecting not just the fuel and aviation sector, but those industries further down the supply chain, such as those involved in the production, processing and storage of biomass and biowaste. In many instances, SAF innovation will rely on novel applications of existing processes, but it will also involve new and lesser-known processes and innovation, leading to a variety of safety challenges across the industry.

The Government’s new Mandate makes it clear that safety standards must not be compromised when introducing new decarbonisation technologies, and this is an important baseline premise.

The importance of safety keeping pace in the broader energy transition is a topic that Dräger has highlighted for some time now, and it applies to many areas of new energy innovation, from SAF and energy from waste to use of hydrogen as a biofuel. Furthermore, ambitious timescales mean that it is all the more imperative that safety is built in at an early stage to ensure the industry gets safety right first time.

Gas safety considerations

Gas safety is a key safety consideration relating to SAF and is a useful example to explore to better illustrate and understand the challenges involved.

It is perhaps inevitable that there will be unknowns and uncertainties in the early stages of new innovations, but in some respects, many of the gas safety considerations related to SAF are not dissimilar to those seen elsewhere in wider industry. For example, good gas detection and monitoring has been a cornerstone of safe operations in industries such as wastewater treatment or chemical processing for decades.

The key difference when it comes to SAF is the combination of new applications, new processes, frequently new people working in an early-stage industry, and the creation of new safety processes and protocols. In emerging industries, it’s vital that the knowledge and experience gained through more established sectors (such as oil and gas or the chemical industries) is borne in mind and applied wisely wherever appropriate.

Pathways to sustainable aviation fuel

There are three recognised pathways to produce sustainable aviation fuel. These are:

1. HEFA (hydro-processed esters and fatty acids), which is a fuel developed from oils or fats, such as used cooking oil.

2. Non–HEFA – which includes several different methods of making advanced fuels from wastes and residues, such as fuel made from municipal solid waste.

3. Power to liquid – this is a relatively new technique which provides a promising and scalable fuel for the future. The process combines carbon dioxide, water and renewable energy to produce SAF with properties that are similar to conventional jet fuel. The three major steps that comprise this pathway are carbon capture, hydrogen production and hydrocarbons synthesis.

HEFA and Non–HEFA

These techniques are the most widely adopted and currently provide the only commercially viable technology, and it is believed that this will enable the UK to reach the first 2030 threshold for SAF.

However, there is a lack of aromatics in HEFA feedstocks. These aromatics are reactive molecules which are needed for maintaining seal compatibility. Fuel-seal compatibility is, unsurprisingly, an important consideration for SAF certification and blending limits so it is not advisable to use more than 50 per cent HEFA SAF to maintain the required fuel characteristics and maintain the long-term health of the aircraft engine.

The production of HEFA SAF involves the hydrotreatment of organic feedstocks, such as vegetable oils, fats and greases, in order to create a fuel that is compatible with existing aviation infrastructure and aircraft technologies.

Megan Hine: ""We are already working closely with companies developing new SAF technologies.""

The good news is that many of the risks are well understood in processing heavy hydrocarbons. The supply chain is sufficiently mature to provide comprehensive safety solutions for application of hydrocarbon substances and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These solutions include flame and gas detection systems, as well as personal protective and detection equipment, such as respiratory protection or personal portable gas monitors.

There will however be changes to how we handle this kind of waste and the touch points in industry. There will need to be consideration given to how much of the waste is processed on the waste generating site, or whether it will be transported, unprocessed, to a different site for the refining process to begin.

If new plant and equipment is installed as part of the process, associated fire and gas detection will need to meet current safety guidelines, such as BS (British Standard) 60080:2020, which may not have existed when the original plant was built.

Meanwhile, non-HEFA technology converts waste material which, as is the case with landfill sites, carries the risk of exposure to methane gas. This technology also relies on the use of biomass waste which has significant fire and explosive gas hazards, as well as hazards from exposure to nitrogen and carbon dioxide. In addition, oxygen depletion in confined spaces is a particular issue with biomass storage.

A further safety concern, which is well known to areas of industry dealing with biomass storage, but potentially not so well known to new market entrants looking at SAF feedstock, are the hazards associated with carbon monoxide.

For example, Hydrotreated Depolymerised Cellulosic Jet Fuel (HDCJ) is one of a number of innovative pathways which are being explored, in addition to the main SAF technologies, in a bid to diversify SAF production. HDCJ uses lignocellulosic biomass (wood residues, crop waste) broken down through pyrolysis, the chemical decomposition of organic (carbon-based) materials through the application of heat, or hydrothermal liquefaction, a process using heat and pressure, to produce bio-oil.

If you have large scale storage of, for example, crop waste or sawmill waste, significant volumes of this feedstock can create a thermal reaction deep within the mound. This heat can be sufficient to begin inefficient combustion of the feedstock, producing carbon monoxide, an acutely toxic gas.

As these examples illustrate, it is important to understand the specific hazards of each SAF process and respond accordingly with the correct safety technology – particularly gas and flame detection technology. Such systems are vital safety considerations in the production of these fuels.

Power to liquid

There have been advances in the use of hydrogen in aviation in recent years, with some promising results on a small scale. Hydrogen tanks are lighter than those required for HEFA and non-HEFA fuels, and the indications are, significantly, that 100 per cent of hydrogen could be used. There is some way to go before this is a reality – particularly for long haul flights – but it is thought that this form of SAF will be easier to scale.

Clearly, the hazards in relation to hydrogen usage are becoming better known as hydrogen technology advances, and there is work being carried out currently at the University of Aberdeen looking at the transport of hydrogen, a research project which Dräger is supporting by advising on the safety aspect. This will look at a wider transport distribution network but the project’s research into structural integrity when in contact with hydrogen and preventing hydrogen leakage will be essential in hydrogen applications, including SAF.

As is the case with all renewable energy, there is a sense of the unknown when it comes to safety. However, providers like ourselves are very experienced in a range of relevant safety issues, such as gas detection, in a wide range of different scenarios and will be able to use our knowledge to address safety in this sector as it develops.

Ensuring the success of SAF is not only about meeting targets; it’s also about embedding safety from the ground up. We are already working closely with companies developing new SAF technologies, and these partnerships will be essential in bridging the gap between innovation and safety, ensuring the industry continues to grow – safely and sustainably – to 2030 and beyond.

As the world grapples with the urgent need for energy transition, fossil fuels remain at the forefront of the global energy supply. Carlos Garibaldi, the executive secretary of the Association of Oil, Gas, and Renewable Energy Companies of Latin America and the Caribbean, or Arpel, emphasized the current stability of oil and natural gas, which are still the most reliable sources of energy.

""When there is no rain, wind or sun, there is still gas,"" Garibaldi said at the International Brazil Energy Meeting, or Ibem, in Bahia state. Garibaldi added the gas and oil industry is taking measures to decarbonize production by electrifying processes, replacing equipment, and containing leaks and burns.

While alternatives depend heavily on critical minerals and are susceptible to weather variation, fossil fuels like gas offer a consistent energy supply, particularly during periods of low renewable energy generation, he said.

S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that demand for gasoline A, or gasoline before the mandatory anhydrous ethanol blend, will rise by 2.17% on the year in 2025, hitting 566,531 b/d, then jump by 3.68% to 587,391 b/d in 2026, according to the Latin America Short-Term Outlook report for refined products.

Demand for diesel A, also unblended, is expected to grow by 1.90% in 2025, reaching 1.19 million b/d, and then increase by 2.01% in 2026, to 1.22 million b/d.

Garibaldi also expressed optimism about the future, advocating for natural gas and nuclear energy as pivotal players in the transition away from oil.

One significant challenge is the lack of coordinated action among Latin American countries to optimize the use of their abundant resources. Brazil, with its energy oversupply and potential for renewable integration, could lead the charge if it strengthens its multi-lateral relationships, according to Thiago Guilherme Ferreira Prado, president of Brazil's Energetic Research Company.

Reliance on S500, S1800 diesel

In Brazil, private refiner Acelen is making strides in sustainable energy by investing in macaúba palm oil to produce sustainable aviation fuel and green diesel. Macaúba is a species of palm native in Latin America, mostly south of Mexico.

Matheus Soares Matos, director at private refineries association Refina Brasil, noted that while the biorefinery project is still in its engineering phases, it aims to position Brazil as a value-added product exporter rather than merely a commodities supplier. This aligns with the regulatory push for biofuels, driven by mandatory fossil fuel-biofuel blends.

Despite these advancements, the Brazilian energy landscape remains heavily reliant on S500 (500 ppm of sulfur) and S1800 (1,800 ppm) diesel for thermal power plants. The recent logistical adjustments to manage fuel supply have led to significant price increases, impacting all fuel consumers.

Seasonal droughts in Brazil, exacerbated by climate change and the El Niño phenomenon, pose additional challenges to energy supply and demand. While Brazil's Aneel national power agency indicates that diesel demand is generally stable, the growing interest in gas and renewable energy sources suggests a potential shift in the energy landscape.

Bruno Stukart, an energy research analyst at the Brazilian government's Energy Research Company, forecasts a decrease in diesel demand as interconnected systems expand, although isolated systems in the Amazon region will continue to rely on thermal power.

Looking ahead, the Brazilian National Gas and Oil Agency has proposed a phased-out plan for S500 and S1800 diesel, aiming to transition to S10 by the end of 2024. Mandelli cautions that the implementation of this plan may not occur as quickly as anticipated, given the need to balance environmental concerns, supply security, and social implications.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-01 17:56:20.236186

By Pablo Cerezal

We’re all familiar with airplanes and seeing them soar through the skies, but we rarely stop to think about how long they last. So, how long is an airplane’s lifespan, and what happens when it reaches the end?

On average, an airplane usually has a service life of between 20 and 25 years. However, some are retired earlier due to issues like corrosion or minor accidents. When operators and manufacturers decide to retire a plane, that’s when the recycling process begins.

Undoubtedly, aircraft recycling is of great importance to boost environmental sustainability. What percentage of material is usually reused?

Aircraft recycling involves two distinct processes. On one hand, there’s dismantling, which focuses on extracting high-value components. This includes the engine, the auxiliary power unit (APU), avionics components (such as electronic communication and navigation systems), and the hydraulic system. Once removed, these parts are either fully reused in other operational airplanes or sold. After dismantling is complete, the next step is recycling the remaining parts of the airplane. In this case, depending on how well the initial separation of materials was done, between 80% and 85% of these components can be recycled.

What is the reason for the remaining percentage not being recycled?

Usually, everything left inside an airplane gets broken down into a mixture of fiberglass, plastic, composite materials and carbon fiber, among others. As we specialize in remote projects, separating these materials is often not feasible for us. Right now, we’re working on creating a unique dismantling and recycling plant in Teruel, which will be the first of its kind in Europe. The aim of this project is to minimize the amount of waste sent to landfills and maximize the percentage of materials that can be recycled.

The decommissioning of aircraft whose service life has ended must be a complex task. From Aviation International Recycling (AIR), where does this process take place and for how long can it last?

So far, we don’t have a fixed base, which is why we’ve specialized in handling decommissioning processes remotely, traveling to wherever the airplane is located. As for the time, that depends on the type of airplane. Obviously there are many types of airplane, but in our business, they are mainly categorized between wide bodies, those with a wide fuselage, and narrow bodies, the most typical being the 320 and 737. A project for a wide body can last, on average, a month and a half for dismantling and a week for cutting. On the other hand, narrow body airplanes require about three to four weeks for dismantling and two to three days for cutting.

What is the most complex stage of the process?

That is definitely removing the heaviest components: the engines. Moreover, they're the most economically valuable, so they must be handled with great care to avoid damaging them. Managing hazardous materials, like fuel and hydraulic oils, is also crucial to prevent any residual contamination.

What are recycled materials typically used for?

During the dismantling process, components are reused in other fleets that are still in service, allowing them to re-enter the aviation sector. When we cut down the airplane, the most abundant material recovered is aluminum. After cleaning and separating it, it’s then sold again to aluminum castings foundries. Then there’s plastic. The plastics used inside airplanes are quite specialized. We’re currently focused on research and development projects to find ways to repurpose them more effectively, separate them more thoroughly and reintegrate them into the production cycle. This aspect of the project is still in the R&D phase.

Can recycling and reusing materials, along with the valuable support of SAF as a key element in decarbonizing the aviation sector, really make a difference in reducing CO2 emissions?

The sector is very aware of the reduction of emissions. SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is a fuel type that contributes to reducing CO2 emissions by up to 90% throughout its entire life cycle compared to traditional kerosene. In addition to using SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), we're developing innovative projects that aim to reduce our carbon footprint. Our customers are increasingly asking their suppliers for certifications that prove their procedures help reduce carbon emissions. It's a very important topic and we need to keep making progress on it moving forward.

AIR is the first company in Europe to achieve AFRA (Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association) certification. Can you explain why this certification is so important?

The Aircraft Fleet Recycling Association (AFRA) is an American organization that leads the world in aircraft recycling standards. When we founded the company 10 years ago, one of our top priorities was to earn AFRA accreditation. Numerous American companies that buy airplanes in Europe actively seek out AFRA-accredited businesses. This certification assures that all procedures adhere to AFRA's regulations and best practice manuals.",http://www.moeveglobal.com/stfls/comercial/IMAGENES/Moeve_ODS_Cabecera_Chico_2048x1640_2025-header.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 15:56:28.255693

The challenge of achieving net zero in aviation

Tom acknowledged that aviation is a ""hard-to-abate"" sector when it comes to carbon emissions. Unlike many industries that can electrify operations, airlines rely on fuel-intensive aircraft that generate substantial emissions.

""When we set our net zero target in 2019, we were the first industry group to do so. It was extremely ambitious, and over the last five years, we’ve been building out what that looks like,"" Tom explained.

British Airways' approach to net zero is based on three key pillars:

Using less fuel – Investing in fuel-efficient aircraft and optimising flight operations to reduce consumption.

Switching to low-carbon fuels – Expanding the use of SAF, which can cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80%.

Carbon removals – Supporting projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere to compensate for remaining emissions.

Tom was clear that while aviation faces major decarbonisation challenges, British Airways is making progress across all three areas.

Sustainable aviation fuel: A key part of the solution

One of the most significant advancements in aviation decarbonisation is the development of SAF.

Tom explained that SAF is made from alternative feedstocks such as used cooking oil or captured carbon, making it a lower-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel.

""You’ve probably already flown on SAF without realising it,"" he noted.

""If you’ve taken a British Airways flight from Heathrow in the last couple of years, a small amount of the fuel used was SAF.""

In 2023, British Airways sourced 1% of its total fuel from SAF, increasing to 2.7% in 2024. The airline aims to reach 10% by 2030, with a longer-term goal of 50–70% SAF by 2050.

""The beauty of SAF is that it’s a ‘drop-in fuel’,"" Tom explained. ""We can blend it with traditional jet fuel, and it works the same way – no need for new engines or infrastructure.""

However, scaling up SAF remains a challenge due to limited supply and high costs. Tom emphasised the importance of government mandates, incentives and corporate partnerships to accelerate adoption.

""A UK government mandate will require 2% of aviation fuel to be SAF from 2025, and similar policies around the world will help create a viable market,"" he said.

Collaboration and supply chain innovation

Tom highlighted the importance of collaboration in British Airways' net zero strategy. Since the airline doesn’t manufacture aircraft or fuel, it relies on working closely with suppliers, governments and corporate partners.

""We’re great at flying planes, but we don’t build them, we don’t refine fuel and we don’t capture carbon,"" he said. ""To succeed, we need to partner with those who do.""

He outlined how British Airways is:

Working with Airbus and Boeing to develop more fuel-efficient aircraft.

Co-investing in SAF production facilities to boost supply.

Collaborating with corporate customers to sponsor SAF, reducing their business travel emissions.

Reducing emissions beyond the skies

While the majority of British Airways’ emissions come from flights, Tom highlighted the airline’s efforts to cut carbon on the ground.

Ground operations: Over 90% of the airline’s Heathrow ground vehicles now run on electric power or biodiesel, reducing emissions by 5,000 tonnes of CO₂ per year.

In-flight sustainability: British Airways has removed 250 tonnes of single-use plastic from its cabins in the past three years.

Customer engagement: The airline provides transparency on flight emissions and offers carbon removal options for environmentally conscious travellers.

""We want to bring customers on this journey without making them feel guilty,"" Tom said. ""Some passengers want to contribute to carbon removals, but most just want to know we’re taking care of it.""",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/6edaf9feef31323b87644402e9241c9e:ff1a19ea6f0c81cec1e45c9ede6f0c1c/maxresdefault.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 11:56:16.017008

Renovating a fleet is always the most efficient way to cut emissions. However, there is much more an airline can do. We discussed the airline’s operations and targets with Remona van der Zon, Director Sustainability.

Economics vs sustainability: where has KLM found its sweet spot?

It is a difficult balance indeed. On one hand, economics remains a vital aspect of any business. We want to keep flying for another 105 years, and this requires a combination of both business and sustainability.

On one hand, basic economics drives the business, simple as that. On the other, sustainability comes at a cost and often impacts all the business aspects. To be able to invest in new projects and initiatives, we must be able to have a stable position as a company. Finding the balance between these two topics is indeed tricky.

Sometimes, though, the two aspects go together, such as fuel consumption reduction, which grants us a sweet spot. The main subject for an airline these days is indeed climate impact, and local debates also involve noise footprint. The big challenge for which we have to find a solution for is the reduction of CO2 emissions, which remains our top priority at the moment.

Is there a part to blame when it comes to air travel emissions?

We all have our share of responsibility, from consumer to company, from government to regulators. For example, the government has the responsibility to steer towards the right direction and ensure that aviation is on the path to a sustainable future. Likewise, the consumer can make an impact with their choices, from bringing lighter items to purchasing SAF in their tickets. There is not a specific part that should be blamed; however, we are all playing the same game, and ultimately, the goal is to improve this industry. And we have a responsibility to invest in new fleet to reduce our CO2 emission, and much more.

Where does KLM stand when it comes to sustainable aviation fuel? Are the international goals feasible, or is it possible to do more?

We are a promotor of having a worldwide culture for sustainable aviation fuel. We have this in Europe now, with Refuel EU, with the target of achieving 2% of SAF use this year, increasing to 6% by 2030. The question is: how much can we go beyond these goals, and how can we achieve that? We will meet the European goals, however, it is not enough, and our ambition is to do more.

We aim to use 10% SAF by 2030. The price gap is an obstacle that we need to overcome, as the production rate is still not enough to satisfy the potential demand and lower the cumulative price of sustainable aviation fuel.

What initiatives have taken place to bring innovation across the day-to-day operations?

The Aviation Challenge is a SkyTeam initiative that came out of a group of KLM colleagues during COVID-19 to stimulate our industry to become more sustainable. It is nice that, after a few editions, we could already appreciate some of the results. For example, regarding fuel consumption, we worked hard to optimise the centre of gravity of our long-haul adventure. This involved a collaboration between multiple departments to create an ideal build-up of cargo loads, optimising the weight distribution.

We tested this work once during The Aviation Challenge, and we have now implemented it across some of our flights, including the long-haul route to Singapore. We are also sharing the results with other airlines for common benefit across the industry. One more innovation is delivered by the optimisation of the aircraft’s initial climb as well as catering options, tailoring our onboard numbers based on data that we collected on different flights.

Single-use plastic is indeed a hot topic these days. How is KLM coping with the use of plastic, and what is being done to minimise on-board waste?

We are complying with European Union regulations. However, sometimes, the use of plastic can be based on the life cycle analysis of different products. In some cases, thanks to the light weight of the material, it is still preferable to employ plastic as opposed to the increased weight of the equivalent. If its lightweight and recyclability allow it to be recycled, plastic can still represent an environmental advantage.

Similarly, one of the most impactful ways to reduce our waste is by enforcing data-driven decisions when it comes to food. Based on passengers' habits, we were able to offer a combination of sandwiches and banana bread. The former is usually consumed first on flights, and the latter allows to be consumed as a backup.

Investing in a new fleet is always the best way to reduce fuel consumption. However, new aerodynamic films are being rolled out, allowing to cut emissions from long-haul flights by up to 1%. Is KLM looking into these options as a potential investment?

We are studying these options carefully because we would like to see everything that can reduce our fuel consumption. AeroSHARK is one of them, and more companies are developing their own products to enter the market. We think it is an amazing technology application. However, as these films are relatively new, there may be concerns regarding their long-term applicability and operations.

We are looking into the potential benefits, as some airlines have been successfully using the drag-reduction technology for a while now. There is also a certification aspect; the Boeing 777 has been proven suitable for the application of drag-reducing coatings, however, there may be more opportunities with other aircraft too.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/67ebfb27756ccac13efa869d_Airways%20Magazine%20Image%20from%20Simone%20Chellini.jpg,N,,2025-04-01 11:56:22.702405

In both projects Saipem also carried out preparatory engineering activities such as feasibility studies and front-end engineering design.

The two contracts are valued about EUR 320 million ($345.4 million), according to Eni.

Eni, through subsidiary Enilive, has a biorefining production capacity of 1.65 million metric tons per annum (MMtpa). Eni aims to raise this to over 5 MMtpa by 2030 as part of its efforts to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050. It also aims to enable 1 MMtpa of SAF production by next year and potentially double that level by the end of the decade.

Earlier this year Eni announced the start of SAF production at its Gela biorefinery, designed to produce up to 400,000 metric tons a year of SAF. Eni said the capacity represents nearly a third of Europe’s SAF demand in 2025.

“Since September 2022, Enilive has signed agreements with several airlines for the supply of SAF, thanks to the initial production achieved through synergies between the Gela Enilive biorefinery and other Eni facilities, using waste-based feedstocks”, Eni said January 22, 2025, announcing the start-up.

The converted Gela refinery in Sicily can process up to 736,000 metric tons of biomass a year, mainly using waste and residual feedstocks such as cooking oil, animal fat and by-products from vegetable oil processing, according to Eni.

“The plants and technologies that we are developing position Enilive as a leader in the production of HVO biofuels and confirm the company’s strategy, distinguished by a strong growth in offering increasingly sustainable products"", Enilive chief executive Stefano Ballista said then. ""Eni started investing in this field over a decade ago and Enilive will be among the first companies in the world to produce significant quantities of SAF”.

Eni is also developing biorefineries in Malaysia and South Korea.

In a landmark move, the UK Government has announced over £20m in funding to accelerate the development of next-generation aviation technology.

Announced by the UK Aviation Minister Mike Kane, this funding aims to break down regulatory barriers, enhance public services, and propel the country toward a greener, more efficient future in air mobility.

Minister Kane explained: “I want the UK to have the most advanced aviation technology ecosystem in the world.

“That means creating a nimble regulatory environment and a culture of innovation so everyone can benefit from cutting-edge transport while tackling emissions, traffic, and potentially saving lives.

“Our investment alongside the new Future of Flight industry group will bring together tech experts, drone operators, flying vehicle manufacturers and local communities to identify where change needs to happen.”

Unlocking barriers to innovation

The funding will help streamline regulations, allowing the aviation sector to embrace futuristic solutions like electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicles and autonomous drones.

These advancements could benefit sectors such as healthcare, law enforcement, and infrastructure maintenance.

In a joint announcement, the Aviation Minister and Science Minister detailed how the Department for Transport (DfT), Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), and the new Regulatory Innovation Office (RIO) will work together to modernise regulatory processes.

By cutting red tape, they aim to make it easier for businesses to innovate while maintaining strict safety standards.

Smarter regulations for faster adoption

To ensure the safe integration of drones and flying taxis into UK airspace, authorities are consulting on new electronic conspicuity standards.

These technologies will allow drones and crewed aircraft to share location data electronically, enabling them to coexist safely.

Additionally, the government plans to simplify airspace regulations, shortening the approval timeline for commercial drone operations to just two years.

Emergency services, including firefighters and paramedics, will also benefit from relaxed regulations, allowing them to deploy drones more efficiently in crisis situations.

Moreover, noise exemption rules for drone trials will be adjusted, making it easier to test these technologies in real-world conditions.

Collaborating for a future-ready industry

To guide the transformation of aviation technology, the government is establishing the Future of Flight industry group.

This coalition will bring together regulators, drone operators, and flying vehicle manufacturers to ensure that new aerial solutions align with economic growth and public sector needs.

The government’s Plan for Change also emphasises sustainable aviation, with a focus on lowering emissions through electrification and automation.

The aim is to create a thriving industry while tackling challenges such as air traffic management and urban congestion.

Potential impacts of flying taxis and commercial drones

The integration of flying taxis and commercial drone services has the potential to revolutionise transportation and logistics.

eVTOL air taxis could provide fast, congestion-free travel within cities, reducing commute times dramatically.

Meanwhile, drones can enhance delivery services, transporting medical supplies, groceries, and packages more efficiently than ground-based transport.

In the long term, widespread adoption of these technologies could lead to a multi-billion-pound industry, creating jobs and boosting local economies.

Additionally, the shift to electric-powered aerial vehicles will contribute to the UK’s net-zero targets by reducing reliance on fossil fuel-powered transport.

Stuart Simpson, CEO of Vertical Aerospace, added: “Flying taxis will transform the way we move – making it quicker, quieter and cleaner to travel while connecting communities and supporting essential services.

“The UK has an incredible opportunity to lead the world in this new era of aviation, delivering not just greener transport but real economic growth and skilled jobs.

“This latest funding is another welcome step towards seeing that ambition realised and our world-leading aircraft flying in British skies from 2028.”

Funding allocation and next steps

To bring these advancements to life, the CAA will receive £16.5m in 2025-2026. This funding will support regulatory frameworks for BVLOS (Beyond Visual Line of Sight) drone flights and the integration of eVTOL taxis.

The CAA will also develop roadmaps for piloted flying taxis, introduce drone pathways for businesses, and consult on uncrewed traffic management systems.

An additional £5m will be allocated to the Future Flight Challenge, supporting industry-led demonstrations and commercial drone and air taxi development.

These trials will be essential for proving the safety and viability of this cutting-edge technology before widespread deployment.

The future of urban air mobility

With government backing and streamlined regulations, the UK is poised to become a global leader in advanced air mobility.

By supporting innovative companies and enabling real-world testing, flying taxis and large-scale drone operations could soon transform everyday transport.

This award-winning technology will be used in WSF’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Teesside, Northeast England.

The project should start operations in 2028. It aims to be the first of its kind in the UK. The facility plans to use biomethane. This feedstock will be processed into syngas. JM’s reforming technology will handle this. The syngas will then feed the JM/bp FT CANS technology. This will produce synthetic crude oil. The oil can be upgraded. It can also be blended to create SAF.

Once operational, the WSF facility has plans. It will produce 14 thousand tonnes of SAF blendstock each year. Teesside is becoming an active location. This is for SAF production in the UK. Teesside International Airport has its own net zero strategy. The strategy sets ambitions. The airport wants to use SAF for net zero flights by 2035. It aims to be the UK’s first net-zero airport.

WSF’s planned development received funding. This funding came from round two of the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund. The project was one of five in Teesside to receive this funding. The fund supports the commercial deployment of fuel production technologies. These technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The reduction will be from the UK aviation industry.

Alberto Giovanzana is a Managing Director at Johnson Matthey. He expressed excitement. He noted that JM is a UK-headquartered company. He is pleased their technology was chosen. It will be part of this innovative UK project. JM has FT CANS development and testing facilities in Teesside. With projects like this in development, the North East appears to be a leader. This leadership is in efforts to meet the UK SAF mandate. He looks forward to working with Willis Sustainable Fuels. The goal is to develop SAF in the region. This collaboration may extend beyond.

Amy Ruddock is a Senior Vice President at Willis Lease Finance Corporation. This is the parent company of WSF. She commented on the partnership. She stated that partnering with Johnson Matthey and other industry leaders is important. It enables meaningful progress. This progress is toward their vision. The vision is connecting the world through sustainable flight.

The funding builds on a $645 million Series C round the Berkeley, California-based company closed in September to construct a sustainable aviation fuel plant in central Washington nicknamed AirPlant One. The facility, which sits on a 14-acre site, is scheduled to open later this year.

“As we continue to work toward a zero-emissions future, this funding reinforces our ability to drive change across supply chains, industries and geographies at scale,” Twelve said in a news release.

Airlines say that sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is the on-ramp for meeting their near-term carbon-reduction goals.

To produce its fuel, Twelve captures carbon from the air, putting it through an electrochemical process and then refining it, according to the company. That differs from how other SAFs are produced, such as by repurposing cooking oils. Twelve says its method, which in part requires less land and water use, is greener and more efficient.

Related coverage

With the latest funding round, Twelve also brought in new investors including Amazon, the Development Bank of Japan, the Japan Hydrogen Fund and Coca-Cola’s sustainability fund.

Twelve was already backed by Microsoft and Alaska Airlines, both of which signed a memorandum of understanding with the startup in 2022 to use the fuel on planes that Microsoft uses for business travel.

Alaska wrote in its latest annual report that it began using ""limited quantities"" of SAF made by other companies on flights from San Francisco and Los Angeles last year.

Twelve is building its facility in Moses Lake following passage of a $1- to $2-per-gallon tax credit by the state Legislature in 2023 for SAF that has “at least 50% less carbon dioxide” than standard jet fuel.

Construction on the plant began in July 2023. CEO Nicholas Flanders said the plant will produce 50,000 gallons of SAF per year. (A Boeing 737 Max 8 can hold 6,820 gallons of fuel.)

Across the country, companies are vying to create and use sustainable aviation fuels to meet climate goals. Critics of SAFs, though, have said producing the fuels requires immense energy and that it will be years before they become widely deployed.

“SAF prices are generally higher than jet fuel prices as the SAF market is still developing,” Alaska said in its annual report. “The demand for SAF within the industry significantly exceeds the current available supply.”

In Washington, Dutch company SkyNRG is building a SAF plant in Walla Walla that’s expected to open in 2029.

Nevertheless, two critical issues require urgent attention from policy makers; (1) enhancing the diversity of feedstocks available for SAF production, and (2) establishing a clear national mandate to accelerate domestic adoption of SAF.","Mr. Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, is advancing Thailand's new economic engines by assigning the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) to collaborate with Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and five leading business organizations to accelerate the promotion of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production. This initiative is driven through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) titled ""Management of Used Cooking Oil for the Production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel in line with the Bio-Circular-Green Economy policy.""

The aim is to establish a collaborative supply chain network for used cooking oil (UCO) as a key feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. This partnership seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, move toward carbon neutrality and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, and elevate Thailand's aviation industry to internationally recognized standards.

Mr. Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, stated that Bangchak had initiated discussions with the Ministry of Industry on potential collaboration to collect used cooking oil from the industrial sector for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The Ministry recognized the importance of this initiative and found it aligned with the policy direction of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who aims to enhance Thailand's global competitiveness and reposition the country as a key economic player on the world stage. This also supports Thailand's ambition to become the aviation hub of the region, creating advantages for domestic producers and service providers while opening new gateways to global trade. As Minister of Industry, Mr. Akanat underscored his commitment to driving the ""Fighting, Saving, Creating"" policy through industrial reform focused on three key areas: overhauling the management of industrial waste and hazardous materials that impact public health, strengthening fair competition for Thai industries - especially SMEs, and developing new, environmentally friendly industries to move the country toward carbon neutrality. This collaboration between the Ministry of Industry, through the Department of Industrial Promotion, and Bangchak Corporation, along with five leading private sector partners, marks the beginning of a comprehensive public-private integration that will benefit the nation across all dimensions.

Dr. Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, stated that the Ministry has developed a framework to promote the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), along with studying potential feedstocks, particularly used cooking oil (UCO), in alignment with Thailand's national fuel management plan. The Ministry is also moving forward in building a collaborative network among industry players while supporting the development of an effective UCO supply chain to serve as a key feedstock for SAF production.

The Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the Ministry of Industry, through the Department of Industrial Promotion, and Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, along with key private sector partners that utilize used cooking oil—namely Central Group, Thai Beverage Public Company Limited, Charoen Pokphand Foods Public Company Limited, Thai President Foods Public Company Limited, and the Thai Food Processors Association. The partnership aims to establish and promote a supply chain network for UCO sourced from both industrial and service sectors, to be used as feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. This effort supports the development of Thailand's aviation industry to meet international standards while reducing environmental impacts from air transport, optimizing resource use, and creating added value from waste materials in alignment with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy policy.

Ms. Natthinya Netyasupha, Director-General of the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM), added that DIPROM has collaborated with internal agencies under the Ministry of Industry to analyze data on SAF demand, production capacity, and potential domestic feedstock supply—such as used cooking oil (UCO), refined palm oil, and sugarcane by-products like molasses. The goal is to identify practical approaches for developing an industrial ecosystem that will effectively support SAF production from locally sourced materials. In the initial phase of the collaboration under this MoU, the focus will be on promoting and supporting the establishment of supply chain mechanisms for UCO collection from both industrial and service sectors. This includes public awareness campaigns, education initiatives, and network-building efforts to enhance understanding and engagement throughout the UCO supply chain, ultimately transforming waste into value-added SAF in line with the BCG model. This initiative also serves as a role model for other sectors, especially households, encouraging proper and safe UCO disposal and utilization. It not only strengthens energy and economic security in Thailand's aviation logistics industry but also contributes to long-term social and environmental sustainability.

Mr. Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group Chief Executive Officer and President of Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited, stated that Bangchak Group has embraced the government's BCG (Bio-Circular-Green) Economy policy and is pleased to see strong support from government agencies and business partners in advancing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) - a key solution to reducing carbon emissions from the aviation industry. With readiness as a pioneer in the production of 100% Neat SAF in Thailand, the Group can produce 1 million liters per day under the globally recognized International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) system, covering the entire value chain from feedstock sourcing and production to distribution. Nevertheless, two critical issues require urgent attention from policy makers; (1) enhancing the diversity of feedstocks available for SAF production, and (2) establishing a clear national mandate to accelerate domestic adoption of SAF. A potential path forward includes setting a minimum SAF blending requirement in aviation, complemented by appropriate incentives and support measures. Such efforts would help build confidence among stakeholders, encourage long-term investment in the SAF ecosystem, and ultimately enhance Thailand's position as a future regional hub for clean energy.",https://www.newswit.com/assets/newswit-32.png,N,,2025-03-31 23:56:47.846815

That number represents an 11% increase from 2023 levels, and figures are expected to grow again this year,” Prince Harry said.
Other major sources of emissions in travel include road transport, hotels, construction, and food and drink, according to the non-profit Sustainable Travel.
A study from the University of Queensland found that travel emissions are growing twice as fast as those in other industries.","Prince Harry has urged the travel industry to cut its carbon emissions by 50% by 2030. In a report released Monday by Travalyst, the sustainable travel initiative he founded, Prince Harry said the sector remains “off track” but has made some progress.

“Last year saw a staggering 1.4 billion international tourist arrivals globally. That number represents an 11% increase from 2023 levels, and figures are expected to grow again this year,” Prince Harry said.

He added in the report that the travel sector should “align behind a set of three core goals focused on climate, nature, and communities.

He said that includes “reducing [travel’s] carbon emissions by 50% by 2030, protecting and restoring at least 30% of the planet, land and sea and promoting truly sustainable tourism that enables a just transition of inclusive economic benefits, reduced inequality, and which preserves local culture and fragile ecosystems.”

“The evidence shows we’re significantly off track,” Prince Harry said in the report.

But he added that more of the world’s biggest travel companies are trying to reduce emissions and come up with solutions.

Travalyst partners with businesses including Amadeus, Booking.com, Expedia, and Google to promote greener travel options and reduce emissions.

Aviation: The Biggest Polluter

Travalyst’s research shows aviation is the travel industry’s biggest emitter, accounting for 52% of total emissions. And with air travel set to grow, so will its environmental impact.

The aviation industry aims to reach net-zero by 2050. The plan? Mainly more efficient engines and greener jet fuel - sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said newer engines could reduce emissions by up to 25%.

The industry believes SAF could reduce emissions by up to 70%, but there are concerns that not enough is being produced to realize those gains.

Boston Consulting Group’s (BCG) recent report showed that fuel producers are falling behind on SAF production.

Executives from some of the biggest airlines including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and British Airways owner IAG, echoed some of these concerns in an aviation meeting last week.

“Realistically, the SAF does not exist. We don’t see it,” said Benjamin Smith, chief executive of Air France-KLM.

Other major sources of emissions in travel include road transport, hotels, construction, and food and drink, according to the non-profit Sustainable Travel.

Many parts of the travel sector have pledged to reduce emissions and achieve net-zero by 2050, including hotels, online travel agents, and technology companies.

Travalyst said its work with Google, Booking.com, and Skyscanner has helped display flight emissions data in 130 billion searches worldwide.

“Millions of data points on sustainability help travellers make informed accommodation choices,” Prince Harry said.

Can the Industry Meet Its Goals?

Research suggests travel emissions are rising faster than almost any other sector.

A study from the University of Queensland found that travel emissions are growing twice as fast as those in other industries.

With just five years until 2030, that 50% reduction goal looks increasingly out of reach.

A Travalyst spokesperson told Skift there’s no single roadmap for cutting emissions in travel and tourism.

“Different sectors and governments have their own approaches based on specific challenges, regulations, and technology,” the spokesperson said. “The 2030 target is a global milestone, not just for travel and tourism. While emissions from travel are projected to rise, the industry is actively working toward a more sustainable future.”

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented, “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.
In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five U.K. airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition.
Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power.
We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.","Farnborough Airport, the Birthplace of British Aviation and Europe’s leading airport for premium air travel connectivity, on March 20 announced that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million liters or 10,000 metric tons per annum of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million liters of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the U.K.

The U.K. and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivizing farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks. SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (hydro processed esters and fatty acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented, “We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery. Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the U.K. Government’s own target of 10% by 2030. What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the U.K.

He went on to comment, “The transition to new fueling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen. Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

This news follows a series of successful milestones in recent years at the Airport. In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five U.K. airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition. Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power. In 2022, for a two-week trial period in the lead up to the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport became the first airport in the world to offer SAF at the same price as standard Jet A1 fuel, after it took a major step in driving the adoption of SAF by offering it to all customers the year prior. Also in 2022, Farnborough Airport made a commitment to be Net Zero by 2030 or sooner for emissions within its control, setting one of the most ambitious targets in the aviation industry.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented, “We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling. Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill.

Thus, while India’s potential capacity for SAF production is significant, multiple interventions are required to realise its potential fully.
Together, we can propel the aviation sector into a new era of sustainability, ensuring that the skies remain a symbol of progress and opportunity for future generations.
Per Deloitte India report, “Green wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revolution in the making,” India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40.
The report indicates that an 8–10 million tonnes production would surpass India's estimated domestic demand of 4.5 million tonnes for a 15 percent blending mandate in 2040 across all flights.","The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) scheme to limit aviation emissions to 85 percent of 2019 levels, necessitating decarbonisation efforts in the sector.

Globally, aviation decarbonisation can be achieved through multiple levers such as operational improvement, hydrogen fuel, electric aircraft, SAF, etc. Operational improvement initiatives, which have helped the aviation sector substantially reduce fuel consumption in the last two decades, can deliver only a limited impact in the future. New technologies such as hydrogen fuel and electric aircraft are still in nascent stages. And the forecast for any meaningful and commercial-scale deployment is only after 2040. As a result, SAF is emerging as a key decarbonisation lever expected to contribute between 53 percent and 66 percent in achieving the net-zero targets for the aviation sector.

India currently accounts for ~2.5 percent of the global ATF demand. Given India’s abundant feedstock for SAF and high exposure to exports for ATF (50 percent of ATF produced being exported), India is well-positioned to capitalise on the rising global demand for SAF. Thus, while India’s potential capacity for SAF production is significant, multiple interventions are required to realise its potential fully. A strategic focus on SAF would strengthen India’s leadership in the aviation sector as it transitions toward more sustainable practices, and concerted efforts are required from all ecosystem stakeholders. This includes establishing a clear and long-term regulatory roadmap, formalising SAF feedstock supply chains, creating ecosystem partnerships, institutionalising financial incentives and transparent pricing mechanisms, and identifying certification agencies to fast-track investments.

We hope this report, compiled through a series of deep conversations with key industry leaders in India and across the globe, presents you with real insights and actionable takeaways. As you explore it, we hope it inspires action and fosters the collective ambition required to navigate the complexities of this journey.

Per Deloitte India report, “Green wings: India’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) revolution in the making,” India could produce 8–10 million tonnes of SAF annually by FY40. Investments worth INR6–7 lakh crore (US$70–85 billion) would be required to realise the projected SAF production. It will give impetus to the aviation sector's decarbonisation efforts, reducing carbon emissions to 20–25 million tonnes annually.

It turns out that the number one factor influencing whether women thrive at work isn’t their mindset — it’s the workplace culture.
When women feel valued and supported, they report they are more engaged, productive and creative.
On average, women thrive in environments where they receive support, feel empowered and are able to share concerns and work through obstacles without fear of judgment.
What thriving really looks like Thriving at work isn’t about pushing harder — it’s about changing the work cultures that make success feel like an uphill battle.","For decades, women have been told that success at work requires grit, resilience and perseverance. The message has been clear: push through, work harder and individual tenacity will eventually pay off. But what if the real key to success isn’t just about surviving adversity alone? What if it’s about changing the workplace itself — so that everyone can thrive?

Our latest research in our Thriving at Work Study challenges the deeply embedded belief that professional success is an individual battle. It turns out that the number one factor influencing whether women thrive at work isn’t their mindset — it’s the workplace culture. Poor communication, ineffective leadership, and lack of transparency are the main barriers to women thriving.

Thriving cultures allow everyone to feel they are doing meaningful work, that they are valued and that they can grow and develop. While thriving might sound aspirational and maybe even unattainable, we have seen that it is not just achievable but a business’s long-term success.

Why thriving matters

We began our research by asking participants at our long-running Simmons Leadership Conference (the vast majority of whom are women) what it means to thrive and how it benefits them and their organizations. Our research shows that thriving at work has clear, measurable benefits. When women feel valued and supported, they report they are more engaged, productive and creative. They stay longer, reducing costly turnover.

A report by Deloitte examines the impact of supportive workplace cultures on women’s engagement and retention and finds that 63% of women who work in inclusive and supportive workplaces say they plan to stay at their company for more than three years. They go above and beyond their job descriptions, driving innovation. Thus, the impact of workplace thriving extends beyond individual employees — it can influence the bottom line.

Thriving levels may be declining

In our latest research study, we launched the Thrive Index to measure reported levels of thriving at work and to understand what the blockers and barriers were to thriving more deeply. We learned that thriving may be on the decline. Our Thrive Index shows a downturn in women’s reported level of thriving between the first and second halves of 2024. In early 2024, our survey respondents rated their workplace thriving at 3.4 out of 5. By the end of the year, that number had dropped to 3.2.

The role of leadership: Fostering open and supportive environments

One of the key factors in enabling women to thrive is excellence in leadership. But what kind of leadership? On average, women thrive in environments where they receive support, feel empowered and are able to share concerns and work through obstacles without fear of judgment. This isn’t about being overly protective — it’s about fostering openness and inclusion in a way that enhances overall team performance and produces value.

What thriving really looks like

Thriving at work isn’t about pushing harder — it’s about changing the work cultures that make success feel like an uphill battle. Our research shows three key factors that determine whether someone thrives at work:

Clear and transparent communication – When employees are left in the dark, they feel undervalued and disconnected. Leaders who communicate openly and frequently create environments where people feel included, engaged and aligned with the mission.

Supportive leadership – Micromanagement, avoidance of tough conversations and favoritism create toxic workplaces. Leaders who check in regularly, provide actionable feedback and invest in their employees’ growth foster thriving cultures.

Sustainable workloads and work-life balance – Success should not come at the cost of burnout. Workplaces that prioritize realistic expectations, respect boundaries and support well-being see higher retention and performance.

Thriving is for everyone

Our research reveals that thriving isn’t a luxury; it’s an organizational imperative. Women are ready to go the extra mile, but they need workplaces that enable them to do it without burning out, breaking down or feeling undervalued.

The real opportunity isn’t just making work better for women. It’s about making it better for everyone. We believe that what our research tells us about what women need in order to thrive — meaningful work, recognition and opportunities for growth — are likely things everyone wants. For example, Gallup’s research in 2024 showed that well-recognized employees are 45% less likely to have turned over after two years. Gallup also found that organizations that have made a strategic investment in employee development report 11% greater profitability. Organizations that invest in ensuring all people managers (regardless of identity) take action to remove barriers and create enablers for all to thrive will reap the most significant rewards.

Advancements in efficiency, sustainability, and performance, among other things, will reinvent the future of commercial aviation.

Nature-Inspired Wing Design: Breaking All Existing Boundaries

Aircraft wings have continuously evolved since the early days of flight, and Airbus aims to push the boundaries even further. The next-generation single-aisle aircraft wing concept offers higher lift, less drag, and improved efficiency by harnessing biomimicry and cutting-edge aerodynamics.

One main feature being considered is a folding wingtip, similar to the one found on the B777X. This could enhance the wingspan during flight while still making it compatible with current airport gates.

This is where the Wing Technology Development Centre in Filton, UK, plays a crucial role in these technologies. The research program, known as the Wing of Tomorrow (WoT), aims not only to investigate new types of aerodynamic configurations but also to devise wing production and assembly technologies that will make tomorrow’s aircraft lighter, stronger, and cheaper to produce.

Next-Gen Propulsion: Open Fan Technology

Propulsion systems have made impressive strides, evolving from yesterday's piston engine to today's fuel-efficient turbofan. Now, Airbus is considering the next step: the open fan engine. Open fan engines feature larger, uncowled blades, allowing for a more efficient airstream than conventional turbofans, which results in lower fuel consumption and emissions.

Airbus is partnering with CFM International on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program, which targets a 20% reduction in fuel burn and CO2 emissions compared to today’s most efficient single-aisle aircraft. By the end of this decade, the company foresees test-flying an open fan engine on its A380 test platform, sealing the right path to a more sustainable aviation future.

Hybrid-Electric, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Integration

Airbus focuses on a hybrid approach to power the next-generation aircraft to achieve more efficiency. Key innovations include:

100% SAF-COMPTIBLE: All future Airbus aircraft will be 100% compatible with still expensive-to-produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80%.

Hybrid-Electric Propulsion: While still at the experimental stage, Airbus is working on systems enabling electricity generated by batteries or fuel cells to support jet fuel, potentially cutting emissions by as much as 5%.

Solid-State Battery Research: Airbus is developing solid-state batteries that are lighter and higher-energy than conventional lithium-ion batteries. These batteries will allow for more efficient taxiing and non-propulsive operations.

EcoPulse demonstrator: A collaboration between Airbus, Daher, and Safran has already gained key knowledge on implementing battery-powered high-voltage systems in commercial aircraft.

New Materials Make Planes Lighter, Stronger

The materials of aircraft have evolved from wood and Aluminium to Carbon-fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and titanium. Airbus is now looking into even more exotic composite options like biomass composites and thermoplastics, which provide lower weight but also higher recyclability and manufacturing times.

This evolution has been foreshadowed by the Multifunctional Fuselage Demonstrator (MFFD), a Clean Sky 2 project led by Airbus. By using CFRTP instead of traditional CFRP, Airbus demonstrated weight savings without penalties, making recycling and production efficient.

Aircraft Commercial Digital Systems

Airbus was the pioneer in digital technology in aviation, the first manufacturer to introduce fly-by-wire on its aircraft in the 1980s. This will replace the next-generation single-aisle aircraft with a fully connected digital fly-by-wire plane to improve safety, efficiency, and automation.

Key features include:

Live Data Processing: Real-time AI-driven processing platforms will enhance predictive maintenance and performance.

Automated Pilot Assistance: This will provide pilots with enhanced operational support, drastically improving safety and precision.

Innovative Ground Operations: The combination of automated ground handling and ground maintenance systems will lead to increased turnaround time efficiency and reduced operational costs

El Mecanismo de Certidumbre de Ingresos (MCI) es una nueva política del Gobierno británico. Su objetivo es acelerar el desarrollo del combustible de aviación sostenible (SAF). El MCR garantiza rendimientos estables a los productores. Esto reduce el riesgo de inversión y fomenta el abandono de los combustibles fósiles. Dado que la aviación se enfrenta a una creciente presión para descarbonizarse, el MCR se convierte en una pieza clave del plan del Reino Unido para alcanzar las emisiones netas cero en los vuelos en 2050.

Para apoyar esta visión, el Gobierno británico está implantando el RCM como parte de su programa más amplio Marco político de las FAS. Al ofrecer estabilidad de mercado a largo plazo, el mecanismo fomenta la inversión privada y permite a los promotores de combustibles limpios ampliar su escala con mayor confianza. En este artículo analizaremos lo que se ha decidido, a quién afecta el mecanismo, cómo y cuándo se aplicará, y cómo se alinea con los esfuerzos más amplios de descarbonización del Reino Unido.

¿Qué se ha decidido sobre el MCR?

En Enero de 2025el Gobierno británico anunció su decisión de aplicar un Modelo de precio de ejercicio garantizado para el MCR. Al igual que el Contratos por diferencia (CfD) modelo utilizado en los mercados de electricidad renovable, este enfoque garantiza que los productores de SAE reciban un precio garantizado por su combustible.

Si los precios de mercado caen por debajo del precio de ejercicio, el MCR cubrirá la diferencia.

Si los precios superan el precio de ejercicio, los productores devolverán el excedente.

Para mantener la sostenibilidad financiera del mecanismo, el Departamento de Transporte (DfT) propuso una tasa variable en marzo de 2025. Los proveedores de combustible de aviación pagarían al fondo. Este fondo protegería a los promotores de FAE de las oscilaciones del mercado y mostraría el apoyo a largo plazo del Gobierno a los combustibles limpios.

¿A quién afectará el mecanismo de ingresos seguros?

El MCR está concebido principalmente para beneficiar a Productores SAFEn particular, las que se enfrentan a costes iniciales elevados y beneficios inciertos. Sin embargo, su impacto se extiende a todo el ecosistema de la aviación:

Proveedores de combustible de aviación contribuirán al fondo a través de la exacción propuesta.

Aerolíneas pueden tener que adaptar sus estrategias de adquisición de combustible a medida que cambien los costes y la disponibilidad.

Inversores y promotores de proyectos obtendrán una mayor visibilidad de los ingresos, lo que hará que los proyectos de FAE sean más atractivos y financiables.

Al reducir el riesgo financiero y garantizar rendimientos previsibles, se espera que el MCR desbloquee importantes inversiones privadas e impulse el crecimiento de las infraestructuras en el sector de las FAE.

¿Cuándo se introducirá el MCR?

El Gobierno británico tiene previsto lanzar el MCR en 2026en línea con su objetivo de tener al menos cinco plantas comerciales de SAE en construcción para 2025-un hito clave en el mandato de las FAE.

He aquí una cronología de alto nivel:

Mediados de 2025: El Gobierno seguirá consultando a las partes interesadas y recabando opiniones del sector.

Finales de 2025: Los funcionarios finalizarán el diseño de la política e introducirán la legislación necesaria.

2026: El Mecanismo de Certidumbre de Ingresos entrará en funcionamiento, proporcionando estabilidad de ingresos a los productores de SAE.

Este planteamiento gradual da tiempo para planificar los proyectos, adaptar la normativa y lograr una participación efectiva de la industria.

Posición del Gobierno británico sobre la MCR

En Ministerio de Transportes ha subrayado que el MCR es crucial para acelerar la inversión en FAE. Según su funcionario Enero de 2025 respuesta:

""Un mecanismo de certidumbre de ingresos es esencial para apoyar el despliegue comercial de las instalaciones de producción de SAE, que a menudo se enfrentan a costes de capital y operativos más elevados en comparación con los combustibles fósiles.""

Esta declaración deja clara la postura del Gobierno. SAF es vital para alcanzar los Estrategia Jet Zeroy el MCR es una forma inteligente, impulsada por el mercado, de aumentar la producción. En lugar de funcionar como una subvención, el mecanismo corrige los desequilibrios del mercado y ayuda a los combustibles limpios a competir con alternativas fósiles más baratas.

Impulso de 63 millones de libras a través del Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados (AFF)

Para seguir apoyando a la industria de las FAE, el Gobierno británico también se comprometió a 63 millones de libras en financiación para 2025/26 a través de la Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados (AFF). Esta iniciativa pretende acelerar el desarrollo de proyectos mediante:

Financiación instalaciones de SAE a escala comercial

En apoyo de tecnologías de producción innovadoras

Proyectos regionales en ámbitos clave como Teesside y Humberside

El FFA contribuye a que los proyectos en fase inicial lleguen a un listo para invertir y cerrar la brecha entre innovación y comercialización. Con ello, no sólo se construye una cadena de suministro de FAE más sólida, sino que también se fomenta desarrollo económico regional y descarbonización industrial.

Por qué el RCM y la AFF son importantes para la aviación sostenible en el Reino Unido

Juntos, los Mecanismo de ingresos seguros y el Fondo de Combustibles Avanzados formar una estrategia global para situar al Reino Unido como líder mundial de la aviación limpia:

En RCM ofrece estabilidad de precios a largo plazo y fomenta la inversión privada en FAE.

En AFF desbloquea la innovación en fase inicial y refuerza la cartera de proyectos del Reino Unido.

En lugar de responder reactivamente a los objetivos climáticos, el Reino Unido está construyendo proactivamente una industria aeronáutica competitiva y preparada para el futuro, basada en la sostenibilidad y la innovación.

One aspect of this is our work to prepare for the Environmental Impact Assessment, says Karl Hauptmeier, CEO of Norsk e-Fuel.
Jyrki Holappa, head of Fortum’s Customer Site Development team, says that cooperation with Norsk e-Fuel began in autumn 2023.
– Our attention was soon drawn to the Rauma Port area, and we recognized that there was potential here, Holappa explains.","Norwegian e-fuel specialist Norsk e-Fuel is planning to expand its operations to Finland. The company – now investing abroad for the first time ever – has reserved a 14-hectare land area in Rauma on the western coast of Finland.

Together with the energy company Fortum and the Port of Rauma, Norsk e-Fuel will now start with electricity grid connection planning and permitting processes to establish an e-Fuel production facility in Rauma.

In cooperation with Fortum and the Port of Rauma, Norsk e-Fuel will begin the planning of the area’s electricity connections and the permit processes for establishing an e-fuel production plant. The project is also the first outside Norway as the company expands its operations in Northern Europe.

By entering into a strategic partnership agreement with Fortum for site development, Norsk e-Fuel has secured sufficient space for an e-Fuel plant with an annual production volume of up to 100 million litres. Most of the product will be refined into synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) to provide fossil-free fuels to the aviation industry.

– We are currently working on the permits and detailed project plans for the project. One aspect of this is our work to prepare for the Environmental Impact Assessment, says Karl Hauptmeier, CEO of Norsk e-Fuel.

Wanted: Sustainable power

According to the CEO, Finland offers a unique combination of advantages for the e-Fuel industry – one of them being power.

– Finland has one of the cleanest grids in Europe and is continuing to have significant investments in new clean power generation. This, in addition to past and planned major investments in the transmission grid, offers great potential for energy-intensive industries, he says.

Hauptmeier notes that it is not only the aspect of power that made the company expand into Finland.

– The potential of approximately 24,4 million tons of bio-based CO2 ready for capture, access to well-developed transportation infrastructure and a strong workforce of highly educated people made the decision easy for us.

Teaming up with Boeing

The Rauma site can play an important role in increasing the supply of eSAF across Europe. EU regulations require aviation fuel suppliers to gradually increase the share of eSAF blended with conventional aviation fuel at EU airports, starting with a blending obligation of 1,2% in 2030 and rising to 35% by 2050. Given the energy-intensive nature of eSAF production, reliable grid connection and availability of clean power are essential.

Boeing and Norsk e-Fuel have just announced that they will start developing aviation fuels together. What’s the significance of this move?

– Boeing’s investment is supporting our entire project pipeline and this includes Rauma, Hauptmeier says.

Targeting performance

Finnish energy company Fortum is committed to promoting Green Transition – and the company has its own unit that helps industry players find suitable plots for their operations. Jyrki Holappa, head of Fortum’s Customer Site Development team, says that cooperation with Norsk e-Fuel began in autumn 2023.

– Our attention was soon drawn to the Rauma Port area, and we recognized that there was potential here, Holappa explains.

The land in question is partly owned by the Port of Rauma. The land is mainly owned by the City of Rauma and leased to the port.

– In order to enable new operations, the plot needs development in terms of both zoning and power issues, but the overall situation is solid, due to the logistical connections offered by the port.

Gas network is crucial

Gasgrid is a very important partner for Fortum.

– Building a hydrogen network is an undertaking with great national significance. Gases are needed in the Green Transition, Holappa says.

Holappa says that, ultimately, Fortum always wants to champion the cause of decarbonization. In terms of regional development, this means a variety of things, from production plants to data centers:

– Our focus is on large, power-intensive projects where we can genuinely help our customers, Holappa concludes.",https://gasgrid.fi/wp-content/uploads/Portrait_Karl-Hauptmeier_2_2022-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 14:56:27.885074

Brazil is poised to play a major role in the global energy transition. The country’s own net-zero transformation presents a $6 trillion opportunity through 2050 – equivalent to 6.6% of the country’s GDP over the same period – and as the host of COP30, Brazil has a chance to help shape the world’s climate agenda while also highlighting the progress it is making on its own climate goals.

The 2025 edition of the Brazil Transition Factbook, produced by BloombergNEF and commissioned by Bloomberg Philanthropies, aims to support policy, business and investment professionals by making available key data about the country’s energy transition. Across eight sectors of the low-carbon economy, the Factbook analyzes the key trends, challenges and opportunities that define Brazil’s energy transition – and considers how the country is positioned to support the world meet its climate targets.

On the one hand, Brazil’s energy transition is well under way. The country has the cleanest electricity generation among Group of 20 members and has seen a significant increase in wind and solar generation in the past few years. Energy storage is expected to take off soon. And after reaching six figures for the first time in 2024, electric vehicle sales are on track for another big bump, as Chinese automakers are planning to set up factories in Brazil later this year.

Yet Brazil’s primary energy demand still relies significantly on fossil fuels, and further electrification will be critical if the country is to meet its net-zero goals.

Beyond its own transition, Brazil could play a key role in helping decarbonize the world by providing biofuels, energy transition metals and nature-based solutions. Sustainable aviation fuel targets now cover 45% of global jet fuel demand, and Brazil’s well-developed biofuels industry could play a role in supplying SAF at competitive prices – although announced projects in the country represent just 2% of total projected supply by 2030.

Brazil’s biomass availability could help build out the country’s green-steel industry as clean hydrogen developers grapple with high costs and low demand. And Brazil is one of the world’s top sources for critical energy transition metals.

It also has one of the most diverse and valuable ecosystems in the world, which means Brazil could lead the way in sustainable agriculture. The country’s corporate regenerative agriculture market is already the second-largest globally, and Brazil possesses the largest potential for nature-based solutions in the world.

To support these transitions, Brazil’s national sustainable taxonomy is expected to be finalized later this year, and carbon markets are likely to play a key role. The country stands at the nexus of domestic and global carbon markets, hosting COP30 – where attendees will try to finalize a worldwide market – just as its own offsets market gets off the ground.",https://assets.bbhub.io/professional/sites/24/3484364292.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 13:56:28.901304

The United Kingdom has raised the bar for emission reductions by submitting its 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) goal to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The new target commits the country to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 81% (excluding shipping and aviation) from 1990 levels by 2035. This bolstered target expands on the prior commitment of a 68% reduction by 2030.

The UK was one of just 12 countries that submitted their updated NDCs to the UNFCCC by the original February 10 deadline. The deadline was subsequently extended to September to allow for inclusion in the NDC Synthesis Report that will be published before the COP in Brazil.

One key element of the UK’s submission is its current stance on Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. While it does not plan to use ITMOs to meet its targets, the UK has left the door open for future engagement. ITMOs provide countries with mechanisms to trade carbon credits authorized and correspondingly adjusted by host nations which can then be used to help meet their own NDCs.

For example, Switzerland has adopted this approach, striking bilateral agreements with Peru, Ghana, Thailand, and others under Article 6.2. These partnerships allow nations to take a cooperative approach to achieving their climate goals by tapping into international emissions reductions. Switzerland’s strategy to gradually reduce its reliance on ITMOs from 2031 onward indicates a maturing framework for their use.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) faces investment hurdles

The push for decarbonizing aviation through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) continues, but recent challenges loom larger than anticipated. US government programs that once bolstered SAF development, such as the SAF Grand Challenge and the 40B blenders’ tax credit, are facing uncertainty. This transition away from the 40B credit to the production-oriented 45Z tax credit has added complexities, directly impacting the path forward for innovative SAF technologies.

Under 45Z, tax credits are linked to carbon intensity (CI) scores. For instance, HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) fuels with lower CI scores receive larger credits, making waste feedstocks particularly advantageous. Technologies like Fischer-Tropsch (FT), derived from biomass feedstocks such as corn stover, are now gaining traction due to their lower CI scores with tax credits ranging up to $1.65 per gallon. Similarly, plant waste like sugarcane bagasse is being tapped to produce SAF within FT processes, with companies initiating pilot projects aimed at full-scale production in the years ahead.

Another emerging technology, power-to-liquids (PTL), holds great promise but faces significant obstacles. PTL could achieve a negative CI score when operational, qualifying for the maximum tax credit of $1.75 per gallon. However, its scalability and the removal of SAF-specific incentives raise concerns about its ability to reach commercial viability. The absence of sustained governmental

backing risks delaying critical advancements, which could impact aviation’s ability to achieve long-term emissions reductions.

Google deepens commitment to carbon removal

Google continues to be one of the leaders in corporate climate action with its large investment in carbon removal credits. For 2024, the company has committed over $100 million, spanning projects like direct air capture (DAC), enhanced rock weathering, biomass carbon sequestration, and biochar production. With nearly 800,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent removals secured to date, Google is making a notable contribution to scaling durable carbon removal solutions.

These investments, which include purchases through carbon demand aggregator Frontier, demonstrate Google’s holistic strategy. For example, biochar and enhanced rock weathering projects contribute towards Google’s portfolio, with scalability and innovation driving down costs for future buyers. Google’s commitment reflects a broader trend among corporations integrating climate innovation into their operations while supporting global net-zero ambitions.

United Airlines seeks scalable DAC initiatives

Through its Sustainable Flight Fund, United Airlines has made its first investment in Direct Air Capture (DAC) through project developer Heirloom. This partnership not only provides funding but also secures United the option to acquire up to 500,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent removals, either for sequestration or as a raw material for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production using power-to-liquid methods.

Heirloom’s technology combines DAC with geological storage to achieve permanent carbon removal. The company currently oversees a 1,000 tCO2 per year DAC facility in California, with the first phase of a larger Louisiana plant capable of capturing up to 17,000 tCO2 per year planned for 2026. A separate facility in Louisiana is set to add a further 100,000 tCO2e year of carbon removals in 2027. This collaboration underlines the growing engagement of the aviation sector with scalable carbon removal technologies to tackle the industry’s residual emissions.

Broader implications for voluntary carbon markets

The landscape of voluntary carbon markets continues to evolve, offering a mix of optimism and challenges. The UK’s ambitious climate targets, advancements in SAF production, and significant private-sector investments highlight the sector’s forward momentum. However, looming uncertainties in policy and funding underscore the challenges still facing the market.

Corporate and governmental collaboration remains critical to addressing gaps in support and scaling the adoption of innovative solutions, from SAF to DAC technologies. Staying informed and proactive is essential for stakeholders aiming to leverage the market’s potential fully.

Voluntary carbon markets are not only a bridge to today’s climate challenges but also a powerful platform for fostering long-term sustainability. By aligning with Fasmarkets latest news, pricing and analysis updates, market participants can better position themselves to capitalize on the opportunities ahead.

Why stay updated on voluntary carbon markets?

Voluntary carbon markets are at the forefront of climate innovation, bridging the gap between corporate sustainability goals and global climate targets.

India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets and slowly, steps are being taken towards using SAF.

Aircraft maker Airbus has been pursuing initiatives for increasing the production and use of SAF, for which the demand is in Europe currently. It has also inked a partnership with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock, there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil (and) municipal solid waste that can be recovered,"" Julien Manhes, head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removal Development Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, told PTI.

During an interaction at Toulouse last week, he asserted that SAF can help in addressing various issues, including pollution.

""In India, for example, the rice straws or the wheat straws that are burnt every year that makes for very bad air quality in Delhi, these could be used as a feedstock for SAF,"" he said.

Among other aspects that can push SAF production, Manhes said were India having a huge petrochemicals industry, a lot of refineries and engineering capabilities.

Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum and they are working on a new way of making SAF. ""We are helping IIP to get the new way of making SAF technically approved... it is a specific partnership in India,"" he said.

He also said that by 2040 or 2050, India could be producing 100 million tonnes of SAF or slightly less.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association estimated SAF production to touch 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion litres) in 2025 and the projection was 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) for 2024.

As SAF is much more expensive than crude oil now, Airbus' Manhes said efforts should be made to ensure that SAF is competitive for which there should be mass scale.

""To reach mass scale, you need policies. The government has to either mandate SAF or support in production of SAF. That is why every country is doing regulatory engineering, finding the best regulatory mechanism that will help the local ecosystems grow.

""In India, there is a lot of work going on at the moment...,"" he noted.

On the current demand for SAF, he said the demand is clearly in Europe now while the production is spread across Europe, China and the US. ""What we are working on is to stimulate demand in other countries.""",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-03-31%2Fgoddq608%2Faircraft-13625861920.jpg?w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-03-31 09:56:31.768361

“Our strong partnership with Boeing has led to this 50-aircraft order for the fuel-efficient Boeing 737-8 aircraft. With this transaction, we have commitments to purchase over 140 of these aircraft, which is the largest Boeing orderbook position in our history,” said Steven Townend, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, BOC Aviation. “This order will enable us to continue providing our airline customers with technologically advanced aircraft for their future fleet growth.”

With single-aisle jets projected to account for 75% of global deliveries over the next 20 years, lessors are looking to build their order books to support airlines’ fleet growth plans and replace less-efficient older jets. To date, lessors have ordered more than 1,200 737 MAX jets as they seek to replace up to 300 Next-Generation 737s per year that are set to retire from passenger operations by the end of the decade.

“BOC Aviation’s latest investment in the 737-8 demonstrates the confidence lessors have in this airplane to meet continued air travel demand and improve fuel efficiency,” said Brad McMullen, Boeing senior vice president of Commercial Sales and Marketing. “The 737-8 is much sought after by airlines due to its unmatched versatility, generating significant operational savings because of lower fuel consumption.”

The 737-8, seating 162 to 210 passengers depending on configuration and with a range of up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,480 km), is the market’s most versatile single-aisle airplane, capable of operating profitably on short- and medium-haul routes.

BOC Aviation orders 70 A320neo family aircraft

BOC Aviation also announced it has placed a firm order with Airbus for an additional 70 A320neo family aircraft. With this order, BOC Aviation’s backlog of aircraft to be delivered becomes the largest in its history with Airbus.

“This transaction will lift our remaining Airbus orderbook to around 200 aircraft and takes our total Airbus aircraft deliveries to over 700 (including purchase and leasebacks) since our first order in 1996,” said Steven Townend, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, BOC Aviation. “This order solidifies our position as one of the top five global aircraft operating lessors and provides us with a strong delivery pipeline into the next decade. We look forward to providing more airline customers with this popular fuel-efficient and technologically advanced aircraft.”

Benoit de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business said, “This new major order by BOC Aviation, is a testament to its enduring confidence in the A320 family – the world’s most successful single-aisle aircraft. This significant investment makes BOC Aviation one of the largest Airbus customers and highlights the strong and continued market demand for our fuel-efficient aircraft and their long-term value. The A320 family delivers exceptional benefits to operators, and we look forward to continuing our collaboration with BOC Aviation, providing airlines with cutting-edge fleet solutions.“

The A320 Family is the world’s most popular single aisle aircraft having won more than 19,000 orders globally. The Family includes the largest member, the A321neo offering unparalleled range and performance. The Family offers at least 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft, while maximising passenger comfort with one of the widest single-aisle cabins in the sky. The A320 Family can operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today and up to 100% by 2030.",https://asianaviation.com/wp-content/uploads/BOC-Aviation_737_8_Boeing-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 09:56:41.012021

“Western Australia is globally recognised for its strength in natural resources and its growing leadership in innovation and technology,” stated Asia Pacific chair Neeraj Aggarwal. “Our new office reflects BCG’s deepening commitment to the state.”

Aggarwal noted that the new, larger state-of-the-art office would also support an expansion of the firm’s suite of services to the local market, including cutting-edge technologies via its BCG X division, with the further aim of positioning Perth as a ‘destination office’ to attract both new talent and current BCG professionals from around the world.

After originally setting up shop in 2011, BCG currently has five managing directors and partners stationed in Perth, including office leader and original member Matthew Leach, with the local team predominantly focused on the state’s resources and mining sectors and serving large global players such as Rio Tinto and BHP.

Amusingly, that first office in 2011, staffed by a small team of imports from Sydney, Melbourne, NZ, and Germany, had a capacity for just fifteen people, before the firm almost immediately won a major mining contract and had to bring in an additional 80-plus professionals to support the project, prompting its shift to its last St Georges Terrace address back in 2013.

NEW YORK, March 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- New York's Department of Citywide Administrative Services (DCAS) has awarded its first tender to buy renewable diesel for its ferries. The tender is part of a plan announced in October 2024 to transition the Staten Island Ferry and other vessels to renewable diesel. DCAS is basing its tender — for barge delivery — on the New York Harbor R99 price published by global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus. Adopting renewable diesel is part of the DCAS plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the New York City Ferry service.

Renewable diesel (R99) is a biofuel that acts as a drop-in replacement for petroleum diesel with no requirement for engine modifications. Use of the fuel has grown in the US, spurred by environmental policy. California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard has driven big investments in renewable diesel production, and two major refineries in the state, P66 Rodeo and the Martinez renewables project refinery, a joint venture between Neste and Marathon, have switched from making petroleum diesel to renewable diesel. Companies have also invested in expanding renewable diesel capacity in the US Gulf coast.

DCAS, the NYC Department of Transportation, the NYC Department of Environmental Protection and NYC Parks have already begun testing the use of renewable diesel in vessels. The barge contract will enable the transition to long-term and large-scale renewable diesel use for City vessels.

Argus publishes comprehensive coverage of the renewable diesel market, including price assessments for markets in California and the US Gulf coast.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""We developed our renewable diesel prices in close consultation with buyers and sellers to provide essential transparency around market value in this evolving space. We are delighted that DCAS is using our price for its ferry fleet transition program.""

DCAS Deputy Commissioner and NYC Chief Fleet Officer Keith Kerman said: ""We have already moved all our heavy-duty and off-road vehicles to renewable diesel, making us the first major East Coast city to adopt green technology on such a large scale. As announced by the City in October 2024, step two is to move NYC's ferries and vessels to this more environmentally friendly fuel. DCAS contracts with Argus for fuel market information and Argus has now provided us with a new resource to compare renewable with conventional fuel pricing in our contracts.""

Argus' R99 prices are published daily in the Argus Americas Biofuels report. R99 is the most traded grade of renewable diesel in key US spot markets, reflecting volume priced without tax credits or government mandates.

Argus is the leading provider of renewable fuel indexes and benchmarks for renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and for the key feedstock used cooking oil across the globe. Its indexes are used as the settlement basis for futures contracts in the US, Europe and Asia.

European Union

The Council of the EU has approved the so-called ""stop the clock"" directive which forms part of the European Commission's proposed EU Omnibus Package. The directive postpones by two years the application of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) for large companies that have not yet started reporting, and by one year the transposition deadline and first phase of application (covering the largest companies) of the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).

A vote for the ""stop the clock"" proposals has been scheduled by the European Parliament for 1 April. Parliament remains divided, however, with various political groups expressing differing views on the proposal. The proposals will only enter into force once the Parliament and Council have reached an agreement on the final version of the text.

The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG), which has been mandated by the Commission to prepare the EU sustainability reporting standards (ESRS) that companies will need to apply when they report under CSRD, has undertaken a mapping exercise with the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a widely adopted voluntary environmental disclosure platform. The exercise allows companies that apply ESRS 1 to be better equipped to complete CDP disclosures and companies disclosing through the CDP platform to prepare for CSRD reporting.

The Commission has published an action plan for the European automotive industry, including a relaxation of the CO2 standards regulation, which would have resulted in significant fines for carmakers that had not met their targets for electric vehicle take up. The amendment will allow carmakers to meet their compliance targets over a three-year period (2025-2027) rather than on an annual compliance cycle. The overall target for a 100% reduction in CO2 emissions from new cars and vans registered in the EU from 2035 remains.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and Prudential Regulation Authority have dropped proposed rules and expectations aimed at improving diversity and inclusion in regulated firms in response to ""the broad range of feedback received, expected legislative developments and to avoid additional burdens on firms at this time"" (see below for the expected legislative developments mentioned). The rules had been the subject of consultation in 2023 and had been anticipated for some time. The FCA will be setting out its next steps on tackling non-financial misconduct by the end of June this year.

As part of its proposed draft Equality (Race and Disability) Bill, the government has opened a consultation to seek views on how to implement mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting for large employers (more than 250 employees) in Great Britain, with changes likely to be implemented in 2026. At present, employers with more than 250 employees are only under a statutory duty to report on their gender pay gaps.

The Home Office has updated its statutory guidance on transparency in supply chains under section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015.

Section 54 obligates businesses with an annual turnover of £36 million or more that supply goods or services and conduct business in the UK to publish an annual slavery and human trafficking statement. The updated guidance outlines how businesses should comply with both the letter and ""spirit"" of the law, and goes into a lot more detail on what the ""spirit"" means.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer.","Synopsis

India has great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) using available biomass waste and feedstocks like rice and wheat straws. Airbus is working with the Indian Institute of Petroleum to develop new SAF production methods. Policies and government support are vital for scaling production and making SAF more cost-competitive.

India has many attributes to become a great producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel, which can help reduce pollution, as rice and wheat straws can also be used as a feedstock for SAF, according to a senior Airbus official. India is one of the world's fastest growing aviation markets and slowly, steps are being taken towards using SAF.

Aircraft maker Airbus has been pursuing initiatives for increasing the production and use of SAF, for which the demand is in Europe currently. It has also inked a partnership with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP), Dehradun.

""India has a lot of attributes to become a great SAF producer. The first one is the availability of feedstock, there is a lot of biomass waste, used cooking oil (and) municipal solid waste that can be recovered,"" Julien Manhes, Head of SAF and CDR (Carbon Dioxide Removal) Development Sustainability Organisation at Airbus, told PTI.

During an interaction at Toulouse last week, he asserted that SAF can help in addressing various issues, including pollution.

""In India, for example, the rice straws or the wheat straws that are burnt every year that makes for very bad air quality in Delhi, these could be used as a feedstock for SAF,"" he said.

Live Events

Among other aspects that can push SAF production, Manhes said India also has a huge petrochemicals industry, a lot of refineries and engineering capabilities.

Airbus has partnered with the Indian Institute of Petroleum (IIP) and they are working on a new way of making SAF. ""...we are helping IIP to get the new way of making SAF technically approved... it is a specific partnership in India,"" he said.

He also said that by 2040 or 2050, India could be producing 100 million tonnes of SAF or slightly less.

In December 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimated SAF production to touch 2.1 million tonnes (2.7 billion litres) in 2025 and the projection was 1 million tonnes (1.3 billion litres) for 2024.

IATA represents around 340 airlines, including Indian carriers, that account for more than 80 per cent of the global air traffic.

As SAF is much more expensive than crude oil now, Airbus' Manhes said efforts should be made to ensure that SAF is competitive for which there should be mass scale.

""To reach mass scale, you need policies. The government has to either mandate SAF or support in production of SAF. That is why every country is doing regulatory engineering, finding the best regulatory mechanism that will help the local ecosystems grow.

""In India, there is a lot of work going on at the moment...,"" he noted.

On the current demand for SAF, he said the demand is clearly in Europe now while the production is spread across Europe, China and the US. ""What we are working on is to stimulate demand in other countries"".

Last week, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury told PTI that SAF, which can help reduce carbon emissions, provides an opportunity for India, where sustainability is high on the agenda.

Delta says JetZero’s vastly more fuel-efficient, blended-wing-body (BWB) design is one facet of its ongoing journey to advance industry innovation, reduce cost through increased fuel savings, elevate the customer experience and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Delta’s formal partnership with JetZero comes after the startup received a $235M grant from the US Air Force in 2023 to help facilitate building a full-scale demonstrator for first flight in 2027. Delta’s operational expertise will play a crucial role in development.

“Working with JetZero to realize an entirely new airframe and experience for customers and employees is bold and important work to advance the airline industry’s fuel saving initiatives and innovation goals,” said Amelia DeLuca, Delta’s Chief Sustainability Officer. “While Delta is focused on doing what we can today to address our carbon footprint, it’s critical we also work with a variety of partners to advance revolutionary technologies, like JetZero’s blended-wing-body aircraft, to solve for a significant portion of future aviation emissions.”

The partnership with JetZero — the newest member of Delta’s Sustainable Skies Lab — marks Delta’s fourth “revolutionary fleet” partnership outlined in its Sustainability Roadmap, launched in 2023, by which it aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

“JetZero is working to change the world by bringing to market an aircraft that aims to fly this decade and make immediate and marked progress toward reducing airline energy costs, and the associated emissions,” said JetZero cofounder and CEO Tom O’Leary. “The ability to realize such significant efficiency gains in the near future meaningfully impacts the industry’s commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and will serve as the foundation on which other technologies and efficiencies can be realized. Delta was one of the first carriers to partner with us, supporting us behind the scenes since 2023, and we look forward to their continued support of our program through their deep knowledge and expertise.”

The evolution of the blended wing body

The BWB’s biomimetic design, inspired by the manta ray, is among a growing group of nature-derived innovations that are helping to optimize aircraft design for sustainability and efficiency. First tested and demonstrated in the 1990s by NASA and Stanford University, BWB aircraft could achieve a 50 percent reduction in fuel consumption and emissions compared to current commercial jets — thanks to its markedly lighter weight, which creates less drag.

Other anticipated traveler and sustainability benefits include:

Capacity to carry more than 250 customers — similar to existing, widebody aircraft — to provide the capacity and range needed to meet growing travel demand.

Less noise — with engines mounted on top of the aircraft, BWB aircraft are expected to be significantly quieter than existing aircraft.

The potential to fit into existing airport infrastructure and offer faster turn-around times.

The ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to further decrease lifecycle carbon emissions.

Delta will also help design a new interior experience for the BWB’s uniquely shaped frame to ensure a best-in-class customer and employee experience.

These partners, which generate large volumes of UCO in both industrial and service sectors, will contribute to the supply chain supporting SAF production at scale.
Ms Natthinya Netyasupha, Director-General of DIPROM, explained that her department has collaborated with internal agencies to study SAF demand, production capacity, and feedstock availability.
“These steps are essential to building confidence, attracting long-term investment, and reinforcing Thailand’s leadership in clean aviation fuel within the region,” he added.","The Department of Industrial Promotion (DIPROM) has partnered with Bangchak Corporation Public Company Limited and five leading business organisations to accelerate the development of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Thailand. This public-private collaboration is driven by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the “Management of Used Cooking Oil (UCO) for the Production of SAF in Line with the Bio-Circular-Green (BCG) Economy Policy.”

The initiative aims to establish a nationwide UCO supply chain as a key feedstock for commercial-scale SAF production. By promoting a circular economy approach, the collaboration supports Thailand’s push toward carbon neutrality, enhances energy security, and boosts the country’s aviation sector to meet international sustainability standards.

Mr Akanat Promphan, Minister of Industry, emphasised that the move aligns with the government's policy direction under Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, aimed at positioning Thailand as a key economic player and aviation hub in the region. The SAF initiative also supports the Ministry’s “Fighting, Saving, Creating” policy, which focuses on waste management reform, SME competitiveness, and development of green industries to meet net-zero goals.

“This MoU marks the beginning of comprehensive public-private integration that will benefit the nation across economic, environmental, and social dimensions,” said Mr Akanat.

Dr Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, noted that the ministry has developed a framework for promoting SAF production and assessing UCO’s potential as a domestic feedstock. It is also working to build a collaborative industrial network to strengthen the SAF ecosystem.

The MoU was signed by DIPROM, Bangchak, and five key partners: Central Group, Thai Beverage PCL, Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, Thai President Foods PCL, and the Thai Food Processors Association. These partners, which generate large volumes of UCO in both industrial and service sectors, will contribute to the supply chain supporting SAF production at scale.

Ms Natthinya Netyasupha, Director-General of DIPROM, explained that her department has collaborated with internal agencies to study SAF demand, production capacity, and feedstock availability. The initiative will promote public awareness, education, and supply chain network-building to transform UCO into value-added SAF. It also aims to set a precedent for UCO collection in households, supporting long-term sustainability in both energy and waste management.

Mr Chaiwat Kovavisarach, Group CEO and President of Bangchak Corporation PCL, said the Group is ready to support Thailand’s SAF ambitions with its ability to produce 1 million litres of 100% Neat SAF per day, certified under the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) scheme.

While welcoming government and private sector support, Mr Chaiwat identified two urgent issues for policy makers:

Expanding feedstock diversity to support SAF production; and

Establishing a clear national mandate for SAF usage, including blending targets and investment incentives.

“These steps are essential to building confidence, attracting long-term investment, and reinforcing Thailand’s leadership in clean aviation fuel within the region,” he added.

Speaking at the 2025 Airbus Summit, the company solidified its commitment to introduce a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft to the market, putting forward a number of key technological building blocks it plans to utilise in enabling its introduction.

Said technologies include a set of four, 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines driven by a fuel cell system converting hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy.

The technology, which Airbus states will be refined over the coming years, would be supplied to a prospective hydrogen aircraft via two liquid hydrogen tanks.

Airbus Head of Future Programmes, Bruno Fichefeux says, said:

Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we've adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering.

Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, Glenn Llewellyn, adds:

Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology.

In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.

Airbus first demonstrated its 1.2MW hydrogen-propulsion system in 2023, with subsequent end-to-end testing of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and heat exchangers taking place throughout 2024.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF,"" Willie says.","Right now, the scaling of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is one of the aerospace sector's topmost priorities.

However, it is also one of the industry's biggest problems.

While SAF is being used by airlines in 2025, the amount available is nowhere close to the amount required to sustain air travel at its current rate.

At the end of 2024, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) found that SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production worldwide.

“SAF volumes are increasing, but disappointingly slowly,” says Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA.

Clearly, the production of SAF needs to accelerate, and soon.

That is why IATA has announced the creation of a new body to manage the future of SAF production globally.

The Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) is an independent organisation and its main function will be to manage the SAF Registry, a group established during COP28 to promote the scaling of SAF across the sector.

Based in Montreal, CADO will be tasked with managing the registry with an open and global approach to ensure transparency and trust among stakeholders.

“CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry,"" says Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist.

""Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.”

Ensuring transparency and market liquidity

The SAF Registry is designed to be a critical piece of infrastructure in the aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts.

By creating a standardised and transparent system for tracking SAF transactions, the registry aims to facilitate the growth of a global SAF market.

Airlines, corporate customers and regulatory bodies will be able to verify the environmental benefits of SAF and claim them under compliance or voluntary emissions reduction schemes.

One of the primary challenges in scaling up SAF adoption is its limited supply, with production sites concentrated in specific regions.

The SAF Registry aims to bridge this gap by linking airlines with SAF producers, suppliers and investors, regardless of geographical barriers.

Additionally, corporate customers will be able to participate in emissions reductions within the aviation sector and contribute to co-financing decarbonisation efforts.

""The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF,"" Willie says.

“There is broad interest in monetizing waste streams.” Significant demand is forecast for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from waste fats and oils.
For example, cement kilns and asphalt plants are buyers of any high-BTU (British Thermal Units) fuels.
Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) reached completion on new SAF production last October at their Diamond Green Diesel joint-venture in Port Arthur, Texas.
The conventional market for UMO has been fuel for ships or power plants, which has high carbon emissions.","Energy transition is creating M&A opportunities in green fuels and lubricants. Margins can be captured upgrading waste streams to reuse, supplemented by a range of environmental and tax credits to be harvested or traded. Rollup and consolidation opportunities are appearing, but logistics and commodity prices remain headwinds.

“The waste-to-value environmental services sector is open to capital deployment or M&A,” says Effram Kaplan, head of the infrastructure and environmental practice at Brown Gibbons Lang. “There is broad interest in monetizing waste streams.”

Significant demand is forecast for biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), made from waste fats and oils. Domestic SAF production volume was small until two big public refiners added capacity last year. Another PE-backed development is diverting used motor oil from the power and ship-fuel market to re-refine and reuse.

“The new administration will have an effect that might not be obvious,” suggests Kaplan. “Given the view of subsidies in general, there will be challenges for some forms of alternative energy, but others are very viable without subsidies. For example, cement kilns and asphalt plants are buyers of any high-BTU (British Thermal Units) fuels. So certain green fuels will do well.”

Kaplan notes that waste processors — including GFL Environmental; VLS Environmental, owned by I Squared Capital; and Reworld, owned by EQT Group — blend waste oils and fats with high-BTU solid waste, such as from construction and demolition.

“There are evolving opportunities to protect volumes and monetize waste streams,” he adds, “starting with the expansion of services and collection, and deploying processing technologies. That enhances both conservation and margins. Once you sort the stream into hazardous and non-hazardous, solids and liquids, the opportunities become abundant to pursue M&A and consolidation.”

Early in January GFL struck an $8 billion deal to sell its environmental services business to Apollo (NYSE: APO). BGL was among several advisors on the complex transaction.

Specific to biofuels, there is increasing interest, says JP Hanson, global head of oil and gas at Houlihan Lokey (NYSE: HLI), but so far it is still early in terms of ability to demonstrate scale. “We’ve been hit up with proposals to raise capital for brownfield-into-green-fuels developments at about 30 refineries globally, but economic margins and timeframe to generate consistent cash flows still don’t compete with traditional crude refining margins so as to justify full-scale conversion.”

Of all the green fuels and lubricants, SAF has the most promise for broad application and cashflow generation. “It’s still a relatively small scale, fragmented sub-industry but is a growing market with real demand,” says Hanson. “Jet-A production is limited, so the most meaningful way to meet that increase in demand will be with SAF. Ultimately, SAF could end up being as much as 60 percent of aviation fuel volume.”

Hanson notes that strategics “are not getting out of the traditional refining sector, so we do not foresee a big wave of existing refineries to convert or otherwise repurpose to biofuels. In my experience, the backers of biofuel projects that are getting support to scale up are smart engineers, but so far those opportunities are mostly bespoke situations.”

The global demand for Jet-A, the most common type of aviation fuel, is expected to double, roughly from about 330 millions gallons (8 million barrels) per day today to about 630 million gallons a day (15 million barrels) by 2050.

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, there were only two small SAF producers this time last year, World Energy in Paramount, Calif. and Montana Renewables in Great Falls.

Last June Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) completed the reconfiguration of its Rodeo complex in the San Francisco Bay Area to produce biodiesel and SAF. Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and Darling Ingredients (NYSE: DAR) reached completion on new SAF production last October at their Diamond Green Diesel joint-venture in Port Arthur, Texas. Aemetis received a $200 million federal investment last March for its SAF, renewable natural gas, and carbon sequestration projects.

Separately, the Braya Renewable Fuels, backed by Cresta Fund Management, reached 18,000 b/d of biodiesel production at its reconfigured refinery in Newfoundland, Canada. Plans call for an expansion to 40,000 b/d of biodiesel and SAF.

In a public-private collaboration, Blue Tide Environmental recycles used motor oil (UMO) to produce high-quality base oils at its Baytown, Texas facility. It is in the process of starting its hydrotreater starting with an initial capacity of 5,000 barrels a day. Blue Tide is a portfolio company of Tailwater Capital, and is partly owned by Pennzoil Quaker State, a subsidiary of Shell (NYSE: SHEL).

“Our ability to deploy this process internationally is one of the reasons Shell was excited about the platform,” says David Cecere, partner of Tailwater, and board member of Blue Tide. “It is an all-new facility on a brownfield site. Re-refining has been around for many years, and there are well-established processes for collecting UMO and using a hydrotreater to recycle base oils, so there is not any significant technology risk.”

The key, Cecere adds, “is finding a location where there is a large volume of UMO, as well as access to water transportation and storage assets. We have all those at Cedar Bayou, which connects us to the Houston Ship Channel.”

Looking ahead to replicating the Blue Tide model, Cecere says that land and logistics are paramount. “We are looking at where there are large volumes of high-quality UMO being burned, where there is a logistics network, and where there is demand for base oils. It is a low-risk model with attractive economics.”

Some of the attractive economics is due to the low cost of raw materials. The conventional market for UMO has been fuel for ships or power plants, which has high carbon emissions. “That is a terrible outcome for the environment,” says Cecere. “The marginal demand for UMO continues to be for BTU value, so the key for us is to create additional profit margin by detaching UMO from the energy market in favor of the value-added lubricants market, which has the added benefit of reducing carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.”

In addition to that demand pull, there is also a supply push making raw materials more available. “UMO is high in sulfur,” Cecere explains, “and as a result of the International Maritime Organization’s 2020 rules strictly limiting sulfur in marine fuels, demand for UMO and high-sulfur fuel oil has declined so there is excess supply.”",https://www.themiddlemarket.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iStock-1334432110-1024x475.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 07:56:26.419642

Travel industry analysts reported on March 30, 2025, that BOC Aviation had significantly expanded its Boeing aircraft order book, placing a firm order for 50 Boeing 737-8 jets. The deal, announced from Seattle, was expected to ripple across the aviation and travel sectors, with far-reaching implications for airline networks, flight connectivity, and the future of sustainable air travel.

The purchase increased BOC Aviation’s Boeing backlog to 139 unfilled orders, marking the company’s largest commitment to Boeing aircraft to date. This strategic acquisition placed the Singapore-based lessor in a strong position to support international airlines with next-generation single-aisle jets as global passenger demand continues to rebound and surpass pre-pandemic levels.

Strengthening the Backbone of Global Tourism Recovery

With over 69 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft already in operation, leased to more than 15 airlines worldwide, BOC Aviation was seen as a pivotal enabler in the post-COVID aviation recovery, offering flexible leasing options to airlines that need to modernize their fleets swiftly to meet demand across both established and emerging travel corridors.

As travel rebounds in markets across Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East, airlines were reportedly in urgent need of aircraft that deliver higher fuel efficiency, longer range, and lower emissions—all features offered by the Boeing 737-8 model. The ability to cover short- and medium-haul routes more economically makes these aircraft attractive not only to major carriers but also to regional and low-cost airlines supporting tourism growth in secondary and underserved markets.

Air Travel Demand Soars Amid Fleet Modernization

Aviation experts have noted that single-aisle jets like the 737-8 are expected to account for 75% of global aircraft deliveries over the next two decades. The announcement from BOC Aviation validated this forecast and demonstrated how lessors are positioning themselves as crucial players in facilitating airline fleet expansion and sustainability transitions.

The new order was also part of a broader industry trend to retire aging Next-Generation 737s, which are less efficient and more expensive to operate. Boeing estimates that up to 300 such aircraft will retire annually by decade’s end, opening up major opportunities for replacements that align with sustainability goals.

BOC Aviation’s Strategic Move and Industry Confidence

Steven Townend, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of BOC Aviation, emphasized that the deal with Boeing reflected the company’s confidence in the aircraft type and its relevance to the future of air travel. He said that BOC Aviation now had commitments to over 140 Boeing 737-8s, underlining it as their largest Boeing orderbook in history.

Townend added that the agreement would allow BOC Aviation to continue equipping its partner airlines with technologically advanced aircraft, reinforcing their ability to scale operations, reduce carbon footprints, and offer affordable travel options to a global audience of flyers.

Tourism Industry Impact: What This Means for Global Travelers

From a tourism perspective, the expansion of BOC Aviation’s 737 MAX fleet could significantly influence airfares, flight frequency, and route availability—particularly in regions where tourism growth is fueling demand for reliable, lower-cost flights.

Increased availability of fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 737-8 will allow airlines to:

Launch or restore routes to mid-sized tourism destinations

Increase frequency on popular tourist routes (e.g., intra-Europe, intra-Asia, transcontinental U.S.)

Improve connectivity between secondary cities and major travel hubs

Offer lower fares due to savings on fuel and operational costs

This is expected to encourage tourists, digital nomads, students, and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travelers to explore new destinations, while also empowering national tourism boards and destination marketing organizations to promote air-linked travel packages more confidently.

Boeing’s Role in Fueling the Next Era of Global Travel

Commenting on the deal, Brad McMullen, Boeing’s Senior Vice President of Commercial Sales and Marketing, highlighted the significance of the 737-8 in the eyes of lessors and airlines. He stated that the aircraft’s versatility and fuel efficiency continue to drive its popularity among fleet planners seeking to meet the surging global travel demand.

The 737-8, which can accommodate 162 to 210 passengers depending on its configuration and fly up to 3,500 nautical miles (6,480 km), has become a preferred choice for operating profitable routes across diverse network structures, from regional tourism circuits to international short-haul services.

As a result, airlines worldwide—including those in tourism-heavy economies—are likely to use the 737-8 to enhance connectivity while aligning with environmental goals and improving traveler experience.

BOC Aviation’s Expanded Orderbook: A Strategic Global Asset

With this new order, BOC Aviation’s total portfolio of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft now reaches 215 units, positioning the company as a top-tier supplier for global airlines seeking leasing solutions amid rapid traffic recovery.

Industry insiders have observed that aircraft leasing companies like BOC Aviation are increasingly shaping travel accessibility. By reducing the capital investment barrier for airlines, lessors empower carriers in emerging markets to join the global stage, thus boosting regional air connectivity and opening new frontiers for tourism.

This development was also expected to benefit airport authorities, tour operators, hotel chains, and tourism-dependent economies, especially as newer aircraft enable nonstop point-to-point services between cities that previously required hub-based transfers.

Sustainable Travel and Aviation’s Green Future

The Boeing 737-8 was designed with lower emissions and fuel consumption in mind, offering a 14% improvement in fuel efficiency compared to its predecessors. For travel sector stakeholders, this translates into a cleaner, greener way to fly, appealing to the growing number of eco-conscious travelers and sustainability-focused airlines.

This aircraft is also equipped to support carbon-offset initiatives and future SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) integration, reinforcing the travel industry’s long-term environmental commitments while maintaining the economic feasibility of tourism-focused flights.

Seattle-Based Boeing Remains a Key Export Force for U.S. Aviation

This deal also reaffirmed Boeing’s strength as a top U.S. exporter and a global driver of aerospace innovation, with manufacturing and servicing operations impacting over 150 countries. From Seattle, Washington, the company continues to design next-generation aircraft while supporting supply chains and skilled labor across the U.S. and beyond.

Boeing’s expansive role in travel, tourism, and connectivity also enhances its reputation among tourism ministries and airline planners seeking resilient partnerships and fleet renewal options aligned with future-ready standards.

Global Connectivity Gains Momentum with Asia-Based Lessor’s Commitment

Given BOC Aviation’s headquarters in Singapore, the news also signaled the growing influence of Asian financial and aviation players in shaping the future of global travel. The Asia-Pacific region, long seen as the engine of air travel growth, is leading the charge in aviation investments, infrastructure expansion, and international leasing activity.

This makes BOC Aviation’s move a geostrategic signal, boosting the region’s role in fueling the global movement of travelers and reinforcing Singapore’s status as an aviation and leasing powerhouse.

Conclusion: An Acceleration of the Travel Industry’s Rebound

@TotalEnergies TotalEnergies TotalEnergies TotalEnergies","PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The ongoing conversion of the Grandpuits refinery is entering a key phase. Over 1,200 people are working on the project, which includes the launch of an advanced plastics recycling unit, the first in France to use this particular technology, and the construction of a biorefinery for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF). Once completed, this vast project will be the Company’s first zero-crude platform.

The complex construction operation, for which as much of the site's equipment as possible is reused, requires the mobilization and expertise of all the employees who know the Grandpuits site. Some projects due to arrive in the second phase — biogas and mechanical recycling — have been suspended and the employees who were to join them are assigned, with their agreement, to the success of the first two major projects. In line with its plans at the outset of the project in 2020, TotalEnergies confirms that 250 jobs will be maintained at Grandpuits following the conversion.

Within a few months, Grandpuits will be able to produce 10,000 tons a year of pyrolysis oil from recycled plastic, and from the beginning of 2026, up to 230,000 tons a year of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

The result is 0.7 percentage points higher than in the previous quarter ending in November 2024 (6.1%).
However, it is the lowest for a quarter ending in February since 2014, when it stood at 6.8%.
In the quarter ending in January 2025, the rate stood at 6.5%, down from 6.8% in the period ending in February.
The IBGE study assesses the labor market behavior of people aged 14 and over and takes into account all forms of occupation, whether employment with or without a formal contract, temporary employment, or self-employment, for example.","The Brazilian Government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva recorded a positive balance of 431,995 formal jobs in February 2025, marking the highest monthly figure in the Labor Ministry's New General Register of Employed and Unemployed (New Caged) series since it began in 2020.

The achievements reflected in Friday's release resuled from through 2.58 million admissions and 2.15 million dismissals. Year-to-date, the job market saw a net increase of 576,081 positions, and over the past 12 months, there was a total gain of 1.78 million jobs.

Overall, South America's largest country recorded 47,780,769 active jobs in February, a 0.91% increase from the previous month.

Labor Minister Luiz Marinho claimed that February's figures stemmed from the federal government's policy of investment and reindustrialization of the country. “We stimulated a lot of investment, and this is the result,” he said. “We have a re-industrialization program, we are encouraging industry to prepare to produce health equipment instead of importing it. We're having a debate about the climate transition, encouraging investment; we want to produce SAF [Sustainable Aviation Fuel] in Brazil to replace polluting aircraft fuel,” he went on.

The biggest growth in formal employment last month was in the services sector, with the creation of 254,812 jobs, a variation of 1.1% compared to January. In industry, 69,884 jobs were created, a variation of 0.78%. In commerce, 46,587 jobs were created (0.44%); in construction, there were 40,871 jobs (1.41%); and in agriculture, there were 19,842 jobs or 1.08%.

The average salary was R$ 2,205.25 (US$ 382.83). Compared to the previous month, there was a R$ 79.41 drop in the average salary (-3.48 %).

Most jobs created in February were filled by women, who accounted for 229,163, while men held 202,832 positions. The age group with the highest balance was 18 to 24-year-olds, with 170,593 jobs. High school graduates accounted for 277,786 jobs.

In terms of salary range, jobs paying up to 1.5 minimum wages amounted to 312,790 jobs. In terms of race/color, brown people accounted for 269,129 jobs, while white people accounted for 189,245 jobs.

Except for Alagoas, all states had positive job creation results last month. In absolute terms, São Paulo generated the largest number of jobs, closing February with 137,581; followed by Minas Gerais, with 52,603 jobs, and Paraná, with 39,176 jobs.

On the opposite end, Alagoas lost 5,471 jobs, while Acre created only 429 new positions, with Paraíba slightly better at 525 new jobs.

Marinho noted, however, that the February figures were seasonally adjusted and that a drop in the number of jobs generated is expected for March. He also said he expected the policy of job creation to continue. “I hope the economy continues to heat up; after all, we still have a lot of people underemployed, unemployed,” he pointed out.

The minister once again criticized the increase in the Selic rate to 14.25% by the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) earlier this month. “What seems to me to be happening is that the transition of the Central Bank had contracts in place, and they are being fulfilled. It's not recommended to ride roughshod over the economy and, therefore, the processes are being respected,” he mentioned.

“I think what is needed in Brazil is a great pact of more production to contain inflation, and not the other way around. It also seems to me that, with the increase in interest rates, people aren't going to stop eating meat, eggs, rice, and beans. The debate is different: we need to produce more,” said Marinho.

IBGE

The unemployment rate for the quarter ending in February was 6.8%. The result is 0.7 percentage points higher than in the previous quarter ending in November 2024 (6.1%). However, it is the lowest for a quarter ending in February since 2014, when it stood at 6.8%.

The labor market data is part of the Continuous National Household Sample Survey (Pnad Contínua), released Friday by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). According to survey coordinator Adriana Beringuy, the rise in unemployment compared to the previous quarter is a common trend at this time of year.

“It's an expected movement because in the transition period from the end of one year to the first months of the following year, there is, in fact, this downward movement in occupation,” she said.

The number of people out of work reached 7.5 million in the period, up 10.4% from the previous quarter. However, this figure is 12.5% lower than that recorded in the same quarter of 2024.

Of the ten activity groups surveyed by the IBGE, three showed a drop in the number of people employed: construction (-4.0%, or 310,000 fewer people), public administration, defense, social security, education, human health and social services (-2.5%, or 468,000 fewer people) and domestic services (-4.8%, or 290,000 fewer people).

According to Beringuy, the reduction in vacancies in the public administration group is also seasonal and has to do with the end of temporary workers' contracts.

The researcher also says that this seasonal behavior of the job market means that it is not possible to say that there are recessionary effects from the interest rate hike, a measure adopted by the Central Bank (BCB) to contain inflation.

“At the moment, I wouldn't attribute the effect of this variable to interest rates and the impact of household consumption on the labor market,” she argued.

In the quarter ending in January 2025, the rate stood at 6.5%, down from 6.8% in the period ending in February. However, the IBGE does not make the comparison between the immediately following intervals because there are months that are repeated in both periods (December and January), which distorts the comparison.

In the quarter ending in February, the country's employed population was 102.7 million people. This figure is 1.2% lower than in the period ending in November (1.2 million fewer people) but 2.4% higher than in the same period last year (2.4 million more people).

The IBGE survey also points out that the country reached a record high in the number of workers with a formal contract. There were 39.6 million contracts, the highest volume since the beginning of the historical series in 2012. In one year, there were 1.6 million more people (+4.1%) with a formal contract.

The IBGE study assesses the labor market behavior of people aged 14 and over and takes into account all forms of occupation, whether employment with or without a formal contract, temporary employment, or self-employment, for example.

The informality rate - workers who are not guaranteed rights such as vacations, Social Security contributions, and yearly bonuses fell “slightly” to 38.1% of the employed population, which represents 39.1 million informal workers. In both the quarter ending in November and the same period in 2024, the rate was 38.7%.

This is the 4th project in Europe to select FT CANS for SAF production.

This is the 6th project contributing to JM’s strategic milestone of 20 additional large-scale projects in Catalyst Technologies’ sustainable technologies portfolio by the end of the 2025/2026 financial year.

LONDON, March 31, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Johnson Matthey (JM), a global leader in sustainable technologies, today announced that Willis Sustainable Fuels (WSF) has selected JM and bp’s award-winning Fischer Tropsch (FT) CANS™ technology for WSF’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project in Teesside, Northeast England.

The project, which is expected to be operational in 2028, plans to be the first of its kind in the UK. The facility intends to use a biomethane feedstock, processed into syngas using JM’s proven reforming technology. This syngas will feed the JM/bp FT CANS technology to produce synthetic crude oil that can be upgraded and blended to SAF. Once operational, the WSF facility plans to produce 14 thousand tonnes of SAF blendstock per year.

Teesside is becoming an active location in the UK for SAF production, with Teesside International Airport’s own net zero strategy setting ambitions for it to use SAF to achieve net zero flights by 2035 and to be the UK’s first net zero airport[1].

WSF’s planned development was one of five Teesside-based projects to receive funding from round two of the Department for Transport’s Advanced Fuels Fund[2] which enables the commercial deployment of fuel production technologies capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the UK aviation industry.

Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey, said: “As a UK-headquartered company, we’re excited our technology has been selected to be part of this innovative UK project. With our FT CANS development and testing facilities located in Teesside, and projects like this in development, we see the North East as a leader in efforts to meet the UK SAF mandate. We look forward to working with Willis Sustainable Fuels to develop SAF in the region …and beyond!”

Amy Ruddock, Senior Vice President, Sustainable Aviation & Corporate Development at Willis Lease Finance Corporation, the parent company of WSF, said: “Partnering with Johnson Matthey and other industry leaders enables us to drive meaningful progress toward our vision of connecting the world through sustainable flight.”

“This pioneering project will demonstrate the potential of our Carbonshift pathway, which can leverage various sustainable feedstocks and be tailored to produce power-to-liquids—helping to shape the future of aviation fuels.”

This order strengthens the long-standing partnership between China Airlines and Airbus. The Taiwanese carrier currently operates several Airbus models, including 15 A350-900s, 15 A321neo, and 16 A330s across its comprehensive network serving Asia, Europe, North America, and the Pacific region.

The A350 Family has secured more than 1,360 orders from 60 global customers, with over 640 aircraft already in service with 38 operators worldwide.

Like all Airbus aircraft, the A350-1000 can currently operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with Airbus targeting 100% SAF capability by 2030.

China Airlines Retrofitting A350s

China Airlines has committed to a complete overhaul of its Airbus A350 cabin interiors, signing an agreement with Airbus on December 9, 2023, to retrofit 15 A350 aircraft. The first upgraded aircraft will enter service in 2027, with the entire program scheduled for completion by 2028.

The Taiwanese carrier joins several leading Asia-Pacific airlines in upgrading cabin products to meet evolving passenger expectations. The retrofit will maintain China Airlines’ signature Oriental aesthetic while introducing modern luxury elements designed to create stronger emotional connections with travelers and reinforce brand identity.

All three cabin classes on the A350-900 fleet will receive upgrades, with improvements focusing on ergonomic seating designs and space efficiency. The renovation will also deliver enhanced in-flight entertainment systems featuring larger screens and improved connectivity options.

China Airlines currently configures its A350-900 aircraft with 32 business class seats, 31 premium economy seats, and 243 economy class seats. These wide-body jets primarily serve the carrier’s long-haul network to Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and North America.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels, as reported by Business Recorder.

The EU’s RefuelEU regulation stipulates that airlines operating within the single market must use at least 2% SAF by 2025, increasing to 6% by 2030 and reaching 70% by 2050. However, airlines argue that there is insufficient SAF on the market, and producers are increasingly shifting back to fossil fuels.

The CEO also cited a Boston Consulting study that predicts a 30% shortfall in SAF by 2030 compared to what EU regulations will require.

Despite expressing a commitment to reducing emissions, Gallego stressed that the aviation business must remain ""affordable and accessible for everyone"". He lamented that SAF is not only scarce but also three to five times more expensive than kerosene.

In addition, European carriers warned that the region is falling behind due to stricter regulations than in other parts of the world, which have tripled operational costs since 2014.

For example, SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard requires a company’s decarbonization commitment to include a pledge to reduce their emissions by 90% or more before relying on carbon-removal technologies to counterbalance the remaining 10%.","Net zero. This simple accounting term represents humanity’s greatest challenge — and opportunity — to stabilize Earth’s climate. The goal, timeline and metric for success seem clear: by 2050, each tonne of carbon emitted must be matched by a tonne removed. But achieving this is easier said than done.

Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, the world has built up more than 250 years of momentum in a carbon-emitting economic and technological paradigm. Now, under the terms of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, it has just 25 years — or a few business cycles — to replace the carbon-dependent parts with net-zero components.

Will AI accelerate or delay the race to net-zero emissions?

The journey requires unprecedented coordination, innovation, investment and speed to avoid the catastrophic consequences of failure — including increasingly severe natural disasters, from rapidly rising sea levels and floods to heatwaves and wildfires. We, the authors, understand the potential and pitfalls, having spent more than 20 years between us developing the strategies, programmes, products and policies that achieving net zero demands.

We have deployed and influenced more than US$1 billion in investments and purchases related to carbon reduction and removal, and have been on the front lines of driving large-scale voluntary decarbonization in the corporate sector. Previously, we served as principal architects of Microsoft’s carbon-negative commitment. Now, one of us (E.W.) is a net-zero strategy consultant, and the other (L.J.) is a private-equity executive working to deliver a net-zero investment portfolio.

Although we have a deep conviction that net zero can work, we know it has issues. A premature desire for perfection, overly precise guidelines for implementation, insufficient flexibility in carbon accounting, unhelpful constraints on collaboration and a disproportionate focus on the actions of others all combine to slow down the net-zero transformation just when it needs to speed up. Here, we describe the barriers and suggest ways to overcome them.

Obstacles to market growth

For net zero to work, the world must design markets in which every product or service, everywhere, prices in the cost of removing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or replacing them with an alternative that emits little or no carbon. Regulation will play a crucial part. But adoption at scale will happen only when removals and low-carbon alternatives are cheaper in price, superior in performance, or both, relative to higher carbon incumbents.

Reduction and removal technologies are still in their infancy. Sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen and steel, low-carbon concrete and technologies that capture CO2 from the air are expected to be part of a future net-zero economy. But today, they are too scarce and expensive to enable stakeholders to build anything more than theoretical plans around them.

Long-term cost-efficiencies and supply will emerge only through large investments in a host of approaches, allowing the markets to determine winners and losers. This was a clear lesson from decades of advances in solar and wind energy, which ultimately saw the costs of these renewables plummet by more than 70%.

How car and battery companies can work around US trade tariffs and rules

To meet net-zero goals, global investments in the clean-energy and carbon-removal sectors, and their supporting infrastructure, must exceed $4 trillion annually by 20301. But we are concerned that current carbon-market expectations are inadvertently making it harder — not easier — to deploy the climate capital needed to build robust carbon markets.

Despite widespread agreement on the need for net zero, few binding requirements compel individuals or organizations to act in support of climate goals. This creates a carbon catch-22: governments are hesitant to impose regulations without clear price signals from markets, while markets struggle to deliver price clarity without regulatory guidance.

As a result, achieving net zero globally must rely heavily on early movers — organizations that pursue net-zero outcomes voluntarily. But, so far, there are too few of these, and they aren’t moving quickly enough. In part, that is because the net-zero landscape is dominated by prescriptive rules that are difficult to implement, often creating confusion instead of clarity.

These roadblocks must be removed. Here we identify six remedies.

Pursue progress over perfection

Organizations need flexibility if they are going to commit to innovation. For example, in the early days of renewable energy, corporate buyers purchased renewable energy credits to meet their 100% renewable electricity goals that would not meet quality standards today. But they got the ball rolling: buyers invested, learnt and iterated. Procurement of ‘unbundled’ renewable-energy certificates was replaced by more sophisticated ways of buying and selling energy, such as through contracts to match hourly energy consumption.

Similarly, today’s corporate leaders are advancing energy projects on a voluntary basis, from nuclear to geothermal. Their energy prices are high now, but will come down if buyers and suppliers are given room to improve the technologies. In other words, setting an ambitious but achievable goal and sticking with it, while continuously improving its execution, should be a core principle for reaching net zero.

Yet, rigid and complex standards introduced too soon are discouraging companies from innovating. For example, last year, the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) removed nearly 240 companies — representing more than $4 trillion in market capitalization — from its Corporate Net Zero Standard, because of their inability to meet its stringent criteria2. This highly publicized action led to frustration from the affected companies, some of which stated they were unaware that the deadline for meeting these criteria was approaching.

Delisting or penalizing companies for ‘missing’ arbitrary net-zero milestones should be avoided. SBTi’s working groups should recommend that flexibility and iteration are core pillars of its forthcoming revision to the Corporate Net Zero Standard (see go.nature.com/428ukzq).

Prioritize direct over indirect emissions

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol, a partnership between businesses, governments and other organizations that has set global standards for measuring emissions, has established three ‘scopes’ for voluntary reporting of emissions by corporations. Scope 1 includes an organization’s direct emissions (such as those from a steel producer’s coal-powered kiln). Scope 2 reflects those associated with consuming electricity, as well as heating and cooling. Scope 3 emissions represent all those embodied in an organization’s supply chain and product-delivery networks. Thus, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions help companies to understand the wider carbon implications of their operations. But, if every company reduced their Scope 1 emissions to zero, then every other company’s Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions would also disappear.

For most companies, Scope 3 captures most of their emissions. Accounting for these has helped to drive a cascade of decarbonization commitments, such as identifying, addressing or replacing high-carbon producers. That is good.

Why we still don’t know the mounting health risks of climate change

But a disproportionate focus on reporting Scope 3 emissions — including by the SBTi, the CDP (an international non-profit organization dedicated to collecting information on corporate sustainability efforts) and jurisdictions such as the United States and the European Union — has arguably distracted many companies from doing the hard work at home. In 2022, only 7% of consumer companies were on track to meet their targets for value-chain decarbonization, and only 18% were on track with their direct-emissions targets (see go.nature.com/43ystkc). Companies could make more progress on Scope 1 if they were able to simplify and focus their attention.

First, requiring companies to commit to reductions they have little or no control over, and then penalizing them for failing to make progress, discourages them from engaging. Indeed, in a 2024 survey by the SBTi, Scope 3 difficulties were the biggest complaint from companies working on climate issues, mentioned by 54% of firms2.

Second, a focus on Scope 3 introduces extreme uncertainty into reporting of carbon emissions. The most common way to derive Scope 3 emissions is to multiply how much is spent on certain broad categories, such as ‘marketing’, by a numerical factor approximating national or global emissions for that activity. This simplistic approach misses both the accuracy and precision that reporting bodies desire.

And third, Scope 3 emissions can potentially divert focus away from Scope 1 and 2 emissions for a reason of efficiency: if most of an organization’s emissions are indirect, why focus first on the minority that are direct?

The fix is simple. SBTi, CDP, regulators and other parties should create a tiered system that prioritizes target setting and reporting for Scope 1 and 2 over that for Scope 3. Companies should be making progress on decarbonizing their Scope 1 and 2 emissions before they are expected to tackle the more difficult Scope 3.

Focus on demand over delivery

Corporate demand has had an outsized role in developing renewable-energy markets. Starting in the 2010s, companies were motivated to make purchases because they received credit for doing so under the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. But the protocol’s accounting practices contain an inconsistency. Under its ‘location-based’ and ‘market-based’ accounting rules, companies can get credit for Scope 2 carbon reductions from the electricity they consume by purchasing renewable energy that is never physically delivered to them. But there is no mechanism to do that for Scope 1 or 3.

The protocol now needs to be expanded to allow for such claims across all emissions classes. It is more important that solutions are contracted and paid for than specifying where and to whom they are delivered. For instance, being able to track the delivery of sustainable aviation fuel to a buyer in a specific seat on a particular aeroplane is less important than ensuring that an equivalent amount of fuel was delivered into the broader aviation network.

Allowing companies to claim credit for these purchases would incentivize them to invest. To build trust, descriptions of the projects funded or financed can help others to assess the value of any company’s carbon reduction and removal purchases.

Allow flexibility between emissions reduction and removal

As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has emphasized, limiting the worst harms of global warming requires both reduction of emissions and large-scale carbon removal. In the context of global net zero, how much reduction is needed versus how much removal is an open question, and well-intentioned but premature mandates hold back innovation.

For example, SBTi’s Corporate Net Zero Standard requires a company’s decarbonization commitment to include a pledge to reduce their emissions by 90% or more before relying on carbon-removal technologies to counterbalance the remaining 10%. This requirement is too strict, and too early.

By analogy, in the renewable-energy sector, early markets were unconstrained by requirements for specific amounts of solar, wind or hydropower. Instead, technologies competed, and winners emerged for different uses in different places. A market-driven approach allowed the most effective solutions to materialize naturally over time.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-00935-1/d41586-025-00935-1_50793110.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 05:56:27.245088

This syngas will feed the JM/bp FT CANS technology to produce synthetic crude oil that can be upgraded and blended to SAF. Once operational, the WSF facility plans to produce 14 thousand tonnes of SAF blendstock per year.

Teesside is becoming an active location in the UK for SAF production, with Teesside International Airport's own net zero strategy setting ambitions for it to use SAF to achieve net zero flights by 2035 and to be the UK's first net zero airport[1].

WSF's planned development was one of five Teesside-based projects to receive funding from round two of the Department for Transport's Advanced Fuels Fund[2] which enables the commercial deployment of fuel production technologies capable of reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the UK aviation industry.

Alberto Giovanzana, Managing Director Licensing at Johnson Matthey, said: ""As a UK-headquartered company, we're excited our technology has been selected to be part of this innovative UK project. With our FT CANS development and testing facilities located in Teesside, and projects like this in development, we see the North East as a leader in efforts to meet the UK SAF mandate. We look forward to working with Willis Sustainable Fuels to develop SAF in the region ...and beyond!""

Amy Ruddock, Senior Vice President, Sustainable Aviation & Corporate Development at Willis Lease Finance Corporation, the parent company of WSF, said: ""Partnering with Johnson Matthey and other industry leaders enables us to drive meaningful progress toward our vision of connecting the world through sustainable flight.""

""This pioneering project will demonstrate the potential of our Carbonshift pathway, which can leverage various sustainable feedstocks and be tailored to produce power-to-liquids—helping to shape the future of aviation fuels.""

1 All market position references are estimated and based on date of media release

Zug, 31 March 2025 – VARO Energy (“VARO”) has today reached agreement to acquire Preem Holding AB and Preem AB (“Preem”) through the purchase of 100% of the share capital of the parent company, Corral Petroleum Holdings AB (“CPH”), in an all-cash transaction. Subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of regulatory approvals the transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2025.

The agreement follows a competitive M&A process that began after CPH announced a strategic review of its assets in late 2023. VARO has been engaged in this process for over 15 months, having entered exclusivity in August 2024. As part of this process and in accordance with its rights under existing security arrangements, Deutsche Bank (Suisse) SA, as pledgee of the CPH shares, executed the sale agreement on behalf of CPH’s parent company, Moroncha Holdings Co. Ltd.

Preem is one of the largest energy companies in Scandinavia. The company plays a critical role in the region’s energy security, providing over 40% of Sweden’s and around a quarter of Scandinavia’s energy needs for transportation. It serves customers in 17 countries across Europe.

An early mover in renewable fuel production, Preem has invested nearly US$1 billion since 2010 in the production of renewable fuels and initiatives aimed at reducing the carbon intensity throughout the value chain. As a result of these investments, Preem’s current renewable fuel production of 0.3 mtpa will rise to 1.3 mtpa with the Synsat diesel plant upgrade enabling up to 40% co-processing of renewable feedstocks. The company also has a material pipeline of other renewable fuel projects.

Preem owns two major fuel manufacturing facilities in Sweden, at Lysekil and Gothenburg. The two facilities have a combined capacity of 352,000 barrels per day, which equates to 80% of Sweden’s refining capacity, and the ability to co-process renewable feedstock. Primarily located in Scandinavia, Preem’s assets are highly complementary to VARO’s existing operations across northwest Europe with limited overlap.

Dev Sanyal, CEO of VARO, said: “The acquisition of Preem is transformational for VARO. On completion, we will become Europe’s second largest renewable fuel producer with an extensive distribution and storage network across major European markets with conventional fuel production capacity of 530,000 barrels per day. Combined we will serve over 50,000 business customers across 33 countries, with our future growth underpinned by a robust portfolio of mature renewable fuel projects.”

Marcel van Poecke, Chairman of VARO and Chairman of Energy at Carlyle, said: “This acquisition provides material value creation opportunities through disciplined investment in future growth projects, while enhancing VARO’s ability to deliver the reliable and secure energy that Europe needs. The combined entity will be well positioned to continue to play an important role in meeting Europe’s growing demand for sustainable energy for the mobility and industrial sectors.”

Russell Hardy, Supervisory Board member of VARO and CEO, Vitol, said: “We are very excited by this transaction. The company will be Europe’s second largest producer of biofuels – which are key to decarbonising transport in Europe. It will benefit from access to Vitol’s network and global expertise. We greatly look forward to expanding this ongoing and successful partnership and working with the combined entity to meet customer requirements and supply evolving markets.”

Creating a leading energy provider for mobility and industrial customers

The combined group will have a large geographic footprint across key European markets, with global feedstock sourcing capabilities and an expanded customer base. Benefiting from Preem’s manufacturing facilities and VARO’s Cressier and Bayernoil assets, our fuel manufacturing capacity will increase to 530 kbd. It will serve over 50,000 business customers in Europe and account for almost 10% of all road and marine fuels sold on the continent, with Sweden becoming its largest manufacturing base. The company will operate one of Europe’s largest supply networks in Europe with access to over 120 terminals.

The company will be the largest co-processor of renewable feedstocks in Europe. On completion, the combined group will rank in the top five largest producers of Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) globally. It will be Europe’s second largest renewable fuel producer and the top producer in Sweden.

Material renewable fuel production will provide the company with a strong position in the fast-growing biofuels for transport sector. Biofuel demand in the EU transport sector is expected to increase by 50-80% by 2030 as Member States accelerate decarbonization efforts.

With more than a decade of experience developing renewable fuel assets, Preem brings valuable expertise in applying proven technology at scale. When combined with cash flow growth, increased liquidity and a strong balance sheet, the combined group will have an enhanced capacity to invest in and develop its renewable fuel asset portfolio. In addition, material value upsides from combining the two businesses have been identified. These include leveraging the combined companies’ physical assets with VARO’s extensive value chain optimisation, risk and exposure management capabilities to deliver higher margins, improved crude mix and renewable feedstock optimisation.

Post completion the intention is to focus on three investment priorities. First, investing in improved security of supply and asset resilience, across manufacturing, distribution and storage. Second, decarbonizing and increasing the efficiency of conventional manufacturing assets. Third, investing in the attractive portfolio of biofuel projects of both companies, with a customer-centric approach designed to keep pace with evolving demand for sustainable energy.

Delivering on VARO’s 2022 strategy

In 2022 VARO set out an ambitious set of strategic targets to triple EBITDA by 2026 with 50% coming from sustainable energies. Over the last three years VARO has made good progress towards achieving these goals, notably the acquisition and expansion of the biogas facility in Coevorden and progressing the development of a SAF facility in Rotterdam. The combined company will be well positioned to achieve these financial targets.

Both VARO and Preem share a strong commitment to ambitious targets for decarbonizing their operations and reducing the carbon intensity of the solutions they deliver to customers. Following completion of the transaction, VARO will leverage the decarbonization expertise and proven track record of both organizations to support national and European energy transition agendas and drive progress toward a low-carbon future. They have collectively achieved a 16% reduction in CO2 emissions from their own operations and abated 5.5 million tons per year of CO2 for their customers since tracking began.

Investing for the long-term

Since it was founded in 2012, VARO has made close to 20 acquisitions and has built a strong track record of investing in and integrating the companies that it acquires. Privately held and backed by long-term strategic and financial investors, VARO plays an important role in supporting energy security and decarbonization in the markets in which it currently operates.

With strong medium-term cash flow generation and a long-term holder of assets, VARO will ensure responsible stewardship of Preem. We will continue to be a partner in Sweden and the wider region’s security and energy transition priorities.

By Scott Hamilton

March 31, 2025, © Leeham News: Airbus last week announced a program to boost Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) called Book and Claim. Its purpose is to buy SAF credits in one location and take credit for them in another.

The buyer can then claim in its corporate reports that it is meeting environmental goals, at least in part.

“This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption,” Airbus said at its annual environmental Aviation Summit.

“In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to 'book' a certain amount of SAF and ‘claim’ the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot program running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points,” the company said.

It's an admirable effort for an industry that has so far fallen dramatically short of the SAF goals outlined by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) at its 2021 Annual General Meeting in Boston (MA).

However, LNA is skeptical about the effort. Carbon credits, which appear to be a variation, failed when airlines tried them. United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby called carbon offsets a “fig leaf” and “mostly a fraud.”

In land use regulations, Book and Claim sounds suspiciously like wetland mitigation programs. This is where a wetland is filled in for development and a new one may be created miles away, offsetting the environmental damage in the original location. At least this is the theory, and it’s essentially pencil-whipping. Nature doesn’t work this way for wetlands. LNA isn’t convinced it works this way for carbon, either.",https://leehamnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/LHC-SAF.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 01:56:12.302635

The astonishment was as searing as a jet engine exhaust heat when it was announced that Doncaster Sheffield Airport was to close in 2022.

As new operators and financial packages are now announced and the Chancellor of the Exchequer herself namechecks its importance alongside Heathrow Airport, one question stands above others - can it work?

The ambition now is to have planes using the former RAF Finningley site, to be known as South Yorkshire Airport City, by April 2026.

Wholly-owned council company FlyDoncaster Ltd will operate the airport with Munich Airport International (MAI) hired to provide operational and management services.

Prior to closure, Doncaster Sheffield Airport (DSA) was run by Peel Airports, part of the Peel Group - which has £5bn worth of assets under management. So if it couldn’t make DSA work why should anyone else?

Dan Fell, chief executive of the city’s Chamber of Commerce, says: “Peel is an outstanding land and property company. There isn’t an easy path through to a million passengers, to profitability. The airport is a complex organisation in a complex sector in a challenging economy but there is definitely a pathway to it.

“When the local authority went out to market to find an operating partner, 35 organisations around the world threw their hat in the ring for it. That speaks volumes. I am delighted they picked Munich Airport and that is a key part of why it will work. They will hopefully bring carriers with them, though I can’t name names unfortunately, but we can all see who flies in and out of Munich. They have relationships.”

City of Doncaster Council says the airport could be profitable within five years of reopening and SYMCA’s business case states that the project will generate £6.6 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) to the local economy and 5,000 direct jobs.

Peter Kennan, who sits on the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce’s transport forum, says: “I don’t think the airport will be profitable for some time, although most regional airports aren’t profitable. It doesn’t bother me that the airport loses some money. Someone would have to underwrite losses but tell me about the business rates income that comes from all this investment in due course, tell me about income tax, national insurance, VAT receipts from all this possible investment and then the jobs, skills and opportunities. It is about the wider, economic and social benefits of a region that has had so many hard shocks and bad news. How else are we going to regenerate without using our key strategic asset which is the airport?”

Peel Airports still owns a 47 per cent stake in Liverpool John Lennon Airport though it did sell its majority stake in Durham Tees Valley Airport to the Tees Valley Combined Authority in 2018.

Teesside International Airport, as it now is, has seen revenue double since 2019-2020 and balance sheet assets increased from £33m to £83m, although it did report a £3.3m EBITDA loss most recently.

Its managing director Phil Forster was also head of external affairs at Leeds Bradford Airport until April 2019. On any acceptance of trading losses he says: “That would really alarm me. If you took the view that you didn’t need to make money, you are still playing with public numbers and you are going to be scrutinised for every single penny and rightly so. I’d want to be looking at getting the place back in the black.”

DSA has permissions to take 24-hour flying, which is important in cargo. Kennan argues that the airport needs to be viewed in the context of the South Yorkshire Investment Zone in advanced manufacturing. Hybrid Air Vehicles is preparing to start work on its flagship production facility for Airlander 10 airships at Carcroft Common. Peel itself has room for 3.5m sq ft of industrial space at its adjacent Gateway East development.

Kennan says: “The University of Sheffield Advanced Manufacturing Research Centre is doing work on sustainable aviation fuel and the lightweighting of aircraft in alloys and metals too. So there is a great opportunity to grow a green aviation cluster.

“And then think Vertiport and all the uses to which drones can be used and how we can regulate them in an environment which is safe. Having regulated airspace around an airport means that we can use Doncaster Sheffield Airport for drone applications. There are many opportunities too as aviation grows around the world for maintenance and repair of aircraft.”

Teesside’s Forster says that DSA’s operators need to look at diversifying revenue streams this time around. “Small regional airports can’t look to operate and survive just with passenger flights because the dynamics just don’t work.They need to go after cargo, real estate and maintenance, repair and overhaul - all the non-passenger aeronautical opportunities.”

In January, a government report said that FlyDoncaster would be set up with £105.2m of low-interest loans from the council with £60.6m covering start-up and other costs, while a further £44.6m would plug a shortfall caused by the deferral of rent.

Council auditors Grant Thornton have expressed “a major concern” about the use of public money advanced from the South Yorkshire Gainshare devolution funding.

South Yorkshire mayor Oliver Coppard has postponed a decision on handing over the Gainshare funding until summer to seek independent advice on the financial risks.

Fell says: “We should be able to get the money released to Doncaster to do all of the things it needs to. If SYMCA delays any longer and we miss the window for 2026 and it becomes 2027 or 2028 then confidence could ebb from the project. Pace is important. I understand that, in a world of austerity and other asks such as bus franchising and trams, that it is a lot of money but I think that now is a time for political bravery.”

Fell says there is widespread public support for the reopening, with 130,000 signing a petition.

“I have never known such an outpouring of community support for a project like this. I would say 95 per cent plus of the businesses I have spoken to in the last two years absolutely support it.”

Following the White House directive, at least two meetings have taken place, including one last week hosted by the American Petroleum Institute (API).
Participants, including API’s vice president of downstream policy, Will Hupman, discussed key issues such as future biofuel blending mandates, exemptions for small refineries, and biofuel tax policies.
Any agreement between the two industries could influence the Trump administration’s approach to biofuels policy moving forward.

The oil industry and biofuel producers have long competed for a share of the multibillion-dollar US gasoline market, frequently clashing over the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) — a federal programme requiring billions of gallons of ethanol and other biofuels to be blended into the nation’s fuel supply, Reuters added.

Any agreement between the two industries could influence the Trump administration’s approach to biofuels policy moving forward.

The range discussed was between 4.75 billion and 5.5 billion gallons, with some wanting higher volumes in 2026 and others pushing for a more gradual rise, the three sources said.

Blending mandates for ethanol, meanwhile, have capped out at 15 billion gallons, and the parties saw little growth prospect due to plateauing demand for gasoline, the sources said.

The groups were also split over small refinery exemptions to the RFS, one of the most controversial and divisive issues, the sources said.

In Trump's first administration, the EPA approved a record number of such exemptions, letting small refiners sidestep their blending obligations, and triggering political backlash from his Republican allies in the Farm Belt who said it punished farmers.",https://biofuels-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump-whotehouse-pic-Biofuel-31-3-768x512.jpg,N,,2025-03-31 01:56:57.061785
