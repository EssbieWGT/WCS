The trade group estimates that SAF production will reach 1.9 million metric tons in 2025, almost double the amount made in 2024. But that figure will fall short of IATA’s initial estimates for the year, and in 2026, growth in production is expected to slow to 2.4 million metric tons.

IATA officials placed the blame on “poorly designed” SAF-related mandates and policy frameworks enacted in the U.K. and Europe.

Europe’s ReFuelEU Aviation, for instance, has sharply increased costs, and airlines are now paying up to five times more for SAF than conventional jet fuel, the group said.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production,” Willie Walsh, IATA’s director general, said in a statement. “Europe’s regulators must recognize that its approach is not working and urgently correct course.”

The trade association said governments should focus their efforts on production incentives, rather than mandates, to increase the global supply of SAF and drive down prices.

SAF is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel made from nonpetroleum feedstocks. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, it can be developed from food and yard waste, woody biomass, agricultural waste, cooking oils, animal fats, and algae.

SAF is a “drop in” fuel, meaning it can be blended with traditional jet fuel and used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modification. Its use can reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent.

Many airlines and private aviation companies now use SAF, and some have set targets for a gradual transition away from conventional jet fuel. IATA said that, as a result of increasing costs, airlines that have pledged to use 10 percent SAF by 2030 will be “forced to reevaluate these commitments.”

“SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition,” Walsh said. “These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered.”",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/shutterstock_2030568074.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 16:56:58.683224

Moreover, the slowdown in SAF production growth follows the implementation by the EU and UK this year of new SAF-focused mandates, requiring minimum, and increasing, amounts of SAF usage, causing prices for sustainable aviation fuel to increase sharply.
IATA General Director Willie Walsh said: “If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park.

While substantially outpacing the prior year’s production, however, the new forecast marks a reduction in the IATA’s estimate for 2025 SAF output from its prior 2 Mt prediction, with the IATA noting that 2025 production will only account for 0.6% of total jet fuel consumption this year, and blaming the downward revision on a “lack of policy support to take full advantage of the installed SAF capacities.”

Additionally, the IATA warned that it anticipates that production growth will slow significantly next year, reaching 2.4 Mt in 2026, or 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

Moreover, the slowdown in SAF production growth follows the implementation by the EU and UK this year of new SAF-focused mandates, requiring minimum, and increasing, amounts of SAF usage, causing prices for sustainable aviation fuel to increase sharply. According to the IATA, SAF prices exceed fossil-based jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to a factor of five in mandated markets, with the IATA estimating that poorly designed mandates have led to airlines paying a $2.9 billion premium in 2025 for SAF.

IATA General Director Willie Walsh said:

“If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonization of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels.

Walsh also warned that the failure to accelerate SAF production will lead airlines with SAF targets to review their goals, noting that “many airlines that have committed to use 10% SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition.”

We need to increase the production by .01 million tonnes of green hydrogen by electrolysis. And we need around point 10 million tonnes of CO2 coming from the director of capture or from biogenic sources. But now if I put these numbers in comparison of what is the current production in the UK today and maybe you will be a little bit more shocked. So the current UK production of green hydrogen is not point not not 1,000,000 tonnes. So we are an order of magnitude. They're far away from what we need in 20-30 and if we look at CO2 that looks just a little bit worse.

The organization published its flagship cross-sector Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021, and is currently in the process of developing an update to the standard, Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2.
The new proposed standard was developed in alignment with the SBTi’s draft Net-Zero Standard V2, while also introducing new methodologies and requirements specific to power sector companies.
The new pilot follows the conclusion of an initial consultation on the draft power sector standard.
As renewable energy deployment accelerates and decarbonization becomes increasingly urgent, the power sector is central to the global transition to net-zero.","The Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) announced the launch of the pilot phase for its new draft Power Sector Net-Zero Standard, inviting companies to test the proposed standard aimed at enabling companies across the power sector to set near- and long-term goals aligned with achieving net zero by 2050.

The SBTi released the draft standard in September 2025, set to replace its current “Quick Start Guide for Electric Utilities” with a new standard covering an expanded scope and a broader set of activities and emission sources across the sector’s value chain, for companies involved in power generation, transmission and distribution, and electricity storage, trade and retail.

The SBTi was founded in 2015 with the goal to establish science-based environmental target setting as a standard corporate practice. The organizations’ key functions include defining and promoting best practice in emissions reductions and net-zero targets in line with climate science, providing technical assistance to companies who set science-based targets, and providing companies with independent assessment and validation of their emissions reduction targets. To date, nearly 12,000 companies have set science-based emissions reduction targets with the SBTi, or made commitments to do so.

The organization published its flagship cross-sector Corporate Net-Zero Standard in 2021, and is currently in the process of developing an update to the standard, Corporate Net-Zero Standard V2. The new proposed standard was developed in alignment with the SBTi’s draft Net-Zero Standard V2, while also introducing new methodologies and requirements specific to power sector companies.

One of the key new criteria in the draft standard is a requirement for power sector companies to “publicly disclose a plan to transition away from unabated fossil fuel power generation,” which includes “interim actions to decarbonise, phase-out or retrofit unabated fossil fuel assets, with maximum 5-years milestones up to the net-zero year.” The proposed standard also requires companies to cease investing in new unabated fossil fuel capacity.

The new pilot follows the conclusion of an initial consultation on the draft power sector standard. According to the SBTi, key objectives of the pilot test include ensuring that the new standard and target setting tool are robust, clear and practical, identifying challenges for implementing the standard, informing the development of the final draft of the standard, and testing the feasibility of validating companies against the standard and the clarity of the requirements.

The SBTi said that it is inviting companies across power generation, transmission and distribution, storage, trading, and retail to take part in the new pilot, with applications to participate open until January 16, 2026. Feedback from the consultation and pilot will be used to develop the next draft of the standard

The SBTi said:

“Electricity underpins day to day life and the global economy—from powering homes and industry to enabling digital technologies and innovation. Yet, energy is currently responsible for more than 75% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. As renewable energy deployment accelerates and decarbonization becomes increasingly urgent, the power sector is central to the global transition to net-zero. Establishing a robust, science-based standard is essential for ensuring this transition is both credible and effective.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Electricity-grid.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:56:14.973352

With production potential placing Spain among Europe’s leaders, we outline key measures to create a competitive regulatory framework and foster sustainable investment and project development.

How do you see Spain’s biogas and biomethane market evolving in the coming years?

The updated Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (Plan Nacional Integrado de Energía y Clima – PNIEC) targets 20 TWh of biogas and biomethane by 2030. Yet, in 2024, production was only 319 GWh (according to the CNMC), underscoring the need for optimal conditions to attract investment. Although a growth trend is evident, the sector currently meets just 0.163% of Spain’s gas demand. In short, significant expansion is expected, given its early stage and numerous projects under development.

What are the main regulatory or permitting challenges for developers in Spain?

The absence of a dedicated biomethane framework is one of the main current challenges. Regulation remains fragmented and subject to inconsistent regional interpretations, complicating efficient project delivery. Developers must consider raw material proximity, network access, and social opposition, while navigating frequent rule changes on grid capacity and opaque processes for gas network connections. This situation, combined with the conditional injection capacity currently granted to such projects, further limits project appeal.

What measures could make Spain’s biogas and biomethane market more competitive?

Spain is the third country with the highest biogas production potential in the European Union (163 TWh annually), behind Germany and France.

To unlock this potential, Spanish lawmakers could:

(i) grant biomethane projects public utility status;

(ii) grant them preferential demand access capacity to the electricity grid without subjecting them to capacity tenders;

(iii) guarantee injection capacity into natural gas networks by amending current regulations that only allow conditional capacity; and

(iv) create a basic, specific, state-level regulatory framework.

Public authorities should also promote awareness campaigns to increase social acceptance of these projects, while developers should prioritise responsible, safe, sustainable and transparent development.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white-with-accent/energy---gas-pipleline---teaser.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 12:57:29.097484

The project marks the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal zone.

Production is set to start by 2027 under a long-term offtake deal with Shell.

On December 14, on the sidelines of the Egypt–Qatar Business Forum held in Cairo, Egypt signed an agreement with Qatari conglomerate Al Mana Holding for an initial $200 million investment in a sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production project. The facility will be located in the integrated Sokhna zone on the Red Sea and represents, according to Egyptian authorities, the first Qatari industrial investment in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZONE).

The project will be developed by a newly created entity, Saf Fly, and rolled out in three phases. The first phase is expected to deliver annual production capacity of about 200,000 tons, including SAF, biopropane, and bionaphtha, all derived from refined used cooking oil. Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term supply agreement with Shell, which has committed to purchasing the entire output of the facility. Initial deliveries are expected by the end of 2027, providing early visibility on market outlets and reducing commercialization risks.

The agreement forms part of Egypt’s broader strategy to develop low-carbon aviation fuels. On December 4, the country awarded its first SAF production license to the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), a subsidiary of the state-owned petrochemical holding company ECHEM, for a separate project in Alexandria.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, who attended the signing ceremony, said the initiative with Al Mana Holding reflects the positive momentum in relations between Cairo and Doha. He noted that the project aligns with a shared political commitment to strengthen bilateral cooperation through joint investments and increased trade flows.

SCZONE authorities highlighted the project’s alignment with the area’s sustainability strategy. Its chairman, Walid Gamal El-Din, said the use of sustainable aviation fuel could reduce harmful emissions by between 50% and 80% compared with conventional fuels. He also emphasized the zone’s growing appeal for industrial investors, citing its infrastructure, diversified energy sources, and supportive regulatory framework.

Qatar’s return follows the UAE’s historic $35bn Ras El Hekma deal, marking a competitive shift in Gulf capital flow toward the Nile Valley.

Ranked 9th globally for FDI in 2024, Egypt is negotiating the Alam El-Roum coastal project with Qatari Diar to rival Emirati developments.

The rapid thawing of diplomatic relations between Cairo and Doha has crystallized into tangible economic metrics. Official data released during the Egypt-Qatar Investment Forum reveals that bilateral trade volume increased by 80% during the first ten months of 2025, reaching $143 million.

While this volume remains modest in absolute terms relative to Egypt's total trade balance, the trajectory indicates a sharp political pivot. This normalization was cemented by the announcement from Al Mana Holding, a leading Qatari conglomerate, of a $200 million investment to construct a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) plant. This project targets Egypt’s energy sector, leveraging the country's strategic position to supply green fuels to global logistics networks.

Qatar’s economic re-entry must be analyzed against the backdrop of massive regional competition, particularly from the United Arab Emirates. In early 2024, the UAE signed the Ras El Hekma deal, a historic $35 billion acquisition that stabilized the Egyptian pound and catalyzed a 154% increase in FDI inflows to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region which includes Egypt and Ethiopia among 21 other countries.

In response to this Emirati dominance on Egypt's North Coast, negotiations have advanced regarding the Alam El-Roum peninsula. Reports indicate that Qatari Diar is positioning itself to develop this strategic coastal zone, a move that would signal Doha’s transition from smaller industrial investments to large-scale real estate and tourism infrastructure, directly rivaling the Emirati footprint.

The timing of these investments aligns with Egypt’s improved standing in global capital markets following structural reforms supported by the IMF. According to the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and local economic reports, Egypt ranked as the 9th largst recipient of Foreign Direct Investment globally in 2024.

This macroeconomic stabilization has altered the risk profile for Gulf investors. For Qatar, the current strategy is distinct from previous eras of financial aid; it represents a pragmatic pursuit of high-yield assets in a market that has been de-risked by multilateral support and competitor capital. The focus has shifted from liquidity injection to long-term equity in energy, logistics, and prime real estate.",https://www.ecofinagency.com/media/k2/items/cache/a3652e4158746dc599c29a8997eefa04_S.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 10:57:07.558401

Qatar’s Al Mana Holding has signed a $200m agreement to develop a large-scale sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Egypt’s Suez Canal Economic Zone, positioning the country as a regional hub for aviation decarbonization while deepening economic ties between Cairo and Doha.

The contract, signed on Sunday at Egypt’s New Administrative Capital and witnessed by Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, establishes the first Qatari industrial investment inside the zone. The project will be executed by newly formed Saf Fly Limited and will produce 200,000 tonnes annually of sustainable aviation fuel, BioPropane, and Bio Naphtha derived from refined used cooking oil.

A Strategic Industrial Bet on Aviation Decarbonisation

Al Mana Holding has secured a long-term offtake agreement with Shell covering the plant’s entire production output, with supply scheduled to begin by the end of 2027. Full offtake from a global energy major provides revenue certainty for the project and underscores the growing role of long-term purchase agreements in scaling SAF supply.

Prime Minister Madbouly said the project strengthens the economic zone’s renewable energy credentials while supporting aviation’s transition toward lower-carbon fuels.

“The project reinforces the economic zone’s capabilities in adopting renewable energy sources and supports the aviation sector in line with global environmental standards,” Madbouly said.

The announcement coincided with the Egyptian-Qatari Business Forum held in Cairo, where Madbouly framed the deal as evidence of improving political and economic alignment between the two countries.

“The deal demonstrates positive developments in relations between Cairo and Doha, reflecting a desire by both leaderships to boost bilateral ties and increase joint investments,” he said.

Boson argues that non-recyclable waste can reduce diesel consumption through electrification, cut gas dependence, and produce sustainable aviation fuel –without grid stress.

We can do this at fossil-competitive cost, on attractive commercial terms,” said Jan Grimbrandt, CEO of Boson Energy.","Luxembourg, Gothenburg, Warsaw, Tel Aviv: Is a key to Europe’s energy security sitting in our bins and landfills? The selection of Waste-to-X company Boson Energy by NATO DIANA places municipal waste on the strategic agenda. Boson argues that non-recyclable waste can reduce diesel consumption through electrification, cut gas dependence, and produce sustainable aviation fuel –without grid stress. Resulting in a potential to replace some 440 million barrels of diesel per year at fossil-competitive cost and shielded from hybrid threats.

DIANA, Defence Innovation Accelerator for the North Atlantic, NATO’s deeptech accelerator, has invited 150 innovators from 3,688 applicants globally to the 2026 cohort. Boson is one of six ‘Energy & Power Challenge’ companies selected, to focus on resilient, distributed, and secure energy systems for civilian and defence environments – often referred to as ‘dual use’.

“Waste is a profoundly underestimated strategic resource hiding in plain sight”

Boson describes waste as an overlooked domestic energy source. Unlike large-scale renewable production that depends on extensive transmission infrastructure, its Waste-to-X units can operate ‘behind-the-meter’ on compact sites within urban perimeters – right where waste is produced. Boson also points to rapidly growing urban electricity demand from ‘Edge AI’ datacentres that must be located near real-time applications like autonomous vehicles and drones.

Large impact potential

Boson states that the 230+ million tonnes of non-recyclable EU waste by 2035 have the potential, if deployed in transport electrification, to offset all 440 million barrels of diesel consumed annually by EU trucks and buses. Or support production of 40+ million tonnes of SAF– roughly twice the 20–25 Mt EU mandate for 2050. Boson adds that waste heat recovered could replace one quarter of the natural gas used for EU household heating.

“Our technology and solution transform local waste into local energy, sustainable fuels, and even clean drinking water. We can do this at fossil-competitive cost, on attractive commercial terms,” said Jan Grimbrandt, CEO of Boson Energy.

Next, Boson points to the 6 billion tons of legacy waste in Europe’s landfills as an even larger long-term ‘virtual’ resource, representing the equivalent of 11 billion barrels of diesel – roughly four times the recoverable resources of Johan Sverdrup, Western Europe’s largest oil field. Boson also states the potential to at least one billion tonnes of SAF over time. The resulting heat could replace natural gas comparable to 10 times Romania’s new Neptun Deep gas field – the EU’s biggest.

Distributed systems driving local resilience

Boson explains that its standard Waste-to-X unit can convert 100 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per day into 100 MWh of fast charging. That is the daily waste of roughly 100,000 people and can power 300 to 400 trucks or buses without drawing from the grid. The company highlights the environmental benefits of diverting waste from landfills and incineration, integrating carbon capture, and avoiding fossil transport emissions. Clusters processing 300,000 tonnes of waste per year can produce circular hydrogen and CO₂ for up to 50,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Commercial rollout under way

Boson reports that its core technology has been demonstrated at industrial scale using real municipal waste and that the first commercial projects are under development in France, Poland, Israel, and Australia – together with major waste management and energy companies. Boson works with Siemens AG and other partners to industrialise the solution for rapid rollout. Within DIANA, the company aims to bring understanding across the Alliance for the potential in waste and landfill mining.

Boson CEO Jan Grimbrandt concludes: “The world has a massive, untapped ‘sleeping asset’ in its bins and landfills. DIANA’s selection confirms that distributed generation from local waste has moved from a conceptually appealing idea to a strategic necessity, and we can deliver on that.”

Designed to reduce administrative bottlenecks associated with SAF, the platform addresses a key challenge in scaling SAF adoption among companies in the supply chain.

For aircraft operator clients, the SAF POD will be accessible via the CELESTE platform. It will streamline SAF management by automating the conversion of digital certificates into verified emission reductions and fuel tracking, as well as the issuance of Scope 1 and Scope 3 certificates.

This enhanced functionality simplifies SAF sourcing, tracking, and delivery for operators worldwide.

In addition, JETEX will integrate the Azzera FlyBeyond API tool into its charter sales ecosystem, enabling real-time carbon offsetting and SAF quoting directly within flight quotes.

This technology empowers operators and their customers to make sustainable choices at the point of sale. This marks a significant advancement toward making climate action effortless within private aviation.

Puja Mahajan, CEO of Azzera, says: “The investment from and collaboration with JETEX demonstrates our shared vision of a future where sustainability is seamlessly embedded in every flight.

“Together, we’re bridging the gap between climate ambition and operational reality with practical tools that make sustainability accessible, transparent, and measurable.

“Their investment and involvement will enable us to continue evolving intuitive technology to help our customers, partners, and investors support the global ambitions of reducing carbon emissions.”

Adel Mardini, JETEX CEO, adds, JETEX is one of the world’s largest private aviation companies, and we take our responsibility to support the industry’s ambitious climate reduction goals seriously.

“This is why we have chosen to partner with Azzera in advancing responsible aviation practices. Through innovation and collaboration, we’re driving meaningful progress toward the industry’s decarbonization goals.”",https://evaint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/12/Jetex-Azzera_L_to_R_Adel_Mardini_CEO_Jetex__Puja_Mahajan_CEO_Azzera-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 11:57:10.331933

Signed on Thursday at the São Tomé and Príncipe Investment Forum in Brussels, the three agreements will support energy, climate-smart agriculture, and integrated water-energy-food security.
Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.
The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.
African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.","The African Development Bank Group and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe have deepened their development partnership with $18 million in new grant financing.

Signed on Thursday at the São Tomé and Príncipe Investment Forum in Brussels, the three agreements will support energy, climate-smart agriculture, and integrated water-energy-food security.

The first agreement delivers $7.5 million for the third phase of the Fiscal Sustainability and Resilience Program -Supplementary Financing (FSERP-SF) – part of a budget support operation, launched in December 2023. This brings the cumulative value to $20 million to be disbursed directly into the national budget.

The programme drives reforms across two pillars: fiscal sustainability and energy sector transition. Under the programme, the Government of São Tomé and Principe committed to critical reforms to the public procurement system, customs, and debt management.

On energy transition – a top priority in the country’s National Development Plan – the programme finances improved governance of the national utility, tariff adjustments for cost recovery, and an accelerated transition to renewable energy sources.

This policy framework complements investment in energy transformation in generation and distribution infrastructure. The Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF), administered by the African Development Bank, finances this third phase.

The second financing agreement channels the Global Environment Fund’s (GEF) resources into the Co-Management of Climate Extremes for Agriculture and Fisheries Resilience Project (PRIASA III). The goal is to strengthen agriculture and fisheries value chains while deploying climate-resilient technologies to safeguard livelihoods against droughts, floods, and water scarcity.

With a total investment of $18.9 million, including $10 million in AfDB financing and $8.9 million from GEF, the project will be implemented through three components: enhancing value chains and socio-economic benefits, reducing vulnerability through climate-smart technologies and capacity building, and ensuring effective project management for integrated climate adaptation in agriculture and fisheries.

The third agreement is for a $1.4 million Project Preparation Facility (PPF) for the Water-Energy-Food Security Nexus under the NEW-ERA initiative, to drive sustainable development in the water, energy, and agriculture sectors.

Over two years, the facility will develop critical studies and master plans for integrated water resources management, including a multipurpose dam development, a water treatment plant, climate-resilience measures, and a city-wide sanitation plan.

The PPF lays the groundwork for future investments to deliver universal access to potable water, explore potential hydropower generation, and improve food production by 2030, while strengthening governance and stakeholder capacity. The project will create jobs, enhance ecosystem resilience, and support the country’s climate commitments.

African Development Bank’s Country Manager for Angola and São Tomé and Principe Pietro Toigo said: “As São Tomé and Principe presents to the global community its National Development Plan and approaches investors to power its private sector, these three financing agreements are a clear sign that the African Development Bank stands with the country as a provider of patient capital and risk mitigation”.

The report distributed by the APO Group on behalf of African Development Bank Group (AfDB) stated that as of November 30, 2025, the African Development Bank Group’s active portfolio in São Tomé and Principe totals about $89.4 million, spread across 12 financing instruments, with an average age of 4.2 years and a disbursement ratio of 49.5 per cent. Its sectoral distribution is led by agriculture (43 per cent), followed by multisector operations (23 percent), finance (17 per cent), energy (15 per cent), and water (two per cent).

The Bank’s portfolio reflects a strong emphasis on resilience, food security, energy transition, and macroeconomic reforms, alongside growing engagement in the green and blue economy and financial infrastructure.

Last month, the real estate arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund said it would invest $29.7 billion to develop a luxury real estate and tourism project on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast.

That deal marked the largest Qatari investment in the country since diplomatic relations were restored following a 2017–2021 economic rift when Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism and aligning too closely with Iran, charges Doha denied.

Speaking in the Dewan Negara, Johari said the initiative is aimed at turning Malaysia into a regional SAF hub while improving investor confidence in the domestic industry, according to a report by Utusan Malaysia.

He said the government is making it easier for companies to obtain approvals for building facilities, producing SAF and exporting the fuel, adding that faster and clearer processes would encourage industry players to base their operations in Malaysia.

Johari was responding to a question from Senator Che Alias Hamid on steps being taken to attract foreign investors beyond offering tax incentives.

The minister said Malaysia is capitalising on its status as the world’s second-largest palm oil producer by using feedstock such as used cooking oil, palm oil mill effluent oil and other palm-based biomass for SAF production.

He added that efforts are also under way to increase public awareness about the collection of used cooking oil, while the government is studying measures to ensure that raw materials used for SAF remain sustainable over the long term.

Level 1 accreditation recognises airports that have defined their operational boundary and mapped their corresponding emission sources under Scope 12 and Scope 23 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, as well as compiled a latest annual carbon footprint report.

This achievement underscores RSI’s position as a pioneer in sustainable aviation infrastructure and marks the first step on its pathway towards reaching the highest level of accreditation (Level 5[1]) by 2027, in line with global climate goals.

RSI has been conceived from the ground up to set a new benchmark in airport sustainability. Built to LEED Platinum standards, the airport embeds environmental stewardship across design, construction and operations. Its modular pod-based terminal system allows capacity to scale with demand, ensuring that energy consumption remains tightly aligned to passenger flows. By maximising natural light and modular usage, this design approach significantly reduces the overall energy demand when compared with traditional centralised terminal structures.

RSI is also the first airport in Saudi Arabia to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to aircraft, supporting the wider decarbonisation of the aviation sector. Complementing this, the airport is also rolling out all-electric ground service equipment.

To further safeguard the integrity of its surroundings, RSI’s growth is intentionally limited. RSG designed its destinations to accommodate no more than one million visitors a year at The Red Sea, and 500,000 visitors annually to AMAALA, ensuring development remains within environmental thresholds and natural carrying capacity. This measured approach reflects RSI’s role not just as a transport hub, but as a guardian of two of the world’s most pristine destinations.

Together, these measures position RSI as a global benchmark for sustainable airport operations, with Level 1 accreditation confirming its rigorous commitment to measuring, managing and reducing carbon emissions on its journey to net zero on scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2027.

“I think we're living in a tariff world for the indefinite future.” Cutler’s talk focused on the theme “What's Next for U.S.-Japan Trade?” Jill O'Donnell, the Haggart-Work Director of the Yeutter Institute, led the discussion with Cutler.
Through extensive trade negotiations with the United States this year, Japan achieved a reduction to 15% in the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto exports, down from 25%.
Japan also agreed to invest an additional $550 billion in a variety of projects in the United States.
“This could end up really biting the United States because these agreements will have commitments and market opening, but that will be reserved for the participants to the agreements,” she said.","For decades, the United States and Japan have built one of the world’s most successful and stable trade partnerships — a relationship Wendy Cutler says remains vital as the global economy grows uncertain.

Cutler, senior vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator who spent nearly 30 years working on U.S./Japan issues, discussed the future of this partnership during a Nov. 19 event sponsored by the Clayton Yeutter Institute of International Trade and Finance.

“We're not going to go back to where we were on trade,” Cutler said. “I think we're living in a tariff world for the indefinite future.”

Cutler’s talk focused on the theme “What's Next for U.S.-Japan Trade?” Jill O'Donnell, the Haggart-Work Director of the Yeutter Institute, led the discussion with Cutler.

Mike Boyle, president of Kawasaki Motors Manufacturing Corp., introduced Cutler after briefing the audience about his company and the extensive market connections linking Japan and the United States. Japan is the No. 1 foreign investor in the U.S. and in 40 states including Nebraska, said Boyle, a Husker alum with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. Japan’s total investment in the U.S. tops $819 billion and employs 968,000 people.

Japan is the No. 1 foreign buyer of Nebraska pork and the No. 2 importer of Nebraska beef and corn. In 2024, Nebraska’s exports to Japan totaled almost $700 million. More than 120 Nebraska companies are actively involved in trade with Japan.

The Kawasaki plant in Lincoln, which marked its 40th anniversary last year, has 3,000 employees making off-road vehicles, railcars, subway cars and large parts for Boeing aircraft. The 2.3 million-square-foot facility is the largest manufacturing plant in Nebraska.

Kawasaki’s Lincoln operations partner with more than 1,200 U.S. suppliers nationwide employing 22,000 people, and in 2024 the plant’s purchases of U.S. parts and services totaled $893 million.

The Lincoln plant also used $517 million in imported parts and materials, and the Trump administration’s stepped-up tariffs this year required the company to pay an additional $170 million in import taxes. The tariff costs have “really been disruptive to our business,” Boyle said.

Cutler said she regularly hears from U.S. companies that are holding off from making investment decisions due to the uncertainties generated by ever-shifting tariff levels. Ironically, American automakers haven’t achieved a significant cost advantage against Japanese competitors, she said, because the Trump administration’s 50% tariffs on imported steel and aluminum have caused spikes in input costs for U.S. automakers and other domestic manufacturers.

Through extensive trade negotiations with the United States this year, Japan achieved a reduction to 15% in the U.S. tariff on Japanese auto exports, down from 25%. Japan’s agricultural constituency is a powerful political interest that will always push for trade protection, Cutler said, but U.S. agricultural producers will benefit from Japan’s new pledge to buy an extra $8 billion each year of U.S. exports including corn, soybeans, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

Japan also agreed to invest an additional $550 billion in a variety of projects in the United States. The arrangement is unusual and gives the United States great leverage in decision-making, but Japan’s commitment seems genuine, said Cutler, who served as the assistant U.S. trade representative for Japan, South Korea and the Asia-Pacific area.

If the Supreme Court rules that the administration acted beyond its constitutional powers this year in abruptly imposing tariffs under the 1977 International Economic Emergency Act, the executive branch will have other tariff-imposing tools, but they will be far more slow-moving and procedurally complicated compared to what the world has seen this year, Cutler said.

Just as the U.S. recently lowered tariffs on food items such as coffee and bananas, the administration will likely face pressure to provide additional exclusions on some goods, especially as midterm elections approach in 2026, she said.

The United States’ aggressive and ever-changing approaches on tariffs have given countries “a wake-up call” about U.S. unreliability as a trading partner, Cutler said, and many are pursuing bilaterial and regional trade agreements intended to shift their trade away from the United States.

“This could end up really biting the United States because these agreements will have commitments and market opening, but that will be reserved for the participants to the agreements,” she said. Over the long term, “we could really end up losing out if we don't find a way to integrate our economy more with other countries around the world.”",https://news.unl.edu/sites/default/files/styles/lead_image_teaser/public/media/images/CW0A0256%20E.jpg?itok=F-0Qcu05,N,,2025-12-15 02:56:38.484514

“The ban on internal combustion engines is history,” Weber commented. “We are delivering on our election promise: technological neutrality: combining climate protection with economic success.”

‘Create uncertainty’

Responding, the European Green Party said that it ‘strongly regrets’ reports that the EPP is aiming to weaken the phase-out of petrol and diesel cars, with co-chair Ciarán Cuffe saying that such a move would “create uncertainty, stifle innovation, and weaken Europe’s position in the global race for clean automotive technologies”, ceding leadership in the EV space to China.

“The 2035 zero-emissions standard is a cornerstone of EU climate policy, providing certainty for industry and investors while accelerating the shift to clean mobility,” he said. “The future of mobility is electric. The EU needs a real industrial policy and strategic direction instead of changing strategy every year, so Manfred Weber is acting irresponsibly.”

‘A grave mistake’

Fellow European Green Party co-chair Vula Tsetsi said that weakening or delaying the 2035 phase-out would be a “grave mistake that pushes Europe backwards”, undermining the EU Green Deal, creating uncertainty for industry, and slowing the green transition.

On top of the RIN credits that both biodiesel and SAF collect through the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, SAF also attracts up to $1 per gallon credit through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit scheme.
For example, there is a proposal to introduce a stronger price signal for SAF production through the Energy Taxation Directive, which would provide a tax exemption.","Very few people want to give up flying. It’s how we stay connected with family, expand business opportunities and take holidays to relax. This makes scaling the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—along with other technological developments such as battery-powered planes—critical if we want to continue flying while trying to stop climate change. Without it, we risk significantly reducing, or even losing, our freedom to connect. First-generation biodiesel (fatty acid methyl ester or FAME) producers who have the feedstock, capability and resources to switch to SAF production may hold the fate of air travel in their hands.

A Growing Market for SAF

Although SAF currently represents less than 1% of the overall jet fuel market, several countries including Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Turkey and Brazil will introduce SAF mandates from 2026 or 2027. This will add to existing commitments from the United Kingdom and European Union. Meanwhile, several more countries are considering the introduction of SAF targets in the coming years. With growing global demand, supportive policy regimes and a significantly underserved market, now is the time for interested biodiesel producers to make the switch before feedstocks become difficult to secure.

With global SAF demand expected to rise 10-fold from 2024 to 2030, supply pressure on feedstock is already becoming apparent. For example, in late 2024, the Intercontinental Exchange launched a dedicated used cooking oil futures contract in response to rising demand, creating the opportunity for participants to better manage their price exposure.

Securing Long-Term Feedstock Contracts

When considering an investment in the construction of a SAF plant, one of the major constraints is the availability of feedstock on a long-term supply contract. Consequentially, existing biodiesel producers with contracts in place that can be diverted to make SAF start from a place of advantage.

The need for long-term contracts is further underscored by the changes we can expect to see in feedstock import and export volumes. Around 90% of the U.K.’s SAF is currently produced using imported cooking oil from China. However, with China’s plans to introduce its own SAF targets, some producers will need to begin sourcing alternate feedstocks closer to home. Altogether, having feedstock contracts locked in early in the project development process is essential for managing risk and optimizing project returns.

Financial Incentives Set to Expand

One of the key benefits of moving from biodiesel to SAF production within the next couple of years is the attractive financial incentives currently on offer, particularly in the U.S. market. On top of the RIN credits that both biodiesel and SAF collect through the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, SAF also attracts up to $1 per gallon credit through the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit scheme. State credits can also pay up to an additional $1-$2 per gallon for SAF. This brings total incentives for SAF to up to $3.50 per gallon more than biodiesel.

While in Europe there are no dedicated financial incentives yet, changes on the near horizon look promising. For example, there is a proposal to introduce a stronger price signal for SAF production through the Energy Taxation Directive, which would provide a tax exemption. The European Commission is also expected to release a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan later this year, in which industry bodies such as ACI Europe have called upon to allocate specific EU funds to develop SAF production facilities.

Although SAF plants are currently more expensive to build than an equivalent capacity biodiesel plant, incentive regimes, along with the premium price levied on SAF, make for attractive project returns. For most U.S. projects, the typical payback period has fallen to under three years, creating a compelling case for investment.

Technology Choice Significantly Impacts Project Economics

For biodiesel producers considering converting their facilities, a preliminary techno-economic assessment will estimate the cost of construction, the volume of SAF that will be produced, operational costs such as utilities and financial incentives available. Reusing auxiliary existing infrastructure from the biodiesel plant, such as housing, pretreatment systems and tankage, can reduce product costs by 20%-30%.

Currently, eight technology pathways exist to manufacture SAF, but the HEFA pathway (i.e. hydrotreating fats, oils and greases) offers the industry’s fastest payback and lowest total cost of production while producing comparable yields. This is made possible by the latest innovations which move away from traditional trickle-bed design, as well as opting for a modular build.

For example, Sulzer’s BioFlux technology is a two-stage liquid full hydrotreating process that first removes the oxygen from the oil and then isomerizes it so that the hydrocarbons resemble jet fuel. Rather than using a conventional trickle bed reactor design which is prone to hot spots, BioFlux uses a liquid full reactor design where the catalyst bed is completely submerged in liquid feed with hydrogen dissolved using a proprietary internals design, leading to homogeneous mixing. This significantly improves the efficiency and efficacy of the reaction, optimizes the volume of hydrogen needed and extends the life of the catalyst. In addition, the process has less equipment, so it is simpler to maintain and more reliable. For example, the traditional method requires gas compressors for recycling the vapor; instead, BioFlux eliminates the vapor recycle loop and gas compressors and uses pumps to move the effluent.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cont1_BDM_1_26_8f5259cd8e.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 01:56:30.832273

Johari was responding to a supplementary question from Senator Che Alias Hamid on how the government plans to ensure a stable supply of raw materials to support the growing SAF industry.

Addressing concerns over feedstock availability, Johari said the government would move to halt exports of used cooking oil to safeguard domestic supply and would adopt a circular economy approach within plantation activities to ensure long-term sustainability of raw materials.

In a separate explanation, the minister said the government has also introduced a range of measures to attract both local and foreign investment into the SAF sector. These include streamlining approval processes for plant construction licences, production licences and export permits.

“The government will continue to assist and facilitate industry players interested in operating in Malaysia.

“These measures send a clear signal of the government’s full support for investors seeking to enter the SAF industry,” he said.

The announcement, confirmed by Egypt’s cabinet, marks the first Qatari industrial investment inside the zone and reflects growing economic cooperation between Cairo and Doha.

According to the government statement, the SAF facility will span 100,000 square metres within the Integrated Sokhna Zone on the Red Sea coast and will be developed in three phases. The first phase will produce an estimated 200,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel annually, placing Egypt among a growing group of countries investing in cleaner energy for global aviation.

The deal comes as Egypt continues its push for large‑scale foreign investment to help manage heavy external debts and a widening budget deficit. Gulf states, including Qatar, have become key partners in this strategy.

Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said the agreement reflects “positive momentum” in relations between the two countries, citing shared political will to deepen joint investment and trade after years of turbulent ties. Diplomatic relations were restored in 2021 following the end of the 2017–2021 regional rift.

The new SAF project follows Qatar’s recent announcement of a $29.7 billion luxury real estate and tourism investment on Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, the largest Qatari commitment in Egypt since relations normalised.

Regional Significance and Energy Context

The move aligns with broader global trends as nations race to create cleaner aviation fuels capable of easing pressure on climate commitments. The Suez Canal Economic Zone has positioned itself as a manufacturing and logistics hub for renewable energy, green hydrogen, and industrial projects with export potential.

The project also arrives at a time when energy markets are shifting rapidly. Gulf investors have increased strategic acquisitions across Africa and the Mediterranean to secure long‑term economic influence and diversify beyond oil.

TVOA Insight

Africa’s partnerships in energy and technology are becoming more strategic, and Egypt’s deal demonstrates how nations on the continent are positioning themselves inside a changing global economy. Africa is young, still building, and cannot be compared to economies with centuries of head starts. What matters is momentum, and deals like this show that African countries are not waiting for permission to enter industries of the future. With the right investment climate, youth talent, and cross‑regional cooperation, the continent’s emerging markets can shape cleaner aviation, sustainable industries, and new economic pathways that reflect Africa’s long‑term potential.

District cooling is more efficient than conventional chiller systems, which are unlikely to be operating at optimal efficiency at all times as cooling demand of a building fluctuates.
For instance, during peak periods, the Marina Bay district cooling system melts stored ice to provide cooling.
Moreover, the implementation of urban planning policies that take district cooling into consideration can lead the way for greater adoption.
SP Group’s vision District cooling was once unheard of in Singapore, and an uncharted territory for SP Group.","SP Group aims to address the region’s rising cooling needs with the more energy-efficient district cooling system.

Southeast Asia, like the rest of the world, continues to heat up. Rising in tandem is the high demand for cooling in its major cities and beyond. According to the United Nations, global air-conditioning use is expected to triple by 2050.

Aside from exacerbating the region’s dependence on energy, air-conditioners release heat into the environment to increase temperatures further. This contributes to greater pressure on power grids to remain reliable during peak periods.

In this interview with Asian Power, Stanley Huang, Group CEO of SP Group, Singapore’s national grid operator and a leading sustainable energy solutions provider in Asia Pacific, noted the need for more efficient and sustainable forms of cooling to meet the growing demand.

When cooling demand tests grid reliability

Think of a giant air-conditioner that can cool an entire district, rather than just individual buildings, in a more energy-efficient way. This is district cooling, a system that centralises chilled water production for cooling before piping the water to multiple buildings for air-conditioning. It can provide a respite, and more.

District cooling is more efficient than conventional chiller systems, which are unlikely to be operating at optimal efficiency at all times as cooling demand of a building fluctuates. Instead, a district cooling system is expected to operate closer to its optimal efficiency level most of the time as it will accurately select the most suitable mix of chillers to meet the aggregated cooling demand of multiple buildings. One example is the world’s largest underground district cooling network at Singapore’s Marina Bay operated by SP Group.

“The network has scaled smoothly over the years to serve more buildings and larger cooling loads without compromising performance. It has become a reliable backbone for Singapore’s downtown core, with zero disruptions since operations began in 2006,” said Huang.

District cooling systems can also incorporate technologies like an ice thermal energy storage system to reduce pressure on power grids during high cooling demand. For instance, during peak periods, the Marina Bay district cooling system melts stored ice to provide cooling. This approach relieves grid stress without compromising cooling comfort.

“The system has more than proven its engineering and operational robustness,” added Huang. “Today, it remains a testbed for innovations in energy-efficient cooling and grid integration in Singapore and across the region.”

This solution comes at a time when national grids are increasingly working overtime to keep us comfortable. The International Energy Agency recorded that about a third of Southeast Asia’s electricity demand growth is attributed to cooling. Space cooling is also the fastest-growing source of energy demand in buildings, increasing by nearly 4% annually to 2035.

A greener way to cool cities, industries

District cooling has the potential to be a mainstay in decarbonising the Asia Pacific’s built environment and meeting organisational or even national net-zero targets.

Take the example of Singapore’s largest industrial district cooling plant at global semiconductor firm STMicroelectronics’ (ST) Ang Mo Kio TechnoPark. It is expected to reduce 120,000 tonnes of carbon emissions a year at ST’s single largest wafer-fabrication site by volume – a boost for the company’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2027.

But for district cooling to enjoy uptake across the region, governments and industries must work together on clear national sustainability strategies to reduce regulatory complexities and encourage investment through green financing models. Moreover, the implementation of urban planning policies that take district cooling into consideration can lead the way for greater adoption.

An example of this is Singapore, which introduced incentives for buildings that join a district cooling network. These buildings can either exclude spaces used by their chiller plants connected to a district cooling system from the development’s gross floor area use or remove their old chillers to repurpose that space for commercial use. Several buildings in Tampines Central, Singapore’s first town centre to be retrofitted with a distributed district cooling network, are already on board.

SP Group’s vision

District cooling was once unheard of in Singapore, and an uncharted territory for SP Group. But 20 years on, it stands as a prime example of Singapore’s ability to innovate and scale sustainable infrastructure.

SP Group has taken these learnings beyond Singapore to deploy sustainable cooling solutions in China, Thailand, and Vietnam.

Today, SP Group is using its extensive experience to help cities and industries in the Asia Pacific transition to energy-efficient cooling – from a government complex in Bangkok, Thailand, to commercial mixed-use developments in Western China.

“For Southeast Asia’s tropical climate, air-conditioning is a necessity for business and lifestyle operations to provide thermal comfort,” Huang noted. “With district cooling, we can decarbonise the built environment by supporting greener buildings and align with the region’s low-carbon goals to deliver a climate-resilient future.”",https://www.cmgassets.com/s3fs-public/styles/opengraph/public/2025-12/article-thumbnail-resizer-1200x628-3.png?h=131e0991&itok=KhSIcoJJ,N,,2025-12-15 01:57:20.634916

Fifth Freedom rights serve as both an economic tool and diplomatic lever, with liberal jurisdictions promoting them to enhance connectivity, while others limit access to protect domestic carriers, affecting trade patterns and competitive dynamics.

Maximising their value requires streamlined approvals, robust transhipment infrastructure, and alignment with sustainability goals, ensuring that network efficiencies support growing global cargo demand while meeting environmental and regulatory standards.

Eighty years after its signing, the 1944 Convention on International Civil Aviation, known as the Chicago Convention, continues to underpin the governance of international air transport. Created in the final phase of the Second World War to restore order to civil aviation, it established a core principle: every state exercises full sovereignty over its airspace. Yet, to make international aviation viable, states also needed to grant limited operating rights to one another. This balance between sovereignty and mobility produced the “Freedoms of the Air”, which remain central to commercial aviation.

As airfreight becomes increasingly important to global trade, these same freedoms now influence which cities rise as logistics hubs, which airlines expand, and how supply chains are structured. Recent examples, including China Eastern Airlines’ Fifth-Freedom service linking China to Budapest via Riyadh, highlight how these rights operate in practice and why they matter to the next phase of airfreight growth.

Chicago’s enduring architecture

Signed by 52 nations in 1944 and now comprising 193 contracting states, the Convention established a regime that combines national sovereignty with structured cooperation under the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Two core instruments emerged:

• the Convention itself, which established ICAO and set regulatory standards; and

• the International Air Services Transit Agreement (IASTA), which created the First and Second Freedoms—the right to overfly and to make technical stops.

The commercial freedoms, including the Third, Fourth, and Fifth, were left to bilateral agreements. These determine whether an airline may carry revenue traffic between foreign states. Passenger airlines have generally used them sparingly, but cargo carriers have converted them into strategic assets.

The significance of the Fifth Freedom

The Fifth Freedom—the right for an airline to carry traffic between two foreign countries on a service that originates or ends in its home country—has become fundamental for cargo networks. It enables carriers to blend markets, improve aircraft utilisation, and create commercially viable long-haul routings.

A carrier operating a Shanghai–Riyadh–Budapest rotation, for example, can move Chinese exports to the Middle East before transporting Middle Eastern shipments to Europe. This maximises payloads, reduces empty backhauls, and forms new trade corridors not served by direct home-country flights.

IATA’s 2024 Air Cargo Market Analysis shows global demand rising 10.6 percent year-on-year, driven primarily by intercontinental flows. Multi-leg routings—many enabled by Fifth-Freedom permissions—account for a growing share of capacity, particularly between Asia, the Middle East, and Europe. Sectors such as pharmaceuticals, electronics, and perishables rely heavily on these routings, where delays of even one day risk undermining product value.

Economic tool and diplomatic lever

Despite strong commercial logic, Fifth Freedom rights remain politically sensitive. States evaluate traffic rights through the lens of national interest, balancing trade facilitation with the protection of domestic airlines. Air-service agreements govern these decisions, defining capacity, routes, designated carriers, and the scope of permitted freedoms.

In practice, Fifth Freedom operations require agreement from three states: the airline’s home country, the intermediate stop, and the final destination. Liberal jurisdictions such as Singapore, the UAE, and the Netherlands promote these rights to strengthen trade and logistics connectivity. Others, such as India and China, grant them selectively to safeguard national carriers.

As ICAO observes, these permissions function as “instruments of economic diplomacy”, requiring states to weigh sovereignty against broader connectivity gains.

Network economics and competitive models

Fifth Freedom rights reshape the economics of freighter deployment by enabling multi-point routing that balances demand across multiple legs. Aircraft such as the Boeing 777F and Airbus A350F operate more efficiently when integrated into circuits linking Asia, the Middle East, and Europe.

This model parallels the development of Sixth Freedom hub operations, such as those in the Gulf region, where carriers consolidate traffic from numerous origins and redistribute it globally. The “networkisation” of air logistics—connecting manufacturing centres, consumption markets, and transhipment hubs—is built on the flexibility provided by these freedoms.

Policy priorities for airfreight

To modernise the system without altering the Convention’s structure, three policy priorities stand out:

Streamlining traffic-rights approvals

Fifth Freedom applications often face administrative delays. Standardised approval processes would improve responsiveness in a sector that moves nearly 35 percent of global trade by value.

Enhancing transhipment infrastructure

Liberal rights must be matched by adequate physical capability. Airports such as Dubai’s DWC, Singapore’s Changi Airfreight Centre, and Luxembourg Findel Airport demonstrate the value of integrating cold chain, bonded logistics, and digital customs systems.

Aligning with sustainability mandates

Under ICAO’s CORSIA and IATA’s Net Zero 2050 roadmap, growth in Fifth-Freedom operations must align with sustainable aviation fuel uptake and operational efficiencies.

Competition, protectionism, and the road ahead

While Fifth Freedom rights enhance efficiency, they also trigger competitive concerns. The European Union incorporates fair-competition provisions in agreements to prevent market distortion, while the United States grants open-skies rights selectively. Developing economies must balance liberalisation with domestic industry growth. India’s restrictive Fifth-Freedom policies, for example, have limited transhipment potential at major airports despite national ambitions for cargo expansion.

As airfreight becomes integral to global economic infrastructure, the principles set out in 1944 remain relevant. Yet uneven liberalisation and infrastructure disparities risk fragmenting the global cargo network. The future lies not in rewriting the Convention, but in harmonised, data-driven frameworks reflecting twenty-first-century trade realities.

The Fifth Freedom, once an abstract diplomatic concept, has become a competitive differentiator and a catalyst for supply chain resilience—making freedom of the air increasingly synonymous with freedom to trade.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Page-5-shutterstock_1627386802.jpg,N,,2025-12-15 01:58:46.608333

The company has also taken steps over the past several years to derisk its book of business by reinsuring billions of low return-on-equity and non-core business lines, particularly long-term care insurance, it added.

Manulife’s ERM program is judged as “very strong” by AM Best.

We will have created a booming market for “green” fuel that isn’t truly green.
Even with an all-out effort, SAF production will be constrained for decades.","DECEMBER 15 — The future of flying is already here. It’s called Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). It’s being hailed as the magic bullet that will allow us to keep our wanderlust without cooking the planet.

A new comprehensive review by Klimczyk, Jasiński, Niklas, and Siedlecki cuts through the hype with precision, revealing a simple, uncomfortable truth: SAF is indeed the only viable path to decarbonising aviation in the near-term, but the journey to making it truly sustainable is far more complex and perilous than we’ve been led to believe.

The authors clearly lay out the menu of production pathways. We have the established workhorses, like HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids), which can turn used cooking oil into jet fuel today. It’s the low-hanging fruit.

Then we have the promising but pricey future: alcohol-to-jet, gasification of agricultural residues, and the holy grail — power-to-liquid (PtL) or e-fuels, synthesised from captured carbon and green hydrogen. And herein lies the first critical insight: There is no single “best” SAF. The right choice is entirely contextual, a delicate and location-specific calculus of feedstock availability, energy input, and ultimate environmental payoff.

This is where the study’s focus on Lifecycle Assessment (LCA) becomes paramount, delivering its most potent dose of reality.

The “sustainable” in SAF is not a given; it must be earned. The core promise of SAF is its potential for near-carbon-neutral flight, as the CO2 released when it burns is roughly equal to the CO2 absorbed by its biomass feedstocks during growth.

But LCA forces us to look at the entire picture: the emissions from farming, fertilising, harvesting, transporting, and processing. It’s a full accounting, and the devil is in the details.

The review exposes the critical trade-offs. Do we use a waste feedstock like forestry residues, which has minimal land-use impact, or do we cultivate dedicated energy crops that might be more efficient but could compete with food production or drive deforestation?

This “indirect land-use change” (ILUC) is the ghost in the many well-intentioned biofuels. A fuel that looks clean on paper can be responsible for a carbon bomb if it indirectly causes a rainforest to be cleared elsewhere.

This brings us to the crux of the argument: Our current obsession with a single number — the percentage blend of SAF — is dangerously myopic. The EU’s ReFuelEU mandate and the US Inflation Reduction Act tax credits are powerful drivers, but if they focus only on volume and not on quality, they risk creating a monster.

We could hit our 10 per cent SAF target by 2030, but if that fuel is primarily made from questionable feedstocks with high ILUC values, we may have solved a political problem while exacerbating an ecological one. We will have created a booming market for “green” fuel that isn’t truly green.

This is where the authors’ discussion of certification frameworks becomes vital. Systems like CORSIA and the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive II are the arbiters of truth, the ones tasked with defining the rulebook for what counts as “sustainable.”

The review suggests that while these frameworks are a necessary starting point, they are not yet sufficient. They must be strengthened to fully account for ILUC, water usage, and social impacts with unflinching rigour. A weak certification is a greenwashing enabler.

So, where does this leave us? The work of Klimczyk et al. is not a obituary for SAF, but crucial for its responsible deployment. We must prioritise the right pathways. While HEFA gets us started, we cannot be lulled into complacency.

The real endgame must be the scaling of advanced biofuels from true residues, and a massive, global push to bring down the cost of power-to-liquid fuels. This requires a Manhattan Project-level investment in electrolyser and direct air capture technology. Policy must reward carbon intensity, not just volume.

A litre of SAF should be valued based on its actual, certified lifecycle emissions. This would create a market pull for the best fuels, not just the cheapest ones. We must be honest about limits. Even with an all-out effort, SAF production will be constrained for decades. It cannot be the only solution. It must be paired with radical efficiency gains in aircraft and operations, and a sober conversation about the necessity of some air travel.

SAF is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. It is a bridge to a future of truly clean aviation. The comprehensive review is the essential blueprint. It tells us the bridge is possible, but it also shows us where the foundations are weak and the design is flawed. Our job is to build it right, lest it collapses under the weight of our expectations.

Oliver’s Real Food Limited is positioning its new Feel-Good Meal as a strategic driver for family growth in 2026, using health-led differentiation and playful packaging to lift sales and shift its menu mix.

The new menu offers a choice of mini char-grilled chicken burger, pure beef burger, certified baked organic chicken nuggets, or baked vegetarian rice nuggets. It also caters to a variety of dietary requirements, allergens, and preferences.

Meanwhile, sides include baked potato chips, baked sweet potato chips, or steamed green beans. Each meal is paired with an all-natural 100% fruit juice popper (apple or orange) and a collectable “Ollie the Orange” keychain toy. The meal is priced at $14.95.

The launch of the menu itself was intentional, with Oliver’s planning to target families during the school holiday break.

“The inclusion of playful packaging and a collectable toy is intended to drive repeat visits and positive brand engagement, which could shift the menu mix towards more family and kids’ offerings,” Natalie Sharpe, CEO of Oliver's Real Food, told QSR Media in an email interview.

Sharpe, who is also a licensed dietitian and nutritionist, co-created the meal, developing it on a single nutrition principle: serving fresh, nutritionally dense whole foods and avoiding frying altogether.

This standard was upheld even when balancing taste, cost, and operational demands.

“The core nutrition principle is the commitment to serving fresh, nutritionally dense wholefoods, and explicitly avoiding frying. All meal components are baked, steamed, or grilled, never fried, and the menu is designed to be balanced and healthy, with transparency in sourcing and ingredients,” Sharpe said.

Following the launch of the Feel-Good Meal, Sharpe also announced that the brand will soon launch a new loyalty program, with the Feel-Good meal, along with other Oliver’s menu items, playing a part in this new loyalty programme.

India has already conducted test flights with sustainable fuel. Air Vistara, now merged with Air India, operated a transatlantic test flight of a Boeing 787 from the US to India using 28% blended fuel in March 2023. Air Asia operated the first commercial domestic flight (Pune to Delhi) with 0.75% blended fuel the same year.

A much-awaited policy for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will likely be released for stakeholder consultations next month, the official cited above said on condition of anonymity. Meanwhile, a top industry executive said installed production capacity of ethanol exceeds demand by 4.22 billion litres currently, which is enough to meet the initial target for SAF.

In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) introduced the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) scheme to limit aviation emissions to 85% of 2019 levels, requiring decarbonisation initiatives by carriers globally.

India, a member of ICAO, has to comply with mandatory phases of carbon offsetting in aviation from 2027.

The international aviation entity recognises 11 pathways to switch to green jet kerosene, and ethanol made from byproducts of sugar are carbon neutral, said Deepak Ballani, the director general of the Sugar & Bio-Energy Manufacturers’ Association (ISMA), a leading industry body.

“SAF based on ethanol had the least carbon intensity, according to studies done in partnership with organisations such as Deloitte (consulting firm) and The Energy Research Institute (TERI). The government is drawing insights from these studies,” Ballani said.

The government is working in collaboration with organisations, such as ISMA, on preparing a biofuels programme and road map. Distilleries have conducted several trials to supply ethanol for low-carbon jet kerosene and the government is likely to announce a policy for sustainable aviation fuel by next month, the official quoted above said.

In July, India achieved the target of mixing 20% ethanol — an alcohol compound extracted from sugarcane molasses and grains — with petrol, a move towards paring oil imports.

“India has an inherent advantage in producing ethanol due to its unique ecosystem that binds farmers and millers in historic partnerships,” Ballani said. However, there will be some challenges in rolling out SAF, unlike E20, because it will require trilateral partnerships between distilleries, oil marketing companies and airlines, he said.

The Centre is implementing the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN (Jaiv Indhan - Vatavaran Anukool fasal awashesh Nivaran) Yojana, offering financial aid for biofuel plants, including for sustainable aviation fuel. Over 30 new distilleries have been set up by ethanol producers on the back of these incentives.

The government offers interest subvention for five years, including a one year moratorium, against the loan availed by project proponents from banks at 6% per annum or half the rate of interest charged by banks, whichever is lower, for setting up of new ethanol-producing distilleries.",https://www.hindustantimes.com/ht-img/img/2025/06/30/1600x900/logo/ht-generic_india3_1751287297962_1751287304722.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 20:57:24.909101

Demand for logistics assets and data centres continues to be robust, driven by e-commerce expansion, digitalisation, and AI adoption, according to a report by investment platform Syfe.

“S-REITs play a key role in Singapore’s capital market, accounting for around 10% of the Singapore Exchange’s total market capitalisation. More than 90% of S-REITs own assets outside Singapore, offering investors diversified exposure across Asia Pacific, South Asia, Europe, and the US,” Syfe said.

A separate report by DBS said Singapore’s industrial property market continues to outperform expectations, demonstrating resilient demand, sustained rental growth, and stabilising occupancy across warehouses, factories, and business parks, despite elevated new supply.

The multi-user and warehouse segments remain star performers, whilst business parks are rebounding, backed by high pre-commitments and rising rents. DBS said the overall improvement in the quality and offerings of industrial stock is expected to be a key driver, with the bank forecasting 6%–7% rental growth next year.

DBS also said that positive rental reversions, improving financing costs, and sustained net property income (NPI) growth are placing industrial S-REITs on a firmer footing, with earnings compound annual growth rate projected at about 1.3% over the next two years, compared to around 0.5% growth in FY2025.

Active capital recycling and the resumption of equity fundraising are enabling REITs to pivot towards higher-quality assets, supporting earnings stability even amid new supply and global uncertainties that continue to weigh on near-term sentiment.

DBS noted that a majority of the sector’s $3b acquisition pipeline is expected to complete only in H2 2025, implying that more meaningful earnings uplift will materialise in FY2026.

Amongst individual names, DBS said CapitaLand Ascendas REIT stands out, with strong operational execution and $1.3b in accretive acquisitions set to accelerate earnings.

The SCZone has attracted around $13 billion in foreign investment over the past three years, including $4.2 billion in the past year alone and $4 billion over the past five and a half months.
The project aims to transform the area into a coastal tourism and investment hub, with the first phase scheduled to begin in 2026.
Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib said Egypt’s economy is “moving in the right direction” under its International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform programme.","Egyptian officials said the forum aims to deepen joint manufacturing projects and strengthen supply and value chains in industries, including aluminium, automotive manufacturing, textiles, glass, and polyester, combining Egyptian production capacity with Qatari capital and investment expertise.

Qatari investments in Egypt currently stand at about $3.2 billion through more than 266 companies operating in sectors such as finance, industry, and tourism, according to Egyptian data. Doha has announced plans to invest a further $7.5 billion in Egypt in projects spanning tourism, real estate, food security, and development along the North Coast.

On the sidelines of the forum, Deputy Prime Minister for Industrial Development and Minister of Industry and Transport Kamel Al-Wazir discussed maritime cooperation with Qatar’s Minister of Foreign Trade Ahmed bin Mohammed al-Sayed, including potential partnerships in managing container and general cargo terminals.

The Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone) has signed its first Qatari investment agreement, a $200 million project with Qatar’s Al Mana Group, marking a new milestone in foreign investment in the zone. Under the agreement, Al Mana Group will establish the first Qatari-owned factory within the SCZone, specialising in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as well as biopropane and bionaphtha, using recycled used cooking oils.

The SCZone has attracted around $13 billion in foreign investment over the past three years, including $4.2 billion in the past year alone and $4 billion over the past five and a half months.

SCZone revenues reached EGP 8.25 billion in the 2023/2024 fiscal year, a 36 percent increase from the previous year.

Trade between Egypt and Qatar rose by nearly 80 percent, from $80 million in 2023 to $143 million in the first 10 months of 2025, driven largely by recent Qatari investments, including large-scale North Coast developments launched in November.

One of the largest projects is the $29.7 billion Alam Al-Roum development, led by Qatari Diar, the real estate arm of the Qatar Investment Authority, in partnership with Egypt’s New Urban Communities Authority. The project aims to transform the area into a coastal tourism and investment hub, with the first phase scheduled to begin in 2026.

Egyptian officials say the project is expected to generate more than 250,000 jobs and include residential, tourism, and leisure developments, as well as power distribution facilities, water desalination and treatment plants, hospitals, schools, universities, and administrative infrastructure.

General Authority for Investment and Free Zones (GAFI) chief Hossam Heiba said foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows to Egypt have risen, with investment rates growing by about 25 percent over the past year and company capital increasing by 70 to 80 percent over the same period.

Officials attributed the increase to economic reforms aimed at stabilizing macroeconomic policy, expanding private-sector participation, and digitizing government services.

Investment and Foreign Trade Minister Hassan El-Khatib said Egypt’s economy is “moving in the right direction” under its International Monetary Fund (IMF)-backed reform programme. The IMF has previously said Egypt’s economic indicators improved faster than expected following recent policy measures, praising progress on investment and trade reforms during its latest review missions under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) programmes.

The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.
Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic.
If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights.
According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow.","Airbus is experimenting with a flight formation inspired by nature in an effort to cut fuel consumption and reduce aviation’s environmental footprint. The concept borrows directly from how birds fly in groups, using airflow dynamics to improve efficiency—much like the slipstream effect seen in Formula 1 racing.

The European aerospace giant is behind the initiative, known as Fello’fly, a project designed to optimize flight routes by taking advantage of aerodynamic lift created by aircraft flying ahead. The goal: lower fuel burn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and help airlines save money at a time of rising costs and mounting climate pressure.

How the Fello’fly concept works

The idea is simple in theory but complex in execution. Two aircraft fly in a coordinated formation similar to migrating geese. One plane leads, generating wake turbulence that creates a slight upward lift. The aircraft behind can then “ride” that airflow, improving fuel efficiency through a phenomenon known as wake energy recovery.

Airbus has already completed several successful test flights in partnership with Air France, Delta Air Lines, French bee, and Virgin Atlantic. These trials focused on validating whether such formations could be flown safely, precisely, and within existing aviation regulations.

Successful tests over the North Atlantic

According to French business outlet BFM Business, Airbus carried out eight test flights over the North Atlantic between September and October 2025. The objective was to prove the operational feasibility of guiding two aircraft to a precise rendezvous point while maintaining vertical separation, as required by air traffic control rules.

If applied to commercial operations, Airbus estimates that this technique could reduce fuel consumption by up to 5% on long-haul flights. That reduction would translate directly into lower CO₂ emissions—a meaningful gain for an industry under intense scrutiny.

Why fuel savings alone won’t solve aviation’s climate problem

While innovations like Fello’fly can help, their overall impact remains limited. Several structural challenges continue to slow progress toward more sustainable air travel.

The high cost of cleaner fuels, a shortage of new aircraft, and the relentless growth in global air traffic all work against deeper emissions cuts. Passenger numbers keep climbing year after year, putting added pressure on airlines and the environment.

A future with more passengers—and more planes

Airbus forecasts that global air travel will reach 8 billion passengers by 2040, nearly double the 4.5 billion recorded in 2019. Meeting that demand will significantly expand the world’s aircraft fleet over the next two decades.

According to a study by the environmental group Transport & Environment (T&E), the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—which emits less CO₂ over its lifecycle—will continue to grow. However, the study warns that even if SAF accounts for 42% of fuel use, as required under European regulations, the aviation sector would still burn as much fossil kerosene in 2049 as it did in 2023.

A key driver of this change is the creation of sophisticated market infrastructure, such as RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which has received CFTC approval. This platform is enhancing transparency, liquidity, and risk management in the clean energy derivatives space. For institutional investors, these advancements open up fresh possibilities to diversify holdings and meet ESG objectives, especially in an era of modest returns.

Building the Backbone of Clean Energy Markets

Robust infrastructure is the cornerstone of thriving, liquid clean energy markets. In 2025, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Technology Commercialization allocated over $35 million to support 42 projects through the CLIMR Lab Call, aiming to bridge the gap between laboratory breakthroughs and commercial-scale deployment. At the same time, private companies are making strides in essential technologies: Helion Energy’s Orion fusion facility in Washington is set to deliver 50 MW to Microsoft’s data centers, while TAE Technologies is making plasma formation more cost-effective and less complex, advancing the promise of fusion energy. Progress in hydrogen infrastructure is also notable, with Southwest Research Institute leading projects to test high-pressure valves and underground storage solutions. Collectively, these initiatives are overcoming long-standing challenges in scalability and reliability, paving the way for greater institutional investment.

CleanTrade: Driving Market Liquidity and Openness

At the center of this market transformation is RESurety’s CleanTrade platform, which gained CFTC approval as a Swap Execution Facility (SEF) in September 2025. By offering a regulated environment for trading Virtual Power Purchase Agreements (VPPAs), Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), and Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), CleanTrade has resolved persistent inefficiencies in clean energy derivatives. Within just two months of its debut, the platform saw $16 billion in notional trading volume, reflecting strong institutional trust in ESG-focused assets. Enhanced by real-time analytics, carbon tracking, and robust risk management features, CleanTrade meets the rigorous standards of institutional investors.

Beyond streamlining transactions, CleanTrade is transforming the investment landscape by standardizing contracts and introducing transparent price discovery. This reduces the information gaps that have historically deterred clean energy investment. The platform’s ability to hedge against renewable energy price swings through structured derivatives gives investors greater confidence—a crucial advantage as energy markets are increasingly shaped by policy changes and technological innovation.

Portfolio Diversification and Risk Control in a Low-Yield World

The emergence of liquid clean energy markets coincides with a broader trend among institutions to seek alternative assets. According to a 2025 U.S. report, private equity, hedge funds, and infrastructure have become central to institutional portfolios as investors search for returns in a low-interest-rate climate. Clean energy derivatives, made accessible through platforms like CleanTrade, offer a valuable addition to these strategies. They provide access to rapidly growing sectors such as hydrogen and fusion, while also enabling cross-asset hedging to manage systemic risks.

Incorporating ESG considerations is now a mainstream priority for institutional investors. Assets that support decarbonization are increasingly favored, and CleanTrade’s transparent carbon tracking ensures compliance with evolving regulations. For example, the platform’s verification of renewable energy production and carbon offset credits enables investors to achieve Scope 2 targets under the SEC’s climate disclosure requirements. This dual emphasis on financial returns and environmental responsibility strengthens portfolio resilience, especially as markets contend with the long-term effects of climate change.

Looking Ahead: The Next Era of Clean Energy Investment

As innovation, regulatory clarity, and institutional interest converge, liquid clean energy markets are poised to become a foundational element of future investment portfolios. The U.S. clean energy lending sector, which expanded by 7.6% in the first half of 2025 compared to the previous year, highlights the sector’s growth potential. Meanwhile, advancements in long-duration energy storage by companies like Form Energy and the development of sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure by Twelve Energy are broadening the applications for clean energy assets.

For investors, seizing this opportunity means leveraging platforms like CleanTrade to access structured, liquid, and ESG-compliant investments. As the energy transition accelerates, those who incorporate these assets into their diversification strategies will not only protect themselves from traditional market risks but also position themselves at the forefront of a transformative economic era.",https://img.bgstatic.com/video/open_graph_new.png,N,,2025-12-14 14:57:04.703475

In FY 2024–25 alone, IndianOil invested over ₹460 crore in social development, positively impacting millions of lives.

Values That Drive the Company

IndianOil is guided by five strong values:

Nation-First

Care

Innovation

Passion

Trust

To reinforce these values, 30 June is celebrated every year as IndianOil Values Day.

Upgrade Your Decision Making: Choose your Airbus Narrative

Earlier we mentioned that there is an even better way to understand valuation, so let us introduce you to Narratives, a simple way to connect your view of the Airbus story to the numbers by turning your assumptions about future revenue, earnings and margins into a financial forecast and a Fair Value estimate. On Simply Wall St’s Community page, millions of investors use Narratives as an accessible tool to spell out their thesis, link it to a forecast, and then compare their Fair Value to today’s share price to decide whether Airbus looks like a buy, hold, or sell. Because Narratives update dynamically when fresh news, earnings, guidance or industry data comes in, your thesis evolves as the facts change rather than staying frozen in time. For example, one investor might build a Narrative that leans on the most bullish analyst targets, strong backlog growth and smooth production ramp ups, leading to a higher Fair Value than the current price, while another might focus on supply chain risks, slower margin expansion and the lowest analyst targets, producing a much lower Fair Value and a more cautious stance.

A continent that hosts 18 percent of the world’s population accounts for barely 3 percent of global air passenger traffic.

Even more telling, three quarters of international passenger traffic into Africa is carried not by African airlines but by foreign carriers. This imbalance is not simply a market curiosity but a sign of deeper structural challenges.

Air transport is anything but a luxury. It is a lifeline for landlocked nations, a catalyst for tourism, a conduit for trade, and a bridge across a geography where road, rail, and marine infrastructure are often fragmented or underdeveloped. In short, aviation is a strategic enabler of integration and growth.

Yet African carriers continue to limp from year to year with margins so thin they barely amount to commercial viability. The latest financial outlook from the International Air Transport Association (Iata) underscores this reality.

It projects that African carriers will earn only $0.2 billion in profit in 2025 and 2026. This translates into net margins of 1.1 percent in 2025 and 1.0 percent in 2026—the lowest of any region worldwide.

Profit per passenger tells an even starker story: $1.40 in 2025 and $1.30 in 2026, compared with a global average of $7.90. African airlines are carrying more passengers, yet earning far too little from each seat.

This weakness is particularly troubling because underlying demand is robust. Passenger traffic is expected to grow by 6 percent in 2026, well above the global forecast of 4.4 percent. But capacity growth lags at 5.7 percent, constrained by older fleets, high financing costs, and limited liquidity. Africa is participating in the global aviation recovery, but without the financial stamina needed to sustain long-term growth.

The causes are structural. Africa has the highest operating costs of any aviation market globally, with cost per available tonne-kilometre nearly double the global average.

Fuel—already a major cost everywhere—is up to 20 percent more expensive in Africa due to taxes, storage fees, weak supply competition, and logistical inefficiencies. Ageing aircraft consume more fuel and require more maintenance, further inflating operating costs.

Read: African airlines brace for another year of thin margins as old challenges persist

Market fragmentation, reinforced by restrictive bilateral agreements and inconsistent visa regimes, suppresses intra-African travel and keeps airfares high in price-sensitive economies.

Taxes and charges, averaging 28 percent, compound the problem. These levies push ticket prices beyond the reach of ordinary travellers and erode airline margins.

Rising labour costs, airport fees, and the growing expense of sustainable aviation fuel add new pressures. Supply chain delays slow fleet renewal, leaving African airlines with some of the oldest aircraft in the global industry even as competitors modernise. Without deliberate action, they remain exposed to every shock — from fuel volatility to geopolitical disruption.

A reset is essential. Unless there is a decisive review of aviation taxes, charges, and the broader cost of doing business, Africa’s airlines will remain trapped in a cycle of underperformance. Governments must reassess aviation taxes, and liberalise market access to unlock meaningful economies of scale.

Accelerating open skies policy, modernising fleets through targeted incentives, and abandoning restrictive bilaterals would all reduce operating costs and stimulate traffic.

Only then can African airlines transition from survival mode to sustainable profitability—and provide the connectivity on which the continent’s future depends.",https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/resource/image/5296708/landscape_ratio3x2/1200/800/24670b5ec01e08ad6297a1fc0d54e5f0/XC/plane-1-.jpg,N,,2025-12-14 00:56:22.153936

The parties believe that the partnership has the potential to advance HEFA and next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF pathways

The parties intend to jointly evaluate the future development of New Rise Louisiana, a SAF facility comparable in size to XCF’s New Rise Reno facility of ~40 million gallons

XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX); Southern Energy Renewables Inc. (“Southern”); and DevvStream Corp. (“DevvStream”) (Nasdaq:DEVS) (together “the parties”) today announced a non-binding tripartite memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) to jointly explore the potential development of a next-generation low-carbon fuels platform designed to accelerate SAF adoption, expand domestic capacity, and integrate environmental-attribute monetization into a unified customer offering.

By 2030, the U.S. SAF market is projected to reach nearly $7 billion, while global demand is expected to exceed 5.5 billion gallons, supporting a global market of more than $25 billion. By that time, approximately 4 billion people are expected to live in countries that utilize SAF for air transportation. Looking ahead to 2050, the global SAF market could exceed $250 billion. This collaboration is intended to position the parties around a unified platform that directly supports this long-term growth.

The collaboration would seek to increase long-term SAF supply across multiple production pathways while advancing the transparency and commercialization of environmental attributes. As part of the negotiation of a binding agreement, the parties expect to evaluate the commercial viability of developing a HEFA-based SAF facility in Louisiana.

Potential Unified Commercial Platform and Strategic Integration

The parties intend to negotiate a definitive collaboration agreement which, if executed, would create a collaborative venture that intends to develop a unified commercial platform that enables customers to procure fuel, logistics services, and environmental-attribute value through a single integrated offering. If developed, this structure would be expected to simplify procurement, improve pricing efficiency, and enhance long-term customer retention across the aviation and industrial markets.

Chris Cooper, Chief Executive Officer of XCF Global, said:

“This collaboration has the potential to create the foundation for a first-of-its-kind, fully integrated low-carbon fuels platform – linking production, logistics, and environmental-attribute systems into a seamless value chain. If we succeed in combining Southern’s developmental stage biomass-to-methanol-to-jet technology, DevvStream’s environmental-attribute and digital MRV capabilities, and XCF’s HEFA production and commercial infrastructure, we see the potential to build a revolutionary end-to-end system that unlocks new value for customers and potentially accelerate the scaling of SAF in a disciplined, capital-efficient way.

“Our goal is to modernize how low-carbon fuels are produced, certified, and delivered – not as isolated components, but as an integrated solution aligned with the needs of global aviation and corporate sustainability programs.”

Potential Environmental-Attribute Monetization and Digital Infrastructure

A core component of the potential collaboration is expected to be the integration of environmental-attribute capabilities, including voluntary and compliance carbon credits, CORSIA units, renewable energy certificates, digital MRV solutions, and tokenized environmental-attribute tracking systems. Under the MOU, DevvStream is expected to lead the generation, verification, and monetization of environmental assets associated with the potential platform’s low-carbon fuels.

The parties plan to work towards jointly evaluating solutions to help customers capture, verify, and monetize environmental attributes, including LCFS credits, RINs, and benefits under 45Z/45Q. The parties also plan to evaluate lifecycle analysis (“LCA”) methodologies and carbon-intensity optimization systems which may strengthen project economics and support high-integrity SAF development.

Carl Stanton, Chairman of DevvStream, said:

“Integrating environmental assets directly into the fuel value chain is essential to accelerating SAF deployment. This collaboration has the potential to bring together three distinct strengths – XCF’s production expertise, Southern’s developing advanced biomass platform, and DevvStream’s environmental-asset monetization capabilities – to help improve project economics while giving airlines confidence in the integrity of their SAF purchases.”

Potential Multi-Pathway SAF Collaboration and Offtake Framework

The parties intend to explore a long-term offtake framework under which XCF could purchase SAF which will eventually be produced by Southern, subject to mutual agreement on commercial terms, in order to capitalize on long-term global demand for SAF.

A key anchor for the potential collaboration is Southern’s planned biomass-to-fuel facility in Louisiana, expected to produce approximately 28 million gallons of SAF and 220 kilotons of methanol per year, supported by an estimated $1.4 billion total project investment, according to Southern.

The parties further intend to explore multiple SAF production pathways with the goal of accelerating the adoption of SAF worldwide to address the forecasted industry demand noted above, including:

Southern’s in-development, next-generation biomass-to-methanol-to-jet SAF platform;

XCF’s HEFA-based SAF platform; and

Joint carbon-intensity and co-product optimization strategies

Jay Patel, Chief Executive Officer of Southern, added:

“We believe partnering with XCF and DevvStream would strengthen our ability to scale a multi-pathway SAF strategy grounded in real production capacity and real climate benefit. We are eager to work together to further develop our experimental $SAF token on Solana with DevvStream. Further, we believe Louisiana has the workforce, infrastructure, and feedstock resources to become a national leader in low-carbon fuels, and we see this potential collaboration as a major step toward that future.”

Exploration of New Rise Louisiana SAF Facility

The parties plan to assess the potential development of New Rise Louisiana, a proposed HEFA SAF facility. The evaluation process is expected to include engineering, permitting, feedstock integration, logistics, and financing strategies.

XCF and Southern also plan to evaluate municipal financing pathways in Louisiana, following recent momentum from the Louisiana Community Development Authority, which authorized up to $402 million in potential revenue bonds for Southern’s biomass-to-fuel project, subject to additional approvals, documentation, and market conditions. While not representing committed capital and there can be no assurance that any such bonds will ultimately be issued or that any particular amount of funding will be available, the authorization underscores Louisiana’s growing role as a U.S. clean-energy manufacturing hub. Any XCF participation in Louisiana municipal financing strategies would be separate from and in addition to Southern’s existing authorization. There can be no assurance that XCF will be able to secure any Louisiana municipal financing.

Cooper added:

“We believe Louisiana offers a compelling combination of infrastructure, talent, and policy support. We expect our evaluation of New Rise Louisiana will allow us to determine whether our modular HEFA platform can complement Southern’s developing biomass capabilities while fitting squarely within our disciplined, capital-efficient growth model.”

The MOU reflects a shared intent to collaborate on SAF and other low-carbon fuel opportunities. Any specific offtake arrangements, investments, or project development activities described in this release remain subject to confirmatory due diligence, negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, internal corporate approvals, and any required regulatory or permitting approvals. Accordingly, the MOU does not commit any party to proceed with any particular transaction or project.

Dalam sambutannya, Wamenlu menyampaikan bahwa Indonesia terus berupaya mengimplementasikan standar keberlanjutan demi memajukan industri kelapa sawit. Kendati banyak tantangan dalam implementasinya, tetapi kita harus tetap optimis.

Dubes Arif mengungkapkan saat ini Indonesia masih bisa bernapas lega karena Uni Eropa masih menunda penerapan regulasi EUDR. Penundaan ini dilakukan setelah Uni Eropa juga mendapatkan desakan dari internal, termasuk diantaranya dari industri kendaraan. Sebagai informasi, regulasi keberlanjutan EUDR juga mengatur terkait peternakan.

Dengan adanya aturan EUDR, negara-negara di Eropa menolak hasil peternakan yang tidak lolos sertifikasi keberlanjutan. Di sisi lain, industri kendaraan yang membutuhkan bahan baku dari peternakan, kulit sapi untuk jok misalnya, akan kelimpungan dengan adanya aturan itu lantaran susah mendapatkan pasokan dan menaikkan harga bahan baku.

Sementara itu, Ditya Agung Nurdianto selaku Direktur Perdagangan Internasional Kemenlu menyampaikan kegiatan ini sebagai upaya untuk menyamakan persepsi tantangan yang dihadapi oleh petani kelapa sawit dan juga petani kakao dalam memenuhi standar keberanjutan internasional seperti EUDR.

The election is highly polarized and will determine the direction of the country amid growing concerns over security, migration, and economic stagnation.

Jeannette Jara represents the continuity of the leftwing Unity for Chile of incumbent President Gabriel Boric Font against the Republican (rightwing) José Antonio Kast, who is making his third attempt to reach La Moneda on his harsh stance regarding irregular migrants and also promising broad tax cuts.

Sunday's runoff follows the Nov. 16 elections, where former Labor Minister Jara secured approximately 27% of the vote, narrowly edging out former Congressman Kast, who finished with about 24%.

Both candidates have made security a central pillar, but with opposing approaches. Kast promises a hardline, “iron fist” strategy, including military deployment to troubled areas and harsher penalties. Jara focuses on strengthening the police, investing in the prison system, and cutting off the financial streams of organized crime.

On the economic front, Jara advocates for boosting social rights, raising the minimum wage, and implementing a more progressive tax system. Kast, an admirer of Argentine President Javier Milei, proposes a radical reduction in the State's size and lowering the tax burden on businesses.

Political analysts widely view the election as a contest between extremes. Despite Jara's narrow win in the first round, Kast is generally seen as the favorite, largely because other right-wing candidates who collectively took over 50% of the vote in the first round have endorsed him. His victory would mark the most significant conservative shift in Chile's leadership since the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990).

For the first time since 2012, voting is compulsory for most citizens, with fines imposed for non-voters. Over 15 million citizens are eligible to cast their ballots, with polls open from 8 am to 6 pm local time.

KLM argues that such a fund is necessary to accelerate the domestic production of alternative aviation fuels, make them more affordable, and fast-track the sector’s sustainability, reports news.klm.

KLM CEO Marjan Rintel emphasized that meaningful progress requires collaboration and a more active government role.

“Real progress can only be achieved if government and industry work together and if the government takes a more active role. KLM urges policymakers to adopt this recommendation,” she stated.

KLM fully supports the report’s conclusion that aviation is vital for safeguarding prosperity and maintaining the Netherlands’ position as an innovative ecosystem. The airline stressed that the industry, centered around Schiphol Airport, is crucial for the nation’s economic strength, trade, employment, and international competitiveness.

“It is therefore vital that we invest collectively in a future-proof aviation sector rather than restrict it or impose additional national charges. Doing so would undermine the Netherlands’ competitive position and the global connectivity on which our prosperity depends,” the company warned.

KLM confirmed it is heavily investing in cleaner operations, noting that SAF is currently one of the most effective ways to reduce aviation CO₂ emissions, achieving at least a 65% reduction across its lifecycle compared to traditional jet fuel.

The airline already blends more SAF than mandated by European regulations and has committed to a long-term purchasing agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl. However, to meet the national goal of a 14% SAF blend by 2030, these fuels must become more widely available and significantly more affordable. KLM argued that government investment, similar to support provided for wind and solar energy, is essential.

KLM views the national SAF fund as a mechanism to align with European initiatives, such as the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality. The airline recommends the fund focus on three key areas:

Making SAF Affordable for Airlines: The fund should bridge the current price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene using incentives. KLM estimates that an annual investment of €60 million could increase the SAF blend by an additional one percent.

Accelerating Production and Access to Raw Materials: The fund should improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove obstacles to building necessary infrastructure, accelerating domestic production scale-up.

Investing in Innovation: Support should be channeled into developing next-generation technologies like e-SAF, positioning the Netherlands as a European leader in innovation.

The major success is attributed to the dedication of the Gamleby team to drive change.
Hearing the news about the grant made the result even better, but we would have continued regardless,” said Henrik Nilsson, Industrial Engineer at Saab’s Barracuda facility.
“The success here has really grown the enthusiasm across the Barracuda team and wider Saab.","The Barracuda facility in Gamleby, which manufactures camouflage for Saab, has achieved a massive reduction in its carbon footprint by introducing a biogas system into its production process. This single change is projected to fulfill nearly 50% of Saab’s overall company-wide carbon dioxide (CO₂) reduction target for 2025 while also increasing the security of the factory’s energy supply, reports SAAB.

The shift to biogas effectively cuts the Barracuda facility’s total CO₂ emissions by 65% and creates opportunities for further environmental improvements in the future.

When the Saab Barracuda management team first began exploring ways to reduce their emissions, few expected that one modification could be so transformative. The major success is attributed to the dedication of the Gamleby team to drive change.

“This was our strategy and our goal from the beginning. We want Saab to be a leader in sustainability, but we also wanted Barracuda to set the example within the company. We moved forward with this project because we believed in it, and we managed to secure the necessary support,” explained Charlotta Fridell, Production Manager at Saab Barracuda in Gamleby.

Manufacturing camouflage is a process that requires a lot of energy and heat. The process involves heating two boilers, which are now powered by biogas but previously used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This heat is then used to dry the camouflage material.

This heating process previously generated 1,250 tonnes of CO₂ annually. With the switch to biogas, the process now creates almost zero direct emissions.

Beyond the reduction at the factory, the move improves overall environmental performance because the old LPG had to be transported to Sweden by ship from Eastern Europe, generating large emissions throughout the delivery process. The new biogas, however, is produced locally in Sweden. Some of the organic waste used to create the gas even comes from the nearby town of Västervik, making it a truly local and sustainable supply chain that also enhances energy security.

The team started looking into biogas after securing funding from Saab’s internal Climate Fund for initial studies in 2022. They later learned from Västervik Council that a grant from the Swedish climate organization, Klimatklivet, might also be possible.

“We committed to the project in the third quarter of 2024, before we received confirmation from Klimatklivet that we would get the grant. Hearing the news about the grant made the result even better, but we would have continued regardless,” said Henrik Nilsson, Industrial Engineer at Saab’s Barracuda facility.

Planning began shortly after, and the new biogas system was successfully installed over a six-week period during the summer production break in 2025. This allowed production to resume on schedule, a key factor for management.

Now, the Barracuda team is already looking ahead, investigating the feasibility of capturing the excess energy from the production process to heat the rest of the factory, as well as finding spaces to install solar panels for further gains.

“The success here has really grown the enthusiasm across the Barracuda team and wider Saab. This is something we needed to do to contribute to Saab’s environmental goals, but also something we wanted to do as an example to others of what is possible. It was a real team effort from Saab management, the environment team, and those involved in production here in Gamleby,” Ms. Fridell concluded.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-14.png,N,,2025-12-13 10:56:37.262013

Today, according to that same census, Arkansas forests boast a hefty 1.1 billion tons of standing timber.
According to the Arkansas Division of Forestry, each year our forests grow by more than 50 million tons, while all harvests and removals are 27 million tons.
Enter Arkansas' forest industry.","Arkansas' forests are overweight and becoming more obese every year.

According to the U.S. Forest Service census of our forests, our forests had 630 million tons of standing timber in 1970. Today, according to that same census, Arkansas forests boast a hefty 1.1 billion tons of standing timber. We have added about 10 percent to our forest land, but that still represents a whopping weight gain.

The growth of our forests isn't slowing down ... yet. According to the Arkansas Division of Forestry, each year our forests grow by more than 50 million tons, while all harvests and removals are 27 million tons.

That means every year, our forests are increasing their stocking by about 23 million tons. Our forests are becoming unhealthy.

My cardiologist tells me that I cannot keep gaining weight every year or I'll have some real health problems. Forests don't have heart attacks, but they are subject to insects, diseases and fires that can ravage the landscape and peoples' lives.

Check the news about forests out west -- pine beetles and wildfires are on the upswing.

Enter Arkansas' forest industry. It supports more than 50,000 jobs in the state and represents nearly 4.1 percent of our state's economy -- all on a renewable resource that supports wildlife, clean water and some of the best recreation in the nation. You can think of the forest industry as a way of ""exercising"" our forest and managing its health.

Yes, we obtain products and jobs from our forests, but forest managers are most concerned with promoting the sustainability and health of our forests.

The money and jobs are really a side benefit of good forest management. The voluntary adoption of sustainability standards is just one demonstration of the forest industry's commitment to the long-term health of our forests.

But our forests are outgrowing our industry. There is more forestland than we can effectively manage. If this continues, Mother Nature -- in the form of insects, diseases, fires and climate events -- will rebalance the scale. It is inevitable. And while some might think that Mother Nature knows best, the side effects of insects, disease, fires and storm-damaged forests is incredibly detrimental to Arkansans. Ask the good folks of Paradise, Calif., where the 2018 Camp Fire killed more than 85 people and displaced about 50,000, how they feel about uncontrolled wildfire.

A TALE OF TWO FUTURES

One future has us staying the course towards forest catastrophe. In this future, Arkansas' rural towns lose their paper mills and sawmills, leaving forest landowners without affordable ways to manage the health of their forests. Dense forests are feeding grounds for bark beetles and diseases. Dying and dead forests are vulnerable for wildfires. Homes, property, whole towns and lives are lost. Again, I refer the reader to recent events in the forests of the American West.

Another future supports our forest industry with innovative and forward-thinking policy. The most critical need is a market for small-diameter trees that landowners typically send to paper mills or use for products such as wood pellets for energy. Potential markets for this small-diameter wood include emerging technologies, such as sustainable aviation fuel, and existing technologies, such as combined heat and power or combined natural gas and wood pellets.

The advantage of using renewable wood for energy production is clear. It provides rural jobs in communities already dependent on our forest. At the same time, it gives landowners tools to improve the health of their forest and produces more wildlife habitat, clean air and clean water. The landowners and communities also get the side benefit of jobs and income.

These infrastructural characteristics can limit the types of aircraft that can be deployed efficiently. In this context, turboprop aircraft offer performance features - such as effective take-off and landing capabilities on shorter runways - that make them particularly suitable for regional networks. As a result, they play a central role in ensuring stable and reliable connectivity across a wide range of territories.

These aircrafts have been around for many years: they have propellers in front of their engines and create speed and power by directly spinning the blades. In contrast, a jet engine creates a blast of air which passes behind the plane and pushes it forward.

Turboprop engines produce high thrust at lower speeds making them efficient to take off and land on much smaller airstrips.

That’s just one of the reasons why they have become an increasingly popular option with airlines. In recent years, the turboprop has also gained renewed attention for its suitability in supporting regional mobility strategies.

Lower Altitudes Needed

Turboprop engines generate thrust by driving the propeller. This allows maximum thrust to be achieved at much lower revs than jet engines. Jets create thrust by pushing air out the back; the faster they turn, the more air, or thrust, is generated.

Turboprop aircraft fly at a lower speed and lower altitude compared to similar size jets. This makes them perfect for regional connectivity.

Maintenance

Turboprop aircraft burn less fuel than similar size jet aircraft. They have fewer moving parts compared to traditional jet (turbofan) engines, which can simplify some aspects of maintenance.

Fuel Usage

Because turboprop engines produce thrust efficiently at lower RPM and are optimized for lower-speed flight, they consume significantly less fuel than comparable jets.

It’s similar to driving a car—pushing for higher speeds uses more fuel. This efficiency improves operational performance and helps airlines open additional regional routes, supporting better access for smaller communities.

Improved Sustainability

The aviation industry is working toward having net-zero emissions by 2050. It’s a challenge, but it could make a dramatic difference to the amount of CO2 being pumped into the atmosphere.

Using turboprop aircraft for regional flights reduces fuel usage as we just said and, therefore, emissions. In addition, some aircraft manufacturers, such as ATR, already offer turboprop planes which can use 50% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). ATR completed the first successful commercial flight using 100% SAF in 2022 proving that new technology can be achieved without expensive modifications.

By adopting solutions such as turboprops capable of SAF operations, airlines contribute to the sector’s ongoing progress toward decarbonisation, supporting efforts already underway across the industry.

Airlines which have switched to turboprop aircraft for regional flights are benefiting from cost savings and reducing environmental damage. These, and the above factors, make regional flights attractive to customers. In turn, this makes the airline’s investment valid, effectively regenerating regional connectivity and making smaller cities more connected.",https://www.bbntimes.com/images/ATR_Turboprop_Aircraft_-_Flight.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 11:56:58.956016

Willie Walsh, Director General, IATA, said: “Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 per cent net margin and a USD 41 billion profit in 2026.
Ancillary revenues will grow 5.5 per cent to USD 145 billion, accounting for 14 per cent of total revenue.
Latin America and Africa will post smaller but positive results, at USD 2 billion and USD 0.2 billion, respectively.
Conclusion The IATA outlook positions 2026 as a year of consolidation rather than acceleration — profitability is holding steady, but margins remain thin.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released its latest global airline industry outlook, projecting a stabilised yet record-breaking year for airline profitability in 2026, with combined net profits estimated at USD 41 billion, up from USD 39.5 billion in 2025. Despite this growth, the net profit margin will hold steady at 3.9 per cent , underscoring a cautiously optimistic trajectory for the sector.

According to the forecast, airlines are expected to report USD 72.8 billion in operating profit, with an operating margin of 6.9 per cent , driven by steady demand, cost discipline, and resilient travel appetite. However, return on invested capital (ROIC) is expected to remain below the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) at 6.8 per cent vs 8.2 per cent , reflecting structural profitability challenges.

Advt

Total industry revenues are forecast to reach USD 1.053 trillion, while passenger numbers will rise to 5.2 billion, up 4.4 per cent year-on-year. Cargo volumes are expected to expand 2.4 per cent to 71.6 million tonnes, supported by robust e-commerce and semiconductor-related shipments.

Willie Walsh, Director General, IATA, said:

“Airlines are expected to generate a 3.9 per cent net margin and a USD 41 billion profit in 2026. That’s extremely welcome news considering the headwinds the industry faces — rising costs, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain bottlenecks. Airlines have built shock-absorbing resilience that is now delivering stable profitability.”

Walsh also highlighted persistent imbalance within the aviation value chain, noting that while airlines form the backbone of global connectivity and economic activity, their margins remain far below those of other sectors.

“Airlines underpin nearly 4 per cent of the global economy and support 87 million jobs, yet industry-level margins remain minimal. The sector’s potential could be even greater if profitability across the value chain were more equitably distributed.”

Revenue and Cost Outlook

Passenger revenues are projected to rise 4.8 per cent to USD 751 billion, with load factors at a record 83.8 per cent .

Advt

Cargo revenue will reach USD 158 billion, driven by time-sensitive shipments and e-commerce.

Ancillary revenues will grow 5.5 per cent to USD 145 billion, accounting for 14 per cent of total revenue.

Fuel costs are expected to dip slightly to USD 252 billion, comprising 25.7 per cent of total operating expenses.

Labour costs will remain high, forming 28 per cent of the cost base, as wage growth continues to outpace inflation.

The industry’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) spend is projected to reach USD 4.5 billion, representing 0.8 per cent of total fuel use, while CORSIA compliance costs will grow to USD 1.7 billion.

Regional Performance

Europe will remain the most profitable region, with USD 14 billion in net profit and a 4.9 per cent margin.

North America will post USD 11.3 billion in profit, maintaining 3.4 per cent margins despite domestic slowdowns.

Asia Pacific is expected to record USD 6.6 billion, led by strong recovery in China and India.

Middle East carriers will continue to lead in margin performance at 9.3 per cent , reflecting their hub strength.

Latin America and Africa will post smaller but positive results, at USD 2 billion and USD 0.2 billion, respectively.

Air Cargo and Resilience

Air cargo continues to outperform expectations, supported by flexible routing amid trade shifts and tariff-driven demand realignment. Walsh described air freight as “the hero of global trade,” citing its critical role in maintaining supply continuity amid economic and geopolitical turbulence.

Traveller Sentiment

An IATA global survey found 97 per cent of travellers satisfied with their last air travel experience, with 88 per cent agreeing that aviation enhances quality of life. Most respondents recognised air connectivity as vital to the economy and sustainable development, reinforcing the industry’s social and economic importance.

Conclusion

The IATA outlook positions 2026 as a year of consolidation rather than acceleration — profitability is holding steady, but margins remain thin. With supply chain constraints, infrastructure costs, and regulatory burdens persisting, airlines must balance stability with strategic efficiency to sustain long-term growth.

A team of researchers from Tohoku University found that the rare-earth element europium (Eu) was the key to controlling the selectivity of this reaction for C1 or C2+ products.
At low Eu concentrations, certain bonds are weakened that lead to C-C coupling and produce C2+ via the frustrated deep hydrogenation of *CHO.
For high Eu concentrations, certain bonds become strengthened instead, which facilitates the deep hydrogenation of *CHO to CH4 via the C1 pathway.
This research provides a design concept for ""dialing in"" desired carbon products from CO2 using earth-abundant Cu-based catalysts and rare-earth promoters.","The electrochemical CO2 (carbon dioxide) reduction reaction takes harmful pollutants and transforms them into valuable products like fuel. However, selectively tailoring various processes in this reaction to successfully and efficiently arrive at a particular desired outcome remains a challenge.

""We want to be able to tailor this reaction so we can accurately predict what the result will be each time—and to control what that result is,"" explains Hao Li (Distinguished Professor, Advanced Institute for Materials Research (WPI-AIMR)).

A team of researchers from Tohoku University found that the rare-earth element europium (Eu) was the key to controlling the selectivity of this reaction for C1 or C2+ products. Their findings are published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

When atomic Eu was incorporated into Cu2O, it was able to shift the dominant product depending on whether Eu concentration was high or low. For example, low Eu-doped Cu2O achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of nearly 80% for C2+ products, while higher Eu doping tips the pathway toward C1 products such as CH4.

Theoretical calculations and other observations imply that the mechanism behind this involves the way Eu facilitates different reactions depending on its concentration.

At low Eu concentrations, certain bonds are weakened that lead to C-C coupling and produce C2+ via the frustrated deep hydrogenation of *CHO. For high Eu concentrations, certain bonds become strengthened instead, which facilitates the deep hydrogenation of *CHO to CH4 via the C1 pathway.

This work establishes a clear, intrinsic mechanism for switching between C1 and C2+ products in electrochemical CO2 reduction by using Eu as an electronic modulator in Cu2O-based catalysts.

By leveraging the reversible Eu3+/Eu2+ redox couple and its impact on the *CHO intermediate, this study shows how subtle changes in electronic structure can selectively favor either C-C coupling (toward C2+ products) or deep hydrogenation (toward CH4).

Air travel is entering a transformative phase. A new industry-backed study reveals that hydrogen-powered aviation could significantly reduce emissions while allowing global air travel to grow responsibly. For travelers, this signals a future of cleaner flights without limiting mobility.

The research highlights how hydrogen propulsion, when combined with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), could reshape the European and UK aviation landscape. This transition supports climate goals while protecting travel connectivity across borders.

Why Hydrogen Matters for Travelers

Hydrogen-powered aircraft produce zero carbon emissions at the point of use. This makes them especially important for travelers concerned about environmental impact. Government climate agencies across Europe, including those aligned with the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, continue to prioritize low-carbon transport solutions.

For passengers, this means future flights could feel familiar while being far cleaner. Routes remain open. Destinations stay accessible. The difference lies in what powers the journey.

Strategic Airports Could Lead the Change

The study suggests that hydrogen infrastructure does not need to be everywhere at once. Instead, focusing on around 20 major European airports could deliver more than 80 percent of the total emissions benefit.

Airports such as London Heathrow are already preparing for next-generation fuels. Government-backed airport transition programs emphasize safety, efficiency, and phased implementation. For travelers, this means early hydrogen-powered routes are likely to appear at major international hubs first.

What This Means for European Travel Routes

Popular short- and medium-haul routes are expected to benefit first. These are often the most traveled corridors for tourism and business. Hydrogen-powered aircraft are particularly well-suited for these distances.

Tourists flying between European capitals or regional cultural centers may be among the first to experience hydrogen-supported travel. Over time, route availability is expected to expand as infrastructure grows.

Supporting Growth Without Limiting Travel

One key takeaway is that hydrogen does not restrict aviation growth. Instead, it supports it. The study shows that earlier adoption leads to greater long-term carbon savings.

From a traveler’s perspective, this reassures frequent flyers that sustainability does not mean fewer choices. Governments supporting innovation through funding programs and fuel incentives help airlines invest without raising barriers for passengers.

Collaboration Behind the Scenes

The research draws on advanced airline behavior modeling developed by academic aviation labs. These models simulate how airlines respond to fuel costs, incentives, and emerging technologies.

This approach aligns closely with government transport research standards used across the UK and EU. The findings reinforce the importance of coordinated action between airlines, airports, aircraft manufacturers, and regulators.

A Gradual but Meaningful Transition

Hydrogen aircraft will not replace today’s fleets overnight. Officials stress that efficiency improvements and SAF remain crucial in the near term. Hydrogen becomes increasingly valuable as infrastructure matures.

For travelers, this means a gradual shift. Flights become cleaner step by step. Airports adapt quietly in the background. The travel experience remains smooth.

What Travelers Can Expect Next

Government climate roadmaps indicate that pilot hydrogen routes could emerge in the 2030s. Travelers booking European trips later this decade may begin seeing hydrogen-supported flights offered on select routes.

Clear labeling, safety certification, and international standards will guide public adoption. Aviation regulators emphasize that passenger safety remains the highest priority throughout this transition.

The Bigger Picture for Global Tourism

Cleaner aviation supports sustainable tourism growth. Destinations remain reachable without increasing environmental pressure. Hydrogen-powered aviation helps preserve cultural travel, international exchange, and global mobility.

For travelers planning future journeys, this innovation represents progress without compromise.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/5nov7-7.jpeg,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:07.035317

As tourism worldwide seeks solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of travel, the Netherlands is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in sustainable tourism.","The tourism industry in the Netherlands is on the brink of a sustainability revolution, thanks to a bold proposal from KLM, the country’s flagship airline. In a bid to reduce aviation emissions and make travel greener, KLM has urged the Dutch government to invest in a national fund for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). The call comes at a critical time, as the global tourism market increasingly favours environmentally responsible travel options. The move could also significantly enhance the tourism experience in cities like Amsterdam, known for its rich culture and eco-conscious initiatives.

As the world grapples with climate change, airlines and destinations alike are seeking ways to reduce carbon emissions while maintaining essential global connectivity. SAF, which is made from sustainable feedstocks like waste oils and agricultural residues, has been hailed as a key solution for achieving greener air travel. According to KLM, SAF could reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint by up to 65% compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. By urging the Dutch government to boost SAF production, KLM is not just advocating for a cleaner future but also reinforcing the Netherlands’ position as a leader in sustainable tourism.

The government’s role is crucial in scaling up the production and use of SAF. KLM’s proposal for a national SAF fund is designed to subsidize SAF production, bringing it closer to cost parity with traditional jet fuels. The Dutch government has already made strides toward incorporating sustainable aviation technologies into the broader transportation strategy, but KLM’s push for increased investment represents a call to action. The government’s commitment to financing SAF production would help make cleaner travel options more affordable for airlines, eventually lowering the costs for tourists.

The Netherlands’ tourism sector stands to benefit greatly from this transition to more sustainable aviation fuels. Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, one of Europe’s busiest and most iconic travel hubs, could serve as a model for green airports worldwide. By increasing the availability of SAF, Schiphol and other Dutch airports would offer visitors the option of flying with significantly reduced emissions, making the Netherlands an even more appealing destination for eco-conscious travellers.

This move is aligned with EU climate goals that aim to decarbonize the aviation sector by increasing the use of renewable fuels. The European Union has set ambitious targets to increase the share of SAF in aviation fuel consumption, aiming for a 5% SAF mix by 2030. The Netherlands, with its strong focus on sustainability and green innovation, has an opportunity to lead by example. A national SAF fund could not only help the country meet these targets but also attract international attention as a hub for sustainable tourism.

Additionally, the Dutch tourism sector could benefit from a stronger tourism brand tied to sustainability. Tourists are becoming increasingly mindful of their environmental impact, and those travelling to the Netherlands could be more inclined to choose this eco-friendly destination if they know their flights are powered by renewable fuels. The proposed SAF fund would ensure that this growing trend of sustainable tourism continues, positioning the Netherlands as a leader in responsible travel.

In line with KLM’s request, the proposed investment in SAF could help the Netherlands build a robust sustainable fuel infrastructure that supports both domestic and international tourism. By securing funding for this critical resource, the Dutch government would not only be supporting its aviation industry but also promoting eco-friendly travel options for tourists. The sustainability push in aviation could also encourage more businesses in the tourism sector to adopt green practices, further boosting the country’s reputation as an eco-conscious destination.

As tourism worldwide seeks solutions to mitigate the environmental impact of travel, the Netherlands is positioning itself as a forward-thinking leader in sustainable tourism. KLM’s call for a national SAF fund is not just about aviation—it’s about creating a more sustainable, competitive, and attractive travel destination for the modern, eco-conscious traveller. The future of tourism in the Netherlands looks greener than ever, thanks to the collective efforts of KLM and the Dutch government working together to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable travel experience.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/KLM-Royal-Dutch-Airlines-1.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:14.944631

Despite these extreme difficulties, SABR stayed busy and the industry saw some important advocacy wins.","On Feb. 29, 1968, the Beatles won the Grammy Award for album of the year with “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.” But something else happened that Leap Day that was an even bigger blessing to the Jobe family—my cousin Angie was born. We are 11 months apart and are still more like siblings than cousins. She likes to quip that she is just a teenager since she has technically only had 14 birthdays. The Sustainable Advanced Biofuel Refiners Coalition (SABR) just celebrated our second official birthday—and while we weren’t founded on Leap Day, we share something in common with Angie: We’re a bit older than our birthday count suggests. In reality, SABR has existed in one form or another for nearly six years.

SABR incorporated as a 501(c)(6) biodiesel trade association in September 2023 with about 20 organizational members, and now we have more than 70, including some of the most seasoned veterans in the industry. This includes Pacific Biodiesel, the first dedicated biodiesel company in the U.S., celebrating 30 years in the industry this year—a milestone I will hit in a little over a year. Other biofuel trade associations represent a broader constituency of advanced biofuels, which is fine. But SABR is a more focused group representing biodiesel stakeholders. This includes every link in the biodiesel value chain: soybean growers and processors, biodiesel producers, glycerin refiners, input suppliers, distributors and retailers. Our truck stop members buy and sell about half of all the biodiesel sold in the U.S.

SABR encourages growth in all biofuels, but we support policies that cause the new fuels, like renewable diesel (RD) and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), to grow the RFS rather than displace existing biofuels in the program. And SABR supports all feedstocks, but we are unapologetically pro–soybean farmer—the folks who invested their time, talent and treasure to build the biodiesel industry in the first place. Our narrow mission is to pursue corrections to policies that improperly disadvantage biodiesel as a fuel and soy as a feedstock. We seek to level the playing field for biodiesel and soy that has been improperly tilted by flawed policies that are neither feedstock- nor technology-neutral.

SABR has its origins in 2019 when many in the industry and NGOs began lauding the California LCFS as the template for state carbon policy. On behalf of a group of biodiesel clients, I wrote a white paper in an attempt to persuade our peers in the industry that this was a flawed approach. California policy is anti-agriculture, with multiple layers of “guardrails” to penalize crop-based feedstocks. It also contains flawed policies that improperly advantage renewable diesel over biodiesel. Biodiesel is also an oxygenated fuel, which makes it combust more efficiently, giving it a better health and emissions profile. Biodiesel further exhibits premium diesel characteristics that provide performance, safety and maintenance benefits. These issues are detailed in the white paper titled “Renewable Diesel and California LCFS Impacts to Soybean Industry,” which is available at sabrcoalition.org under the news tab.

Because the California LCFS falls under the umbrella of the RFS, California policy does not generate any additional demand over what would otherwise be generated by the RFS. It simply dictates where the volumes are consumed and under what policy conditions—favoring renewable diesel from non-soy feedstocks. In 2019, there were approximately 500 million gallons per year of biomass-based diesel sold in California. The white paper predicted that this volume would increase at an accelerating rate and result in a cascade of petroleum refinery conversion projects to renewable diesel, and that this phenomenon would have negative impacts on soy biodiesel in other parts of the country by non-soy renewable diesel in California. That is exactly what happened. Biomass-based diesel in California is now 2 billion to 2.5 billion gallons per year, and very little of it is biodiesel or soy-based. That amounts to roughly half of the RFS. And that portion continues to grow at an accelerated rate as the three other western-tier states come online that have adopted California-style LCFS.

SABR spent a good deal of time in 2024 trying to persuade groups that without one more extension of the biodiesel blenders tax credit in order to buy time to fix the new and very flawed 45Z credit, and get a proposed and final rule in place, 2025 would be an extremely difficult year. Some groups argued that an extension of the blenders credit was not needed because we had 45Z in place and that it was operative, pointing to a Jan. 10, 2025, IRS bulletin. But that was not a final rule—it wasn’t even a proposed rule. Rather, it was a “notice of intent to propose a rule.” Indeed, we are now in December and 2025 volumes have been about half of the previous year’s, back to 2011 rates. The policy uncertainty was in triplicate: tepid RVOs, the lapse of the biodiesel blenders tax credit and the lack of implementing regulations for 45Z. In 2025, some companies went under; others shut down or ran at a fraction of their capacity at a loss. The economic harm has been devastating.

Despite these extreme difficulties, SABR stayed busy and the industry saw some important advocacy wins. There were significant shared victories among all of the biofuel groups working on them, including the dropping of ILUC penalties from 45Z and robust proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027. There were several key victories in which SABR played a leading role—often working alongside a handful of close partners—to help push important provisions across the finish line. These included securing SAF parity in 45Z, achieving partial transition relief through the extension of the small agri-biodiesel credit—which doubled its value and made it transferable—and advancing a proposal to correct inflated equivalence values for RD, SAF and naphtha in the EPA’s proposed rule. SABR also collaborated with soybean farmer allies in supporting the half RIN on imported feedstocks, adding an important voice to a unified effort.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Joe_Jobe_26ae6188bb.jpg,N,,2025-12-13 02:56:12.325143

Cantwell’s letter noted that timing and the recent merger could have increased the value of Bedford’s holdings, raising further questions about why the divestiture has not been completed.
Bedford has previously pledged to divest the holdings and recuse himself from matters affecting Republic Airways until that process is complete.
Cantwell’s letter ties into broader concerns about FAA leadership credibility and public trust in the agency’s oversight.","The head of the US Federal Aviation Administration has been accused of violating his ethics agreement by failing to divest a multimillion-dollar stake in an airline he once led, drawing criticism from a senior lawmaker and raising fresh questions about potential conflicts at the helm of the United States’ top aviation safety regulator.

Sen. Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, wrote to FAA Administrator Bryan Bedford saying he promised during his confirmation process to sell all his shares in Republic Airways within 90 days of taking office but has failed to do so more than 150 days later. Bedford’s financial disclosures showed his holdings in the regional carrier were worth between $6 million and $30 million at the time he was confirmed.

In a December 8, 2025, letter from the Office of Government Ethics to Cantwell’s committee, regulators noted that Bedford sought to amend his original ethics agreement to extend the divestiture timeline, but the request was denied because it did not meet the standards for such changes. The ethics office also said it has not been informed that Bedford has divested his Republic stock and told Transportation Department ethics officials to emphasize his personal responsibility to avoid any actions that could create a conflict of interest.

Cantwell’s letter says the ongoing failure to divest violates the commitments Bedford made when he was confirmed as FAA chief, a role in which he oversees critical aspects of US aviation safety and regulation. “It appears you continue to retain significant equity in this conflicting asset months past the deadline set to fully divest from Republic, which constitutes a clear violation of your ethics agreement,” she wrote, calling for a full accounting of his actions.

Republic Airways, where Bedford was CEO before joining the FAA, completed a merger with Mesa Air Group on November 25, 2025. Under the merger deal, Republic shareholders now own about 88% of the combined company, which operates a fleet of more than 300 Embraer jets under contracts with legacy airlines. Cantwell’s letter noted that timing and the recent merger could have increased the value of Bedford’s holdings, raising further questions about why the divestiture has not been completed.

Bedford has previously pledged to divest the holdings and recuse himself from matters affecting Republic Airways until that process is complete. But as of mid-December 2025, that effort has not been finished, apparently leaving him with a significant airline stake while leading the agency responsible for regulating carriers and overseeing air safety.

The FAA has been under heightened scrutiny this year after a deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., earlier in 2025 and other recent operational challenges, including air traffic control outages and widespread flight delays during a prolonged government shutdown. Cantwell’s letter ties into broader concerns about FAA leadership credibility and public trust in the agency’s oversight.

Cantwell has asked Bedford to explain why he did not comply with the 90-day divestiture timeline, why he sought an amendment to his ethics agreement, and to provide a full accounting of any Republic stock he has sold.

SAF mandates will shape flight operations, prices, and traveller experience for the next decade.","Air travel is entering a transition. Governments around the world are introducing rules that require airlines to use sustainable aviation fuel, often called SAF. These policies aim to cut emissions and help aviation shift to cleaner energy. For travellers, these rules may influence ticket prices, flight options, and long-term travel planning. This guide breaks down what global tourists should expect as these rules take shape.

Why SAF Matters for Travellers

SAF is produced from materials like waste oils, agricultural residues, or advanced synthetic processes. It can significantly reduce lifecycle emissions compared to traditional jet fuel. Governments promote SAF as a pathway to meet climate goals without limiting mobility.

Travellers may hear airlines speak about rising costs or “fuel adjustments.” This is because SAF is still produced in small volumes and is much more expensive than conventional fuel. When governments set strict mandates, airlines must buy a minimum percentage of SAF even if the supply is limited. Industry observers have said that these rules could slow production growth and raise costs in the short term.

The Policies Behind the Shift

Several major regions have introduced binding fuel rules. Europe has created a system that gradually increases the minimum share of SAF at airports. The United Kingdom has also announced its own SAF mandate, supported by guidance to help the industry scale fuel production. These policies focus on long-term environmental benefits, but airlines say compliance can increase immediate operating expenses.

Government agencies state that the mandates are part of their climate commitments. They explain that early adoption is needed so that the industry can scale fuel production to lower costs over time. The aim is to make greener aviation accessible to all travellers in the future.

How Mandates Could Influence Airfares

Fuel is one of the largest expenses for airlines. When the cost of fuel rises because of mandatory SAF blending, the effects can appear in ticket prices. Travellers may see small fare increases on certain routes, especially during the early years of mandate introduction. Some airlines may also adjust flight schedules or routes if operational costs rise at specific airports.

However, these effects may not be uniform. Airports located in regions with government incentives and targeted support for SAF production may experience smoother transitions. Travellers flying through certain European, UK, or North American airports may find more stable prices as production capabilities grow.

Travel Booking Tips for the SAF Transition

Travellers can prepare for the changes with simple steps:

Compare airfares across multiple dates.

Prices may fluctuate more often as airlines adjust to new fuel requirements.

Check airline sustainability pages.

Most major carriers now publish information on SAF usage and long-term fuel plans. This can help travellers understand how each airline is responding to mandates.

Choose airports with clearer SAF availability.

Airports in regions with strong government incentives often have more predictable supply. This can reduce the risk of unexpected fare spikes.

Monitor added fees.

Some airlines might pass certain compliance costs to passengers through surcharges. Reading fare breakdowns can help travellers spot these changes early.

Book flexible tickets for complex itineraries.

During early implementation periods, airlines may adjust routes or frequencies as they respond to the new regulations.

Long-Term Travel Impact

Governments emphasize that SAF mandates are part of a broader climate strategy. They aim to support sustainable tourism, cleaner skies, and long-term consumer stability. As global fuel production expands and new facilities open, the price gap between SAF and conventional fuel is expected to shrink. For travellers, this means that short-term adjustments may lead to more efficient and environmentally conscious flying in the future.

Final Takeaway for Global Tourists

The world is moving toward cleaner air travel. SAF mandates will shape flight operations, prices, and traveller experience for the next decade. Understanding these rules helps tourists plan smarter.

In KLM’s view, a national SAF fund should focus on the following: 1.
Accelerating production and access to raw materials Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development.
The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax.","KLM has backed calls for the Dutch Government to invest in a national Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fund.

In doing so, the Dutch flag carrier is supporting the so-called Wennink Report, a wide-reaching support, by Dutch businessman Peter Wennink, examining how the Netherlands should and could invest in innovative technologies to support its future economic growth.

Such a fund would enable the Netherlands to accelerate the production of alternative aviation fuels and make them more affordable, thereby accelerating the sector’s sustainability. Real progress can only be achieved if government and industry work together and if the government takes a more active role. KLM urges policymakers to adopt this recommendation, the report said.

KLM fully endorses the report’s conclusions about the crucial importance of aviation to safeguarding prosperity and maintaining the Netherlands’ innovative ecosystem.

The airline said: “Aviation and Schiphol are crucial to our economic strength: they connect the Netherlands to the world and are essential for trade, employment and our international competitiveness. It is therefore vital that we invest collectively in a future-proof aviation sector rather than restrict it or impose additional national charges. Doing so would undermine the Netherlands’ competitive position and the global connectivity on which our prosperity depends.

“KLM is investing significantly in cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient operations. Alongside fleet renewal, SAF is currently one of the most effective means of reducing aviation CO₂ emissions, cutting emissions by at least 65% across its entire lifecycle compared with fossil kerosene. KLM blends more SAF each year than required under the European mandate and has entered into a long-term offtake agreement to support the development of the Netherlands’ first dedicated SAF production facility in Delfzijl. However, to achieve the joint ambition of a 14% SAF blend in the Netherlands by 2030, alternative fuels must become more affordable and widely available. Just as with wind and solar energy, government investment can make a real difference in securing the future of sustainable aviation.”

Marjan Rintel, CEO KLM, said: “We fully support the Wennink report’s conclusion that aviation is vital to the Netherlands’ future prosperity. To maintain that position and accelerate our sustainability efforts, the government must invest rather than introduce additional national charges. A national SAF fund would allow government and industry to work together to drive change. KLM is already investing in alternative fuels, but only with an active government role can we achieve the necessary scale and affordability. Now is the moment to position the Netherlands as a leader in sustainable aviation.”

A national SAF fund: paving the way for ‘SAF Made in Holland’

The creation of a national SAF fund aligns with European efforts to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels, including the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), and would make ‘SAF Made in Holland’ a reality. In KLM’s view, a national SAF fund should focus on the following:

1. Making SAF affordable for airlines

Bridge the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene through an incentive fund, enabling airlines to actually use SAF and encouraging them to choose sustainable options. Based on current prices, an annual investment of €60 million could already deliver an additional 1% SAF blend.

2. Accelerating production and access to raw materials

Improve access to sustainable raw materials for SAF production and remove barriers to accelerated SAF infrastructure development. This would allow the Netherlands to make significant progress in scaling up domestic production.

3. Investing in (e)SAF innovation to become a European leader

Support the development of next-generation (e)SAF technologies and take a leading role in European innovation initiatives. The Dutch government has already taken a promising first step by joining a European pilot within the STIP programme.

The national SAF fund could be financed through the revenues from the existing Dutch aviation tax. This would allow the Netherlands, and Dutch aviation, to take the lead in scaling up alternative aviation fuels and help ensure that the national ambition of a 14% SAF blend by 2030 remains within reach.",https://ittn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Marjan-Rintel-KLM.webp,N,,2025-12-13 10:57:32.684905

We believe this technology will change the way we think about natural gas going forward.” Mr. Stopp added.
“Because Greenway’s cutting-edge reformer technology can also address the challenges of stranded natural gas wells, it will be especially important in Indian country.
When derived from natural gas, these fuels are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels.","ARLINGTON, TX, Dec. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Greenway Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: GWTI) (“Greenway”), an advanced gas-to-liquids (“GTL”) and gas-to-hydrogen (“GTH”) technology development company, announced today that, on December 5, 2025, it signed a non-binding term sheet with Swift Creek, LLC (“SCL”), a native and veteran owned company assisting tribes to find solutions in technology and economic development with potential access to certain U.S. government subsidies and funds by virtue of its American domicile and ownership status.

The term sheet sets forth certain terms regarding the parties’ desire to have SCL purchase a patented Greenway G-Reformer™ unit and Fischer Tropsch unit to produce a minimum of five barrels per day at a site to be determined. The purchase price of this micro-plant is expected to be $16 million with Greenway retaining 20% of the agreed offtake from the production of liquid hydrocarbons and other liquids. The term sheet also contemplates SCL acting as a representative of Greenway to promote, market and identify potential customers/purchasers of such systems on behalf of Greenway in return for agreed-upon commissions. Greenway expects to negotiate definitive documentation with SCL pertaining to the term sheet by the first quarter of 2026.

In a statement, Doug Cogan, Chief Executive Officer of Greenway, said, “Greenway Technologies has been working diligently on research and development for over 10 years to develop and patent processes and procedures to perfect innovative and clean gas-to-liquid and gas-to-hydrogen solutions. Because natural gas is available across the globe, we believe the winning GTL solution is the one that can produce valuable liquids and hydrocarbons at the final site where it is utilized without carbon generation into the atmosphere. We believe the relationship that Kevin Jones, our Executive Vice President of Sales, has developed with SCL has been invaluable and is the reason the partnership between our two companies has progressed. We are excited for our shareholders as we move our focus from pre-revenue (R&D) to commercialization. By using our technology in conjunction with SCL’s projects, we expect that the G-Reformer™ units can be configured to not only produce valuable liquid hydrocarbons, but also synthetic diesel blend stock, jet fuel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and valuable tech water.”

Mr. Cogan added, “Greenway has been investigating the implementation of additional technology for a variety of purposes. Greenway continues to diligently research and develop patent processes and procedures for clean gas-to-hydrogen solutions. Our research and development has shown the conversion of natural gas (CH4) to hydrogen gas (H2) can be accomplished efficiently. However, widespread use to convert H2 into marketable liquids or electricity has been limited due to the prohibitive cost to liquify and transport the H2. We are focused on a more efficient process to commercialize. Greenway and SCL are collaborating in the utilization of using the G-Reformer™ to produce methanol, a liquid fuel, in areas where removal of the offtake is efficiently accomplished as a single liquid. Methanol is emerging as a clean burning hydrocarbon fuel, which may have substantial value if created with a low-carbon emitting process. Renewable methanol is in large demand at premium prices due to worldwide interest in lower carbon standards.”

Michael Stopp, Managing Partner of Swift Creek LLC, stated, “Over the past 18 months, I’ve gained tremendous confidence not just in the technology itself, but also in the evolving leadership at Greenway. Greenway’s commitment to innovation, recent leadership changes, and research and development partnership(s) have strengthened our collaboration and aligned our shared vision for sustainable business growth. Our partnership underscores Swift Creek’s dedication to embracing forward-thinking solutions and strong organizational leadership across all its ventures. We believe this technology will change the way we think about natural gas going forward.” Mr. Stopp added. “Because Greenway’s cutting-edge reformer technology can also address the challenges of stranded natural gas wells, it will be especially important in Indian country. Many tribes have an abundance of natural resources, but face challenges in getting those resources to market.”

About Greenway Technologies, Inc.

Based in Arlington, Texas, Greenway, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Greenway Innovative Energy, Inc., is engaged in the research and development of proprietary GTL and GTH syngas conversion systems that can be scaled to meet oil and gas field production requirements, or the requirements of various processes where natural gas is produced or available. Greenway’s patented technology has been integrated into its recently completed first-generation commercial G-Reformer™ unit, a unique component used to convert natural gas into synthesis gas (a mixture of Hydrogen and Carbon Monoxide). In the case of hydrogen creation, an additional new technology, the H-Reformer™, has been developed which creates synthesis gas consisting of Hydrogen gas and CO2. When combined with an FT reactor and catalyst, G-Reformer™ units can be deployed to process a variety of natural gas streams, including pipeline gas, associated gas, flared gas, vented gas, coal-bed methane, and biomass to produce fuels including gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and methanol as well as valuable chemical outputs. When derived from natural gas, these fuels are incrementally cleaner than conventionally produced oil-based fuels.

Following a turbulent year, full of highs and lows, the Port of Seattle’s 2026 budget is keeping us on the right trajectory. The highs included the grand opening of the newly renovated working waterfront, our big win to protect maritime industrial lands in Seattle, new bike lanes at Pier 66 and Terminal 91, and three days that broke records for overall daily number of passengers at SEA Airport. The lows included the Trump administration‘s tariff-induced impacts on maritime trade, tensions with Canada reducing tourism revenues for our communities, and an all-out attack on foundational environmental laws. The Northwest Seaport Alliance’s weekly basis tracking of tariff-induced impacts for the last several months are clearly negative with void sailings up 15% compared to 2024 and our import volumes down more than 20% compared to 2024.

That said, we still expect to break more records next year, with a projected 54 million passengers estimated to fly through SEA and more than two million cruise passengers. From the waterfront to the airport, we’ll continue to prioritize creating good paying jobs through sustainable economic growth while working to minimize collateral impacts.

Among the work we’re facilitating with this budget, I’m particularly pleased that we’re continuing to invest in the next generation of maritime workers, with funding for “Blue Schools,” Core Plus maritime curriculum, and pre-apprenticeship programs for construction trades. The silver tsunami of retirements in the maritime field is gathering pace, and we’re working to ensure Seattle’s working waterfront continues to thrive for generations to come. That starts with elevating public awareness of maritime-related career opportunities through educational interpretive signage associated with the redevelopment of the waterfront and in the aquarium’s new Ocean Pavilion as well as in the classroom. These investments are designed to help inspire students and their parents to consider careers in the maritime industry, which is central to the Port’s mission.

I’ve also continued to advocate for funding for responsible tourism in King County and beyond. One of Washington’s most visited tourist hot spots, including for our cruise passengers, is the Snoqualmie Falls. That’s why we convened a group of people interested in protecting this incredibly special place last year. Together with members of the SnoValley Chamber, members of the Snoqualmie Tribe, and others, we mapped out potential strategies to ensure visitors care for the environment and appreciate the history of the falls and the entire Snoqualmie Valley. This year, I’m looking forward to building on that work, with additional support for interpretive signage.

I also spearheaded the installation of an interpretive kiosk at Shilshole Marina to educate boaters about protocols to avoid impacting the recovery of our endangered population of Southern Resident orcas and how they provide whale-sighting networks with information that can aid in their protection. As a former professional photographer and killer whale biologist, I know firsthand how incredibly lucky we are to have them here in our backyard and retain a sense of responsibility to do what I can to preserve their coexistence.

Advancing clean fuels: The potential of Renewable Natural Gas

In recent weeks, the Commission Office has received hundreds of letters from community members expressing concerns about the climate impacts associated with the growing use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a marine fuel by ships being deployed globally and already calling on our gateway. The Port shares those concerns, which is why we continue to push for the development and deployment of sustainable alternatives, including Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), which can both lower near-port communities’ exposure to harmful pollution and reduce the impact on the climate.

AAPA’s Annual Convention in Québec City

Earlier this fall, I had the honor of representing the Port of Seattle at the annual convention of the American Association of Port Authorities (AAPA) in Québec City. This gathering brought together maritime leaders from across North America. Together, we had the chance to exchange ideas on strengthening the maritime industry while protecting our communities and environment.

Discussions focused on a range of issues, including supply chain resiliency, sustainability, and modernizing port infrastructure. It was enlightening to learn how ports are addressing these challenges and made me proud of the progress we continue to make at home — from expanding shore power to electrifying cargo-handling equipment and supporting innovation in alternative fuels.

Most importantly, attending this convention ensured that the voices and values of the Port of Seattle — especially our commitment to environmental stewardship and community partnership — were front and center. Whether we’re addressing climate challenges or strengthening economic opportunities, our participation in these forums reinforces the Port of Seattle’s leadership and dedication to advancing maritime innovation, workforce development, international trade, and sustainable tourism practices.

I was also glad to be at the event to celebrate Mario Cordero’s retirement. As the CEO of the Port of Long Beach for the last eight years, Mario led the organization through a period of tremendous growth while advancing environmental initiatives. His own journey, as a first-generation American and as an activist and educator, is incredibly inspiring. As a port executive and member of the Clinton administration, he helped advance America’s role both in international commerce and sustainability. It was an honor and a pleasure to meet him.

Talking responsible tourism in Spokane

It’s gratifying to see how Washington’s priorities have grown to include responsible tourism in recent years, thanks in part to leadership I brought on the subject to the Port of Seattle. In October, just after leaving Québec, I had the opportunity to speak to the Port’s commitment to responsible tourism at the state’s tourism conference in Spokane. While I celebrated our work in SnoValley and our “Stay Another Day” program for cruise ship passengers, I also pointed to the work I’d like to accomplish in the coming year — the “Three-Nation Vacation” associated with visitors arriving from around the world to attend the World Cup tournaments in Seattle and Vancouver, B.C.

The Three-Nation Vacation would be a collaboration across Washington state, British Columbia, and Tribal and First Nations. The concept builds on the government of Canada’s Juan de Fuca Crossing initiative, which affords a great opportunity to encourage travel between Victoria, B.C. and Port Angeles on the Black Ball ferry. This would provide a diversity of experiences for the traveler, increase prosperity across the border, and help repair some of the strains between our countries associated with the Trump administration’s rhetoric assaulting the sovereignty of Canada.

As a demonstration, I’m planning to take the Three-Nation Vacation journey by bus, train, and ferry. I will start from SEA Airport, take the light rail to within walking distance of Coleman Dock, ferry to Bainbridge Island, catch the Clallam transit bus to Port Angeles, and then ferry to Victoria. Along the way I intend to visit Olympic National Park, Tribal and Frist Nation communities, and the culturally rich capital of B.C., all without renting a car. After all, one of the most important ways to practice responsible tourism is to travel by public transit.

I’ll also meet with public officials, Tribal leaders, and tourism industry entrepreneurs to learn more about how we can advance efforts to welcome visitors while protecting the places we love here in the Northwest. The trip, of course, will be the subject of a future Field Notes newsletter.

The tourism conference in Spokane ended on a high note, pun intended. On my last evening in the city, I enjoyed one of the best live jazz concerts I’ve seen recently. It was a great reminder that you don’t have to travel far from home to experience cultural richness. And after a few days in Canada, it was a great example of one of the art forms forged right here in America.

Preserving North SeaTac Park

Protecting North SeaTac Park has been one of my top priorities in recent years, and I’m pleased to share that we have reached a major milestone.

In October 2024, I championed a legislative order – passed by the Commission unanimously – that directed the Executive Director to identify options for permanently protecting 55 acres of the park from development. Through the Joint Advisory Council (JAC), I worked with members of the SeaTac City Council toward that goal.

Earlier this year, the Executive Director adopted the JAC's recommendation to support the City of SeaTac’s application for a King County Conservation Futures (KCCF) grant. The grant would enable SeaTac to purchase the Park with permanent development restrictions in place – ensuring that the park remains open for recreation, not development.

North SeaTac Park is one of the most ecologically important areas in south King County. It includes forests, wetlands, gardens, play areas, and community spaces that provide essential environmental and recreational benefits. After hearing the concerns of local residents and assessing disparities in tree canopy cover and access to open space, it became clear that permanent protection was the right thing to do. I’m grateful to the many residents and advocates who have engaged with the Port of Seattle and the City of SeaTac regarding the park. Their advocacy helped us advance this effort.

The work is not yet complete. The Port and the City are now coordinating appraisals, documentation to support the grant, and negotiating on long-term protection mechanisms to ensure the park remains undeveloped and open to the public in perpetuity.

While the ultimate decision as to whether to sell the Park or to preserve it in another manner remains at the discretion of the Port Commission, our actions on the Commission signify a strong, shared commitment to protect North SeaTac Park for the communities of south King County.

It is efforts such as this that have the potential for improving the quality of life of King County residents. That continues to be a source of motivation for my public service on the Commission.
