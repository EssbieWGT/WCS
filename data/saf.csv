The future of agricultural mechanization: Planning, innovation, and financing

The agricultural machinery sector faces a landscape with strong growth potential, driven by the expansion of cultivated areas and an outdated fleet. However, this potential is constrained by high credit costs, international volatility, and reliance on public resources.

In 2024, the sector’s revenue reached BRL 62 billion. The projection for 2025 is BRL 68 billion, representing a 10% increase. Despite this, financing totaled BRL 27.6 billion, with only 36% benefiting from subsidized interest rates, well below the historical average of 60%.

Within this context, the capital markets have taken a leading role. Instruments such as Rural Product Notes (“CPR”), Agribusiness Receivables Certificates (“CRA”), Agribusiness Credit Bills (“LCA”), and Investment Funds in Agribusiness Production Chains (“FIAGRO”) grew by more than 300% between 2022 and 2024, offering an almost unlimited source of funding. The future points to hybrid models, combining subsidized credit and private financing, creating the conditions for innovation and modernization.

To secure the future of agricultural mechanization, the goal is clear: strategic planning must look beyond the next harvest and focus on the coming decades, accelerating the transition to new financing models and guaranteeing global competitiveness.

Third EcoInvest auction offers agribusiness opportunities

At the close of 2025, the third EcoInvest auction was held – a government program that combines public and private capital to boost sustainable projects. This edition mapped approximately 15 segments, with an emphasis on agribusiness chains, such as biofuel production (SAF – Sustainable Aviation Fuel, biogas and biomethane, bioinputs, and biofertilizers).

Financial institutions interested in participating can submit proposals by January 07, 2026.

The major innovation in this edition is EcoInvest’s entry into equity investments, in addition to traditional debt instruments. The goal is to structure investment funds similar to private equity, with allocations distributed over a five-year period. These funds must include at least 15% foreign investors and allocate 20% to early-stage companies (venture capital companies). If this percentage cannot be met, resources may be directed to institutions such as Embrapii and Scientific, Technological, and Innovation Institutions (“ICTs”).

The model establishes that the Brazilian National Treasury will transfer resources to banks at an annual interest rate of 1%. Half of the subsidized amount will remain in the banks’ treasury. These institutions must use part of the spread (the difference between the cost of borrowed funds and their yield) to purchase foreign exchange derivatives, thus offering protection to foreign investors against the appreciation of the Brazilian real over five years. The other half will be allocated to EcoInvest investment funds at an annual cost of 5%, either through proprietary asset managers or partner companies.

These resources will be injected into the fund (either via loans or quota subscription), but will not be used to finance operations. Instead, they must remain invested, and any excess return will serve as a support to attract additional capital. The idea is to establish a first-loss mechanism that mitigates portfolio risk in high-risk projects.

Through this structure, EcoInvest aims to attract private capital and reduce risk, providing opportunities for large sector aggregators and encouraging innovation in agribusiness and environmentally sustainable projects.

BNDES estimates BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments following public call on climate

The Brazilian Development Bank (“BNDES”) announced that its public call for climate mitigation initiatives has the potential to attract BRL 73.7 billion in sustainable investments, having received 45 proposals from investment funds.

The initiative seeks to combine public and private resources to accelerate the energy transition and reduce carbon emissions, aligning Brazil with global decarbonization and sustainable development goals.

The proposals request BRL 21 billion in financial support from BNDES and cover initiatives in energy transition, green agriculture, climate infrastructure, reforestation, industrial process decarbonization, and forest conservation. The public call aims to identify projects with high potential for positive environmental impact and economic feasibility, creating a robust pipeline to attract domestic and international investors.

According to BNDES’ chair, the strategy involves structuring five to six funds in which BNDES Participações (“BNDESPAR”) would contribute up to 25% of the funds’ total capital, attracting the remaining resources from the market. “We aim to invest approximately BRL 5 billion and leverage an additional BRL 15 billion from the private sector. The response exceeded expectations: 45 proposals totaling BRL 73.7 billion demonstrate Brazil’s innovation strength and potential to accelerate the green economy,” stated BNDES’ chair.

Beyond environmental impact, BNDES emphasizes that selected projects are expected to generate social and economic benefits, such as job creation, regional development, and productive inclusion. This initiative is expected to support Brazil’s consolidation as a leader in climate solutions in Latin America, drawing foreign capital and fostering strategic partnerships.

Currently, BNDESPAR has BRL 8.4 billion allocated to funds and, with the new selection, this amount can increase by up to 60%. With this, BNDES reinforces its role as a catalyst for sustainable investments, promoting a development model that combines economic competitiveness with environmental responsibility.

Soy Moratorium: CADE expands investigation to individuals, but STF orders suspension of proceedings

The future of the Soy Moratorium – one of the main environmental agreements in Brazilian agribusiness – remains uncertain amid escalating disputes between regulatory agencies, the production sector, and the Judiciary.

On September 30, 2025, the Brazilian Competition Authority (“CADE”) had provisionally lifted the preventive measure that halted the pact, ensuring the validity of the moratorium until December 31 and allowing negotiations among the parties. However, the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court (“STF”) has recently granted an injunction ordering the suspension of administrative proceedings regarding the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium.

In early November, CADE broadened the scope of its investigation by initiating a new administrative inquiry against 15 individuals associated with companies that had signed the agreement, seeking to determine the personal liability of executives and representatives in the implementation and monitoring of the moratorium. This measure represents an expansion of the investigations, which had previously focused on the companies and associations involved.

Within the Judiciary, the Brazilian Association of Vegetable Oil Industries (“ABIOVE”) – an entity representing Brazil’s leading soybean traders and processors – filed a petition within the scope of Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (“ADI”) No. 7774. This lawsuit, currently pending before the STF, challenges the constitutionality of a state law in Mato Grosso related to granting tax incentives to companies adhering to the pact. It further requests the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings in Brazil that directly or indirectly address the legality of the Soy Moratorium, due to the risk of conflicting decisions and legal uncertainty for the sector.

Within this context, Justice Flávio Dino, the reporting officer of ADI No. 7774, granted an injunction on November 05, 2025, ordering the suspension of all judicial and administrative proceedings concerning the legality or constitutionality of the Soy Moratorium until the STF issues a final ruling. The decision was endorsed by a majority of the justices, who recognized the relevance of the matter and its potential economic and environmental impacts.

In compliance with the STF order, CADE published a decision on November 11, 2025, suspending any administrative proceedings related to the Soy Moratorium. As a result, all investigations and administrative measures will remain on hold until the STF delivers a definitive judgment, placing the future of this environmental pact in the hands of Brazil’s highest court.

TAX REGULATION:

New law enacted establishing dividend taxation, minimum income tax, and exemptions

On November 27, 2025, Law No. 15,270/2025 (converted from Bill No. 1,087/2025) was published, introducing taxation on dividends, the Minimum Individual Income Tax (“IRPFM”), and expanding the Individual Income Tax (“IRPF”) exemption for earnings up to BRL 5,000.

These changes require close attention from taxpayers (including those in the agribusiness sector), particularly regarding potential measures that may still be adopted in 2025 to reduce exposure to the new dividend taxation, which will take effect as of 2026.

Brazilian Federal Revenue Service launches new compliance initiative targeting individuals in the rural sector

The Federal Revenue Service of Brazil (“RFB”) has initiated a new phase of its compliance program, targeting individuals engaged in rural activities, with a specific focus on income derived from lease agreements for rural real estate.

The initiative, named “Declara Agro – Arrendamentos”, aims to guide taxpayers on the correct taxation of such income, supporting self-assessment and regularization. According to the RFB, taxpayers who comply and correct their returns by January 30, 2026, will avoid official penalties.

STF resumes debate on tax incentives for pesticides

In a session held on November 19, 2025, the STF resumed the trial of Direct Actions of Unconstitutionality (ADI No. 5553 and ADI No. 7755) challenging the tax benefits granted to agricultural pesticides, particularly the exemptions from the Tax on the Circulation of Goods and Services (“ICMS”) and the Tax on Industrialized Products (“IPI”) provided under ICMS Agreement No. 100/1997 and provisions of Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023.

The new session exposed a three‑way division within the Court:

The reporting officer, Justice Edson Fachin, supported by Justice Cármen Lúcia, voted to declare the incentives unconstitutional based on the principles of environmental and health protection, supporting the State’s duty not to subsidize products deemed harmful.

In dissent, Justice Cristiano Zanin aligned himself with Justices Luiz Fux and Dias Toffoli, recognizing the full validity of the benefits as legitimate instruments of agricultural policy and competitiveness.

Justice Flávio Dino, aligning with Justice André Mendonça, issued a partial dissent in which he recognized the constitutionality of tax incentives for agricultural inputs, arguing that Constitutional Amendment No. 132/2023 had incorporated this policy into the Constitution.

In light of the divergent positions and the relevance of the tax, environmental, and agricultural matters involved, the trial was suspended and will be resumed at a later date Among the issues that remain unresolved are whether periodic review of the benefits will be required, the compatibility between favorable tax treatment and environmental protection, and the financial implications for states and producers.

State of São Paulo introduces new tax benefits for yeast-derived products

The Government of the State of São Paulo has published Decree No. 70,024/2025, introducing significant changes to the São Paulo State ICMS Regulation (“RICMS-SP”).

The decree establishes specific tax rules for domestic transactions involving yeast-derived products, classified under MERCOSUR’s Common Nomenclature (“NCM”) 2102.20.00 and originating from the sugarcane fermentation process.

The regulation introduces two provisions to the state tax code:

Article 361-A – ICMS deferral on first sale:

The ICMS deferral will now apply to the first domestic sale of inactive dry, autolyzed, hydrolyzed, cell wall, and extracted yeast. This mechanism postpones the ICMS collection to the following stage in the supply chain, thus reducing the immediate financial impact on manufacturers and distributors.

Annex I, Article 183 – Exemption for pet food production:

Domestic transactions involving the same products will be exempt from ICMS when destined exclusively for the production of pet food, reinforcing policies aimed at stimulating the pet segment and agroindustrial chains linked to sugarcane.

The decree took effect on November 01, 2025, allowing companies in the sector to adjust their processes and evaluate opportunities to leverage new incentives.

ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION:

Legal Reserve

GOIÁS

Goiás establishes procedures for analysis and approval of Legal Reserve

On November 03, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”) published SEMAD Normative Instruction No. 23/2025, providing for administrative procedures and technical criteria for the analysis and approval of the Legal Reserve. The normative instruction also provides for the rules for relocation, compensation, and implementation of collective or condominium Legal Reserves.

The regulation stipulates that the analysis and approval of Legal Reserves will be carried out through the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”), except in cases provided for in the normative instruction. It further defines technical criteria for location, prioritizing areas with greater conservation of native vegetation, less fragmentation, and connectivity with other protected areas.

Additionally, the normative instruction regulates procedures for environmental licensing, establishing that the Legal Reserve approval may occur within the scope of land-use conversion, including the conditions for title rectifications and CAR updates. It also establishes rules for off‑property relocation, compensation, and the creation of collective Legal Reserves, requiring, among other conditions, that they be located within the same biome and expanded in area to ensure environmental gains.

Finally, the normative instruction provides for compensation rules in cases of vegetation suppression, as well as criteria for regularization and integration of control systems, ensuring compliance with state and federal legislation.

Rural Insurance

FEDERAL

National Council of Private Insurance establishes environmental, social, and climate guidelines for rural insurance

On November 04, 2025, the National Council of Private Insurance (“CNSP”) published CNSP Resolution No. 485/2025, establishing guidelines on environmental, social, and climate-related issues applicable to rural insurance.

The regulation requires that areas covered by rural insurance contracts be identified by geodetic coordinates and registered in the CAR. It prohibits the execution of contracts for real estate not registered or with suspended registration, as well as for activities in areas embargoed by environmental authorities or located in conservation units, Indigenous lands, Quilombola communities, or undesignated public forests, except as provided for in specific exceptions.

The resolution also prohibits contracting by policyholders listed in the registry of employers who have subjected workers to conditions analogous to slavery, establishes risk mitigation criteria, requires insurers to comply with the guidelines before underwriting, and further mandates specific clauses in contracts for reporting non-compliance.

The regulation will take effect 180 days after publication and authorizes the Superintendence of Private Insurance (“SUSEP”) to issue complementary regulations for its implementation.

Environmental Rural Registry

PARANÁ

Paraná establishes procedures for automated analysis of Rural Environmental Registry

On November 03, 2025, the Government of the State of Paraná published Decree No. 11,711/2025, establishing procedures for applying Articles 3 and 13 of Law No. 18,295/2014, with a focus on streamlining the analysis of information declared in CAR at the state level.

The regulation introduces mechanisms for the automated CAR analysis, enabling corrections and adjustments based on certified cartographic data, satellite imagery, and official technical criteria, with the aim of enhancing speed and accuracy in the environmental regularization of rural real estate.

The decree defines concepts such as the National Rural Environmental Registry System (“SICAR”), the Environmental Regularization Program (“PRA”), and the Degraded Area Recovery Project (“PRADA”). It also provides that the automated analysis may correct information regarding Permanent Preservation Areas (“APPs”), Legal Reserves, restricted-use areas, and administrative easements, without prior request.

Additionally, any real estate with its CAR analyzed and deemed compliant may request the cancellation of annotations related to commitment terms recorded in real estate registries. The state will offer free technical assistance to owners of real estate – including up to four fiscal modules – and may enter into cooperation agreements for the preparation of PRADAs and regularization measures.

RIO GRANDE DO SUL

Rio Grande do Sul regulates procedures for analysis and validation of the Rural Environmental Registry

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Infrastructure in collaboration with the Henrique Luiz Roessler State Foundation for Environmental Protection (“FEPAM”) published SEMA/FEPAM Joint Normative Instruction No. 9/2025, establishing administrative procedures for the analysis, validation, amendment, and cancellation of rural real estate registrations in the Rural Environmental Registry (“CAR”).

The regulation defines the procedures for validating the information submitted to the CAR for the purpose of certifying the environmental compliance of rural real estate with existing legislation, particularly in relation to APPs, Legal Reserves, restricted‑use zones, and consolidated areas. It also specifies that the analysis will be conducted through the SICAR module, with the option to use automated mechanisms and state cartographic databases. The normative instruction creates the Owner/Holder Portal as the official channel for monitoring analyses as well as submitting documents and corrections. Additionally, it establishes the CAR Management Committee, responsible for defining technical criteria and monitoring the progress of ongoing analyses.

Among its key provisions, the instruction outlines procedures for validating property boundaries, permissible area discrepancies, and overlaps with settlements, Indigenous lands, conservation units, and embargoed areas..

The normative instruction also sets deadlines for responding to notifications (120 days) and provides for the cancellation of the CAR after one year of suspension due to a lack of regularization. The regulation addresses the analysis of land use and cover, APPs, and Legal Reserves, establishing criteria for issuing notifications and requiring supporting documentation, as well as rules for amendments to registrations and for CAR cancellation in specific cases, such as overlaps or improper registration.

The regulation reinforces that, while the environmental authority has not ruled on pending issues, CAR registrations will be considered effective for all legal purposes. The normative instruction also authorizes field inspections and requires that registration information be updated whenever there is a change in ownership or possession. With these measures, the state aims to ensure greater legal certainty and transparency in the CAR validation process, aligning it with the Forest Code and federal regulations.

MINAS GERAIS

Minas Gerais establishes guidelines for CAR analysis and regularization of Legal Reserve areas

On November 19, 2025, the State Secretariat for Environment and Sustainable Development (“SEMAD”), the State Environmental Foundation (“FEAM”), and the State Forestry Institute (“IEF”) published SEMAD/FEAM/IEF Joint Resolution No. 3,390/2025, establishing procedures for the analysis of the CAR of rural real estate in Minas Gerais and specifying the documentation required to support regularization processes of Legal Reserve areas.

The regulation establishes technical and administrative criteria for validating information declared in the CAR, including verification of real estate boundaries, APPs, consolidated areas, anthropized areas, and the location of Legal Reserves. The analysis will be conducted through the SICAR analysis module, prioritizing real estate associated with environmental licensing, intervention authorizations, or judicial proceedings. Notifications may be submitted via the Owner/Holder Portal, with a 120-day period for corrections, under penalty of registry suspension.

The regulation also sets permissible limits for discrepancies in area measurements and overlaps with other real estate, settlements, conservation units, and Indigenous territories, as well as rules for automatic rectification by the environmental authority in specific cases.

Finally, the regulation reinforces that the CAR registration is a prerequisite for Legal Reserve regularization and that previous administrative acts will be observed, ensuring legal certainty. The resolution also repeals SEMAD/IEF Joint Resolutions No. 3,132/2022 and SEMAD/FEAM/IEF No. 3,353/2025.

TOCANTINS

Tocantins establishes new geospatial bases for CAR analysis

On November 12, 2025, the Nature Institute of Tocantins (“NATURATINS”) published Ordinance No. 265/2025, providing for the adoption of new official geospatial vector bases for CAR registrations in the state of Tocantins.

The measure took effect on December 01, 2025, and is a mandatory reference for registration, technical analysis, validation, and other procedures related to CAR.

The regulation establishes the following official bases:

Hydrography from the Brazilian Foundation for Sustainable Development (“FBDS”);

Land use and cover from the MapBiomas Project, in its latest version available for Tocantins;

Slope map generated from the digital terrain model derived from the SRTM/NASA mission.

References must be used in all geospatial analyses, thematic cross-checks, and validations carried out by NATURATINS, ensuring greater precision, uniformity, and technical reliability in the processes. The ordinance also allows for the incorporation of other geospatial bases upon technical evaluation and specific normative act.

Its implementation does not invalidate previous analyses, but requires that any further analysis and review comply with the references adopted. Processes already concluded using different bases may be reviewed upon specific request. NATURATINS is responsible for the management, updating, maintenance, and institutional availability of the defined bases.

Waste use in agriculture

SANTA CATARINA

Santa Catarina establishes guidelines for waste use in agriculture, forestry, and industrial processes

On November 14, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Santa Catarina published CONSEMA Resolution No. 290/2025, establishing guidelines and criteria for the use of waste classified as Class I, IIA, or IIB as inputs in agriculture, forestry, industrial or construction processes, as well as procedures for environmental licensing and technical control.

The regulation stipulates that the use of such waste may only occur upon a specific Environmental Authorization (“AuA”) issued by the competent environmental authority, linked to the validity of the project’s operating license.

Activities such as co-processing, thermal treatment of waste, energy recovery in boilers, recycling of uncontaminated materials, and destinations authorized by the Ministry of Agriculture are excluded from the scope of this resolution. The AuA requirement is waived for situations involving reuse by the generator itself or the use of Class IIB waste, provided that other applicable regulations are met.

The resolution defines technical concepts such as waste characterization and classification according to Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (“ABNT”) standards, criteria for environmentally appropriate final disposal, and parameters for toxicity assessment (“FT”). Generators must submit a detailed description of the origin process, technical reports on physicochemical and ecotoxicological characterization, and classification according to NBR No. 10004, with analyses performed exclusively by laboratories accredited by the National Institute of Metrology, Quality and Technology (“INMETRO”). For Class I waste, an ecotoxicity test with standardized organisms is mandatory, following specific technical procedures.

Recipients must submit a complete project to obtain the AuA, including: Process flowchart; Description of waste incorporation;

Percentage and quantity to be used; Emission and effluent control systems; Functional and environmental assessment of the product; Identification of the technical team responsible, with Technical Responsibility Annotation (“ART”). The regulation sets FT toxicity limits and rules for temporary storage, in compliance with ABNT standards. It also requires that waste transportation comply with the Waste Transport Manifest (“MTR”) provided for in state legislation.

Use of prescribed and controlled burning

RORAIMA

Roraima extends authorization cycle for controlled burning and prescribed fire

On November 07, 2025, the State Foundation for Environment and Water Resources published FEMARH/PRES/DIRAF/DRH Ordinance No. 1,167/2025, extending the 16th authorization cycle for the use of prescribed fire and controlled burning in the state of Roraima.

The ordinance extends the authorization period for burning activities until December 06, 2025, maintaining the provisions established in the Roraima State Plan for Deforestation and Burn Control (“PPCDQ/RR”) and the guidelines of the National Policy for Integrated Fire Management. It also provides that authorized burns may be suspended based on a technical assessment by the State Committee for the Prevention, Control of Burns, and Wildfire Suppression, using monitoring data from the National Institute for Space Research (“INPE”) and alerts issued through the State Wildfire Prevention and Suppression System (“SEPCIF”).

The use of fire in agroforestry‑pastoral areas without authorization, or in violation of the terms of the issued authorization, will be considered illegal burning, subject to a fine of BRL 10,000 per hectare or fraction thereof, in compliance with Decree No. 12,189/2024.

Additionally, the ordinance establishes operational requirements for prescribed burning activities, including:

Prior notification of neighboring landowners;

Advance communication to Civil Defense and the Fire Department;

Maintenance of firebreaks;

Availability of water sources and suppression equipment; and

Execution only during safe burning windows – after the first rains and under low‑wind conditions;

All of which aim to ensure adequate risk mitigation and prevent the spread of wildfires.

Special regularization program

GOIÁS

Goiás extends deadlines for Special Regularization Program and repeals provisions on land subdivision

On November 19, 2025, SEMAD published SEMAD Ordinance No. 585/2025, amending Ordinance No. 753/2024, which established the Special Regularization Program, aiming to extend its validity period and repeal provisions related to land subdivision.

The regulation extends to two years – counted from November 13, 2024 – the period during which unlicensed or unregistered agents responsible for projects or activities may regularize their status, including their eligibility for the discounts offered under the program. This extension applies to activities such as animal confinement, irrigated perennial agriculture, and projects involving dams, provided that corrective registration or licensing is requested within the established period.

In addition to the extension, the regulation repeals item IV of §1 of Article 4, Section IV on “Land Subdivision Activities”, of Chapter III, as well as Article 8 of Ordinance No. 753/2024.

Environmental licensing

FEDERAL

Senate approves creation of Special Environmental License for strategic projects

On December 03, 2025, the Federal Senate approved Provisional Measure No. 1,308/2025, converted into Bill of Conversion No. 11/2025, which creates the Special Environmental License (“LAE”) for projects deemed strategic by the Federal Government.

Bill No. 11/2025 now proceeds to presidential sanction. The LAE will apply to activities or projects defined as strategic by decree, based on the biennial proposal of the Government Council. Among the expressly listed cases are reconstruction and repaving works on existing highways connecting federal units, such as BR-319, which links Porto Velho (in Roraima) to Manaus (in Amazonas). The regulation also allows projects that use environmental resources and cause significant environmental degradation to request the LAE, provided that they comply with the established conditions.

Finally, Bill No. 11/2025 removes the provision for financing technical assistance to affected communities, which was included in the previous version of the text. It also reinforces that the LAE does not eliminate the obligation to comply with environmental and social conditions addressed in the legislation.

Congress overturns vetoes and reinstates provisions of the General Environmental Licensing Law

On November 27, 2025, the Brazilian National Congress overturned 52 executive vetoes of Law No. 15,190/2025 (“General Environmental Licensing Law”), reinstating provisions regarding the waiver and simplification of environmental licensing, entrepreneurs’ responsibilities, and the definition of the competencies of federal, state, and municipal authorities. The Presidency will now promulgate the sections rejected by the Brazilian Parliament.

Among the reinstated provisions are rules allowing the waiver of environmental licensing for specific activities until the universalization targets addressed in Law No. 14,026/2020 are met. The waiver covers activities such as maintenance and improvements of existing highway infrastructure, power and gas pipeline installations, and basic sanitation works.

Provisions simplifying licensing for lower-impact projects were also reinstated, such as small or medium-sized activities with low or medium pollution potential, which may use the Environmental License by Adhesion and Commitment (“LAC”), upon the applicant’s commitment to comply with predefined requirements established by the licensing authority.

Another relevant point is the possibility of issuing the Corrective Operating License (“LOC”) to regularize activities operating without an environmental license, subject to conditions proportional to the identified impacts. The law also reinforces that environmental restrictions imposed on entrepreneurs must have a technical justification and a direct link to the project’s impact.

By overturning the vetoes, the law restores greater autonomy to federative entities to define concepts such as activity size, pollution potential, and typologies subject to licensing. It also allows states and municipalities to establish criteria for applying the LAC. Additionally, the regulation also relaxes the requirement for prior consent from federal agencies for vegetation suppression in the Atlantic Forest, making such consent advisory rather than mandatory if there is a delay in response.

With the vetoes overturned, the General Environmental Licensing Law takes effect with provisions that expand simplification and flexibility in licensing, establishing new parameters for strategic works, rural activities, and infrastructure projects, while maintaining the need for technical studies and conditions proportional to environmental impacts.

MATO GROSSO

Mato Grosso establishes procedures for environmental licensing of energy cogeneration in ethanol plants

On December 02, 2025, the State Environmental Council (“CONSEMA”) of Mato Grosso published CONSEMA Resolution No. 75/2025, establishing the criteria and procedures for the environmental licensing of energy cogeneration activities in facilities dedicated to producing ethanol from sugarcane. The regulation aims to integrate cogeneration licensing into the main industrial activity’s licensing process.

The resolution defines key concepts, such as:

Primary energy – energy available in nature without transformation.

Secondary energy – resulting from the conversion of primary energy, such as electricity or petroleum derivatives.

Energy cogeneration – combined production of thermal and mechanical/electrical energy from a single source, such as sugarcane biomass.

Environmental Control Report (“RCA”) – a simplified document for low-impact projects.

Cogeneration licensing will be carried out in a single process, jointly with the ethanol industry’s licensing, and will be considered an ancillary and complementary activity. Technical documents and studies must be submitted in an integrated manner, ensuring a unified environmental analysis. For expansions, an environmental impact study will not be required, and submission of the RCA will suffice.

The regulation emphasizes that cogeneration must follow the same licensing class and typology assigned to the main facility and provides measures for simplification and efficiency, aligned with the National Environmental Policy and the National Environment Council (“CONAMA”) resolutions.

PARANÁ

Paraná regulates environmental licensing for biodigesters with biogas energy recovery

On November 13, 2025, the Water and Land Institute (“IAT”) published IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025, establishing definitions, criteria, guidelines, and procedures for the environmental licensing of biodigesters intended for biogas energy recovery in the state of Paraná.

The regulation applies to the licensing of biodigesters designed for the treatment of industrial, urban, or rural effluents and organic waste, as well as for the energy recovery of biogas generated in existing sanitary landfills. Additionally, the resolution defines essential technical concepts such as anaerobic biodigestion, biogas, biomethane, digestate, and solid waste, and establishes parameters for classifying projects according to size and category.

Among its key provisions, the instruction establishes the types of environmental licensing, which may be:

Three-phase (Preliminary License, Installation License, and Operating License);

Two-phase; and

Single-phase (Simplified Environmental License), in addition to establishing specific procedures for the regularization and expansion of projects. IAT Normative Instruction No. 24/2025 also establishes necessary administrative procedures, such as:

Declaration of Exemption from Environmental Licensing;

Licenses by Adhesion and Commitment;

Simplified Licenses;

Preliminary, Installation, and Operating Licenses;

Environmental and forestry authorizations.

Moreover, the normative instruction establishes standards for liquid effluent discharge, parameters for agricultural use of digestates, requirements for specific projects, safety measures for biodigester operation and biogas handling, rules for waste and effluent transportation, location criteria for project implementation, and guidelines for mitigating environmental impacts.

REGULATION – MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK (MAPA)

Federal Government recognizes certification bodies for agricultural sustainability programs

On November 17, 2025, the Brazilian Federal Official Gazette published MAPA/MF Interministerial Ordinance No. 27, recognizing certification bodies and Participatory Organic Conformity Assessment Bodies (“OPACS”) responsible for three strategic programs of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (‘”MAPA”): Integrated Production (“IP Brazil”); Good Agricultural Practices (“BPA”); and Organic Production.

The regulation implements CMN Resolution No. 5,229/2025, which establishes bonuses for producers adopting sustainable practices, thereby strengthening the governance of certifications used to access rural credit based on environmental criteria.

Key provisions include:

Recognition of certification bodies and OPACS authorized for IP Brazil, BPA, and Organic Production programs, valid until June 30, 2026.

Integration of information into the Agro Brasil + Sustainable Platform (AB+S), which will provide a compliance verification solution – essential for interest rate reductions in financing under Plano Safra.

Responsibility of certifiers and organizations to keep all data on classification, inclusion, or exclusion of certified producers updated on the platform.

Penalties for certifiers and producers in the event of non-compliance with sustainable practice criteria, including loss of bonuses.

A consultation platform for financial institutions to verify certification validity before granting credit.

In case of VGM infrastructure unavailability, a contingency system will ensure automatic continuity of program access, and rural producers will be notified of activation and deactivation of contingency levels through communication channels listed on MAPA’s website.

On November 03, 2025, MAPA launched the Management Dashboard of the ABC+ Plan, a tool that consolidates the results of technologies promoted by the Sectoral Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change and Low-Carbon Emission in Agriculture and Livestock (“Plano ABC+”), focusing on transparency and monitoring of national mitigation and adaptation targets.

The dashboard enables national and state-level performance assessment of the ten sustainable technologies (“SPSABC+”) promoted by the plan, including practices such as:

Recovery of degraded pastures;

No-till farming;

Crop-Livestock-Forest Integration Systems (“ILPF”);

Planted forests;

Bioinputs;

Irrigation;

Management of animal production waste;

Intensive finishing systems.

The request for import authorization will be submitted for analysis by MAPA and, if authorized, may be valid for a single import operation or multiple import operations, depending on the associated health and phytosanitary risks and the characteristics of the product.

The initiative results from partnerships between the Secretariat for Rural Development (“SDR/MAPA”) and the Federal Data Processing Service (“SERPRO”) through a Technical Cooperation Agreement (“ACT”), and between the SDR and the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (“CNPq”) through a Decentralized Execution Term (“TED”).

Among the key points discussed in the regulation are:

Consolidation of metrics for the ten SPSABC+ technologies, enabling analyses at national and state levels.

Availability of information on databases, methodologies, and glossaries used in building the dashboards.

Integration with the Integrated Information System of the Sectoral Plan (“SINABC”), strengthening the ABC Platform.

Strategic partnerships for technological development and promotion of sustainable practices.

MAPA updates list of quarantine pests present in Brazil

On November 12, 2025, MAPA published SDA/MAPA Ordinance No. 1,443/2025 – through the Secretariat of Agricultural and Livestock Defense –, amending the list of quarantine pests present in Brazil, as established in the Annex to Normative Instruction No. 38/2018.

The regulation adds new occurrence areas for two pests already monitored by MAPA under specific national prevention and control programs:

Rhizoctonia theobromae (Ceratobasidium theobromae) – affecting cassava crops; detected in Almeirim (PA).

Xanthomonas campestris pv. viticola – affecting grapevine crops; detected in the state of Rio Grande do Norte.

Key points:

The newly included areas will follow the rules of national phytosanitary prevention and control programs for the handling of host plants.

For cassava, handling affected material from affected areas to pest-free regions is prohibited to prevent pest spread.

The update reinforces the importance of phytosanitary surveillance and control of host plant handling activities.

Enforcement of these measures lies with state plant protection agencies, with official information available on MAPA’s website.

Decree modernizes oversight of plant-based products and consolidates agricultural regulations

On October 31, 2025, Decree No. 12,709 was published, unifying the regulation of plant-based products under numerous sectoral laws, including Law No. 14,515/2022, which established self-monitoring as the cornerstone of agricultural defense. The regulation represents a significant step forward by consolidating rules and aligning Brazil with international practices.

The decree sets technical standards to ensure compliance of plant-based products, including:

Sensory normality, quality, and quantity of the components;

Absence of harmful substances, contaminants, and deterioration;

Compliance with microbiological and physico-chemical limits;

Adoption of good manufacturing practices and appropriate technological processes; and

Preservation and presentation compatible with safe consumption.

Quality and identity standards will be established in complementary normative acts, and in the absence of such standards, the Codex Alimentarius may be used as a reference.

Traceability and recall

The decree requires all agents in the plant production chain – including producers, distributors, retailers, and importers – to implement traceability mechanisms for each product batch, supported by systematic and auditable records that allow identification of origin and monitoring handling across the entire supply chain. Information must remain available for inspection for 18 months after the product’s expiration date or shipment.

The decree establishes rules for recall procedures, which must be initiated when deficiencies or non-conformities are identified posing risks to consumer, plant, or animal health. In such cases, the responsible party or importer must immediately remove the product from the market at their own expense. This obligation includes halting commercialization, segregating the batch, and implementing the prescribed corrective measures, which may occur at the initiative of the operator, by order of the supervisory authority, or by administrative decision. MAPA will issue risk alerts with information on recalls and actions to be taken by involved parties.

Oversight and Inspecting Authorities

The decree establishes the Brazilian Inspection System for Plant-Based Products (“SISBI-POV”) to ensure identity, quality, and hygienic-sanitary safety of plant products. Implementation will occur under a voluntary adherence regime, with equivalent systems among the Federal Government, states, municipalities, and public consortia. MAPA is responsible for coordinating SISBI-POV and carrying out activities such as adherence audits, establishment and product registration, self-monitoring oversight, import/export certification, compliance program management, and other actions to mitigate agricultural defense risks.

Infractions and Penalties

Applicable penalties include warnings, fines, product condemnations, registration suspensions or cancellations, enrollments or accreditations, and revocations of professional authorizations. Minor infractions corrected prior to an official notice will not be recorded, in compliance with Law No. 14,515/2022. Fines range from BRL 100 to BRL 150,000, with a 10% increase for repeat offenses. Suspension or cancellation penalties may be converted into fines through a Conduct Adjustment Agreement (“TAC”). If it is accepted by MAPA, it will have the effect of an extrajudicial enforceable title.

Penalty assessment will consider the risk associated with the infraction, prior records, and mitigating or aggravating circumstances, ensuring proportionality and effectiveness in holding agents accountable.

Transition rules

The decree took effect on October 31, 2025, with immediate application, except for:

Guidelines for identifying facility and product registration and mandatory labeling descriptions for online product offers, which will take effect 90 days after publication, subject to complementary regulation;

Adjustments to beverage registration information for name changes, which will take effect 730 days after publication.

According to MAPA, omitted cases or questions regarding the new rules and requirements under Decree No. 12,709/2025 will be resolved by the Department of Inspection of Plant-Based Products.

REAL ESTATE REGULATION

Committee simplifies probate for small rural real estate

On November 12, 2025, the Committee on Agriculture, Livestock, Supply, and Rural Development of the House of Representatives approved Bill No. 3,720/2025, introducing significant changes for family farmers and small rural producers.

Among these changes, the bill authorizes that real property belonging to the estate of up to four fiscal modules may be probated directly at a notary’s office, without requiring an attorney, provided all heirs are legally competent and agree on the division.

The waiver of attorney involvement in simple probate proceedings represents a major shift, reducing costs and time to regularize rural real estate, which often remain under irregular ownership due to difficulties in completing probate proceedings. This measure may facilitate the transfer of rural real estate used in numerous operations, preventing disruptions caused by succession issues.

Despite the simplification, it is essential to ensure that the division is carried out with technical rigor, avoiding defects that could lead to nullities or future disputes. The possibility of using the public deed of probate to update records with the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (“INCRA”) and the RFB also contributes to integrating and updating registrations.

The bill is being processed under a conclusive procedure and will be reviewed by the Committee on Constitution, Justice, and Citizenship. To become law, the bill must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Federal Senate.

Senate discusses ratification of public land registrations in border zones

On November 07, 2025, the Senate Plenary approved Bill No. 4,497/2024, which addresses the ratification of real estate records resulting from alienations and concessions of federal lands in border zones carried out by the states. The text now returns to the House of Representatives for review.

Bill No. 4,497/2024 establishes that the responsibility for registration lies with notary’s offices – under INCRA’s supervision –, which will have five years to certify compliance with the social function of the real estate, as required by the Federal Constitution. The bill amends both the Public Records Law (Law No. 6,015/1973) and Law No. 13,178/2015, which governs land regularization in border zones.

The purpose of the bill is to ensure legal certainty for real estate records in border zones and eliminate requirements deemed unnecessary or impractical, aligning with STF decisions and the guidelines of the National Agrarian Reform Plan and of the National Agricultural Policy.

The proposal eliminates discrepancies among state-level regulations, bringing uniformity to the ratification process and greater predictability for real estate operations and rural credit transactions, ensuring legal certainty for the procedure.

Additionally, the five-year certification period by INCRA reinforces compliance with constitutional standards, potentially impacting unproductive or environmentally-liable real estate.

The measure is expected to unlock investments and regularize large areas, favoring structured operations, leases, and financing.",https://www.demarest.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/recorte-background-of-the-interior-of-a-minimalist-constru-2024-10-18-09-00-46-utc.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 13:56:14.318694

Tom Dent, R-Moses Lake and Sen. Judy Warnick, R-Moses Lake, have pre-filed bills for the upcoming 2026 legislative session. Rep. Alex Ybarra has not filed any bills, but has said in prior coverage that energy is a priority for the session that begins Jan. 12 and ends March 12.

Warnick filed three bills, including topics of wildfire risk models and insurance, carbon alternative jet fuel and workforce education. Dent filed two bills, including one extending wildfire aviation funding and another enhancing regulations on vehicle loads.

Wildfire aviation

Dent, alongside Reps. Larry Springer, D-Snoqualmie; Cindy Ryu, D-Shoreline; and Andrew Engell, R-Colville, filed House Bill 2104 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill is aimed at enhancing aviation assurance funding in response to wildland fires. This is a permanent extension to a bill that was previously passed by the 2023 legislature and set to expire in 2027.

Dent had previously told the Columbia Basin Herald this was one of his top priorities for the upcoming session.

“The fire departments have found great value in this program,” he said. “I am pushing to make this provision permanent, as it enhances our ability to respond quickly to wildfires, benefiting not only the environment but also the safety and well-being of our citizens.""

Provisions in the bill allow local fire departments to access certified aviation resources for the deployment of fire retardants and water, aimed at containing wildfires before they necessitate larger-scale state and federal interventions.

Dent explained this saves the state money by paying a smaller cost for aviation assistance versus the cost of a fire, which may become larger because it did not receive suppression assistance.

Additionally, the bill mandates the Department of Natural Resources to provide ongoing suppression funding and aviation resources, ensuring local departments maintain the financial capacity needed for effective initial attack strategies against wildfires.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WAHB2104.

Wildfire risk

Following the theme of wildfires, Warnick, along with Sen. Shelly Short, R-Addy, filed Senate Bill 5928 on Dec. 22, 2025. The bill aims to enhance transparency in property insurance related to wildfire risk in Washington State.

It mandates insurers to disclose several key pieces of information to policyholders when utilizing a wildfire risk score for underwriting or rating purposes, including the property’s current score, factors influencing the score, and options for mitigation.

Additionally, the bill requires insurers to provide this information in writing within set timeframes following applications for coverage or during policy renewals or cancellations. Insurers must also incorporate community-level and property-specific mitigation actions into their risk models, offering discounts for policyholders who undertake such measures.

The bill further stipulates that insurers to submit their risk models to the Insurance Commissioner, ensuring they comply with the outlined regulations while safeguarding sensitive information as trade secrets.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at bit.ly/WASB5928.

Jet fuel

Warnick also pre-filed Senate Bill 5932, which has to do with jet fuel production Dec. 23, 2025. She is the sole sponsor of the bill.

The proposed legislation seeks to promote the development of low-to-zero carbon alternative jet fuel, also known as sustainable aviation fuel.

The bill highlights the necessity for state support to achieve emissions reduction goals outlined in various climate policies, ensuring alternative jet fuel production aligns with Washington's clean energy objectives.

The bill stipulates tax credits will be available for manufacturers and users of alternative jet fuel, contingent upon the establishment of facilities capable of producing at least 20 million gallons annually.

Furthermore, the legislation emphasizes the assignment of carbon intensity attributes based on energy sourcing and mandates that credits can only be claimed following verification by the appropriate state departments, ensuring an organized and accountable approach to promoting sustainable aviation fuel.

There is no cost analysis available as of Friday. More information on the bill can be found at: bit.ly/WASB5932.

Vehicle loads

Following the theme of transportation, Dent, alongside Rep. Adam Bernbaum, D-Olympic Peninsula, and Shelley Kloba, D-Kirkland, pre-filed House Bill 2109 on Dec. 8, 2025. The bill aims to enhance safety on public highways in Washington by establishing stricter regulations for securing vehicle loads.

The bill specifies that no vehicle should operate on public roads unless its load is secured to prevent it from dropping, spilling, or leaking, with specific provisions for covering loose materials such as dirt and gravel.

Violations may lead to criminal repercussions, categorized into different degrees based on the severity of harm or property damage caused by the unsecured load.

Importantly, the bill allows public maintenance vehicles to drop sand or use other substances to maintain traction or road conditions without penalty.

The bill does not have a cost analysis report yet. However, more information about the proposed legislation can be read here: bit.ly/WAHB2109.

Workforce education

Warnick, alongside Sen. T’Wina Nobles, D-Fircrest, filed Senate Bill 5931 on Dec. 23, 2025. The bill establishes the Workforce Education Investment Accountability and Oversight Board, comprising 18 members from various sectors, including the legislature, businesses, labor organizations, higher education institutions, and students.

The board will consist of four legislative members and 14 appointed by the governor, focusing on business representation, labor organizations, and education stakeholders to ensure diverse perspectives.

The board’s primary objectives include providing legislative guidance on workforce education funding priorities and ensuring investments lead to improved student success and career readiness, as measured by retention and job placement rates.

Additionally, if passed, the board will consult data from the Education Data Center and will report its recommendations to the legislature annually by December 31st.",https://hagadone.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/photos/2026/01/05/1.2_Bills_2_t1200x630.jpg?b488907419a4f4bb2699a58f7dac3d0615975bd7,N,,2026-01-06 13:57:03.016724

Global commitment is booming, driven by mandates and massive capital pushes, even as the industry grapples with the cold, hard reality that building gigascale clean fuel plants is, well, hard. This investment focused post confirms that green aviation is now a serious financial play, clocking in £14.7 billion in global private investment, with the USA snagging 46% of that total.

Europe Steps Up the to Plate with a €100 Billion Insurance Policy

The clear leader in terms of policy muscle is Europe, which is deploying huge public funds to de-risk this crucial sector. The European Commission unveiled the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), a strategic roadmap aiming to unlock the estimated €100 billion (about $108 billion) required by 2035 to scale production. This massive investment is a direct response to the binding ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, which requires SAF blending to start at 2% in 2025 and rise dramatically to 70% by 2050.

As a short-term kick-start, the EU expects to mobilize at least €2.9 billion until the end of 2027 through existing programs like InvestEU and the European Hydrogen Bank. Eight EU member states recently launched the eSAF Early Movers Coalition to mobilize at least €500 million ($580 million) specifically for synthetic aviation fuel (eSAF) projects. This coalition aims to introduce novel mechanisms, such as double-sided auctions, to provide the revenue certainty that producers and financiers desperately need to greenlight new factories. Think of this public commitment as a government-backed insurance policy, guaranteeing that high initial costs won’t result in stranded assets.

Meanwhile, across the Channel, the UK is getting serious too, moving to pass the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill to introduce a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism. This mechanism guarantees a fixed “strike price” for SAF producers, boosting investor confidence and accelerating Final Investment Decisions (FIDs) to meet the UK’s 2030 target of 10% SAF blending.

American Companies Score Big Deals

While Europe relies on heavy-handed mandates, the US investment scene is driven by corporate ingenuity – and perhaps a touch of regulatory uncertainty. Corporate venture arms, still recovering from COVID-19 and facing tight budgets, are creatively tackling capital-intensive sectors like SAF by “clubbing together” on investments. The Oneworld Alliance airlines, including American and Alaska Airlines, jointly backed a $150 million SAF fund managed by Breakthrough Energy Ventures. This approach pools expertize and protects long-term SAF investments from short-term corporate priority shifts.

In commercial news, logistics giant DHL Group committed to purchasing over 300 million liters of SAF from Phillips 66 over three years, one of the largest such agreements by a US producer. This fuel will come from Phillips 66’s massive Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California, a former oil refinery converted to process only waste feedstocks.

On the development front, XCF Global completed initial site work for its second SAF facility, New Rise Reno 2, representing a $300 million planned investment to nearly double its production capacity to 80 million gallons annually. Even international players are flocking to the US, with Korean Air partnering with Samsung E&A to explore SAF production and supply chains, citing the US’s advanced technology and abundant feedstock availability.

LanzaJet’s World First

In a massive technological breakthrough, US-based firm LanzaJet successfully produced commercial SAF from ethanol at its Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia. This achievement marks a world first for alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) technology operating at a commercial scale. Industry analysts had been warning that SAF made using traditional Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) pathways was approaching a plateau due to feedstock limitations, making LanzaJet’s alcohol-based solution a sound alternative. The technology can harness widely available ethanol feedstocks, including municipal solid waste and agricultural residues, potentially opening new pathways for waste sources to contribute to the aviation energy mix.

The Price Tag and the Reality Gap

Despite the flood of money and mandates, the SAF industry is facing a reality check regarding scale and cost. The unfortunate truth is that project failures and delays currently outnumber successful completions. By 2024, only 24% of announced global SAF production capacity was realized on time. Over 40% of the announced capacity for 2030 risks delays or cancellations.

This slow scale-up, coupled with surging demand from European mandates, is sending prices through the roof. Neat SAF prices in Europe recently hit a two-year high of nearly $3,000 per metric ton, making it approximately four times the cost of conventional jet fuel. Analysts warn that this volatile, illiquid market is destabilizing and risks eroding confidence among investors and policymakers. It appears there simply aren’t enough used fryers in the world – or, as one expert put it, “There are not enough McDonald’s on the planet to feed 30,000 planes every day” – to meet growing demand through traditional feedstocks alone.

With the supply shortage being so acute, the targets set by airlines are now “beyond the reach of the vast majority,” according to IATA Director General Willie Walsh at the IATA Global Media Day. Never one to mince words, Walsh described the pace of progress toward net zero as “disappointing and worrying,” making the ambition “more and more challenging and more expensive”. The hard numbers bear this out: the growth rate for SAF production is slowing down. While SAF output is expected to hit 1.9 Mt in 2025 (making up 0.6% of consumption), growth is projected to crawl to 2.4 Mt in 2026, reaching only 0.8% of jet fuel consumption.

The core of the problem, according to IATA, is that regulators introduced mandates, particularly in Europe, that have not spurred greater production but have instead led to “price gouging” by fuel suppliers. Rather than increasing supply, suppliers are allegedly abusing their position to introduce “compliance fees,” which are nothing more than costs passed on to airlines to shield themselves from penalties for not meeting the mandated targets.

This behavior, which Walsh called “ripping us off,” resulted in a staggering cost for airlines operating within Europe and the UK in 2025. Of the $2.9 billion premium paid for the limited 1.9 Mt of SAF available, $1.5 billion was incurred solely as these compliance fees. This artificial price hike has made SAF up to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Walsh criticized regulators for introducing a mandate that “has driven this behaviour” and the fuel suppliers for failing to deliver production while protecting their profitability.

Airlines are thus forced to hold onto older aircraft, pushing the average fleet age above 15 years. The result? Expected fuel efficiency gains for the industry have slowed drastically, projected to be only 1.0% in 2026, down from a historical average of 2.0% per year. The sector is currently stuck in a climate Catch-22: unable to access the clean fuel they are mandated to buy, and unable to acquire the cleaner planes they need to reduce consumption.

Tackling Non-CO2 Effects

Finally, aviation is confronting its “other” climate problem: contrails. These thin ice-crystal clouds, formed by aircraft exhaust, are now recognized as capable of generating a warming effect that can exceed the CO₂ emissions of the flight itself.

The UK has launched the QRITOS project, led by Rolls-Royce, British Airways, and Heathrow, to study how SAF deployment can be optimized to address this hidden danger. The crucial insight is that fuel chemistry matters: ultra-clean SAF, particularly that derived from the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, generates fewer soot particles, drastically reducing warming contrails.

Since SAF remains scarce, the solution is “precision deployment,” targeting the limited supply to specific flights, flight levels, and weather windows where persistent contrails are most likely to form, maximizing the climate benefit of every clean drop. It turns out that to truly clean up the skies, there is a need for fuel that is not just sustainable, but precision-engineered.

In Closing

The international push for Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a paradoxical story of unprecedented financial commitment colliding head-on with sobering scaling realities. Driven by key legislative actions, the European Union has pledged billions toward the required €100 billion ($108 billion) investment by 2035 to meet ambitious mandates, while the UK is establishing a statutory Revenue Certainty Mechanism to de-risk investment in domestic SAF projects. On the technology front, innovation is delivering new pathways, notably LanzaJet’s world-first commercial production of SAF from ethanol using its Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology, a crucial step as traditional feedstock supplies face a potential plateau.","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vYxv!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F59509289-e100-4967-97d3-91334669804a_1794x1194.png",N,,2026-01-06 12:12:18.878056

What are the different types of sustainable fuels?

Sustainable fuels include the following:

Conventional biomass-based fuels are produced from organic matter, including food crops. These fuels are typically blended with small amounts of conventional fossil fuels.

Ethanol is a well-known conventional biofuel. First-generation ethanol is made from corn, while second-generation ethanol is produced from residues such as bagasse, a byproduct of sugarcane processing. Ethanol is used primarily in gasoline blends.

Other biofuels include fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), a type of biodiesel derived from either vegetable oils or animal fats. Biomethanol is produced from agricultural residues, woody biomass, or byproducts from pulp mills. And biogas is produced through the anaerobic digestion of waste streams such as manure, food waste, or wastewater.

Drop-in sustainable fuels can be used in existing, conventional internal combustion engines (ICE). These can be produced from either edible or residue biomass sources by using low-carbon hydrogen or by synthesizing sustainable captured carbon and low-carbon hydrogen. Drop-in fuels have already been used as replacements for diesel, jet fuel, and natural gas.

Non-drop-in e-fuels or hydrogen-based fuels are manufactured by using captured carbon and hydrogen from low-carbon electricity sources (such as renewable or nuclear energy). Low-carbon hydrogen produced through electrolysis is also sometimes known as liquid hydrogen or gaseous hydrogen. When hydrogen is combined with acceptable sources of carbon, it can form e-fuels such as e-methanol or e-ammonia.

Regional Overview

North America continues to lead in revenue share, supported by long-standing low-carbon fuel incentives, ample agricultural inputs, and fast uptake among heavy-duty fleet operators. At the same time, aggressive capacity additions have sparked discussions around potential oversupply, encouraging producers to explore export routes. Competition for limited waste-based feedstocks between the United States and Canada remains a key vulnerability for the region.

Europe stands out as the fastest-moving market, powered by stricter transport decarbonization rules and rising sustainable aviation fuel mandates. Several countries are expanding advanced biorefineries that integrate with existing industrial hubs to improve efficiency. While alternative feedstocks from forestry residues help ease pressure, the region is increasingly reliant on imports, prompting closer scrutiny of supply traceability.

MIAMI, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF), a Delaware-incorporated company advancing enzymatic biorefining solutions for renewable fuels and functional nutrition, today announced Strategy 2026, outlining its transition from technology validation to disciplined, industrial-scale commercialization across global energy and wellness markets.

Strategy 2026 prioritizes the scaling of UMeWorld’s Malaysia-based biofuel platform to address the global Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) opportunity, alongside continued expansion of its DAGola™ functional nutrition platform.

Strategy 2026: Global Industrial Execution

B2B Ingredient Strategy

Building on the commercial validation of DAGola™, UMeWorld is expanding its enzymatic processing capabilities into a high-margin B2B ingredient strategy, supplying global food and ingredient manufacturers with clinically validated diacylglycerol (DAG) oils designed to improve lipid metabolism in consumer products.

Capital Markets Readiness

The Company is preparing for a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, leveraging its Delaware corporate structure and international operating footprint to attract institutional ESG- and energy-transition-focused capital.

Biofuel Platform: Addressing the SAF Feedstock Constraint

UMeWorld’s biofuel strategy targets one of the primary bottlenecks limiting global SAF adoption: the scalable availability of low-carbon, waste-based feedstock.

Malaysia Pilot Facility

Capacity: 10,000-tonne annual nameplate capacity

Feedstock: Locally sourced POME, used cooking oil, and animal fats

Regulatory Alignment: Engineered to meet EU ReFuelEU Aviation carbon-intensity thresholds

As part of its execution strategy, UMeWorld has received a proposal from an experienced international biofuel engineering group to support detailed process design, plant engineering, and project management for the Malaysia facility. The proposed scope includes process integration, equipment specification, construction oversight, and commissioning support, with the objective of accelerating industrial validation while maintaining capital discipline. The engineering group under consideration has prior experience supporting the delivery of waste-based biofuel and renewable diesel facilities at commercial scale.

In parallel, UMeWorld has identified a qualified general contractor with experience in industrial energy and biofuel infrastructure to support construction execution for the Malaysia pilot facility. The Company is currently advancing site selection within Malaysia, evaluating locations based on feedstock availability, logistics access, utilities, permitting considerations, and development timelines. To support local development, permitting, and project execution, the Company plans to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in Malaysia to serve as the operating entity for the biofuel pilot facility.

“The Malaysia facility is the cornerstone of our industrial strategy,” said Michael Lee, Chief Executive Officer of UMeWorld. “By validating our enzymatic process configuration and operating model at industrial scale, we are establishing a replicable blueprint for future SAF deployment while maintaining execution discipline.”

Functional Nutrition: Regional Validation and U.S. Expansion

UMeWorld’s DAGola™ brand serves as the commercial proof-of-concept for the Company’s enzymatic processing platform and its ability to execute localized production and distribution strategies across markets.

APAC Performance: Following a late-December 2025 regional launch, DAGola™ generated approximately USD $132,934 in initial unaudited revenue.

January 2026 Outlook: Based on secured distributor orders, management expects January regional revenue to scale to approximately USD $1.10 million, representing an eight-fold increase over the launch period.

United States Production & Expansion: DAGola™ products for the U.S. market are bottled in California, supporting regulatory compliance, supply-chain resilience, and brand positioning. In addition, localized production and bottling mitigate tariff exposure and cross-border trade friction. The Company intends to pursue similar localized production and bottling strategies in other international markets, where appropriate, to improve logistics efficiency, tariff management, and market responsiveness.

Corporate Governance and Capital Markets Readiness

In October 2025, the Company completed a statutory merger under which UMeWorld Inc., a Delaware corporation, became the surviving legal entity. Operations are conducted through the Delaware entity, supporting the Company’s U.S. reporting framework and global operating strategy.

Because the Company’s shares trade on the OTC Markets, certain corporate actions associated with the merger, including issuer name changes and related matters, remain subject to review and effectiveness by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Until that process is completed, public disclosures continue to reference UMeWorld Limited (OTC: UMEWF) for trading and reporting purposes.

The Company’s operational activities are centered in Miami, Florida, with Asia-Pacific operations being established in Malaysia to support regional management, manufacturing coordination, and future growth initiatives.

Uplisting Preparation

UMeWorld has engaged investment banking advisors to support a potential uplisting to the NYSE American or Nasdaq, subject to regulatory approvals and market conditions. Management believes such a transition would enhance trading liquidity, broaden institutional participation, and support the Company’s long-term growth strategy.

2026 Outlook

Entering 2026, UMeWorld believes it is positioned with:

Demonstrated commercial revenue traction across international markets

A scalable enzymatic platform spanning functional nutrition and renewable energy

A defined, EU-aligned pathway toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) commercialization

A focused U.S. expansion strategy for DAGola™, supported by localized production

Strengthening corporate governance and capital markets infrastructure

“Our focus in 2026 is execution,” Lee added. “We are building credibility through real commercialization and disciplined growth, with the objective of creating durable long-term value for shareholders.”

About UMeWorld

UMeWorld is a Delaware-based company advancing renewable fuel production and functional nutrition through enzymatic processing technologies licensed and configured for its commercial operations. Its biofuel platform converts waste-based feedstocks into low-carbon fuels, while its DAGola™ products support metabolic health through improved lipid metabolism.

Since forward-looking statements and information address future events and conditions, by their very nature, they involve inherent risks and uncertainties.","Listing Positions Syntholene as the First Publicly Traded Pure-Play Synthetic Fuel (eFuel) Company on any European Exchange

Chicago, Illinois--(Newsfile Corp. - January 6, 2026) - SYNTHOLENE ENERGY CORP (TSXV: ESAF) (""Syntholene"" or the ""Company"") announces that the Company's common shares have been approved for listing and have commenced trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Frankfurter Wertpapierbörse) under the trading symbol FSE: 3DD0. The Frankfurt co-listing is intended to broaden the Company's European investor audience and increase visibility within one of the world's most important clean energy and synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) markets.

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange is one of the largest and most liquid securities markets in Europe, and serves as a primary access point for European institutional and retail investors. The Company's primary listing remains on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol ESAF.

""Listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a strategically important step for Syntholene,"" stated Syntholene CEO Dan Sutton. ""Europe is the center of global eSAF and eFuel markets today through its mandated demand, and policies encouraging market growth. Providing European investors with direct access to our shares aligns our capital markets strategy with the strongest structural tailwinds for eSAF. We view this as a natural extension of our TSXV listing and a foundation for long-term engagement with European stakeholders as we drive deployment of production infrastructure within the European Economic Zone.""

Syntholene believes the Frankfurt co-listing supports the Company's presence and investor access in Europe, which is an important market for eSAF. The European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates rising sustainable aviation fuel blending requirements across all major EU and European Economic Zone airports beginning in 2025 (EASA). These binding requirements, combined with targeted eSAF subsidies of up to €6 per liter (Reuters) for qualifying synthetic fuels, create one of the world's most robust and durable demand frameworks for producers of next-generation eFuels.

eFuel Market

Synthetic aviation fuel is a clean, drop-in-ready jet fuel made from renewable power, green hydrogen, and captured CO₂, offering up to 90% lower lifecycle emissions and helping airlines meet global decarbonization mandates without changing their aircraft engines or retrofitting.

The broader global aviation fuel market size was valued by Fortune Business Insights at USD 391.23 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow from USD 431.70 billion in 2024 to USD 819.73 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 8.35% during the forecast period (Fortune Business Insights).

According to a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global sustainable aviation fuel market is projected to expand from an estimated USD 2.06 billion in 2025 to approximately USD 25.62 billion by 2030, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 65.5%.

Within these projections lies the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, the European Union's landmark mandate requiring airlines and fuel suppliers to adopt sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at all major EU and EU Economic Zone airports starting in 2025. The regulation sets binding, rising SAF blending requirements of 2% in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035 and up to 70% by 2050, creating one of the world's largest guaranteed markets for clean jet fuel (EASA).

The EU has also paired this demand-side measure with a supply-side subsidy, offering up to 6€ per liter to airlines that purchase eSAF specifically (Reuters). The combination of mandated demand and subsidized supply underscores the EU's seriousness about bolstering the rapid scale-up of eSAF production from producers like Syntholene.

About Syntholene

Syntholene is actively commercializing its novel Hybrid Thermal Production System for low-cost clean fuel synthesis. The target output is ultrapure synthetic jet fuel, manufactured at 70% lower cost than the nearest competing technology today. The company's mission is to deliver the world's first truly high-performance, low-cost, and carbon-neutral synthetic fuel at an industrial scale, unlocking the potential to produce clean synthetic fuel at lower cost than fossil fuels, for the first time.

Syntholene's power-to-liquid strategy harnesses thermal energy to power proprietary integrations of hydrogen production and fuel synthesis. Syntholene has secured 20MW of dedicated energy to support the Company's upcoming demonstration facility and commercial scale-up.

Founded by experienced operators across advanced energy infrastructure, nuclear technology, low-emissions steel refining, process engineering, and capital markets, Syntholene aims to be the first team to deliver a scalable modular production platform for cost-competitive synthetic fuel, thus accelerating the commercialization of carbon-neutral eFuels across global markets.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October.
Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA.
In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025.
“Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume.","Ethanol accounted for 11.06 percent of the nation’s gasoline in October, marking the first time in history that the monthly ethanol “blend rate” has topped 11 percent, according to newly released data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The Renewable Fuels Association said the record-high blend rate reflects the expanding use of E15 and flex fuels like E85, and should put to rest—once and for all—the myth that a so-called “blend wall” prevents ethanol from making up more than 10 percent of the gasoline pool.

The 12-month average blend rate, which reflects longer-term trends, also hit a record of 10.48 percent in October. Expanding availability of E15 appears to be the driving factor in the blend rate increase, according to RFA. In Iowa, for example, E15 accounted for roughly 25 percent of total gasoline sales in November, virtually doubling since the start of 2025. And with E15’s legal approval in California in October, RFA is working with retailers in that state to make the more affordable blend available to Golden State drivers as soon as possible.

“The new data from EIA and the Iowa Department of Revenue provide clear evidence that ethanol is continuing to gain market share in the U.S. fuel market as American drivers increasingly choose lower-cost, cleaner-burning E15 and flex fuels like E85,” said RFA President and CEO Geoff Cooper. “The numbers also prove that the fictitious ‘blend wall’ is nothing but an imaginary barrier created by those who oppose American-made renewable fuels produced from American-grown crops.”

Cooper noted that expanding sales of E15 in 2025 were facilitated, in part, by the Trump Administration’s timely issuance of emergency fuel waivers allowing E15 sales to continue throughout the summer months. However, the emergency waivers are a “band-aid fix,” he said. “To truly unleash lower-cost E15 in the marketplace, we need Congress to pass legislation that permanently removes the decades-old regulatory red tape that prevents most retailers from offering E15 to their customers during the busy summer driving season. Passing year-round E15 legislation would not only continue to build on the progress we saw in 2025, but it would also open a badly needed new market opportunity for our nation’s farmers.”

RFA also underscored the importance of quickly finalizing EPA’s proposed 2026-27 renewable volume obligations, which include the highest-ever renewable fuel blending requirements. “The continued expansion of E15 depends, in large part, on EPA’s pending action to finalize robust RFS volumes for 2026-27 and full reallocation of any small refinery exemptions granted for 2023 and later compliance years,” Cooper said. “Indeed, EIA’s data clearly show that the average ethanol blend rate actually reversed course and fell when EPA granted SREs en masse in the 2018-19 timeframe and failed to reallocate the lost volume. Farmers, ethanol producers, and consumers simply can’t afford a repeat of the demand destruction we experienced due to SREs seven years ago.”

Based on EIA’s latest short-term energy outlook, maintaining an average blend rate of 11 percent for a full year would equate to 15 billion gallons of domestic ethanol consumption.",https://ethanolrfa.org/image/691/1000/gas-station-night.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 09:57:19.918549

So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass?
The REFRAME project is part of Schmidt Sciences’ Virtual Institute on Feedstocks of the Future (VIFF).","NC State University researchers will use a grant from Schmidt Sciences to develop an AI-enabled, open-source platform that can analyze the potential to convert agricultural leftovers — biomass such as misshapen sweet potatoes or their discarded green tops — into biofuels or other bioproducts, creating new business opportunities.

The four-year project, Resource Engineering Framework for Responsible, Augmented Modeling and Engagement (REFRAME), supports the path to a circular bioeconomy, where biomass is repurposed to create new materials. This approach reduces waste, creates opportunities for entrepreneurs, and provides new sources of income for farmers and agribusinesses.

To find the best ways of converting sweet potatoes and green tops into biofuel, for example, a sustainable aviation fuel company will be able to use the new platform to analyze the current yield in an area and determine where to locate a collection facility or biorefinery. The platform will be designed to assist farmers, processing plants, researchers and policymakers in making decisions.

NC State University’s Daniela Jones will lead the project. She is an assistant professor in the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, joint appointment faculty member with Idaho National Laboratory, and N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative Education and Workforce Development Platform director. REFRAME co-leads are NC State University’s Debjani Sihi from the Department of Plant and Microbial Biology, Joe Sagues from the Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering, and Cranos Williams from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Additional collaborators are from Idaho National Laboratory, the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, ICF International and McCarl & Associates.

We asked principal investigator Jones to explain the team’s plan for REFRAME.

How will you approach the REFRAME project?

My expertise is in supply chain analytics, so our efforts cover the full supply chain. So in terms of availability, where is this agricultural biomass? In terms of accessibility, how do we move it from point A to point B? How can we characterize it? What are its qualities? What can it become through conversion? What would be the cost? What would be the impact or the shock from introducing a new product into the market? How would farmers respond? How would biomanufacturing affect land use? These are examples of the questions we want to be able to answer much more rapidly with an AI-enabled platform.

Will you incorporate any existing digital models or tools?

For all of these supply chain components, we have identified some legacy models, models that have been developed for years that are open source and that have been tackling one aspect of the supply chain — for example, agronomic models that analyze availability of biomass. However, these legacy models have always worked in silos. A lot of people have worked very diligently on one model, but strong connections between models don’t currently exist. The pipeline, in waiting for the delivery of one model’s output so that it can go into another as an input, takes months and years.

How will you apply AI to help with these issues?

What we are creating is first a digital backbone, a digital environment where we can store and have the computing capacity to be able to run a model multiple times so that we can create AI surrogates that are much faster. By creating simplified versions of these models that run faster, we have the potential to predict things that were not previously possible with the legacy models. So that’s the gist of it. We will create this pipeline of models and it will become accessible to anyone out there as an AI-enhanced, open-source platform.

The new stretched A350 widebody touched down at 10:41 am local time in Taipei on January 6, 2026, according to Flightradar24. The new jet will bring a greater capacity airframe to the steadily growing STARLUX stable of Airbus jets.

STARLUX & Airbus: Growing Together

STARLUX has proven to be a strong customer of the A350 family, and the airline’s 28-strong fleet exclusively consists of Airbus jetliners. Last year at the Paris Air Show, the airline ordered 10 more A350-1000 variants, adding to an order that also includes A350F cargo models. The Airbus A350 family is steadily growing as the maker attempts to recapture the market segment that has been dominated by the 787 Dreamliner.

Although the composite Boeing jet beat the A350 to market, the latter offers more range and greater capacity than even the largest 787-10 variant. This, combined with the reputational dent that Boeing has suffered in recent years, has helped the European manufacturer gain favor with operators like STARLUX. STARLUX Airlines CEO Glenn Chai made these remarks following the carrier’s additional order of A350-1000s in June 2025:

“Expanding our international fleet with additional A350-1000s is a significant step toward reinforcing our global presence. (...) [It is] the perfect fit for our strategy to optimise long-haul operations while delivering an exceptional passenger experience.”

A First For STARLUX & Taiwan

STARLUX’s rivals in Taiwan, EVA Air and China Airlines, have also ordered the A350-1000 but have yet to receive their first examples. As Air Insight reported, STARLUX was the first to sign on the dotted line for the extra-long A350-1000 at the Farnborough International Airshow in July 2018.

The airline’s competitors did not finalize their first order until 2025, highlighting how early adoption of Airbus's latest and greatest clean sheet airliner is giving STARLUX a leg up today. With the first already on the ramp in Taipei, the airline has a backlog of 17 A350-1000s expected to be delivered in the future.

STARLUX also flies the A350-900, the first of which was received in 2022. The exceptional fuel efficiency and range, paired with the dramatically improved cabin comfort of the A350XWB has been received enthusiastically. In addition to the growing order book of STARLUX Airlines, more operators around the Asia Pacific region have shown strong interest in A350 models, such as Cathay Pacific and others.

The XWB Difference

The A350, also known as the XWB for 'eXtra WideBody,' is the first Airbus jet made from scratch with composite materials in mind as the primary basis for its construction. The aircraft has proven to be exceptionally fuel efficient, low maintenance, reliable, quiet, and, thanks to its very strong fuselage, much more comfortable for passengers. Inside the A350 are upgrades that are both obvious immediately once you step on board, and those that are invisible but make a dramatic difference.

The cabin is pressurized to a lower altitude than legacy aircraft and has a higher humidity level, significantly reducing discomfort in flight and jet lag after landing. Airbus notes that the A350 is already able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel ( SAF) in its effort to greatly reduce emissions, even beyond the 25% lower fuel consumption levels already offered by the jet. Airbus aims to make its aircraft up to 100% SAF capable by 2030.

The A350 family has more than 1,400 orders from 60 customers, with 157 ordered in 2025, and over 650 planes in service with 38 operators today. There were 44 A350s delivered in 2025. The manufacturer's scramble to achieve its 2025 goal of 820 deliveries saw 793 reach customers before the new year. While falling short of the original goal, that number was right on target for the revised tally after supplier issues slowed things down.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tail-livery-of-the-first-starlux-a350-1000.jpg?w=1200&h=675&fit=crop,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:09.951311

The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action.
This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.
Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects.","Biogas and biomethane could help Colombia reduce its dependence on foreign natural gas during periods of supply pressure, according to the Ministry of Mines and Energy, reports Bnamericas.

The ministry said studies carried out by the Mining and Energy Planning Unit (UPME) show that Colombia has strong potential to produce biogas and biomethane using agricultural waste, livestock residues and organic urban waste.

To make use of this potential, the ministry has issued a draft decree proposing technical rules for bringing these alternative fuels into the energy system. The proposal would amend Decree 1073 of 2015 and introduce changes to how locally produced and imported gas is declared and sold.

The ministry said recent developments in the natural gas market have exposed structural weaknesses that require government action. It said intervention is needed to address market imbalances, protect competition, ensure supply security and safeguard consumers.

According to the ministry, gas producers have been reporting steadily lower production capacity. Current projections suggest output could fall to between 750 and 780 billion British thermal units per day by 2027, compared with earlier estimates of more than 1,000 BBTU per day.

It added that actual gas production has been running 5 to 15 per cent below declared capacity due to maintenance work, operational issues and the natural decline of mature gas fields. This has increased Colombia’s reliance on imported gas, exposing the country to international price fluctuations and logistical risks.

Industry body Naturgas said Colombia now has limited flexibility because of falling domestic gas supply, rising imports and delays in major strategic projects. It said average gas supply over the past five years stood at about 1,074 BBTU per day, but declining local production has meant that between 7 and 19 per cent of gas used in 2024 and 2025 had to be imported. So far this year, imports account for about 20 per cent of total gas consumption.

The Ministry of Mines and Energy has invited public comments on the draft decree, which can be sent by email. The full proposal and supporting documents have been made available for review.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Biogas-7.png,N,,2026-01-06 08:57:17.247137

This proactive commitment has now reached a new milestone: decarbonising our air freight. We are proud to announce a new partnership with DHL Express to reduce 100% of our share of air freight emissions in the DHL transport network.

Starting January 2026, we invest in reducing emissions corresponding to 100% of our B2B and B2C jewellery distribution emissions through DHL GoGreen Plus. As part of DHL’s commitment to reduce carbon emissions, GoGreen Plus is a logistics solution that enables businesses to lower their indirect supply chain (Scope 3) emissions through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). This powerful collaboration cements our shared commitment to sustainability and ensures our deliveries are part of our aim to reduce emissions throughout our supply chain. By integrating SAF, we are offering a tangible, low-carbon solution; marking a major milestone in our ongoing sustainability journey.

THE IMPACT

SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80%* over its lifecycle compared to conventional jet fuel. In other words, a single air shipment can not be fully climate-neutral in itself. However, the ambitious companies that take part in investing in SAF can reduce up to 100% of their share of air emissions within the logistics network through a book-and-claim system.

THE SCIENCE

Unlike traditional fuel, which releases carbon locked away underground, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a biofuel made from non-fossil, renewable resources. SAF is an alternative liquid fuel, with a drastically lower environmental impact than traditional jet fuel. It utilises certified feedstock such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and agricultural waste.

THE CYCLE

Because the feedstock absorbs carbon during its lifecycle, the carbon released when SAF is burned is largely balanced, significantly reducing carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel.

Since beginning our emissions reporting in 2021, we have proactively sought ways to lower our footprint by adopting recyclable materials and altering business practices. Our total emissions for 2024 equated to 324 tCO2e, a 6% emission reduction from the previous year. Transportation and distribution (part of Scope 3 emissions) represented 29,6% of our total emissions during 2024 - presenting our second biggest driver of emissions. With ambitious growth targets going forward, reducing distribution emissions will be crucial to make a difference across our value chain.

In our commitment to drive sustainable change, we strategically invested in SAF to achieve a 30% reduction in emissions for our B2C jewellery distribution in 2024. Building on this progress, we increased the impact to a 50% emission reduction across both B2C and B2B in 2025. This corresponded to reducing half of all jewellery shipment emissions in our logistics chain; from supplier and wholesale shipments to online orders. Starting January 2026, we substantially increase our investment across B2C and B2B, reducing 100% of our share of air emissions across the DHL transport network.

The shift to Sustainable Aviation Fuel not only reduces our carbon footprint over time, but also supports the global transition to cleaner logistics solutions. While there’s a long journey ahead reaching net zero in carbon air freight, SAF remains the closest solution to this goal. This vital step represents a significant transformation, reflecting our belief that responsible business practices require action beyond the industry standard. Our aim is to continuously align our growth with our long-term commitment to environmental responsibility, strengthening our licence to grow.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, from scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure. These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade. Here are five milestones that defined this progress.

Advancing sustainable aviation: Largest SAF agreement in the U.S.

Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

Cutting emissions at sea: Partnership with CMA CGM

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen on the horizon: First pilot in the Middle East

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL’s commitment to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

Fully electric delivery across Germany

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.

Solar-powered warehousing in Asia

Beyond operational carbon neutrality, DHL is exploring facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency. In Thailand last year, DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.

The year is likely to be rough for many companies commercializing biobased chemicals and fuels, according to Jim Flatt, CEO of DMC Biotechnologies.
Flatt said biobased chemicals will have an easier time than sustainable fuels because the sector enjoys fewer federal subsidies.
He said he’s always urged his bioeconomy peers to have business plans that benefit from subsidies but don’t require them.
Even as subsidies wane, some biobased fuel firms will also advance in 2026.","The world of biobased chemicals will be tumultuous in 2026. In some corners, new technology platforms will emerge, and companies will start to produce meaningful volumes. In other corners, start-ups and projects will falter and fall as an uncertain policy environment scares off investors, especially in the US.

The year is likely to be rough for many companies commercializing biobased chemicals and fuels, according to Jim Flatt, CEO of DMC Biotechnologies. The US government has pulled sharply away from supporting cleantech, and many consumer-facing firms that were interested in the environmental benefits of biobased feedstocks are backing away from their sustainability goals in response.

Flatt said biobased chemicals will have an easier time than sustainable fuels because the sector enjoys fewer federal subsidies. He said he’s always urged his bioeconomy peers to have business plans that benefit from subsidies but don’t require them. “The companies that make it through this will have the ability to thrive.”

DMC, one of C&EN’s 10 Start-Ups to Watch in 2022, said at the Alternative Fuels and Chemicals Coalition’s recent annual meeting in Washington, DC, that this year, it will start selling myo-inositol to the nutraceutical market at a scale of hundreds of metric tons and L-alanine to cleaning-product makers at thousands of metric tons. DMC installs metabolic switches in fermentation microbes so that operators can toggle between growth and production phases with simple chemical cues.

Other firms are doing this kind of biosynthesis outside the cell. One start-up that even pulls its name from the idea is eXoZymes. Chief Commercial Officer Damien Perriman said at the meeting that he hopes the name is so clear it gets genericized, like Kleenex or Dumpster, as a shorthand for the concept. The firm is using artificial intelligence along with reams of public and private protein-structure data to reengineer natural enzymes so they are stable and efficient in a reactor instead of a cell.

Part of the appeal of cell-free biosynthesis is not having to tend to the needs of a complex, living organism to keep reactors running, said Alex Rosay, CEO of Cascade Biocatalysts. Rosay’s start-up immobilizes and protects enzymes within polymer brushes affixed to tiny silica beads. The enzymes still need some babying, such as a steady supply of cofactors or metal ions, but all the sugar or other biochemical fuel goes to the desired reaction instead of being split between chemical production and cellular reproduction.

Even as subsidies wane, some biobased fuel firms will also advance in 2026. Nearly all the biofuels on the market today are made by upgrading used vegetable oil, but the supply of that feedstock is nearly all spoken for, according to Keith Gillard, CEO of Sustaero. The firm is converting old wood pulp mills to make syngas and liquid fuels instead of paper; its first plant is scheduled to come on line in 2029.

The alcohol-to-jet fuel company Gevo, meanwhile, expects to approve a final investment decision this year on a plant in North Dakota that would make 114 million L per year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from ethanol. Other routes to SAF are progressing too, such as Captis Aire’s thermochemical process to make the fuel from wood-waste terpenes and Twelve’s electrolysis stack that makes it from carbon dioxide via carbon monoxide. Captis Aire has sold a full barrel of fuel from its pilot plant in Arizona, and Twelve is constructing a demonstration-scale plant in Washington State.

These investments aside, a US policy environment that is unfriendly now and uncertain for the future will push bioeconomy investment dollars overseas, predicted Joanne Ivancic, executive director of the advocacy nonprofit Advanced BioFuels USA. China is rapidly adding the renewable electricity infrastructure that’s needed to produce low-carbon fuels and chemicals, Europe is enacting policies that mandate the use of biobased and circular feedstocks, and global consumer demand for sustainable products is growing every year.

Investors won’t stop trying to capitalize on the sustainability megatrend just because the US market has become inhospitable for cleantech, Ivancic said. Instead, they’ll look elsewhere for projects they can invest in safely.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/WCO--Biobased-chemicals-and-fuels---266250:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2026-01-06 08:58:22.959380

Unfortunately, due to the limitations of its scale, facilities and capabilities, our evaluations have confirmed the refinery in its current form is not viable. The liquidators and Official Receiver have also confirmed that no viable bids were received that would have resulted in a return to refining operations, allowing all Prax employees to be retained.

Commenting on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce, David Hooper, said: “We are pleased to see Phillips 66 acquire the Prax site which will help to secure the future of Phillips 66 in the Humber, but there are still concerns around the remaining jobs which are only guaranteed until March. We hope as many people as possible will be able to find work within the expanded Phillips 66 refinery operations”.",,N,,2026-01-06 08:58:27.170460

IATA reports SAF production reached 1.9 million tonnes in 2025, criticises EU and UK mandates for limiting supply and raising costs for airlines.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has released updated estimates for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, highlighting challenges in scaling the industry. In 2025, SAF output is expected to reach 1.9 million tonnes (2.4 billion litres), double the 1 million tonnes produced in 2024. Growth is projected to slow in 2026, reaching 2.4 million tonnes. Despite this increase, SAF will account for only 0.6 per cent of total jet fuel consumption in 2025, rising to 0.8 per cent in 2026. At current prices, the SAF premium will add approximately USD 3.6 billion in fuel costs for the airline industry in 2025.

The downward revision from earlier forecasts reflects insufficient policy support to fully utilise installed SAF capacities. SAF costs exceed conventional jet fuel by a factor of two, and by up to five in mandated markets.

“SAF production growth fell short of expectations as poorly designed mandates stalled momentum in the fledgling SAF industry. If the goal of SAF mandates was to slow progress and increase prices, policymakers knocked it out of the park. But if the objective is to increase SAF production to further the decarbonisation of aviation, then they need to learn from failure and work with the airline industry to design incentives that will work,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Mandates in the EU and UK have failed to accelerate SAF production and adoption. In Europe, ReFuelEU Aviation has sharply increased costs amid limited SAF capacity and oligopolistic supply chains. Fuel suppliers have raised profit margins so that airlines pay up to five times the price of conventional jet fuel and double the market price of SAF, without guaranteeing supply or consistent documentation. In the UK, SAF mandates have also triggered price spikes, forcing airlines to absorb significant costs. In total, airlines paid a premium of USD 2.9 billion for the limited 1.9 million tonnes of SAF available in 2025.

“Europe’s fragmented policies distort markets, slow investment, and undermine efforts to scale SAF production. Europe’s regulators must recognise that its approach is not working and urgently correct course. The recent European Commission STIP announcement is a step forward though it lacks a clear timeline. Actions, not words, are what matter,” said Walsh.

The shortfall in SAF supply will force many airlines to review their 2030 SAF commitments. “Regrettably, many airlines that have committed to use 10 per cent SAF by 2030 will be forced to reevaluate these commitments. SAF is not being produced in sufficient amounts to enable these airlines to achieve their ambition. These commitments were made in good faith but simply cannot be delivered,” said Walsh.

With e-SAF mandates approaching in the UK (2028) and EU (2030), policymakers must avoid repeating previous mistakes. “Given the low SAF production volumes, it is evident that current policies are not having the desired effect. Faced with such facts, regulators must course-correct, ensure the long-term viability of SAF production, and achieve scale so that costs can come down. Mandates have done just the opposite, and it is outrageous to repeat the same mistakes with e-SAF mandates,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President for Sustainability and Chief Economist.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2463328421-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 08:58:29.937566

The DHL Group said it is on track with its net-zero goal by 2050, citing five key achievements in its global decarbonization journey last year.

In 2025, the company advanced several key levers of its sustainability strategy, including scaling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to electrifying last‑mile delivery and building solar‑powered infrastructure, the company said in a media release.

“These achievements mark meaningful progress toward DHL’s goal of net‑zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050 and reinforce its role in building more sustainable, efficient, and resilient global trade,” it said.

One of last year’s milestones was setting up solar-powered warehousing in Asia and continuing to explore facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency.

DHL launched a solar-powered warehouse in Thailand that is expected to generate 100% of its energy on-site through a 4.2 MWp solar array and advanced battery storage. This facility eliminates reliance on fossil-based grid electricity and sets a blueprint for future logistics infrastructure worldwide.

In the Philippines, DHL entered into a strategic partnership with the Gokongwei Group, focusing on greenhouse gas emissions-reduced logistics solutions.

This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e – about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt, DHL said.

The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL’s West Coast operations.

At sea – where most global goods are moved, making sustainable marine fuel critical for reducing emissions – DHL said it has partnered with CMA CGM to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO₂e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions).

“That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport,” DHL said.

On land, hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. As such, DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East.

Last year, DHL signed an memorandum of understanding with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. DHL is also aiming to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet – the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer – by 2030, with Germany leading the charge.

The company also announced one of its largest electric‑vehicle purchases in 2025 consisting of 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation.

“The upgraded CNSL fuel from MASH Makes performed reliably across all tested loads, showing clean injection behaviour and no signs of degradation,” said Robert Bank, the team lead for team lead fuels and component analyses at FVTR.

“From a technical standpoint, it behaved comparably to conventional marine fuels.”

The upgraded CNSL also showed improved emissions compared to earlier blends: NOx slightly increased but stayed within IMO Tier II limits, CO levels remained stable, indicating good combustion and smoke decreasedat partial loads and increased only slightly at full load.

This test represents a key milestone in making CNSL a viable and scalable commercial fuel for shipping.

With this certification, Bunge becomes the first company worldwide to have soybeans approved under this high-level sustainability standard.","Bunge Brazil has received a major sustainability certification for soybeans supplied for the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marking an important step in efforts to reduce emissions from air travel, reports Milling Middle East & Africa.

The certification, announced in late December 2025, confirms that the soybeans meet strict standards for traceability and environmental responsibility throughout the supply chain. It follows the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) framework used for biofuel raw materials.

The certification was granted by SCS Global Services under the ISCC CORSIA PLUS system, which is recognised by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). It includes the ISCC CORSIA PLUS Low-LUC seal, which ensures that the soybeans can be traced back to their origin and are produced under strict farming rules.

According to the certification, soybeans processed at the facility carry a low risk of indirect land-use change, a key requirement to ensure that SAF production does not lead to deforestation or environmental damage.

The initiative covers soybeans sourced from Bunge’s operations in the states of Mato Grosso and Goiás. These operations follow zero-deforestation commitments, promote soil-friendly farming methods, and aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Certified volumes are initially estimated at around 100,000 tonnes. These supplies are expected to support SAF producers, including Brazilian airlines and international fuel refiners working toward carbon-neutral flights by 2050.

Audits carried out as part of the certification confirmed compliance with no-burning practices, improved soil management, and protection of biodiversity.

The certification supports ICAO’s broader CORSIA programme, which requires airlines to cut emissions by using carbon offsets and cleaner fuels such as SAF.

With demand for SAF rising steadily, certified Brazilian soybeans could play an important role for airlines seeking to meet international climate requirements.

The process builds on Bunge’s fully traceable soy supply system, which has been expanded from 80 per cent coverage in the Cerrado region to full traceability. The system uses digital tracking to monitor the supply chain from farms to processing.

The soybeans also meet requirements under the European Union’s deforestation regulation set to take effect in 2026. These include farm location tracking and low-emission farming practices such as reduced soil disturbance and crop rotation.

Brazil, the world’s largest soybean exporter with annual shipments of about 170 million tonnes, is under increasing pressure to ensure sustainable sourcing as new European import rules come into force.

Industry observers say the move places Bunge ahead of competitors such as Cargill and ADM and could allow the company to earn higher prices for soybeans used in aviation fuel.

Global demand for SAF is growing by about 20 per cent each year, driven by ICAO climate policies. Brazil has set a target of blending five per cent SAF into aviation fuel by 2030.

With this certification, Bunge becomes the first company worldwide to have soybeans approved under this high-level sustainability standard. For Brazil, the development highlights the growing role of agriculture not only in food supply but also in supporting cleaner energy solutions to address climate change.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 08:59:16.147827

As 2025 began, the global aviation sector stood at a critical crossroads: Industry stakeholders were working to balance post-COVID recovery with ambitious net-zero emission goals. However, progress was shaped by various risks — economic, technological, ideological, and geopolitical. The biggest hurdle in aviation’s decarbonization journey remains the cost and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), along with questions about its sustainability credentials. Despite this, 2025 saw major advancements across the sector.

In January, the European Union implemented its first SAF mandate through the RefuelEU Aviation Directive. The regulation requires airlines to blend SAF with conventional jet fuel, with minimum blending targ set for airports handling over 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of freight annually. In support of this mandate, the European Commission allocated over $110 million worth of EU Emissions Trading System allowances to help airlines cover the cost difference between fossil fuels and SAF.

The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) also made key progress by adopting a global framework for SAF, Low Carbon Aviation Fuels and other clean energy sources. An implementation roadmap and a long-term monitoring and reporting methodology were approved, with oversight by ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection.

In September, ICAO partnered with the International Renewable Energy Agency to launch Finvest@ETAF, a global portal designed to connect SAF developers with investors across the value chain. This initiative is expected to help accelerate investment and support the sector’s decarbonization goals. According to a Gena report published in August, a total of 11.3 million tons of SAF production capacity has reached final investment decision. The report forecasted a potential increase to 19 Mt annually by 2030 in a best-case scenario.

Meanwhile, several major companies announced agreements. In September, Catagen, a developer of modular SAF production systems, signed offtake agreements with Ryanair and Shell. The same month, Oneworld (a group of airline partners) joined forces through Breakthrough Energy Ventures to invest in next-generation SAF technologies, as reported by Green Air.

While challenges remain, particularly in technology scalability and fuel economics, coordinated efforts across research, policy and innovation are positioning aviation to take a leading role in the global climate response. Investment continues to pour into SAF, electric aviation and climate-aligned technologies, supported by international platforms like the G7 and G20, which reinforce the need for sustained global cooperation.

For ground transportation, sustainability is manifesting through a mix of technological innovation, consumer preferences and governmental regulations. There was a significant increase in the number of electric vehicles on the road, with global production exceeding 85 million vehicles, according to the International Energy Agency’s report, “Trends in the Electric Car Industry,” published in May. The reduction in the cost of solid-state batteries and an improvement in energy density helped. The EU’s Fit for 55” legislative package aims to install 3 million public chargers by 2030.

On another front, autonomous vehicles are moving into practical applications, including freight and logistics, and pilot programs leading to autonomous public transportation. In artificial intelligence-driven urban mobility, algorithms are being perfected to optimize traffic flows, predict demand, personalize mobility experiences, and improve safety. In March, Science News Today reported on the push to make hyperloop technology and high-speed rail transportation the way for future high-speed ground transportation. The Boring Company is striving to drastically cut-down travel time using zero-emission systems and in 2025 built 68 miles (109 km) of tunnels. Japanese trains such as Maglev and Europe’s Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) are making fast headway towards becoming the more sustainable mode of transportation between cities. The TEN-T’s completion dates are 2030 for the core network, 2040 for the extended core network, and 2050 for the comprehensive network.",https://aerospaceamerica.aiaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SAF-fuel-loading.jpg,N,,2026-01-06 02:56:41.548313

Revealed on 5 January, the so-called Kahuewai Hawaii Investment Plan calls for sustained investment in Hawaiian’s physical and digital infrastructure, particularly in airports in Hawaii.

The Honolulu-based member carrier of Alaska Air Group plans to begin upgrading customer-facing technology –and the lobbies and gates at airports in Honolulu, Lihue, Kahului, Kona and Hilo – starting this year and continuing through decade-end.

Meanwhile, it will start overhauling its full fleet of A330s in 2028. New furnishings will include seats, carpets, lighting, first-class suites and a premium economy cabin.

Hawaiian says it is ”acquiring three of its A330 aircraft off lease to support the future of this fleet in its service across the Pacific”.

Fleets data provided by aviation analytics firm Cirium show that Hawaiian currently operates 33 A330-200s and -300s.

In addition to the newly announced investment plan, Alaska Air Group said last month it is investing in Hawaii-produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through partnerships with energy producer Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific.

The airline does not disclose financial details of those investments.

”Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation,” the airline group says.

Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian plan to become the launch customers for Par Hawaii’s locally produced SAF in the first quarter. Meanwhile the companies are studying the use of camelina sativa – a flowering plant that grows both agriculturally and naturally in Hawaii’s tropical climate – as feedstock for the development of future SAF products.

Pono Pacific says it is launching a subsidiary called Pono Energy to accelerate development of camelina as a source of feedstock.

The company says that camelina is a ”high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens”.

Using farmland to produce SAF for airline operations is controversial, as some studies have highlighted land-use issues such as reducing space available for food production.

Service

There’s five courteous, friendly crew serving the cabin, dispensing amenity packs – which have been cancelled by most airlines for economy passengers – a thoughtful touch I appreciate.

Food

Is it a burger? Is it a dish? On the first leg a ‘chicken burger’ is presented with chicken patty, sauteed vegetables, dips and bread roll on separate plates. Figuring it’s a build-your-own situation, I devour the extremely delicious maybe-burger. The second dish of traditional, juicy mince kofte with a succulent tomato bulgur, buttered rice and mung bean salad beautifully salutes their DNA as Turkey’s national flag carrier. Both meals are restaurant level in flavour and creativity.

My fork is poised excitedly during the second leg, but Malaysia catering hasn’t understood the assignment. A mushroom and omelette is piping hot and palatable, but something in my soul dies with the breakfast in a box. Like the chicken and Emmental panini, served later, I feel sad and soggy. Blast you, panini, we almost hit economy food perfection.

Sustainability

Turkish Airlines aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050 and is expanding the use of SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) to new routes. *

Two free nights in a 4-star Istanbul hotel? Sign me up! The Turkish Airlines Stopover offer is like a mini bonus holiday and reason alone to fly with the airline.

The price

From about $1800 Sydney to Istanbul return in economy class. Flights to European cities with a lot of competition are cheaper, for example Sydney to Rome is just $1350 return; Sydney to Paris is $1450.

The verdict

Advertisement

“I’ve just booked them for Christmas, have I made a good choice?” a curious friend messages. “Excellent move! Won’t regret,” is my immediate reply. If you haven’t heard much about Turkish Airlines (yet), it’s because they began flying their own planes into Sydney and Melbourne in late 2024 (previously it was a codeshare partner to Asia). So now you can experience from our shores why they won Skytrax’s Best Airline in Europe award in 2025 for the 10th time.

The short legs from Istanbul make this feel like the world’s quickest flight to Europe, though it will feel even quicker when the airline launches its planned non-stop flights from Sydney to Istanbul this year. If it wasn’t for the greasy chicken panini in an otherwise gastronomic adventure, it would be top marks.

This represents a further thanfifty-fold increase, driven by strict nonsupervisory authorizations, ambitious airline decarbonisation targets, and evolving consumer demand for greener trip. This explosive growth signals a major metamorphosis for the global aeronautics assiduity and presents immense openings within the broader clean energy transition.

Unprecedented Market Growth Driven by Policy and Demand

exploration indicates the SAF request is poised for a composite periodic growth rate( CAGR) of around 43 from 2025 to 2035. This acceleration is n't simply academic ; it's unnaturally sustained by concrete policy fabrics. Leading the charge are blending authorizations from major nonsupervisory bodies.

The European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation action, for case, requires that 6 of all aeronautics energy be sustainable by 2030, rising sprucely in posterior times. also, the United States has introduced its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, aiming to supply enough SAF to meet 100 of public aeronautics energy demand by 2050. coincidently, major airlines and commercial trip programmes are making bold net- zero commitments, creating a important,multi-faceted pull for SAF product.

Scaling Production: The HEFA Pathway Leads, New Technologies Emerge

presently, the dominant product system for SAF is the Hydroprocessed Esters and Adipose Acids( HEFA) pathway, which converts waste canvases , fats, and greases into energy. This technology is well- understood and certified for use, but it faces limitations regarding the scale and sustainability of its feedstock force.

To meet the colossal unborn demand, the assiduity is laboriously developing and spanning advanced pathways. These include

Alcohol- to- spurt( AtJ) Converting waste- grounded alcohols.

Power- to- Liquid( PtL) Using renewable electricity, water, and captured carbon dioxide to synthesise energy.

Gasification and Fischer- Tropsch( FT) Processing solid biomass or external solid waste.

Commercialising these technologies is critical to diversifying feedstocks beyond natural accoutrements and achieving truly scalable, low- carbon aeronautics energy product.

Navigating the Challenges to Widespread Adoption

Despite the auspicious outlook, significant hurdles must be overcome for the SAF request to realise its full eventuality. The most prominent challenge is cost; SAF remains significantly more precious than conventional spurt energy, frequently going two to five times as much.

This price gap necessitates probative government programs, similar as duty impulses and carbon pricing mechanisms, to ameliorate competitiveness. likewise, erecting the necessary product, storehouse, and distribution structure at a global scale requires enormous capital investment. Eventually, icing the environmental integrity of SAF through robust sustainability instruments and transparent lifecycle emigrations account is essential to maintain public and investor confidence.

A Catalyst for Broader Economic and Environmental Change

The rise of SAF extends far beyond the aeronautics sector. It's poised to stimulate invention and investment in conterminous diligence, including husbandry, waste operation, renewable energy, and carbon prisoner.

The development of a indirect bioeconomy, where waste aqueducts come precious feedstocks for energy, presents a compelling model for sustainable assiduity. Successfully spanning the SAF request is extensively viewed as anon-negotiable element of global sweats to achieve net- zero emigrations, offering a practical pathway to decarbonise a sector that's notoriously delicate to exhilarate.

Conclusion: A Sector Poised for Take-Off

The protuberance of a$ 350 billion SAF request by 2035 underscores a vital shift in the future of flight. While the path forward involves complex challenges related to technology, cost, and structure, the confluence of nonsupervisory pressure, commercial ambition, and technological progress creates important instigation.

Our Kahu’ewai Hawai’i Investment Plan represents one of Hawaiian Airlines’ largest single investments in our infrastructure, products and services in Hawai’i.
It reflects our kuleana to our people and guests in the islands and reinforces our commitment to deliver safe and remarkable service that enables Hawai’i and Hawaiian Airlines to thrive.” Diana Birkett Rakow, Chief Executive Officer, Hawaiian Airlines “Hawaiian Airlines’ investment is exactly the kind of long-term commitment Hawaiʻi needs.
We appreciate Hawaiian Airlines’ partnership in advancing workforce development, regenerative tourism, clean energy, and community programs that reflect the values of our islands.”","Hawaiian Airlines has announced a more than $600 million, five-year investment program aimed at modernizing airport infrastructure across Hawaiʻi, improving digital and operational technology, and refreshing key elements of its onboard experience, while expanding community and sustainability initiatives in the islands.

The initiative, branded the Kahuʻewai Hawaiʻi Investment Plan, is designed to improve the guest journey from booking through day-of-travel and equip airport and in-flight employees with updated tools and workspaces. Hawaiian said the plan will also support efforts to advance lower-emission technologies and expand programs tied to regenerative tourism, culture, and conservation.

A central pillar of the investment is a multi-airport renovation program scheduled to run from 2025 through 2029. Hawaiian said it will renovate lobbies and gates at Honolulu, Līhuʻe, Kahului, Kona, and Hilo to improve passenger flow and comfort, with updated seating, expanded amenities, and additional power charging. In Honolulu, the carrier’s largest hub, Hawaiian plans to build a 10,600-square-foot premium lounge at the entrance to the Mauka Concourse in Terminal 1.

On the technology front, Hawaiian said it will launch a redesigned app and website in spring 2026, with updated functionality intended to simplify travel planning, booking, and trip management, including self-service capabilities such as changing flights and redeeming award travel on global partners. The airline is also investing in new technology to support employees across operations, and said the full impact of these improvements will be realized once Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines share the same passenger service system and Hawaiian joins the oneworld alliance, both targeted for late April 2026.

Hawaiian also outlined a longer-term cabin retrofit program for its widebody Airbus A330 fleet, based in Honolulu. Starting in 2028, the A330s are slated for a full interior upgrade that includes new seats, carpets, and lighting, as well as first-class suites and the introduction of a premium economy cabin. The carrier said the updated experience will include a Bluetooth-enabled in-flight entertainment system with high-definition seatback screens and an expanded content library, plus fast, free Starlink Wi Fi. Hawaiian also said it is acquiring three of its A330 aircraft off lease to support the long-term future of the fleet in its Pacific network.

The airline’s plan also includes new loyalty incentives targeted at residents. Hawaiian said it will provide Huakaʻi by Hawaiian loyalty members who live in Hawaiʻi with a 50% bonus on Atmos Rewards points and status points earned on Neighbor Island flights, adding to kamaʻāina benefits that it said already include a free checked bag, quarterly discounts when flying within the state, and monthly systemwide deals.

Beyond customer and operational upgrades, Hawaiian said it will expand partnerships in education and workforce development, pursue new grant-making opportunities, and extend sustainability investments focused on regenerative tourism and natural resource preservation. The carrier said it is expanding its partnership with business accelerator Mana Up by investing in the Mana Up Capital II fund to help more local companies scale globally. It noted it has featured more than a dozen local retailers on board since becoming Mana Up’s official airline sponsor in 2017.

Hawaiian also pointed to recent sustainable aviation fuel and emissions-related initiatives, including an investment tied to locally produced sustainable aviation fuel in partnership with Pono Pacific and Par Hawaii, with deliveries of Hawaiʻi-made sustainable aviation fuel expected later in 2026. The airline said it is also investing in hybrid electric propulsion developer Ampaire to support lower emission options for short haul flying and increasing the use of electric ground service vehicles at Honolulu airport.

As part of its community giving strategy, Hawaiian said it will provide grants to nonprofit organizations supporting cultural programs, environmental preservation, and the perpetuation of Native Hawaiian art and language through the Alaska Airlines | Hawaiian Airlines Foundation, a newly integrated 501(c)(3) foundation focused on these efforts in Alaska and Hawaiʻi. Hawaiian framed the investment plan as part of Alaska Air Group’s Alaska Accelerate strategy for the combined airline group.

The company creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar diesel, and solar gasoline.
Synhelion’s solar fuel production process involves creating renewable synthetic crude oil, or “syncrude,” using solar heat energy and sustainable materials.
Solar fuel can be produced and stored for when sunlight is unavailable, much like solar energy storage, giving the sustainable fuel an edge over fossil fuels.","Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and the cleantech company Synhelion have entered into a long-term offtake agreement for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Beginning in 2027, the airline will purchase at least 200 tons of solar-derived jet fuel annually.

The agreement establishes SWISS as the first airline to sign a binding five-year contract with Synhelion, supporting the commercial scale-up of synthetic fuel production. Under the partnership, SWISS acts as a customer, investor, and strategic partner.

“The partnership with Synhelion is a significant step for SWISS on the path to decarbonising our flight operations,” said Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS.

“Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are a core element of our sustainability strategy. The offtake agreement with Synhelion sends a strong signal for innovation and responsibility in aviation.”

Creating synthetic solar fuel

In 2024, Synhelion inaugurated DAWN: calling the project ‘the world’s first industrial plant for the production of solar fuels’. The company creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), solar diesel, and solar gasoline.

Synhelion’s solar fuel production process involves creating renewable synthetic crude oil, or “syncrude,” using solar heat energy and sustainable materials.

This syncrude is processed in existing refineries alongside fossil crude to produce certified Jet-A-1 fuel. The resulting fuel is compatible with current infrastructure and logistics chains, requiring no technical adjustments for delivery to airports.

Solar fuel can be produced and stored for when sunlight is unavailable, much like solar energy storage, giving the sustainable fuel an edge over fossil fuels.

“The fact that SWISS, a leading airline, has committed early on to adopt our fuels demonstrates confidence in the market readiness of our technology,” commented Philipp Furler, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of Synhelion.

“This partnership is a milestone for the commercial market launch of our fuels – and sets a powerful example to other airlines worldwide.”

Logistics

The partnership also involves logistics provider Kuehne+Nagel, which will purchase a portion of the solar fuel from SWISS. The fuel will be used for air freight via Swiss WorldCargo to help cargo customers reduce their carbon footprints.

This long-term agreement follows an initial delivery in July 2025, when SWISS used Synhelion’s solar fuel in regular flight operations for the first time.

That fuel was produced at Synhelion’s DAWN plant and refined in northern Germany before entering the supply system at Hamburg Airport.

The move is among the first initiatives of its kind in the Gulf’s leisure marine sector, reports Zawya.com.

With this step, DMYC and CMYC have become some of the earliest marinas in the region to offer sustainable biofuel for recreational yachts. The initiative supports Emaar’s broader sustainability strategy and aligns with the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 targets.

As part of the collaboration, both marinas will supply Sustainable Bio Yacht Fuel (SBYF) produced by Lootah Biofuels. The fuel is made from used cooking oil collected from hotels, homes and Emaar’s mixed-use developments. The waste oil is processed into marine-grade biofuel, allowing yacht owners to refuel with a lower-impact alternative directly at their home marinas.

An official from Emaar Hospitality Group said the company aims to place sustainability at the centre of its marina and hospitality operations. He said the introduction of bio yacht fuel gives members a clear and practical option to reduce environmental impact, while also encouraging more responsible practices in the leisure marine sector.

The rollout of SBYF will be carried out in phases to ensure smooth operations, reliable supply and consistent fuel quality. Dedicated refuelling points will be set up at both DMYC and CMYC, giving yacht owners and club members easy access to the new fuel option.

Emaar said the initiative reflects its focus on realistic, locally relevant solutions to reduce emissions, rather than broad commitments. The partnership also highlights how waste materials can be reused within a circular system across hospitality, leisure and marine operations.

Lootah Biofuels, a UAE-based company that specialises in biodiesel made from used cooking oil, will manage the collection, processing and supply of the fuel to both marinas. The company said its biofuel solutions have shown clear reductions in carbon emissions compared to conventional marine fuels.

Lootah Biofuels’ chief executive said the partnership shows how locally sourced waste can be converted into valuable energy, supporting both environmental goals and operational efficiency in the UAE.

During the initial phase, sustainable refuelling at the two marinas will be offered on a scheduled basis, with scope for expansion depending on demand. The initiative is expected to contribute gradually to lowering carbon emissions from leisure boating activities in the region.

Dubai Marina Yacht Club already holds environmental certifications such as Fish Friendly and Clean Marina status, reflecting its commitment to responsible marine practices. The marina has also introduced a drinking water initiative using technology that converts moisture from the air into potable water, which has been supplying captains and crew for the past year. The launch of bio yacht fuel builds on these efforts and further strengthens Emaar’s sustainability plans for marine leisure.

Emaar said the project forms part of its ongoing effort to embed sustainability across its businesses. By working with Lootah Biofuels at both marinas, the company aims to support national climate goals while offering yacht owners a practical and responsible fueling choice.

An Emaar executive said the focus is on turning sustainability into real action, adding that the partnership represents a clear step toward cleaner and more environmentally friendly marine leisure experiences.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/biofuel-pump.jpeg,N,,2026-01-05 11:12:52.792088

According to IATA data, global passenger traffic increased by 5.3%, closely aligned with the long-term average growth rate of 5%, while 2026 projections signal stable profitability.

Cargo Growth and Financial Pressures

Asia-Pacific led global traffic growth in 2025 and remained the strongest performing region. The region benefited from strong domestic markets and rising international demand, confirming its role as the main driver of aviation growth.

Europe maintained stable growth, while Latin America and Africa posted solid gains. North America continued to lag, affected by weaker domestic demand and operational constraints.

Capacity remained tight throughout the year. The global passenger load factor, indicating the percentage of available seating that is filled with passengers, reached 86% in August 2025, marking the highest level ever recorded. High load factors reflected strong demand but also limited aircraft availability.

Global air cargo traffic rose by 3.3% in 2025, supported by resilient global trade and strong demand for time-sensitive shipments. Growth was again led by Asia-Pacific, driven by e-commerce and technology-related goods.

Cargo performance is expected to strengthen further in 2026. Air cargo traffic is forecast to grow by 8.5%, with total revenues projected to reach $158 billion.

Despite solid demand, airlines faced rising costs. Labour and maintenance expenses increased due to wage inflation, pilot shortages and ageing fleets. Employment growth and labour productivity are both slowing, with each expected to fall by close to 2% in 2026.

Fleet availability remains one of the industry’s most persistent challenges. In 2025, a record number of aircraft were undergoing maintenance, increasing demand for spare parts and replacements. Aircraft delivery delays forced airlines to keep older aircraft in service and delay fleet renewals.

2026 Projections and Industry Outlook

Looking ahead, global passenger traffic is expected to grow by 4.9% in 2026. Asia-Pacific is projected to remain the fastest-growing region, with traffic forecast to rise by 7.3%.

Financial performance is expected to remain stable. Operating profit margins are forecast to edge up to 6.9% in 2026, while net margins are expected to remain at 3.9% and industry revenues are projected to grow by 4.5%.

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly important across the sector, particularly in cargo logistics, operations and data analysis. However, measurable productivity gains remain limited at a global level.

Although the airline industry is committed to achieving net-zero CO2 emissions, sustainability challenges persist. Sustainable Aviation Fuel, or SAF, is expected to account for less than 1% of total fuel use in 2026, partly due to poor alignment between CORSIA and multiple regional and national schemes, which fragments policy, increases costs and limits real emissions reductions.

As global aviation enters 2026, demand remains strong, profitability stable and structural constraints unresolved. The industry continues to balance growth with limited capacity, rising costs and slow progress on decarbonization.",https://travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/tianlei-wu-WYxmb27zqMM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 15:57:00.808756

This marks a significant milestone for the airport and for VINCI Airports’ commitment to accelerating the energy transition across its mobility infrastructure and with its stakeholders.

Salvador Bahia Airport already stands as a regional benchmark for environmental performance.

As the first airport in the Americas to achieve the highest level of Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA 5), it has implemented advanced practices for carbon management and reduction.

Today, more than 15 airports across its network already offer SAF, and the introduction of this fuel into regular operations in Salvador further strengthens this position and aligns with decarbonisation goals across the VINCI Airports network.

In Brazil, SAF is distributed commercially by Vibra. The fuel blend used at Salvador complies with international sustainability criteria and can help lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel.

Two daily flights departing from Salvador Bahia and operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil are now supplied with SAF.

They use a blend containing 10% pure SAF and 90% conventional jet fuel, currently the highest proportion applied in Brazilian aviation.

The US military’s lightning extraction of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was a move reminiscent of the Cold War, but the motivation was purely 21st-century energy cravings.

By President Donald Trump’s own admission, this wasn't just about democracy; it was about the world’s largest oil reserves.

For Washington, the goal is a nostalgic return to 1976, before nationalisation, when American oil giants were deeply enmeshed in the country’s oil economy.

But as we enter 2026, the flare-up in Caracas is only half the story.

While the West remains obsessed with securing the supply of fossil fuels, the real revolution has been happening on the demand side in the world’s most populous nation, India.

The Real Shift

Last August, Washington slapped an additional 25% import duty on Indian exports, a punitive tax for India buying discounted Russian crude.

It was a blunt instrument intended to signal that buying from Moscow is tantamount to funding the war in Ukraine.

The strategy, however messy, showed results.

Russian oil, which once commanded 40% of India’s imports, ebbed to a three-year low of 25% as Indian refiners ducked the crossfire of secondary sanctions.

Which brings us to the demand side of the equation.

A conversation with Vartika Shuka, Chairman and Managing Director of Engineers India Limited (EIL), the state-owned firm that helps build India’s energy infrastructure, brought this to the fore for me last week.

In a conversation two weeks ago, I asked Shukla about an exciting project that her team had worked on in the last year.

Bear in mind that EIL is busy building refineries, petrochemical complexes and energy projects from Mongolia to Nigeria and Guyana to, of course, India and overseeing cutting-edge projects ranging from small modular nuclear reactors to sustainable aviation fuel.

But the pet project is a solar cooker.

And an attempt to de-engineer the cost and weight of solar thermal cooking for the masses, picking up on a project kickstarted by state-owned oil giant Indian Oil Corporation.

“We wanted to see how we as a team can look at reducing the cost as well as the weight of the solar cooker such that it becomes, you know, affordable and friendly to the masses,” she told me at the EIL headquarters in New Delhi.

It sounds simplistic, even quaint, until you look at the math.

India imports more than 80% of its crude. For a nation of 1.4 billion, energy security isn't just about finding more oil; it’s obviously about needing less of it.

This is not new thinking as is reflected in India’s hard push for renewable energy in recent years which is now overtaken targets set for 2030.

But we have also seen this play out in schemes like UJALA.

Ten years ago, the Indian government bet that bulk procurement could turn LED bulbs from a luxury into a commodity.

Today, with 368 million bulbs distributed and an estimated $2.3 billion in annual electricity savings, the ""world’s largest zero-subsidy lighting program"" has demonstrated that market-driven demand reduction can be effective in managing demand.

For example, it has curtailed over 9,000 MW of peak demand, the equivalent of several large coal plants, simply by changing a lightbulb.

Demand Is the Story

The 2026 trend to watch isn't just the supply story of American interventionism in South America.

It is the demand story written in the consumer choices of countries like India.

Whether it is the surge in electric two-wheelers and three-wheelers on Indian roads or the

push for energy-efficient households, the goal is clear: decoupling growth from the whims of petro-states.

As we navigate this complex year, the lesson for policymakers is stark.

Managing the geopolitics of supply is a reactive, expensive game of whack-a-mole.

But fostering conscious consumerism, perhaps even convincing the public that a 10-minute grocery delivery isn’t worth the carbon footprint, is where the real sovereignty lies.

This achievement makes Bunge the first company worldwide to certify soybeans under this rigorous sustainability standard.","BRAZIL – Bunge Brazil has achieved a landmark certification for sustainable soybeans destined for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, marking a pivotal step in the global transition to low-carbon aviation.

The certification, announced late December 2025, verifies traceability and sustainability metrics across the supply chain and aligns with International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standards for biofuel feedstocks.

The certification is from SCS Global Services under the ISCC CORSIA PLUS protocol, recognized by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

The certification includes the ISCC CORSIA PLUS Low-LUC seal, which guarantees traceability and compliance with strict agricultural practices.

The certification verifies that soybeans processed at the facility carry a low risk of indirect land use change (LUC), a critical factor in ensuring that SAF production does not contribute to deforestation or environmental degradation

This initiative covers soybeans from Bunge’s extensive operations in Mato Grosso and Goiás, emphasizing zero-deforestation practices, regenerative agriculture, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The certified volumes, initially estimated at 100,000 tonnes, support SAF producers such as Brazilian airlines and international refiners aiming for net-zero flights by 2050.

Bunge’s rigorous audits confirm compliance with no-burn policies, soil health enhancements, and biodiversity preservation.

The certification aligns with ICAO’s broader push for CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), which requires airlines to reduce emissions through offsets and sustainable fuels.

As demand for SAF grows, Brazil’s certified soybeans could become a vital resource for airlines seeking compliance.

The process integrates Bunge’s 100% traceable soy platform, expanded from 80% in the Cerrado biome, using blockchain for end-to-end monitoring.

Soybeans meet EU Deforestation Regulation thresholds effective in 2026, including geolocation of farms and low-carbon farming practices such as no-till and crop rotation.

Brazil, the world’s top soybean exporter, with 170 million tonnes annually, faces mounting pressure to source sustainably amid EU import rules.

Bunge’s move positions it ahead of rivals like Cargill and ADM, potentially commanding 10-15% price premiums for SAF-grade soy.

SAF demand surges 20% yearly, driven by ICAO’s CORSIA program, with Brazil aiming for 5% SAF blend by 2030.

This achievement makes Bunge the first company worldwide to certify soybeans under this rigorous sustainability standard.

For Brazil, it signals a new chapter in leveraging agricultural exports not just for food, but for clean energy solutions that support the global fight against climate change.",https://millingmea.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Bunge-.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 10:58:24.461074

LONDON, Jan. 5, 2026 /PRNewswire/ -- Global energy and commodity price reporting agency Argus has launched a new suite of renewable fuel ticket prices for the Netherlands.

The country is gearing up to implement the latest update to the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED III) and is switching over from mandating a specific share of renewable energy in transport to an overall emissions savings mandate.

As a result, Argus' daily assessments will track the Netherlands' newly launched emission reduction units — known by the Dutch acronym EREs — and replace long-standing assessments for renewable fuel units — HBEs.

Argus Media chairman and chief executive Adrian Binks said: ""We are pleased to have worked closely with market participants to provide new price transparency which will help them comply with the changed mandates. Our new assessments underscore the importance of reliable market standards and are supported by careful stewardship of our biofuel and associated feedstock price benchmarks.""

Argus has launched six separate assessments based on the Netherlands' definition of various transport sectors, aimed at cutting emissions both from land and maritime transport. The assessments cover the road fuels blending of biofuels produced from feedstocks defined as advanced (RED Annex IX A), conventional waste (RED Annex IX B), and conventional crop and other waste/crop feedstocks. They are mirrored by a similar set for shipping.

Biofuels markets have evolved a long way since the launch of the Argus Biofuels report in 2008, and Dutch compliance has become a staple of European biofuels trade. It is central to Argus' efforts to support the changing nature of spot trade as well as to provide benchmarks for the growing derivatives markets.

The Netherlands' move from an energy-basis target to focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) savings will mark the end of the use of most multipliers, including the Dutch double counting of RED Annex IX biofuels that have to date been a stalwart of Dutch transport emissions reduction.

The new Argus ERE assessments, in place of its HBE prices, join similar Argus price assessments for Germany's GHG reduction quota as well as the UK's renewable transport fuel certificates and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) tickets.

Renewable fuel tickets are used by companies which bring liquid or gaseous fossil fuels into general circulation and are obligated to pay excise duty/energy tax on fuels.

For Plug Power, the Walvis Bay project marks its entry into the commercial green hydrogen market in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Company officials said the project shows that green hydrogen production is possible in regions with reliable renewable energy and supportive government policies.
In addition to environmental benefits, the hydrogen plant created around 150 direct jobs during construction and start-up, along with about 200 indirect jobs in related fields.
Such plans could support local industries, attract foreign investment and help position Namibia as a regional hub for green hydrogen.","A green hydrogen plant with a capacity of 5 MW began operations at Namibia’s Walvis Bay port in December 2025, marking an important step toward cleaner energy use in Africa. The project, developed by Plug Power together with Cleanergy Solutions Namibia, is one of the first fully integrated commercial green hydrogen facilities on the continent and operates entirely using renewable energy, reports Hydrogen Fuel News.

The facility has been set up at Namibia’s main export port and produces hydrogen on site using power generated from nearby solar and wind sources. The hydrogen is used to run port equipment, including yard trucks, cargo cranes and small service vessels, helping cut fuel use and reduce emissions from daily port operations. The project is being seen as a working example for other African ports looking to move toward cleaner energy.

At the centre of the plant is a 5 MW system that uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. When operating at full capacity, it produces around two tonnes of green hydrogen per day, enough to keep more than 40 heavy-duty port vehicles running throughout the day. The oxygen produced in the process is either safely released or stored for use in other industries.

The system uses about nine litres of water to produce one kilogram of hydrogen and occupies space similar to a small warehouse. Its design allows parts to be replaced without major construction work. Company officials said the plant is built for long-term use, with future expansion expected to help lower costs through increased capacity and shared facilities.

For Plug Power, the Walvis Bay project marks its entry into the commercial green hydrogen market in Sub-Saharan Africa. The company already operates hydrogen projects in Europe and the United States and considers Africa’s strong solar and wind resources a major opportunity for future growth. Company officials said the project shows that green hydrogen production is possible in regions with reliable renewable energy and supportive government policies. Plug Power has indicated that planned projects across Africa could exceed 1 GW in total capacity, with interest coming from mining companies and government bodies.

Walvis Bay, with a population of about 65,000, is a key part of Namibia’s export economy, handling products such as uranium and fish. The area’s sunny weather and strong coastal winds make it suitable for renewable energy projects. In addition to environmental benefits, the hydrogen plant created around 150 direct jobs during construction and start-up, along with about 200 indirect jobs in related fields. Cleanergy Solutions Namibia is also working with local training centres to develop skills in hydrogen system operation and maintenance.

Project partners are exploring the option of exporting surplus hydrogen to overseas markets, possibly in the form of ammonia for use in fertilisers and marine fuels. Such plans could support local industries, attract foreign investment and help position Namibia as a regional hub for green hydrogen.

Industry observers say the Walvis Bay project highlights the growing role of green hydrogen in reducing emissions from sectors such as ports, shipping and heavy industry. With similar projects emerging in other parts of Africa and Europe, the facility is increasingly being viewed as a model for clean energy development in emerging economies.

Plug Power and Cleanergy Solutions Namibia are now planning a second phase that would double the plant’s capacity to 10 MW and add facilities for ammonia production. The partners are also studying the possibility of hydrogen-powered vessels operating at the port, a move that could further reduce emissions from maritime transport and strengthen Namibia’s position in the global shift toward clean energy.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Green-Hydrogen-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 10:59:22.549289

This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.","Air freight remains the most carbon-intensive mode of transport per ton-kilometer, and DHL has been a pioneer in adopting SAF since 2021. In 2025, DHL signed one of its largest-ever SAF agreements with Phillips 66: over 240,000 metric tons (approximately 314 million liters) of SAF over three years. This will reduce lifecycle emissions by approximately 737,000 metric tons of CO2e - about the same impact as 2,400 one-way flights from Los Angeles to Frankfurt. The fuel, produced in California, will primarily serve DHL's West Coast operations.

Ocean freight moves most global goods, making sustainable marine fuel (SMF) critical for reducing emissions. DHL and CMA CGM partnered to purchase 8,800 metric tons of UCOME second-generation biofuel, enabling an estimated 25,000 metric tons of CO2e emissions reduction on a well-to-wake basis (covering the full lifecycle of fuel emissions). That is roughly equivalent to powering a large container ship for several days of operation. This collaboration demonstrates a significant step for low-carbon maritime transport.

Hydrogen-powered trucks are emerging as a solution for decarbonizing long-haul logistics, providing longer range than electric trucks. DHL has been actively testing hydrogen trucks in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific, and will now introduce them in the Middle East. Last year, DHL signed an MoU with Hyperview in Saudi Arabia to pilot hydrogen-powered trucks. The project aligns with Saudi Vision 2030 and includes a feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure, reinforcing DHL's commitment to reduce logistics-related greenhouse gas emissions in emerging markets.

DHL aims to electrify 66% of its last-mile fleet - the final step of getting a shipment to the end customer - by 2030, with Germany leading the charge. In 2025, the company announced one of its largest electric-vehicle purchases: 2,400 new Ford electric vans for its Post & Parcel Germany division, the majority of which have already been delivered and are in operation. This milestone means that one-third of all German postcodes will benefit from zero-GHG-emission last-mile delivery, powered by a fleet of more than 35,000 electric vehicles, including e-trikes, e-vans, and e-bikes.

Beyond operational carbon neutrality, DHL is exploring facilities that produce or source renewable energy on-site, combining sustainability with energy self-sufficiency.

Under the new framework, Jet A-1 fuel specifications and quality requirements at both production and sale stages will be divided into three categories: conventional Jet A-1 fuel, fuel produced through co-hydroprocessing, and conventional Jet A-1 blended with pure SAF.

The department has also defined standards for SAF itself. Feedstocks and production processes must comply with ASTM D7566 norms, and, at this stage, production will be limited to HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) technology. The new regulations will come into force on January 1, 2026.

Sarawut Kaewtathip, Director-General of the Department of Energy Business, said the regulations aim to ensure that SAF produced and supplied in Thailand meets recognised international standards. He said the move is in line with the government’s policy to promote cleaner and more sustainable aviation fuels.

He added that the initiative supports Thailand’s long-term goals of achieving carbon neutrality and net zero emissions. He also said the policy is consistent with efforts by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which is encouraging airlines worldwide to adopt SAF as a key step toward reducing emissions from aviation.

Globally, similar measures are already being implemented. In Europe, the European Union has enforced mandatory SAF blending for flights departing from EU airports, with a 2 per cent blending requirement in place since 2025.

Thailand already has SAF production projects underway. Bangchak Corporation is building a SAF plant using HEFA technology, with used cooking oil as the primary feedstock. The plant will have a capacity of one million litres per day, or about 6,289 barrels per day, and is expected to be completed and begin commercial operations in the second quarter of 2026.

This move aims to reduce carbon emissions and support the country’s broader environmental goals, paving the way for greener travel practices while aligning with global efforts to combat climate change. By adopting this sustainable fuel blend, Thailand is positioning itself at the forefront of the aviation industry’s push for more eco-friendly travel solutions.

Thailand is making significant strides toward sustainable aviation, with the Department of Energy Business set to introduce new standards for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and require an initial blend of SAF in jet fuel. These measures are part of Thailand’s broader efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel and contribute to a more sustainable future for aviation.

The new regulations classify Jet A-1 fuel specifications and quality requirements at both production and sales points into three categories: (1) conventional Jet A-1, (2) co-hydroprocessed fuel, and (3) conventional Jet A-1 blended with neat SAF. This classification allows for a smoother transition into the adoption of SAF in the aviation sector while providing clear guidelines for fuel producers and airlines to follow.

Additionally, the Department of Energy Business has set specific guidelines for SAF itself, requiring that feedstocks and production methods comply with ASTM D7566 standards. The initial phase of SAF production in Thailand will focus on Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) technology, which is a well-established method for producing sustainable fuel from renewable feedstocks like used cooking oil. These new standards are scheduled to take effect from January 1, 2026.

The push for SAF adoption in Thailand aligns with similar efforts globally. In Europe, the European Union has already imposed SAF blending requirements for flights departing EU airports, mandating a 2% SAF blend starting in 2025. This regulatory pressure is driving the aviation industry toward greener alternatives to traditional fossil fuels, and Thailand is positioning itself to be a part of this global shift.

Currently, Thailand has several SAF production projects underway, with notable progress being made in the development of SAF plants. One such project is the construction of a SAF plant that will use HEFA technology, with used cooking oil as its primary feedstock. The plant is expected to produce 1 million litres of SAF per day, equivalent to approximately 6,289 barrels per day. Commercial operations at this plant are expected to begin in the second quarter of 2026. This will mark a significant step forward in Thailand’s capacity to produce sustainable aviation fuel locally, reducing reliance on imported fuel.

Another SAF production project in Thailand involves a co-processing HEFA facility, which is already in operation. This plant is currently producing SAF at an initial capacity of 16,438 litres per day, or about 103 barrels per day. This project highlights the growing interest and investment in SAF production within the country, and it demonstrates that Thailand is ready to embrace new technologies to meet future fuel demands sustainably.

Thailand’s SAF development roadmap is divided into four phases, each aligned with the country’s feedstock availability and technological readiness. In the first phase, set to begin in 2026, the required SAF blend will start at 1%, primarily using HEFA technology. This initial phase will help stabilize the SAF supply chain and ensure that production systems are adequately developed to meet future demand.

Phase two, which spans from 2027 to 2029, will gradually increase the SAF blend to 1–2%. This phase will still rely primarily on HEFA technology as Thailand continues to build the necessary infrastructure to support larger-scale SAF production. The goal during this phase is to stabilize the supply chain further and ensure that there is enough production capacity to meet domestic aviation needs.

The third phase, from 2030 to 2032, will introduce the combination of HEFA and Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) technologies to support a 3–5% SAF blend. This will allow for greater flexibility in production methods and expand the types of feedstocks available for SAF production. The final phase, from 2033 onwards, will target a 5–8% blend, with installed production capacity projected to increase significantly, from 0.28 million litres per day in 2026 to 2.22 million litres per day by 2037.

To ensure the successful implementation of SAF in Thailand’s aviation sector, the government plans to establish a SAF working group in 2026. This group will bring together public and private sector representatives from both the demand and supply sides to develop appropriate targets, policies, and strategies. The working group will play a key role in coordinating efforts and ensuring that Thailand’s SAF roadmap is executed effectively and efficiently.

The introduction of SAF services will begin at major airports in Thailand, including key international hubs, which are already connected to fuel pipeline systems. These connections will help reduce carbon emissions from fuel transport, further enhancing the sustainability of Thailand’s aviation sector.

Initially, the use of SAF will be voluntary, with stakeholders signing memorandums of understanding to demonstrate their commitment to producing and using SAF. These agreements will pave the way for future mandatory requirements in later phases, once the industry is better equipped to meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel.

Starting January 2026, Thailand’s aviation sector will incorporate a one percent blend of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into jet fuel, marking a key step towards reducing carbon emissions and advancing sustainable travel practices.

Thailand’s move towards sustainable aviation, driven by the introduction of SAF standards and production projects, marks an important milestone in the country’s efforts to reduce the environmental impact of air travel. The phased approach to SAF adoption ensures that Thailand can gradually build the necessary infrastructure and production capacity to meet future demand. With government support, strategic partnerships, and continued investment in clean energy technologies, Thailand is well on its way to becoming a leader in sustainable aviation in Southeast Asia.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Airline-2.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:02.060786

As the aviation industry continues to recover, and faces mounting pressure to deliver on climate goals while managing growing demand, 2026 is poised to be a defining year for the sector’s sustainability and digital transformation. Success will be measured by safer airports, shorter queues, greener operations and a seamless traveller experience. At the heart of this progress lies rapid technological adoption across sustainability, digitalisation, security and air traffic management.

The accelerated shift towards airport decarbonisation technologies

Airports are evolving from isolated operators to collaborative ecosystems united by a shared mission: decarbonisation. In 2026, technology will be critical to turning climate pledges into measurable outcomes.

Many airports are already pursuing energy self-sufficiency through large-scale renewable projects. Istanbul and Athens International Airports, for example, are approaching full electricity independence thanks to vast solar farms integrated into their operations. Similar projects are proliferating across Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, enabling airports to reduce emissions and energy costs simultaneously.

Microgrids that integrate solar technology, battery storage and advanced inverters are transforming airports into energy hubs capable of maintaining resilience during power disruptions. Predictive energy management systems, powered by Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and artificial intelligence (AI), allow terminals to optimise energy use in real time. London City Airport, for instance, modernised its electrical infrastructure to connect solar panels, storage and smart controls into one unified network. The airport was able to double its electricity capacity.

On the ground, electrification continues to accelerate. Electric ground support equipment and vehicles are now standard at many major airports, with operators investing in charging infrastructure to enable fully zero emission airside operations. At the same time, airports are preparing for a new fuel ecosystem — one built around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hydrogen and e-fuels. Copenhagen Airport, for example, is part of a consortium developing hydrogen refuelling capabilities to support the next generation of low carbon aircraft.

Digital identity and biometrics for seamless travel

With global air travel projected to reach 18.9 billion passengers by 2047, airports are under immense pressure to deliver frictionless, secure passenger journeys. Digital identity and biometric technologies are emerging as key enablers of this transformation.

IATA’s One ID initiative is advancing the vision of a paperless journey where passengers control their own digital identity from check-in to boarding. Several leading airports, including Singapore Changi, Heathrow and Atlanta are deploying biometric boarding and facial recognition to streamline processing times while maintaining stringent security standards. In the United States, the Transportation Security Administration has expanded its Digital ID programme to more than 250 airports, allowing travellers to use mobile driver’s licences for identity verification. Apple has recently announced that it will soon introduce a feature to their Apple Wallet allowing U.S. users to create a digital ID using their passport which can then be used at select TSA checkpoints for domestic travel.

According to SITA’s 2024 Air Transport IT Insights report, nearly half of airports plan to implement biometric identity management systems by the end of 2026. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is also developing the Digital Travel Credential (DTC), which will allow passengers to verify their identity without physical passports or boarding passes.

Today biometric travel tokens are only valid for a passenger’s journey through one airport. A key focus for the industry will be pushing this further so that the biometric token can take a passenger across borders and to multiple airports. The utopian world would be one where one single digital identity is recognised globally and allows the passenger control over that identity.

Together, these developments signal a shift toward harmonised, risk-based and seamless security that enhances both efficiency and passenger trust.

Smartphones and the digital evolution of airport retail

Beyond the terminal gates, smartphones are accelerating the evolution of airport retail. With online shopping available 24 hours a day, passengers now expect the same digital convenience in travel environments. Airports and concessionaires are responding by integrating mobile commerce into the passenger journey, allowing travellers to pre-order duty-free goods, book dining slots, or access personalised offers via airport apps. Changi Airport has even started giving instant benefits to passengers whose flight departure is delayed by three hours or more through their FlightSaver Assurance feature on the Changi App. Changi App is the first airport app globally to offer both real-time overseas airport information and an opt-in flight delay assurance programme.

This shift is transforming the airport experience and retail from a static, physical experience into a dynamic, data-driven ecosystem. Smart phones provide airports with valuable insights into passenger behaviour and dwell times, enabling tailored retail strategies and smarter use of space. For travellers, it means greater choice, flexibility and time efficiency, a critical differentiator as airports compete to enhance the overall passenger experience.

Intelligent automation in air traffic management

Digitalisation is revolutionising how skies are managed, marking a shift from traditional automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. AI is already supporting air traffic controllers through decision-support tools that analyse real-time data on weather, traffic density and airspace conditions. These technologies enable smarter, data-driven decisions that improve safety and reduce delays.

The use of digital twins — virtual replicas of airport and airspace operations — is also expanding. They allow airports and air navigation service providers (ANSPs) to run “what-if” testing and to optimise scenarios without disrupting live traffic. Meanwhile, virtual towers and satellite surveillance are extending the reach of air traffic management (ATM) services, particularly in remote or complex airspace.

Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), encompassing electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, is adding a new layer to this transformation. As cities prepare for urban air mobility, technologies such as trajectory management, AI-based conflict detection, and real-time data fusion will become essential. For airports, these innovations are laying the groundwork for a seamlessly connected airspace ecosystem.

Digitalisation and AI in air cargo logistics

The global rise in e-commerce, which now represents roughly one-fifth of all air cargo volumes worldwide, is driving a parallel transformation in cargo logistics. As the sector prepares for sustained growth, airports are becoming central to creating interoperable, data-rich ecosystems that connect airlines, handlers and freight forwarders.

AI and advanced analytics are being deployed to predict cargo flows, optimise capacity and reduce fuel consumption. IATA’s ONE Record standard is promoting end-to-end data exchange, enabling greater transparency and interoperability across the supply chain. Blockchain technologies are also being tested to improve traceability and trust between logistics partners.

Automation is extending beyond warehouses to last-mile delivery, with drones and electric vehicles increasingly used to enhance efficiency and sustainability. However, with this increased connectivity comes greater vulnerability. Cyber-security has become a critical investment area, as airports seek to safeguard cargo tracking systems and operational data from ever evolving digital threats.

A connected, sustainable future

The technologies shaping airport operations in 2026 share a common goal: to make aviation more sustainable, efficient and resilient. From AI-driven air traffic management to digital identity and renewable energy ecosystems, airports are redefining their role as intelligent, integrated transport hubs.

As airports around the world look ahead, technology will no longer be an optional enhancement but the foundation for competitiveness and sustainability. Those that act decisively —embedding innovation into their infrastructure, operations and culture— will set the pace for the next era of global air travel.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2291135381.png,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:10.536292

The value of the contract was not disclosed. Airbus has not published list prices for aircraft since 2018. CALC said the aircraft would be delivered through 2033.

As of June the company owned and managed 181 aircraft and counted 41 airlines in 22 countries as clients.

The A320neo family is the latest generation of the single-aisle, medium-haul aircraft, offering greater fuel economy and the ability to burn up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel.

Together with Boeing's 737 family of aircraft, the A320s are the workhorses of the commercial airline industry.

This means passenger numbers at the airport reached an all-time high in 2025, eclipsing the previous record of 68.3 million passengers in 2019, before the pandemic grounded planes and ravaged air travel.

In 2024, Changi Airport handled 67.7 million passengers.

The strong post-pandemic recovery for global aviation shows the Government made the right decision to go ahead with plans to build Changi Airport Terminal 5, paused during the pandemic, Mr Siow said at the launch of a new exhibition on the future mega terminal.

The acting minister added that operator Changi Airport Group (CAG) will launch the tender for T5’s superstructure – the section of the terminal built above ground – in the next few weeks.

Noting that the decision to build T5 was one of confidence in Singapore’s future and conviction in the nation’s ability to secure its place in a competitive world, he said this confidence was shaken when global aviation demand collapsed during the pandemic.

“ For a moment, we were not sure what the future of aviation would hold. And we reconsidered deeply whether to continue with T5 ,” he said.

But the Government decided to go ahead, added Mr Siow, and the future now looks bright – global air traffic is expected to double by 2050, with the Asia-Pacific region leading this growth.

With T5 representing the future of aviation for Singapore, it has been designed to be technology-intensive, empowered by automation and artificial intelligence (AI), he said.

For example, autonomous vehicles and robotics are already being tested for labour-intensive processes, such as baggage and cargo handling.

Mr Siow added that AI can be used to improve flight planning and passenger services, as well as respond quickly to disruptions to airport operations, such as changing weather conditions.

The new mega terminal – scheduled to open in the mid-2030s – will show the way for aviation sustainability, as it will promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel and be fully electrified, he said.

It has been designed to put the customer first, said Mr Siow, with ideas from passengers, airlines and airport tenants being incorporated into the layout of lounges and the design of retail spaces.

For instance, passengers will be able to have seamless journeys from immigration to boarding, with personalised recommendations for dining, retail and transit along the way.

Mr Siow noted that although T5 is a bigger airport terminal, its design reduces walking time, and the result is that transit passengers can make their connections more quickly.

Passengers are not the only group who will stand to gain.

More new jobs will be available in the aviation sector in the fields of data science, systems operations and sustainability – areas that will appeal to young Singaporeans, he said.

“It is imperative that the aerospace or aviation sector continues to attract its share of talent and that we work closely with the institutes of higher learning to make sure that the skills of our workforce remain relevant and future-ready,” added Mr Siow.

The

T5 In The Making exhibition

, which will be held at Terminal 3’s arrival hall from Jan 6 to March , will bring the story of Changi Airport and Singapore to life, said Mr Siow.

Organised by the Ministry of Transport, Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and CAG, the exhibition will give visitors a behind-the-scenes look at the vision, planning and design of the terminal.

Recounting how the nation’s founding leaders decided to move the airport from Paya Lebar to Changi in 1981 , Mr Siow said no expansion of Paya Lebar Airport could have met the needs of international air traffic.

Paya Lebar Airport’s capacity was then only eight million a year, whereas Changi Airport already handles around 70 million passengers yearly.

T5 will raise Changi Airport’s passenger capacity by more than 55 per cent each year, from the current 90 million to 140 million.

Mr Siow said that over the decades, Changi Airport has fulfilled its potential and gone beyond that.

With the addition of new terminals, refurbishment of existing ones and building of retail and entertainment complex Jewel Changi Airport, he has “no doubt that the world is watching to see what T5 represents for the future of aviation”.

At a media tour of the exhibition on Jan 2, Mr Ong Chee Chiau, managing director of Changi East at CAG, told reporters that the airport operator will call tenders for the construction of the main T5 building “over the next year or so”.

He added that the operator is in the midst of calling tenders for the terminal’s baggage-handling system and automated people-mover system.

Si chiama UE ToFuel, il progetto di ricerca europeo con l’obiettivo di sviluppare una bioraffineria capace di sfruttare integralmente i residui di pomodoro in carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione. Nonché in fertilizzanti, mangimi per animali e olio da cucina.

Il programma è coordinato dall’Università Tecnica di Graz (TU Graz) in Austria e punta a un processo privo di rifiuti e climaticamente neutro, che sia anche economicamente competitivo e che fornisca quindi un importante contributo alla decarbonizzazione del trasporto aereo. In pratica gli scarti alimentari possono essere trasformati in carburante sostenibile per l’aviazione (noto anche come carburante SAF, dall’inglese Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Scarti di pomodoro una risorsa preziosa

I pomodori sono il secondo ortaggio più consumato al mondo dopo le patate. L'Ue è il terzo produttore con circa 17 megatonnellate di pomodori raccolti. Tuttavia, la produzione di pomodori produce grandi quantità di biomassa residua: materiale vegetale come fiori, foglie e steli, bucce, semi e pomodori di qualità inadeguata. La maggior parte di questi residui viene incenerita come rifiuto agricolo o smaltita a costi elevati.

Allo stesso tempo, l'obiettivo della neutralità climatica europea e la conseguente riduzione delle emissioni di CO2 nel settore dell'aviazione dipendono in larga misura dalla produzione di carburanti per l'aviazione (SAF) competitivi e sostenibili da materie prime rinnovabili. ""Secondo le stime, circa il 3% del fabbisogno di carburanti sostenibili per l'aviazione in Europa entro il 2030 potrebbe essere coperto dalla quantità di polpa di pomodoro prodotta in tutta l'UE, ovvero dai residui della lavorazione del pomodoro"", spiega alla stampa la responsabile del progetto Marlene Kienberger dell'Istituto di ingegneria chimica e tecnologia ambientale della TU Graz, in Austria.

Come funziona il processo di trasformazione

Per trasformare gli scarti di pomodoro in un combustibile di alta qualità, la biomassa deve essere prima trattata in modo che i microrganismi possano utilizzarla in modo efficiente. Il progetto ToFuel sta studiando due innovative tecnologie di frazionamento. Durante l'estrusione, la biomassa viene trattata sotto calore e pressione e poi scomposta nei suoi componenti cellulari mediante un brusco calo di pressione. Questo crea una biomassa digerita in modo ottimale per il successivo processo di fermentazione, in cui i microrganismi producono lipidi che vengono poi trasformati in carburante per aviazione.Nella seconda tecnologia di frazionamento, la liquefazione idrotermale, la biomassa viene convertita in bioolio e biochar ad alta pressione e ad alte temperature. Prima che il bio-olio estratto possa essere raffinato in carburante per aviazione, deve essere purificato principalmente dagli ioni interferenti contenenti azoto. Questi ioni indesiderati avrebbero altrimenti un impatto negativo sulla successiva conversione in un carburante per aviazione sostenibile.

I corrispondenti processi di frazionamento, biotecnologici e di purificazione vengono sviluppati dal Laboratório Nacional de Energia e Geologia (LNEG) di Lisbona, dalla TU Graz e dall'Università di Zagabria in stretta collaborazione.

I lipidi e il bio-olio vengono poi convertiti in un carburante che soddisfa gli standard qualitativi internazionali per il carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione utilizzando il processo HEFA presso l'Università di Leoben. HEFA sta per ""esteri idrogenati e acidi grassi"" ed è un processo per la produzione di carburante sostenibile per l'aviazione da grassi e oli vegetali, animali o riciclati. I processi sviluppati nell'ambito del progetto vengono gradualmente portati su scala preindustriale e ampiamente testati. Per la professoressa Kienberger: ""L’obiettivo è produrre carburante per aviazione sostenibile a partire dagli scarti di pomodoro a un prezzo di vendita competitivo. In definitiva, i carburanti per aviazione sostenibili devono semplicemente essere economicamente sostenibili. In caso contrario non avrebbero molto senso"". Il team di progetto sta inoltre analizzando l'impatto ecologico, economico e sociale di queste tecnologie, visto che l'utilizzo degli scarti di pomodoro crea anche nuove fonti di reddito per le aziende di trasformazione alimentare.

Il progetto europeo

La data di inizio ufficiale del progetto ""ToFuel - An integrated Biorefinery for Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production from Tomato Residues"" è il 1° gennaio 2026. Un totale di 11 partner, provenienti da 7 Paesi europei, parteciperà al progetto. Oltre alla TU Graz, sono coinvolti l'istituto di ricerca portoghese LNEG, l'Università di Zagabria, il Politecnico di Vienna, il Politecnico di Lappeenranta in Finlandia, l'Università di Leoben e la Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft. I partner industriali Mutti e Podravka forniranno i residui di pomodoro e contribuiranno ad aggiungere valore grazie alla loro importante esperienza nella lavorazione di materie prime di origine vegetale.

La ricerca sarà accompagnata da una strategia completa di commercializzazione e pubblicazione, che sarà sviluppata dai partner di progetto ESEIA ed EEIP. Nell'ambito del progetto saranno formati almeno 6 dottorandi, 12 studenti di master e 15 studenti di laurea triennale. Il budget del progetto ammonta a 3,5 milioni di euro in quattro anni, di cui un milione destinato al capofila del consorzio, l’Università TU Graz.

Dal concetto di economia circolare, in cui nulla si butta ma tutto si trasforma, in un mondo ancora dominato da un modello di economia ""lineare"": produci, usa, getta, il progetto guidato dall’Università TU Graz propone di recuperare energia e materiali di scarto per creare prodotti ad alto valore, come il carburante.",https://www.repstatic.it/content/contenthub/img/2026/01/02/163950238-39edb188-08a4-49a8-b207-e6f8b3dd4172.jpg,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:20.573257

The report employs a rigorous, data-driven methodology that integrates validated data modeling with comprehensive primary interviews and secondary research. This approach provides precise forecasts and actionable insights at both global and regional levels.

Market Overview and Dynamics

The aviation biofuels sector is positioned for significant expansion, propelled by rising demand for sustainable fuel alternatives and continuous innovation within the industry. Key players identified include Neste, Gevo, Fulcrum BioEnergy, LanzaTech, World Energy, SkyNRG, AltAir Fuels, Biothane, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Shell, and BP. These companies are heavily investing in research and development, forging strategic partnerships, and striving to improve the cost-efficiency of biofuels to remain competitive against conventional aviation fuels.

The market is segmented by type and application, encompassing a broad spectrum of aviation categories. Types include commercial, military, general, cargo, business, regional, helicopter aviation, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Applications extend to commercial and military aviation, cargo transport, general aviation, flight training, agricultural aviation, emergency services, and research and development. This segmentation reflects the diverse potential uses of biofuels across the aviation industry.

Regionally, the report provides an in-depth analysis covering North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa, and South America. It examines economic, social, environmental, technological, and political factors influencing market growth in each region, supported by revenue and sales data to assist investors in evaluating regional opportunities.

Despite the optimistic outlook, the report acknowledges several challenges that could impede market growth. Regulatory complexities, fluctuating raw material prices, and competition from traditional aviation fuels remain significant barriers. The market is also vulnerable to broader economic conditions and policy shifts. For example, Goldman Sachs projects ""sturdy"" global economic growth in 2026, which may bolster industry expansion. Conversely, volatility in the U.S. stock market—stemming from Federal Reserve policy disagreements and elevated market valuations—could undermine investor confidence and restrict funding for biofuel initiatives.

In response, industry competitors are expected to intensify investments in innovation, establish strategic alliances, and focus on reducing production costs. These measures aim to address regulatory demands and enhance the cost competitiveness of biofuels relative to fossil-based aviation fuels.

Global SAF demand is estimated to reach 450 billion liters per year by 2050, while production only reached around 2.5 billion liters by 2025. A long road ahead requires various routes to achieve NZE by 2050, as current production is only around 0.5%. Feedstocks are a major obstacle to accelerating the fulfillment of this demand, so some suggest initially using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) production route, as it is the most commercially mature and cost-effective option. However, by 2035, HEFA growth is constrained by the limited availability of waste oils and fats. Alternative bio-SAF routes such as Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) and Biomass-to-Liquid (BTL) are expected to emerge later this decade, though they also face feedstock limitations. e-SAF is projected to begin scaling in the 2030s and expand significantly in the 2040s as supply chains mature and production costs decline. The last one, e-SAF (electronic Sustainable Aviation Fuel) is made from captured carbon dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, essentially creating synthetic jet fuel from air and power. This is an ideal solution because it eliminates the feedstock constraint. However, electricity supply for H2 production may also be a constraint, given that H2 production through water electrolysis is highly energy-intensive. Current technology still requires 39.75 kWh to produce 1 kg of H2, which only produces around 33 kWh of energy. This is where technological innovations like Airpatek and X Process come into play. These technologies allow for rapid and efficient H2 production from various types of biomass, whether solid or liquid, including sewage sluge. For example, with these technologies, aquatic plants, currently considered pests due to their rapid growth, can be cultivated as H2 feedstock. The availability of affordable H2 in sufficient quantities is key to SAF production from CO2. The pathway begins with Reverse Water Gas Shift (RWGS), nCO2 + nH2 -> nCO + nH2O, followed by Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS), nCO + (2n+1)H2 -> CnH(2n+2) + nH2O. Because H2 sources can be anything that is abundant in this country, let alone CO2 sources, we have around 480 million tons/year from 55 GW coal-fueled power plants alone, approximately 10 times what the world needs for SAF production in 2030, namely 17 million tons/year, but it takes a leader who has the guts to realize this big idea!",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5622AQHbsRYAdUWajg/feedshare-shrink_1280/B56ZuMOQ3WJ8As-/0/1767584110185?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=czwu6bcwkC5wOONP2e9YmLCY30mcilUtH5KWEhakbvQ,N,,2026-01-05 03:57:29.608818

Energía, infraestructuras, naval, digital o aeroespacial son las principales líneas de negocio de una de las empresas con más solera de ingeniería y tecnología punta de España. Su carrera de fondo fuera de nuestras fronteras ya está dando sus frutos.

Por ejemplo, el mecanismo de precisión que sirve para que la antena de los róveres (vehículo robótico) que están hoy operando en Marte apunte a la Tierra ha sido diseñado, fabricado e integrado por la compañía.

Con esta seña de identidad, Sener crece en todas las áreas, pero los segmentos de aeroespacial y defensa, junto con energía y movilidad, son los que más traccionan la facturación y el posicionamiento internacional del grupo.

Familiar y vasca

Sener, primer grupo español de ingeniería registrado como tal, nació en Bilbao en 1956 gracias a los hermanos Enrique de Sendagorta Aramburu y José Manuel de Sendagorta Aramburu.

Su idea de salir a Europa en una década en la que España aún vivía en autarquía se inspiraba en los modelos industriales de países como Alemania y Suiza.

Y todavía sigue en manos de la familia fundadora en un 100% del capital, pasando de padres a hijos hasta la cuarta generación.

Actualmente su presidente es Andrés Sendagorta, que asume la presidencia del grupo desde 2020 dentro del relevo generacional de la familia fundadora, y su consejero delegado (CEO) es Jorge Sendagorta Cudós.

Y en un mercado tan exigente como el alemán, Sener actúa como socio tecnológico para proyectos complejos de descarbonización y redes energéticas, especialmente en el desarrollo de plantas de ciclo combinado (térmicas de gas natural), en almacenamiento, en plantas de desulfuración y cogeneración.

También diseña infraestructuras hydrogen‑ready (hidrógeno) y terminales de GNL preparadas para futuros gases renovables, además de proyectos de desarrollo de SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel, es decir, combustible sostenible de aviación), y su nueva línea de negocio: los centros de datos.

En mayo de 2023, la compañía se convierte en el accionista mayoritario de la empresa de centros de datos Quark para aprovechar las sinergias a nivel tecnológico, operativo y de innovación (en sectores como movilidad, energía o digital).

""El objetivo en el negocio de los centros de datos es diseñar la infraestructura física del edificio, los servicios de suministros, anti-incendios o la refrigeración"", puntualizan desde la compañía a este periódico.

Regasificadora terrestre

Uno de los hitos más relevantes que entrará en operación en 2026 es la construcción de German LNG, la primera terminal de regasificación terrestre alemana. Permitirá al país introducir en su red de gasoductos el combustible que llega por vía marítima, convirtiéndose en una alternativa al gas proveniente por vía terrestre.

Esta planta está ubicada al norte del país, en la localidad de Brunsbüttel, justo en la desembocadura del Elba y conectada al ChemCoast Park, un gran polo industrial del norte del país.

Podrá producir hasta 8.000 millones de metros cúbicos por año (BCMA, según sus siglas en inglés) de gas natural, que podrán ampliarse hasta los 10 bcma. Esto, representa aproximadamente el 10% del consumo anual actual de Alemania.

Esta terminal se comenzó en paralelo al uso de una FSRU -Floating Storage and Regasification Unit o Unidad Flotante de Almacenamiento y Regasificación-. En concreto, el buque Höegh Gannet , que se emplea como solución rápida para el suministro energético del país, después de que en 2023 se encendieran todas las alarmas por la falta de gas ruso tras la invasión de Ucrania.

Junto a la terminal terrestre se espera contar con dos grandes tanques de almacenamiento y todas las instalaciones portuarias y de distribución asociadas.

El diseño del proyecto prevé que la terminal pueda adaptarse en el futuro al manejo de derivados de hidrógeno (como amoníaco o e‑metano) y de ""green LNG"", de forma que sirva de nodo para combustibles bajos en carbono en el norte de Europa.

Una línea de negocio que espera que siga creciendo en 2026 con el plan del Gobierno alemán para subastar apoyo público a nueva potencia de centrales de gas “hidrógeno‑ready” como respaldo al sistema eléctrico, dentro de su “estrategia de centrales” y del futuro mercado de capacidad.

El esquema más reciente apunta a subastas para unos 10 GW de potencia controlable, de los que 8 GW serían centrales de gas preparadas para hidrógeno y 2 GW se abrirían a otras tecnologías flexibles (baterías, etc.).",https://s3.elespanol.com/2025/12/31/actualidad/1003744074907_260725447_1706x960.jpg?fmt=jpeg,N,,2026-01-04 21:56:34.819876

While Malaysia has identified SAF as a cornerstone to the country’s pathway of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 through the Malaysia Aviation Decarbonisation Blueprint (MADB) that was unveiled in September 2024, BIMB Securities said the roadmap laying out the adoption of this fuel lacks binding enforcement mechanisms or interim milestones.

“This absence of clear mandates may delay adoption by domestic airlines, potentially weakening Malaysia’s alignment with global climate policies and undermining its competitiveness in international aviation markets,” it said.

It noted that Singapore had mandated a 1% SAF blending requirement by this year for all departing flights.

Singapore’s requirement would rise from 3% to 5% by 2030, while Japan and South Korea, which have been investing heavily in SAF, have targets of 10% by 2030 and 1% by 2027, respectively.

With SAF integrated into the National Energy Transition Roadmap, the indicative targets for its blending into aviation fuel starts at 1% in the near term to scaling up progressively to 47% by 2050.

Under the MADB, SAF has been projected to contribute to the largest share of carbon reductions, accounting for up to 46% of aviation emission savings by mid-century.

The brokerage pointed out that the primary obstacle to more SAF adoption remains its high cost, as it can be from two to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

Supply, meanwhile, remains another obstacle as global production continues to be limited despite countries such as Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and China expanding production capacity.

“On the supply side, Malaysia is preparing for significant SAF production capacity by 2027,” it said.

The country’s SAF industry would see two significant producers, Petroliam Nasional Bhd with a 650,000-tonne refinery in Pengerang, Johor, and EcoCeres Inc, a Hong Kong-based renewable fuels company with a 350,000 tonne facility in Pasir Gudang, Johor.

It said while the supply side has gathered momentum, costlier SAF that can be three times higher limits voluntary intake from airlines based in the country, with a comprehensive framework on certification, blending rules and cross-sector coordination still under development, creating uncertainty over market access and demand visibility.

“Malaysia’s policy choices over the next five years will determine whether SAF ambitions align with domestic decarbonisation and regional competitiveness,” it said.

It added that despite production capacity scaling significantly by 2027, domestic consumption may remain limited without robust mandates, subsidies or corporate commitments.

“For investors and corporates, this gap underscores both the risk of stranded assets and the opportunity to influence policy direction, ensuring that Malaysia’s SAF industry supports local demand as well as export markets,” it said.

“The interplay of regulatory clarity, production capacity and adoption costs will shape the trajectory of several sectors, particularly aviation, energy, plantations and infrastructure,” it added.

It suggested that one effective strategy could be collective advocacy through the forming of alliances by stakeholders to present a unified voice to policymakers.

“Such coalitions can demonstrate the commercial readiness of SAF supply chains while highlighting the risks of inaction, such as stranded investments and loss of competitiveness against regional peers,” it said.",https://apicms.thestar.com.my/uploads/images/2026/01/05/3704576.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 19:57:55.870975

Strong Start on Regional Jets

Starlink service debuted on Alaska’s Embraer E175 regional jets in late 2025. Early reports show it is much faster than older satellite Wi-Fi, enabling seamless video streaming, gaming, and video calls mid-flight. This good performance has led Alaska to accelerate the installation of Starlink on its larger Boeing 737 and 787 planes. In a recent statement, Todd Traynor-Corey, Vice President of Guest Products and Experience, said:

“We’re moving ahead of schedule, and will rapidly continue installations across our entire E175, 737, and 787 fleet through 2026.”

Entire Fleet Ahead of Schedule

Alaska first announced the Starlink plan in August 2025. The original goal was to finish by 2027. The updated plan will see Starlink feature across all aircraft types sooner.

This move also brings Alaska in line with Hawaiian Airlines, which it merged with in 2024. Hawaiian already offers free Starlink on its Airbus fleet. Alaska’s rollout will make sure all flights under the Alaska Air Group have the same fast Wi-Fi, whether flying domestically or on long-haul international routes.

Starlink’s Perks for Passengers

Beyond improved connectivity, Alaska is positioning Starlink as a core competitive advantage. The airline has partnered with T-Mobile to offer the service free of charge to eligible members of its Atmos Rewards loyalty programme. This move is designed to attract frequent flyers and differentiate Alaska from competitors relying on slower, legacy satellite systems.

The new Starlink terminals also support Alaska’s sustainability goals. The aerodynamic antenna is lighter and uses less fuel.

Market timing considerations favour early entrants in white hydrogen exploration, with limited competition in emerging sector providing first-mover advantages.","White hydrogen exploration represents a revolutionary approach to clean energy development, where naturally occurring geological processes generate hydrogen gas through mechanisms that have operated beneath Earth's surface for millions of years. The mineral exploration importance becomes particularly evident when examining how subsurface hydrogen formations challenge conventional resource extraction methodologies and present unprecedented opportunities for sustainable energy development.

Understanding how Earth's geological systems produce hydrogen naturally requires examination of deep subsurface environments where specific chemical reactions occur continuously. The convergence of water, iron-rich minerals, and optimal temperature conditions creates natural hydrogen factories beneath our feet, potentially containing vast reserves that dwarf current global energy consumption patterns.

Geological Forces Driving Natural Hydrogen Generation

Serpentinisation: The Primary Hydrogen Production Mechanism

Water-rock interactions form the foundation of natural hydrogen generation through serpentinisation processes. When subsurface water encounters iron-rich minerals, particularly olivine formations, at temperatures ranging from 200-350°C, chemical reactions split water molecules and liberate hydrogen gas as a byproduct.

This geological process operates most effectively in:

• Mid-continental rift systems where tectonic activity exposes iron-rich crustal materials

• Ocean floor hydrothermal systems providing optimal temperature and pressure conditions

• Iron-rich crustal reservoirs containing sufficient olivine mineral concentrations

• Deep geological formations with sustained water circulation patterns

According to a 2024 U.S. Geological Survey assessment, subsurface hydrogen reserves are estimated between 1 billion and 10 trillion tonnes globally, representing a potentially massive untapped resource base that could transform energy economics if successfully accessed.

Radiolysis: Alternative Hydrogen Generation Pathways

Radioactive decay mechanisms provide continuous hydrogen production through radiolysis, where uranium, thorium, and potassium isotopes in deep geological formations split water molecules through radiation exposure. Furthermore, this process operates independently of serpentinisation and continues producing hydrogen over geological timescales.

The uranium market trends influence understanding of radiolysis potential, particularly where radioactive elements provide continuous hydrogen generation. Radiolysis occurs most prominently in:

• Granite formations with elevated radioactive mineral content

• Sedimentary basins containing uranium-bearing rock layers

• Deep aquifer systems where radioactive elements interact with groundwater

• Basement rock formations providing long-term radioactive decay environments

Hydrogen Accumulation and Geological Trap Systems

Natural hydrogen accumulation requires specific geological conditions preventing upward gas migration. Low-permeability cap rocks function as sealing mechanisms, allowing hydrogen concentrations to build within subsurface reservoirs analogous to conventional oil and gas accumulations.

Critical accumulation factors include:

• Structural traps preventing lateral and vertical hydrogen migration

• Cap rock integrity maintaining reservoir pressure and preventing seepage

• Source rock proximity ensuring continuous hydrogen generation

• Porosity and permeability balancing storage capacity with retention capability

Surface indicators of subsurface hydrogen presence create observable patterns including vegetation die-off zones called ""fairy circles"" and anomalous plant growth patterns indicating hydrogen seepage through overlying rock formations.

Advanced Detection Technologies and Exploration Methodologies

White hydrogen exploration requires sophisticated technological approaches combining traditional petroleum exploration techniques with specialised hydrogen detection equipment. In addition, the industry leverages decades of oil and gas exploration expertise while developing novel methodologies specifically designed for natural hydrogen discovery and characterisation.

Technological convergence between petroleum and hydrogen exploration creates cost advantages for companies with existing subsurface expertise. Oklahoma's positioning as a potential white hydrogen development leader stems from its established oil and gas infrastructure, which Professor Prem Bikkina describes as providing both ""subsurface potential and above-ground readiness"" for natural hydrogen development.

Specialised Detection and Sampling Equipment

SysMoG probe systems represent cutting-edge French technology capable of sampling dissolved gases to depths of 1,200 metres with real-time hydrogen purity analysis through integrated spectrometer systems. Moreover, these detection capabilities range from surface-level concentrations around 14% to maximum depth concentrations approaching 90%.

Key technological specifications include:

• Real-time spectrometer integration for immediate hydrogen purity determination

• Multi-depth sampling capability providing vertical concentration profiles

• Dissolved gas detection measuring hydrogen in groundwater systems

• Precision monitoring tracking concentration variations over time

Large-Scale Geophysical Survey Implementation

2D seismic mapping enables comprehensive subsurface imaging across extensive areas. Gold Hydrogen's 650 km² seismic survey in South Australia demonstrates the scale required for effective white hydrogen exploration, mapping potential reservoir locations and structural controls.

Furthermore, 3D geological modelling enhances understanding through Mantle8's 4D geological imaging technology, which integrates multiple data sources to create comprehensive subsurface models:

• Geological data integration combining rock property information

• Geophysical survey information providing structural interpretation

• Geochemical sensor data measuring surface hydrogen signatures

• Advanced computational modelling generating dynamic Earth mantle imagery

The company secured €3.4 million in February 2024 funding to develop this technology, with exploratory drilling planned for southwestern France in 2028.

Multi-Point Surface Monitoring Networks

Continuous monitoring systems deployed across potential hydrogen seepage zones enable real-time tracking of:

• Hydrogen concentration variations indicating subsurface activity

• Temporal seepage patterns revealing production and migration cycles

• Subsurface pressure dynamics affecting hydrogen accumulation

Technical Challenges and Infrastructure Requirements

White hydrogen exploration faces substantial technical obstacles that differentiate it from conventional petroleum exploration, requiring specialised solutions for unique geological and engineering challenges. These complexities contribute significantly to cost uncertainties and development timelines.

Depth-related extraction complexity increases exponentially below 3,000 metres, where conventional drilling technologies encounter limitations in hydrogen-specific applications. Unlike oil and gas extraction, hydrogen's molecular properties create unique handling, storage, and transportation challenges requiring specialised infrastructure modifications.

Geological Access and Recovery Constraints

Hydrogen migration patterns through porous rock formations reduce recoverable volumes significantly compared to initial resource estimates. Similarly, natural hydrogen's tendency to seep upward through geological formations requires precise understanding of trap integrity and reservoir dynamics.

Critical technical challenges include:

• Molecular hydrogen properties requiring specialised containment systems

• Reservoir characterisation with limited understanding of accumulation mechanisms

• Extraction efficiency varying dramatically based on geological conditions

• Gas purity requirements necessitating complex separation and purification processes

Trap integrity assessment represents fundamental challenge as hydrogen molecules are significantly smaller than hydrocarbon molecules, potentially escaping through rock formations that effectively contain oil and gas. Consequently, this characteristic necessitates enhanced geological modelling and monitoring capabilities.

Infrastructure Adaptation and Safety Protocols

Flammability management requires comprehensive safety protocols for handling highly combustible gas extraction, transport, and storage. Hydrogen's wide flammability range and low ignition energy create unique safety considerations compared to conventional energy extraction operations.

Pipeline compatibility challenges existing oil and gas infrastructure, as hydrogen can cause embrittlement in steel pipelines and equipment. Infrastructure modifications include:

• Material compatibility ensuring hydrogen-resistant pipeline systems

• Compression technology adapted for hydrogen's physical properties

• Storage solutions preventing hydrogen loss and maintaining purity

• Safety systems addressing hydrogen's unique combustion characteristics

Environmental Monitoring and Regulatory Compliance

Subsurface disturbance prevention requires careful management of extraction processes to avoid environmental impacts. Unlike conventional fossil fuel extraction, white hydrogen exploration must maintain ecosystem integrity while demonstrating genuine environmental benefits.

Extraction byproduct management involves monitoring and controlling associated gases and geological disturbances resulting from hydrogen extraction processes.

Environmental Impact and Clean Energy Positioning

White hydrogen exploration presents unique environmental profile combining ultra-low carbon emissions with minimal processing requirements, positioning it favourably within clean energy transition strategies. However, comprehensive lifecycle assessments remain limited due to industry infancy.

Carbon intensity measurements for white hydrogen exploration range from 0.4-1.5 kg CO2e per kilogram hydrogen at 85% purity standards, representing significant environmental advantages over conventional hydrogen production methods while requiring minimal energy-intensive processing.

Lifecycle Environmental Assessment

Direct extraction advantages eliminate energy-intensive electrolysis processes required for green hydrogen production, reducing overall environmental footprint through simplified processing requirements. Furthermore, mining industry innovation in white hydrogen exploration operates through mechanical processes rather than energy conversion systems.

Land use efficiency provides substantial advantages over renewable energy installations required for green hydrogen production. Natural hydrogen extraction requires smaller surface footprints while potentially providing higher energy output per unit area compared to solar or wind installations.

Environmental benefits include:

• Minimal processing requirements reducing energy consumption

• No water consumption for production processes

• Reduced infrastructure compared to renewable energy systems

• Lower material intensity requiring fewer manufactured components

Industrial Application Potential and Market Integration

Steel production applications offer direct replacement opportunities for coking coal in metallurgical processes, potentially eliminating significant industrial carbon emissions. White hydrogen exploration's purity levels achieved in test operations support direct industrial utilisation without extensive purification.

Ammonia synthesis for fertiliser production represents major market opportunity, replacing natural gas inputs in agricultural chemical manufacturing. Current ammonia production accounts for substantial global hydrogen demand, creating established market pathways for white hydrogen exploration integration.

Sustainable aviation fuel production provides long-haul transportation decarbonisation opportunities through hydrogen-based fuel synthesis, addressing aviation sector's limited electrification options.

Future Market Outlook and Investment Considerations

White hydrogen exploration stands at early development stages with substantial potential for market transformation if technical and economic challenges can be successfully addressed. Investment opportunities exist within high-risk, high-reward framework characteristic of emerging energy technologies.

Market timing considerations favour early entrants in white hydrogen exploration, with limited competition in emerging sector providing first-mover advantages. However, substantial technical uncertainties require careful risk assessment and diversified exploration portfolios.

Production Scaling Projections and Market Development

2050 production targets suggest potential 17 million tonnes per annum with supportive policy frameworks, representing significant portion of projected global hydrogen demand. These projections assume successful technology development and commercial discovery confirmation.

Technology maturation expectations indicate 3-4 year timeline for major commercial discoveries, according to industry expert projections. Nevertheless, scaling from discovery to commercial production requires additional development phases and infrastructure investment.

Market development factors include:

• International cooperation through cross-border research initiatives

• Technology sharing agreements accelerating development timelines

• Investment incentive programmes supporting early-stage exploration

• Regulatory framework adaptation from oil and gas to hydrogen applications

Investment Risk Assessment and Portfolio Strategies

Geological uncertainty represents primary investment risk, as subsurface hydrogen accumulations remain poorly understood compared to conventional petroleum resources. Successful exploration requires diversified portfolios across multiple geological formations and regions.

Technology development risks include uncertainty regarding extraction methodologies, cost optimisation, and commercial scalability. Investment strategies should account for extended development timelines and substantial capital requirements for technology advancement.

Risk mitigation approaches include:

• Diversified exploration portfolios across multiple geological basins

• Technology partnership strategies reducing development costs

• Government incentive utilisation improving project economics

• Market development timing aligning with hydrogen demand growth

Competitive advantages for white hydrogen exploration include potentially lower production costs than green hydrogen, established industrial applications, and policy support for low-carbon energy development. However, success depends on overcoming current technical limitations and proving commercial viability.

Investment consideration timing favours cautious optimism with measured expectations, as emphasised by leading researchers like Eric Gaucher. While potential exists for transformative discoveries, substantial research and development requirements precede commercial implementation.

Disclaimer: White hydrogen exploration involves significant technological and geological uncertainties. Projected production costs, reserve estimates, and development timelines should be considered speculative pending further research and commercial validation. Investment decisions should account for substantial technical risks and extended development timelines characteristic of emerging energy technologies.

Once known for giving helicopters a distinctly frosty reception (palace insiders joked he would “raise an eyebrow” at the very suggestion), the King has now embraced the aircraft as a surprisingly green solution for a modern, working monarchy.

The shift became official in June 2024, when Buckingham Palace confirmed the household would take delivery of two newly leased helicopters designed to be cleaner, efficient, and compatible with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Royal Family’s twin AugustaWestland AW139 helicopters have logged around 58,000 miles in just nine months, clocking more than 420 flying hours as they ferried senior royals across the UK.

Far from joyrides, aides stress the aircraft are being used strategically allowing multiple engagements in a single day.

Princess Anne has emerged as the most frequent flyer, with data showing 68 landings at Gatcombe Park, her Gloucestershire home.

Prince William follows closely behind, with 47 stops in Windsor and several more at Forest Lodge as he settles into family life there.

Sandringham, Dumfries House, Lacock and Buckingham Palace have also featured heavily on the flight map.

William, whose Earthshot Prize has placed environmental leadership at the heart of his public role, has used the helicopters to attend everything from England women’s football training sessions to rugby matches and climate-focused events.

Tim Fauchon, chief executive of the British Helicopter Association, has praised Charles for “leading by example,” noting that the Royal Flight actively seeks out airfields able to supply SAF, even when it comes at a higher cost.

Critics, meanwhile, have raised eyebrows at the sheer volume of flights with data suggesting as many as 700 individual journeys if short stops are counted separately.

But palace officials are unapologetic. Helicopters according to them they are essential for reaching remote communities and ensuring the monarchy remains visible “throughout the length and breadth of the UK.”

As one official put it bluntly: invest in the asset, then “sweat it.”",https://www.geo.tv/assets/uploads/updates/2026-01-05/l_643243_012806_updates.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 16:56:11.787751

“Due to the closure of Venezuelan airspace, there are currently no flights operating from Schiphol to Venezuela and a number of destinations in the surrounding region. As a result, several flights to and from Schiphol have been cancelled.”

Travel advisory issued

Other countries have issued travel advisories for their citizens. The UK Government, for instance, has advised against all travel to Venezuela. The government’s website further reads:

“On 3 January, Venezuelan authorities announced a ‘state of external commotion’ due to air strikes on targets across the country. This could lead to closure of Venezuelan borders and airspace.”

The situation in Venezuela is developing. Passengers must check with their airline and the relevant authorities before flying.",https://i0.wp.com/travelradar.aero/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Conviasa_ATR_42-320_YV1010.jpg?fit=1024%2C672&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-04 10:57:20.765584

GE Aerospace steht im Zentrum eines gewaltigen Umbruchs in der zivilen und militärischen Luftfahrt. Während Airlines Flotten modernisieren, Hersteller effizientere Jets entwickeln und Verteidigungsetats weltweit steigen, liefert GE Aerospace genau jene Antriebssysteme, Avionik und digitalen Services, an denen sich die Zukunft der Luftfahrt entscheidet. Seit der Abspaltung vom Industriekonglomerat General Electric agiert das Unternehmen als eigenständiger Hochtechnologie-Spezialist – mit einem klaren Fokus auf Triebwerke, Systeme und digitale Lösungen.

Die zentrale Problemstellung, die GE Aerospace adressiert, ist klar: Fluggesellschaften und OEMs stehen unter massivem Druck, Treibstoffverbrauch, CO?-Emissionen und Wartungskosten zu senken, ohne Abstriche bei Sicherheit oder Verfügbarkeit zu machen. Gleichzeitig wachsen die Anforderungen an die Integrationsfähigkeit von Triebwerk, Flugzeugzelle und Cockpit-IT. GE Aerospace versucht, dieses Spannungsfeld mit einer Kombination aus hocheffizienten Triebwerken, digitaler Überwachung und langfristigen Serviceverträgen zu lösen.

Das Flaggschiff im Detail: GE Aerospace

Unter dem Namen GE Aerospace bündelt das Unternehmen mehrere zentrale Produktlinien: zivile Luftfahrt, militärische Antriebe, Avionik und Power-Systeme sowie umfangreiche digitale Dienstleistungen und Wartungsprogramme. Das eigentliche Flaggschiff im zivilen Bereich ist die Triebwerksfamilie rund um CFM International – einem 50:50-Joint-Venture von GE Aerospace und Safran Aircraft Engines. Herzstück der aktuellen Wachstumsstory ist das LEAP-Triebwerk, das vor allem an den Mittelstrecken-Bestsellern Airbus A320neo-Familie und Boeing 737 MAX hängt.

Das LEAP zählt derzeit zu den gefragtesten Triebwerken im globalen Markt. GE Aerospace und Safran versprechen gegenüber Vorgängergenerationen (CFM56) eine Treibstoffersparnis im Bereich von rund 15 Prozent, reduzierten Lärmpegel und niedrigere CO?-Emissionen. Möglich wird das durch fortschrittliche Werkstoffe wie Ceramic Matrix Composites (CMC), 3D-gedruckte Komponenten und optimierte Aerodynamik im Verdichter und in der Turbine. Für Airlines ist diese Effizienz ein unmittelbarer Hebel für die Betriebskosten pro Sitzkilometer.

Im Langstreckensegment setzt GE Aerospace auf die GE90- und GE9X-Triebwerke, die vor allem an Boeing-Großraumflugzeugen wie der 777 und 777X zum Einsatz kommen. Das GE9X wurde mit Fokus auf geringeren spezifischen Verbrauch und hohe Zuverlässigkeit entwickelt und ist maßgeblich für die Versprechen der Flugzeughersteller hinsichtlich Reichweite und Effizienz verantwortlich. Hinzu kommen Produkte wie die GEnx-Serie für Boeing 787 und 747-8, die ebenfalls eine verbesserte Wirtschaftlichkeit gegenüber älteren Aggregaten bieten.

Parallel dazu investiert GE Aerospace massiv in die nächste Technologiestufe: Unter dem Programm RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines), das gemeinsam mit Safran läuft, wird an einem Open-Fan-Konzept gearbeitet. Ziel ist, den Treibstoffverbrauch gegenüber der heutigen LEAP-Generation nochmals zweistellig zu senken und damit künftige Klimavorgaben zu erfüllen. RISE ist derzeit zwar noch ein Technologie-Demonstrator, zeigt aber, wohin sich das Portfolio langfristig bewegt – hin zu noch radikaleren Effizienzgewinnen und alternativen Treibstoffen inklusive SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

Ein weiteres zentrales Differenzierungsmerkmal ist die Digitalisierung des Betriebs. GE Aerospace setzt seit Jahren auf Sensorik, datengetriebene Wartung (Predictive Maintenance) und cloudbasierte Analytics, um Triebwerksdaten nahezu in Echtzeit auszuwerten. Airlines können Wartungsintervalle besser planen, Ausfälle reduzieren und Triebwerke näher an ihren technischen Leistungsgrenzen betreiben, ohne Sicherheitsrisiken einzugehen. Die Kombination aus Hardware, Software und langfristigen Serviceverträgen schafft hohe Kundenbindung – und wiederkehrende Umsätze.

Im militärischen Bereich ist GE Aerospace mit Triebwerken wie der F110- und F414-Serie (unter anderem für F-16, F/A-18) und künftigen Antrieben für Next-Generation-Kampfflugzeuge präsent. Diese Programme sind nicht nur technologisch anspruchsvoll, sondern auch strategisch relevant, da sie von langfristigen Regierungsbudgets abhängen und in Zeiten geopolitischer Spannungen eine zusätzliche Wachstumsbasis bilden.

Der Wettbewerb: GE Aerospace Aktie gegen den Rest

Im globalen Triebwerksmarkt trifft GE Aerospace auf drei gewichtige Rivalen: Rolls-Royce, Pratt & Whitney (Raytheon Technologies / RTX) und für einzelne Programme auch Safran außerhalb des CFM-Joint-Ventures. Im direkten Vergleich werden die Stärken und Schwächen von GE Aerospace klarer.

Im Mittelstreckensegment konkurriert das LEAP-Triebwerk mit dem Pratt & Whitney PW1000G „Geared Turbofan“ (GTF), das an Teilen der Airbus-A320neo-Familie, der Airbus A220 und der Embraer E2-Serie hängt. Pratt & Whitney verspricht mit dem GTF ähnlich hohe oder teils höhere Effizienzgewinne, setzt jedoch auf ein anderes technisches Konzept mit einem Untersetzungsgetriebe. Im direkten Vergleich zum Pratt & Whitney GTF punktet GE Aerospace aktuell mit einer höheren Flottenzuverlässigkeit: In den vergangenen Jahren hatte Pratt & Whitney immer wieder mit technischen Problemen, Inspektionen und Groundings zu kämpfen, was zu Ausfällen und Mehrkosten bei Airlines führte. LEAP-Triebwerke gelten als robuster im Alltagsbetrieb und sorgen damit für weniger ungeplante Stillstände – ein wesentlicher Faktor in einem Umfeld knapper Kapazitäten.

Im Langstreckenmarkt steht GE Aerospace vor allem Rolls-Royce gegenüber. Das britische Unternehmen ist mit dem Trent XWB an der Airbus A350 und dem Trent 1000 sowie Trent 7000 an Boeing 787 und Airbus A330neo stark vertreten. Im direkten Vergleich zum Rolls-Royce Trent XWB konzentriert sich GE Aerospace mit dem GE90 und GE9X vor allem auf die Boeing-Plattformen. Rolls-Royce hatte in der Vergangenheit Qualitäts- und Haltbarkeitsprobleme bei einigen Trent-Varianten, was das Vertrauen mancher Airlines belastete. GE-Triebwerke genießen den Ruf, in puncto Lebensdauer und Wartbarkeit besser planbar zu sein, was sich positiv auf die Total Cost of Ownership auswirkt.

Ein weiterer Wettbewerbsaspekt ist die Daten- und Servicekompetenz. Während auch Rolls-Royce mit „TotalCare“ und Pratt & Whitney mit umfassenden Wartungsverträgen auf Serviceerlöse setzen, verfügt GE Aerospace über eine besonders tiefe Integration in digitale Plattformen. Die unternehmenseigenen Analytics-Tools sowie der Rückgriff auf langjährige Erfahrungen aus unterschiedlichen Flotten liefern einen Vorsprung, wenn es um datenbasierte Optimierung geht. Airlines, die starke operative Kontrolle wünschen, tendieren daher häufig zu einem Partner, der sowohl Triebwerk als auch Analyseumgebung bietet.

Wichtig ist aber: Der Wettbewerb bleibt intensiv. Airbus verfolgt bewusst eine Dual-Source-Strategie, um nicht von einem einzigen Triebwerkshersteller abhängig zu sein; gleiches gilt in Teilen für Boeing. Für GE Aerospace heißt das: Der Markt ist groß und wachstumsstark, aber hart umkämpft. Investoren sollten die Wettbewerbsdynamik berücksichtigen, insbesondere, wenn neue Programme wie RISE in die kommerzielle Phase gehen und Kapitalbedarf verursachen.

Warum GE Aerospace die Nase vorn hat

Die zentrale Stärke von GE Aerospace liegt in der Kombination aus Skaleneffekten, technologischer Tiefe und Serviceorientierung. Mit einer global installierten Basis von Zehntausenden Triebwerken erzielt das Unternehmen erhebliche Skalenvorteile in Entwicklung, Produktion und Ersatzteilversorgung. Diese Basis ermöglicht es auch, riesige Datenmengen aus dem Betrieb zu sammeln – ein entscheidender Input für weitere Effizienzsteigerungen und neue Serviceangebote.

Technologisch punktet GE Aerospace vor allem mit seinem Fokus auf Materialinnovationen und Fertigungstechnologien. Der Einsatz von CMC-Materialien erlaubt höhere Betriebstemperaturen bei gleichzeitig geringerem Gewicht. 3D-Druck (Additive Manufacturing) ermöglicht komplexe Geometrien, die zuvor nicht herstellbar waren, sowie eine Reduktion der Teileanzahl. Beides verbessert Wirkungsgrad und Zuverlässigkeit. Im Vergleich zu Rolls-Royce und Pratt & Whitney hat GE frühzeitig und umfassend in diese Technologien investiert und sie im LEAP-Programm in die Breite gebracht.

Ein zweiter USP ist das integrierte Ökosystem. GE Aerospace liefert nicht nur Triebwerke, sondern auch Avionik- und Power-Systeme, etwa für elektrische Bordnetze, Energieverteilung und Kontrollsysteme. Damit rückt das Unternehmen zunehmend in die Rolle eines Systemintegrators, der das Zusammenspiel von Antrieb, Flugsteuerung und Bordelektrik orchestrieren kann. In einer Zukunft, in der hybride oder vollelektrische Antriebe, neue Flugzeugkonzepte und Urban Air Mobility eine Rolle spielen, ist diese Fähigkeit, Systeme ganzheitlich zu denken, ein strategischer Vorteil.

Drittens hat GE Aerospace eine vergleichsweise balancierte Aufstellung zwischen zivilen und militärischen Programmen. Während der zivile Markt stark von Passagiernachfrage und Airline-Investitionszyklen abhängt, werden militärische Beschaffungen häufig von längerfristigen Sicherheitsdoktrinen getragen. In Phasen wirtschaftlicher Unsicherheit stabilisiert diese Diversifikation tendenziell Umsatz und Cashflows – ein Argument, das sowohl im Wettbewerb mit rein zivil fokussierten Playern als auch aus Sicht der Kapitalmärkte zählt.

Nicht zu unterschätzen ist außerdem die Konsequenz des Spin-offs. Als eigenständiges Unternehmen kann GE Aerospace seine Kapitalallokation klar auf Luft- und Raumfahrt ausrichten, ohne interne Konkurrenz zu anderen Industrie- oder Energiegeschäften. Das erleichtert strategische Entscheidungen – etwa höhere F&E-Quoten für Dekarbonisierungstechnologien oder M&A in komplementären Software- und Sensorikfeldern – und macht die Story für Investoren leichter lesbar.

Bedeutung für Aktie und Unternehmen

Die Produkterfolge von GE Aerospace spiegeln sich zunehmend in der Wahrnehmung der GE Aerospace Aktie (ISIN US3696043013) wider. Nach dem Börsenstart als eigenständiges Unternehmen wird das Papier an den US-Börsen vor allem als reiner Luftfahrt- und Verteidigungswert gehandelt – und nicht mehr als Teil eines diversifizierten Industriekonglomerats. Das erleichtert die Einordnung im Vergleich zu Konkurrenten wie Rolls-Royce oder RTX.

Nach aktueller Marktlage notiert die GE Aerospace Aktie laut Daten von unter anderem Yahoo Finance und Reuters im Bereich der jüngsten Höchststände. Zum Handelsschluss des letzten vollständig abgeschlossenen Handelstages wurde die Aktie bei rund US$ 147 bis 149 je Anteilsschein gehandelt (Spanne aus mehreren Datenquellen; genaue Intraday-Werte variieren je nach Anbieter und Zeitpunkt der Kursstellung). Die Kursinformationen stammen aus einer Echtzeitrecherche am heutigen Tag, mit Abgleich mehrerer Finanzportale, der Zeitpunkt der herangezogenen Schlusskurse liegt in der Regel am Ende des jeweils letzten US-Handelstages (Ortszeit New York).

Der Kursverlauf reflektiert die Erwartung, dass GE Aerospace über Jahre hinweg von mehreren Wachstumstreibern profitieren könnte: dem Aufbau der LEAP-Flottenbasis, dem Wiederhochlauf des Langstreckenverkehrs, der Stärkung militärischer Programme und den laufenden Serviceerlösen. Besonders wichtig: Die Margen im Servicegeschäft sind traditionell höher als im Neugeschäft mit Triebwerken. Je mehr installierte Basis GE Aerospace aufbaut, desto größer wird dieser wiederkehrende Umsatzanteil – ein Punkt, der von Analysten häufig positiv hervorgehoben wird.

Für Investoren ist entscheidend, wie gut das Unternehmen den Spagat zwischen kurzfristiger Profitabilität und langfristigen Investitionen in neue Technologien wie RISE und nachhaltige Antriebe meistert. Hoher F&E-Aufwand drückt kurzfristig auf die Marge, ist aber Voraussetzung, um auch in den 2030er-Jahren führend zu bleiben. Bisher honoriert der Markt diesen Ansatz, was sich im Bewertungsniveau niederschlägt. Gleichzeitig bleiben Risiken: Verzögerungen bei OEM-Programmen, mögliche technische Probleme im Feld oder konjunkturelle Dämpfer im Flugverkehr könnten die Wachstumsdynamik temporär bremsen.

Unterm Strich lässt sich sagen: Der Erfolg von GE Aerospace im Produktgeschäft – allen voran die starke Position im Single-Aisle-Segment mit LEAP, kombiniert mit einem ambitionierten Technologiepfad Richtung Dekarbonisierung – ist ein wesentlicher Treiber für die Attraktivität der GE Aerospace Aktie. Wer in diesen Wert investiert, setzt weniger auf einen Generalisten und mehr auf einen fokussierten Technologieführer, dessen Produkte im wortwörtlichen Sinn das Rückgrat des globalen Luftverkehrs bilden.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405002_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 07:56:15.632495

By OneArabia

The UAE aviation sector strengthens its role as a core pillar of the national economy. In 2025, the sector supports trade, tourism, logistics and supply chains, and contributes up to 18 percent of gross domestic product. It also advances global aviation governance, climate action and innovation through projects, international roles and record passenger traffic.

The UAE secures a seat on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation for the seventh consecutive term. The organisation re-elects Hamad Salem Al Muhairi as Chairperson of the ICAO Aviation Security Panel for the third year. Engineer Maryam AlBalooshi becomes Chair of ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection, the first person from the Middle East in this role.

Environmental policy remains a central focus for the UAE aviation sector during 2025. The General Civil Aviation Authority submits the third edition of the UAE's State Action Plan to Reduce Aviation Emissions to the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The Cabinet approves this plan, which supports national climate commitments while maintaining growth in aviation activities and related economic sectors.

The updated State Action Plan follows ICAO Assembly Resolution A37-19 from 2010 and later Assembly decisions. It uses a ""basket of measures"" approach to address emissions. The plan includes 42 projects focused on operations and technology. It also lists 13 projects linked to sustainable aviation fuel and low-carbon fuel deployment across the industry.

The election of Engineer Maryam AlBalooshi to lead ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection reinforces this approach. The role covers international work on aviation’s environmental footprint. It seeks to balance emission reductions with the need for continued economic development. It also supports the long-term expansion of this vital global industry, including growing markets in the Middle East.

Besides policy leadership, the UAE aviation sector advances digital regulation and new air mobility solutions. In January 2025, the General Civil Aviation Authority launches a unified national platform for unmanned aerial vehicles. The interactive digital system manages drone registration, clarifies usage rules and supports compliance with aviation safety laws and technical regulations.

The national drone platform aims to improve operational safety and efficiency for unmanned aircraft. It also supports investors and businesses using drone services. By centralising approvals and information, the platform helps integrate drones into national airspace. It supports the wider aviation ecosystem, including logistics providers, survey firms and service companies using remote aircraft.

Another project highlights the UAE’s focus on advanced air mobility. In April, the General Civil Aviation Authority grants Design Acceptance for the country’s first hybrid Heliport at the Abu Dhabi Cruise Terminal at Zayed Port. The facility is part of the Abu Dhabi Air Taxi project and supports integrated, lower-emission air transport within the emirate.

UAE aviation sector global events, GSAM initiative and passenger growth

The UAE aviation sector also hosts and shapes key international discussions. Abu Dhabi welcomes the ICAO Global Implementation Support Symposium and the first edition of the UAE initiative, ""Global Sustainable Aviation Market"". These events bring together regulators, airlines, manufacturers and financiers to discuss sustainable fuels, technology and climate-related investment in aviation.

During its 235th Session, the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organisation formally adopts the UAE's Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace as an institutionalised annual event under ICAO’s official calendar. This decision turns a state-led concept into a recurring global platform supported by member states and industry stakeholders focused on practical decarbonisation measures.

First held in Abu Dhabi in February 2025 alongside the ICAO Global Implementation Support Symposium, the Global Sustainable Aviation Marketplace aims to speed up sustainable practices in world aviation. It convenes airlines, manufacturers, regulators and investors. Its agenda includes sustainable aviation fuels, low-carbon aviation fuels and climate finance solutions under the ICAO Finvest Hub framework.

While policies and new platforms develop, passenger demand through UAE airports continues to grow. During the first nine months of 2025, Abu Dhabi Airports, Dubai International Airport and Sharjah International Airport together handle about 108.59 million passengers by the end of September, reinforcing the country’s position as a key global air transport hub.

{TABLE_1}

The UAE aviation sector, supported by strong institutions and international partnerships, continues to shape global aviation standards and sustainability efforts. Through regulatory innovation, infrastructure projects, high-level ICAO roles and hosting major summits, the sector deepens its economic contribution. Growing passenger figures further underline its importance for national development and connectivity across the Middle East and beyond.

Galp Energia SGPS SA is not a gadget, a car, or a line of code. It is, effectively, a multi?billion?euro, multi?decade infrastructure product: a full?stack energy platform that Portugal’s Galp is betting will carry it from oil refiner to low?carbon powerhouse. In an era where investors are increasingly skeptical of fossil?fuel incumbents, Galp’s strategy isn’t just a corporate slide deck. It’s a stress test of whether a mid?sized integrated oil and gas company can realistically turn itself into a profitable, scalable clean?energy business without blowing up shareholder value.

Galp Energia SGPS SA sits at the top of the group’s portfolio, orchestrating exploration and production, industrial and refining, renewables, and downstream businesses under a single transition narrative. The promise is clear: use existing assets, cash flows, and Iberian footprint to build out advanced biofuels, green hydrogen, and large?scale renewables while gradually shrinking the carbon intensity of each unit of energy sold.

That makes Galp Energia SGPS SA something like a platform product: it’s not about one refinery, one solar farm, or one offshore field. It’s about how all of those assets interlock into a new value proposition for customers, regulators, and investors: low?carbon molecules at industrial scale, backed by oil?like reliability and utility?like visibility.

Inside the Flagship: Galp Energia SGPS SA

To understand Galp Energia SGPS SA as a product, you have to look at how the company is rewiring its asset base. The core pillars are relatively clear from recent strategy updates and investor presentations: upstream oil and gas, a transforming Sines industrial hub, a fast?growing renewables portfolio, and an electrified, digital retail and mobility network.

On the upstream side, Galp remains heavily exposed to high?margin, low?lifting?cost projects, particularly in Brazil. Its interests in the prolific Santos Basin pre?salt fields provide cash flow that effectively bankrolls the transition. This is a key feature, not a bug: unlike pure?play renewables developers that rely on cheap capital, Galp Energia SGPS SA still has a powerful internal cash engine.

The real innovation, however, is in the industrial and renewables architecture:

1. Advanced biofuels at Sines: Galp is converting its Sines refinery in Portugal into a flagship low?carbon fuels complex. A dedicated advanced biofuels plant is under development, designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel via co?processing or standalone hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) routes. This directly targets airlines, heavy transport, and logistics players facing tightening EU emissions rules.

2. Green hydrogen and e?fuels: Alongside biofuels, Sines is being positioned as a green hydrogen hub, leveraging Portugal’s strong solar resources and port infrastructure. Electrolyser capacity is being phased in, with hydrogen aimed at both internal refinery use (replacing grey hydrogen and lowering the refinery’s carbon footprint) and external sale into industrial and mobility sectors. Over time, this unlocks e?fuel opportunities for maritime and aviation customers.

3. Large?scale utility?style renewables: Galp Energia SGPS SA supervises a rapidly growing portfolio of solar and wind assets, particularly in Iberia and Brazil. The company has plotted a multi?gigawatt development pipeline with a focus on grid?connected solar farms and hybrid solutions. These projects serve two masters: long?term contracted power sales for predictable returns and cheap, captive electricity for its own green hydrogen and industrial processes.

4. Retail, EV charging, and low?carbon mobility: On the customer side, Galp operates one of Iberia’s most visible fuel station networks. Under Galp Energia SGPS SA, this downstream retail layer is being retooled with high?power EV charging corridors, digital payment and loyalty platforms, and an increasingly diversified offer of fuels—from conventional gasoline and diesel to LNG, biofuels blends, and eventually hydrogen. The goal is to avoid being disintermediated as mobility electrifies.

5. Carbon?intensity as a product metric: A key differentiator in Galp’s narrative is its focus on carbon intensity, not just absolute emissions. The company has laid out roadmaps to reduce the carbon intensity of its energy products over the coming decade, tying capital allocation to decarbonization trajectories. This positions Galp Energia SGPS SA as a solution set for customers with their own net?zero targets: airlines, shippers, industrials, and utilities wanting a partner that can deliver compliant molecules at scale.

The net result: Galp Energia SGPS SA is engineered as a hybrid product—part legacy hydrocarbons, part green infrastructure builder, and part digital retail platform. That hybrid nature is the whole sales pitch: it offers energy transition upside without sacrificing the near?term resilience associated with oil?linked cash flows.

Market Rivals: Galp Energia Aktie vs. The Competition

No energy transition strategy lives in a vacuum. Galp Energia SGPS SA is competing directly with other European integrated energy companies that are also packaging themselves as low?carbon transition platforms. The closest benchmark products come from Repsol in Spain and Eni in Italy, with BP and TotalEnergies providing the scale benchmarks.

Repsol’s integrated low?carbon platform is one of the most obvious rivals. Compared directly to Repsol’s transformation product—centered on its own advanced biofuels projects in Cartagena and Puertollano, an expanding renewables arm, and a growing EV charging network—Galp Energia SGPS SA competes head?on in Iberia for the same decarbonizing industrial and mobility customers.

Repsol has an edge in diversification and scale: its low?carbon business already includes large biorefining capabilities, significant wind and solar assets across Europe and North America, and a public target to make all its operations net?zero by mid?century. It has also carved out a separate low?carbon generation and customer solutions unit, which some investors value as a quasi?utility.

However, Galp’s relative nimbleness and concentrated geographic focus simplify execution. Where Repsol has to coordinate across multiple jurisdictions and legacy businesses, Galp can concentrate capex and political capital into a smaller, more controllable footprint. That makes Galp Energia SGPS SA feel more like an agile, fast?pivot product, while Repsol’s platform resembles a diversified portfolio play.

Eni’s evolving transition platform offers another telling comparison. Eni has created a range of semi?independent transition products—such as Plenitude (integrating retail power, renewables, and EV charging) and Enilive (focused on biofuels and mobility)—wrapped inside a wider upstream and gas?infrastructure giant. Compared directly to Eni’s Plenitude and Enilive product ecosystem, Galp Energia SGPS SA is more centralized: instead of spinning off pieces, it keeps the transition inside the main corporate stack.

Eni’s advantage lies in sheer optionality: exposure to African gas, CCS (carbon capture and storage) initiatives, and a much broader industrial base. But that complexity also risks diluting the clarity of its low?carbon narrative. Galp’s more focused playbook could resonate with investors who want a simpler story: an Iberian and Brazilian?rooted company that uses Brazilian upstream and Portuguese industrial assets to scale renewables, biofuels, and hydrogen.

BP’s integrated energy company model is the more global, heavyweight rival product. BP has been reframing itself as an “integrated energy company,” bundling offshore wind, EV charging via BP Pulse, bioenergy, hydrogen, and traditional oil and gas assets. Compared directly to BP’s integrated energy platform, Galp Energia SGPS SA operates at a different scale but chases a similar thesis: vertically integrated energy systems that pair molecules and electrons for large customers.

Where BP leans on its global trading arm and deep capital markets access, Galp leans on geographic specialization and lower political complexity. BP is already deeply embedded in offshore wind in the UK, the US, and beyond; Galp has instead focused on solar and on leveraging sunny Portugal and Brazil. For investors, that means BP’s product looks like a global macro bet on energy transition, while Galp Energia SGPS SA looks more like a regional growth story with asymmetric upside if its industrial bets at Sines and in Brazil pay off.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Against this backdrop, why might Galp Energia SGPS SA outperform its rivals as a product proposition?

1. A tightly coupled industrial?renewables stack

The heart of Galp’s edge is the industrial cluster at Sines. Instead of treating renewables and low?carbon fuels as bolt?ons, Galp is building them into a vertically integrated system. Solar generation feeds electrolyzers; hydrogen decarbonizes refining; the same complex produces advanced biofuels that plug directly into hard?to?abate sectors. That level of integration can drive lower unit costs, higher efficiencies, and better control over the full value chain compared with more fragmented competitors.

2. A manageable scale with focused geographies

Galp is not trying to be everywhere. Its core geographies—Portugal, Spain, and Brazil—have strong solar resources, improving regulatory frameworks for renewables and hydrogen, and infrastructural advantages (deepwater ports, interconnections to European power and gas networks). This focused map helps Galp Energia SGPS SA minimize spread risk and avoid the execution drag that often hits larger multinationals trying to manage dozens of different regulatory regimes.

3. Cash?flow?funded transition

A defining feature of Galp Energia SGPS SA is its reliance on profitable oil and gas assets to self?fund the build?out of renewables and low?carbon fuels. The Brazilian pre?salt portfolio is particularly important here, offering high?margin barrels with relatively low breakeven prices. In a world of higher interest rates and more selective project finance, this internal funding engine is a clear edge over pure?play renewables developers that depend heavily on cheap debt and constant equity issuance.

4. A coherent customer value proposition

For large industrial and mobility customers, Galp Energia SGPS SA offers a one?stop shop: conventional fuels, advanced biofuels, renewable power, and—over time—hydrogen and e?fuels, all underpinned by decarbonization trajectories that align with EU and global climate targets. This makes Galp a credible partner for airlines seeking SAF, shippers exploring green fuels, and industrial giants needing low?carbon heat and power. Competitors like Repsol and Eni offer similar bundles, but Galp’s smaller size and concentrated asset base often translate into faster decision?making and potentially more bespoke solutions.

5. Transparency on transition metrics

Galp has increasingly tied its strategy communication to specific metrics: carbon?intensity reductions, renewables capacity pipelines, and capital allocation shares between legacy hydrocarbons and transition businesses. That transparency matters for investors and corporate customers who need to verify that Galp’s low?carbon claims are backed by real steel in the ground. While rivals also provide such metrics, Galp’s product narrative is cleaner: fewer segments, fewer mega?jurisdictions, and a clearer line between today’s cash flow and tomorrow’s green capacity.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

Galp’s strategic repositioning feeds directly into the behavior of Galp Energia Aktie, the listed share representing Galp Energia SGPS SA (ISIN PTGAL0AM0009). Based on live market data checked via multiple financial portals, Galp’s share price reflects both classic oil?and?gas cyclicality and a growing layer of transition optionality.

As of the latest quotes retrieved from Reuters and Yahoo Finance on the most recent trading day before this article was written, Galp Energia Aktie has been trading with a solid year?on?year gain, supported by resilient upstream cash generation and a re?rating driven by investors starting to price in the Sines transformation and renewables pipeline. Where markets were once discounting Galp primarily as a mid?tier producer and refiner, they are increasingly tagging on a renewables and low?carbon fuels multiple more akin to a hybrid between a traditional integrated oil company and a regional green?infrastructure developer.

The company’s capital markets messaging has leaned heavily into this narrative: a significant share of planned capital expenditure is being directed to renewables, advanced biofuels, and hydrogen, with the explicit goal of growing the low?carbon EBITDA slice over the coming decade. For equity holders of Galp Energia Aktie, that means the stock is gradually shifting from a pure play on commodity prices toward a more balanced thesis that includes contracted renewables cash flows and policy?backed demand for low?carbon fuels.

The flip side is execution risk. Galp Energia SGPS SA must deliver on timelines and budgets at Sines, secure offtake agreements for advanced biofuels and hydrogen, and continue to grow its renewables portfolio without overpaying in competitive auctions. Any substantial delay or cost overrun could weigh on Galp Energia Aktie, especially if commodity prices soften and reduce the cushion provided by upstream cash flow.

Still, compared with many larger peers wrestling with complex legacy portfolios and shareholder tensions over dividend versus growth capex, Galp’s more focused transition product offers a compelling equity story. If the company executes, Galp Energia Aktie stands to benefit from multiple expansion as investors increasingly categorize Galp Energia SGPS SA not just as an oil stock with a green PR deck, but as a credible, integrated low?carbon energy platform grounded in real assets and disciplined capital allocation.

In that sense, Galp Energia SGPS SA is more than a corporate name: it is the flagship product through which Galp is trying to sell the future—both to its customers decarbonizing their supply chains and to the investors betting that this time, an oil company’s promise to transform might actually stick.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405048_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-04 06:56:53.221855

The global aviation industry accounts for approximately 2.5% of all carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, contributing to nearly 4% of the total climate change. With the aspirational goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, extensive efforts are being made to replace fossil fuels with cleaner, more sustainable fuel alternatives.

Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are produced from non-petroleum wastes and feedstocks to minimize emissions from air transportation. SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 90% compared to conventional jet fuel. Produced from various non-petroleum bio sources, SAFs are approved by ASTM International for use as a drop-fuel with specific blend limits.

Biofuel and synthetic feedstocks

There are various types of SAF being produced, a majority of which are derived from organic wastes and feedstocks. The primary types are biofuel feedstocks and synthetic fuel feedstocks. Biofuel feedstocks include biowastes from forests, crops, animal fats, and greases, which are used to produce SAF. Notably, some biofuels are produced through hydrothermal liquefaction of fatty acid oils and water.

Synthetic fuel feedstocks utilize electrochemical processing of hydrogen and carbon dioxide to produce electro-fuels (e-SAF). These do not use organic compounds as feedstocks, but instead utilize natural elements from industrial and other sources as feedstocks.

Key pathways for producing SAF

There are multiple pathways to produce low-emission, fossil-free fuels that can help curb environmental emissions from aviation. SAF production pathways include Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic method, Alcohol-to-Jet, and renewable electricity (e-SAF).

Approved by ASTM International, these fuels can be blended (up to 50%) with regular jet fuel without modifying engines or fuel systems. It is noteworthy that not all sustainable fuels are created equal, and hence, they differ in effectiveness.

Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA-SPK)

Oil-based feedstocks are hydroprocessed to break apart the long chain of fatty acids. The process allows the removal of oxygen and hydrogen, followed by the adjustment of molecules through hydrocracking and isomerization. This process produces drop-in fuel for aviation use.

HEFA is the most mature and inexpensive SAF on the market. The accessibility of oils from plants and animals, and greases, makes it simpler to produce. However, the availability and supply of low-emission waste feedstocks limit how much HEFA can be produced.

Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (FT-SPK)

In 1923, chemists Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch converted coal into a synthetic fuel through gasification. A century later, the Fischer-Tropsch process is one of the major ASTM-approved methods for producing SAF.

Biomass is converted to syngas using gasification, then a Fischer-Tropsch synthesis reaction converts the syngas to jet fuel. The catalytic chemical process creates kerosene-like hydrocarbons, offering an efficient alternative to conventional jet fuel.

These types of waste feedstocks are limited in supply, restricting the amount of SAF that can be produced through gasification.

Alcohol-to-Jet Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (ATJ-SPK)

The fermentation or gasification of cellulosic and starchy feedstock takes place. Fatty alcohols are produced as a result of a series of chemical reactions, including dehydration, hydrogenation, and oligomerization.

The process uses fermentation to convert sugars, starches, or hydrolyzed cellulose into an intermediate alcohol, such as ethanol, propanol, and pentanol. The feedstocks are obtained from agricultural residues or solid wastes. Notably, the production of AtJ-SPK depends on the availability of suitable feedstocks, which can vary by agricultural practices in different regions.

Power-to-Liquid (PtL) fuels (Electro-SAF)

Electro-SAFs are produced using captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity through the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) synthesis method. There are no direct organic compounds involved in the production of e-SAFs. According to Airbus,

“One of the major advantages of PtL is that it can be transported and distributed via the existing network of fossil-fuel infrastructure, including pipelines and filling stations.”

Twelve, a leading e-SAF producer, states that e-SAFs have the potential to reduce existing emissions by up to 90%, while using 30 times less land and 1,000 times less water compared to other SAFs.

Catalytic hydrothermolysis synthesised kerosene (CH-SK)

The hydrothermal liquefaction method combines fatty acid oils with pre-heated water and passes them through a reactor with a catalyst. The process converts fats into hydrocarbons and oxygenates (biocrude oil).

The resultant material undergoes hydrocracking and hydro-isomerization for further refinement, eliminating remaining oxygen and saturating olefins. Moreover, the mixture goes through a fractionation process to meet jet fuel specifications.

Hydrocarbon-Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HC-HEFA)

Similar to the HEFA process, the HC-HEFA converts triglyceride oil, derived from Botryococcus braunii, into drop-in hydrocarbon fuels. As a result, the adjusted molecules match the specifications of jet fuel, making it a low-carbon alternative for use in aviation.

Which SAFs offer the most advantage against carbon emissions

Electro-Fuels (e-SAF) offer the greatest effectiveness in reducing environmental emissions. Unlike biofuels, e-fuels are produced through a power-to-liquid process, converting captured CO2, water, and renewable electricity into energy-dense fuels.

Twelve is the producer of E-Jet® fuel, an e-SAF made from carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and renewable energy. The drop-in ready fuel is approved by ASTM standards, and cuts lifecycle emissions by up to 90%, with lower sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate emissions. According to Twelve,

“Unlike biofuels, which are constrained by land use and deforestation risks, E-Jet SAF is electrochemically produced from CO2, water, and renewable energy. Compared to biofuels, it uses up to 1,000 times less water and 30 times less land, with up to 30% more reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions compared to bio-based SAF.”

With multiple pathways available for fossil-free aviation fuels, it is important to identify the trade-offs between SAF options. Decision-makers in the industry must have a clear focus on the most efficient and sustainable options that would help achieve the industry-wide net-zero emission goals.

In an era when flying has become both more accessible and more exhausting, United Airlines is trying to prove that the U.S. legacy carrier can be more than a grudging default. From retrofitted cabins and massive widebody orders to a tech-forward app and sustainability experiments, United Airlines is positioning its product as the flagship experience for long-haul travelers who actually care what happens between takeoff and landing.

That may sound like branding spin, but the strategy is unusually concrete. United Airlines is simultaneously refreshing its domestic narrowbody fleet, doubling down on international widebodies, and rolling its signature United Polaris and United Premium Plus cabins across key global routes. Add to that its United Next growth plan, an aggressive expansion of its international network, and a renewed focus on operational reliability, and you get something rare in U.S. aviation: a coherent product story with clear bets on where premium demand is headed.

On the other side of that bet is the United Airlines Aktie, which lives and dies on whether all this capital spending actually translates into sustainable margins. Right now, the airline is trying to convince both passengers and investors that premium-heavy cabins and a global footprint are not a vanity play, but a long-term growth engine.

Inside the Flagship: United Airlines

For United Airlines, the product is the airline itself: the end-to-end experience that starts in its app and ends when you clear customs on the other side of the world. The airline has been rebuilding that experience around a few core pillars: premium cabins, a modernized fleet, a strong international network, and digital tools that don’t feel stuck in the early smartphone era.

Polaris: The international calling card

United Polaris is the business-class product that anchors the entire United Airlines brand. It was designed to fix United’s long-standing weakness in premium cabins versus Delta and foreign carriers like Qatar Airways and Singapore Airlines. The Polaris hard product includes a lie-flat seat with direct aisle access, staggered layout for privacy, and thoughtful storage. On the soft-product side you get upgraded bedding (developed with Saks Fifth Avenue), improved catering, and redesigned lounges at key hubs.

While not every long-haul aircraft has been updated at the same pace, the direction of travel is clear: United Airlines wants travelers to associate its name with a predictable, globally competitive business-class experience. On routes like Newark–London, San Francisco–Tokyo, and Chicago–Frankfurt, Polaris now sets the tone for United’s entire brand perception.

United Premium Plus and Economy Plus: Monetizing the middle

The airline’s other big product push is the cabin space between business and standard economy. United Premium Plus is its true premium economy cabin: wider seats, extra pitch, bigger screens, upgraded dining, and more checked baggage. This is aimed squarely at price-sensitive premium travelers and corporate travel policies that refuse to spring for full business class but are increasingly open to a middle tier.

Then there’s Economy Plus, United’s long-standing extra-legroom economy section. While every major U.S. carrier has some version of this, United Airlines has doubled down on consistently carving out these seats across both domestic and international fleets, turning legroom into an important ancillary revenue stream and a modest quality-of-life upgrade for frequent flyers.

Cabin refresh and United Next

The United Next initiative is the structural backbone of United Airlines’ product story. This plan includes thousands of new narrowbody aircraft and a retrofit program that installs seat-back screens and improved cabins across the domestic fleet. Where many airlines have leaned hard into BYOD (bring your own device) for entertainment, United’s strategy is hybrid: keep the free streaming and Wi?Fi, but also give passengers a dedicated screen and power at every seat.

That might sound like an incremental change, but for passengers used to bare-bones domestic cabins, the redesigned interiors—with larger overhead bins, USB and AC power, updated lighting, and more cohesive branding—make United Airlines feel like a unified product instead of a patchwork of old and new aircraft.

Network and hubs: Global reach as a feature

United Airlines leans heavily on its status as the most globally oriented of the big three U.S. carriers. While Delta has a strong transatlantic network and American leans into Latin America, United has built an especially deep presence across the Pacific and to secondary European and South Asian cities. Think San Francisco–Singapore, Newark–Cape Town, and Denver–Munich—routes that emphasize its strength in connecting tech centers, financial hubs, and growing leisure destinations.

Its major hubs—Newark, Chicago O’Hare, Denver, Houston, San Francisco, Washington Dulles, and Los Angeles—operate as the core of that network. For the end user, the breadth of the United Airlines network is a critical product feature: if you’re loyal, you can get almost anywhere on the planet with a single carrier and its Star Alliance partners.

Digital layer: The app as cockpit

United Airlines has also been unusually serious about its digital layer. The United app is now central to the airline’s product identity. It offers real-time flight and rebooking options, baggage tracking, dynamic seat maps, same-day change tools, and even inflight entertainment control on some aircraft. While app quality alone doesn’t fix delays or cancellations, it does dramatically shape how passengers experience disruption—and how forgiving they’re likely to be afterward.

From mobile boarding passes and automatic standby clearing to upgrading at the gate with one tap, United is trying to position its digital experience as a differentiator in a market where flying can often feel like a black box.

Market Rivals: United Airlines Aktie vs. The Competition

United Airlines doesn’t operate in a vacuum. Its product choices reverberate through a brutally competitive market defined by razor-thin margins and fickle business travelers. The most direct rivals are Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, with their own distinct flagship products and strategies.

Delta Air Lines with Delta One and Delta Premium Select

Compared directly to Delta One, Delta’s long-haul business-class product, United Polaris is often seen as the more modern cabin on refitted aircraft, but Delta traditionally holds an edge on service consistency and soft product polish. Delta One’s suites on select aircraft include sliding doors, a feature United Airlines has not widely adopted, which appeals to privacy-obsessed premium travelers.

Delta’s Premium Select competes directly with United Premium Plus, offering a similar in-between cabin. Where Delta often shines is in operational reliability and on-time performance; a strong track record there makes its product feel less risky for corporate travel managers who care as much about punctuality as pillows.

American Airlines with Flagship Business and Premium Economy

Compared directly to American Airlines Flagship Business, United Polaris often wins on network breadth and lounge design but faces a mixed perception on consistency, since some United aircraft still lag behind the Polaris standard. American’s Flagship lounges and transcontinental business product remain competitive, but American has been less aggressive than United in announcing massive widebody orders or making long-haul expansion central to its identity.

Low-cost pressure from Southwest and international rivals

On domestic routes, the competitive heat comes from Southwest Airlines and ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Frontier. These aren’t full analogues to United Airlines’ flagship product, but they redefine pricing expectations. For many leisure travelers, a cheap fare and two free checked bags from Southwest beat seat-back screens and global connectivity.

Internationally, carriers like Qatar Airways Qsuite and Singapore Airlines Business Class set the premium benchmark. United Airlines can’t always match those gold-standard experiences seat for seat, but it doesn’t have to. Its true competitive field is the U.S. big three plus European majors like Lufthansa and British Airways. Within that peer group, United’s decision to invest heavily in widebodies, Polaris, and a dense long-haul schedule makes it one of the more ambitious players.

Strengths and weaknesses in the current rivalry

United Airlines’ strengths versus these rivals are clear: a vast international network, particularly across the Pacific; a coherent, widely deployed business-class brand in Polaris; and a serious commitment to aircraft modernization. On the other hand, Delta’s reputation for service reliability and American’s strong loyalty base in certain corporate-heavy markets keep the rivalry tight.

From an investor lens, all three carriers’ stocks trade as leveraged plays on global travel demand, but the United Airlines Aktie is uniquely tied to the success of its international and premium strategy. If global business and high-yield leisure travel remain strong, United’s product may give it a higher ceiling. If those segments soften, its heavy capex and complex network become a risk.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

So why does United Airlines have a credible claim to leadership in this space? The answer lies in how its product strategy lines up with where travel patterns are heading.

1. Premium-heavy cabins mapped to real demand

United Airlines isn’t just slapping lie-flat seats on every route and hoping for the best. It has focused Polaris and United Premium Plus on city pairs where high-yield demand is structurally strong: tech corridors, financial centers, political capitals, and emerging tourism hubs with premium leisure traffic. That alignment allows United to justify its investment with higher average fares and better cabin load factors.

While Delta and American are also expanding premium cabins, United’s emphasis on widebodies and long-haul connectivity gives it more room to monetize those seats. This is especially true on routes where U.S. corporates, global consultancies, and tech giants dominate the front of the plane.

2. A unified cabin and tech story

The combination of retrofitted narrowbodies, large overhead bins, seat-back screens, universal power, and a feature-rich app means the United Airlines product feels coherent across aircraft types. That doesn’t fully erase regional jet headaches or occasional equipment swaps, but it moves the airline closer to the kind of consistent brand experience you expect from top international carriers.

Crucially, United isn’t betting everything on in-flight bells and whistles alone. Its digital layer—real-time rebooking, proactive notifications, and self-service tools—tackles one of air travel’s ugliest pain points: being trapped in information limbo when something goes wrong.

3. Network synergy with Star Alliance

United Airlines belongs to Star Alliance, the largest global airline alliance. That means its product doesn’t stop at the edge of its own fleet. A Polaris ticket from a U.S. hub to Europe can connect seamlessly onto Lufthansa, Swiss, or SAS. A trip to Asia can flow onto ANA or Singapore Airlines. This alliance integration amplifies the perceived value of United’s product for frequent travelers and corporate buyers who need network coverage more than they need a favorite logo on the tail.

4. Sustainability and fleet modernization

United Airlines has also been vocal about sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) investments and carbon reduction goals. While every major airline is talking up sustainability, United’s early and frequent commitments have turned it into something of a category leader in the public conversation. For large corporate customers with ESG goals, that matters—especially when selecting preferred carriers for corporate contracts.

The more modern fleet under United Next isn’t just about passenger comfort; it’s a fuel burn and operating cost story. Newer aircraft typically mean lower emissions and better economics, which in theory support both sustainability targets and long-term profitability.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

The United Airlines Aktie, trading under the ISIN US9100471096, is closely intertwined with the fortunes of this evolving product strategy. As of the latest available market data pulled in real time, the stock reflects investors’ mixed but increasingly focused view on whether United’s premium and international bets will pay off.

Current stock snapshot

Based on recent data cross-checked from multiple financial platforms, including major market trackers, the United Airlines Aktie is trading in a range that reflects a recovery from pandemic-era lows but still discounts the airline relative to high-growth tech or consumer brands. The stock price and recent performance numbers are anchored to the last confirmed trading session rather than intraday speculation, underscoring how volatile airline equities can be around fuel prices, macroeconomic news, and travel demand headlines.

Because trading hours and quote availability can vary by exchange and time zone, the most reliable figure for analysis is the last close price available from those sources at the time of research. That closing quote serves as the baseline against which investors judge new capacity announcements, quarterly earnings, and any shocks to international travel demand.

How the product feeds the stock story

For investors, United Airlines is no longer just a volume play on domestic flying. The core thesis behind the United Airlines Aktie is that a premium-heavy, internationally skewed airline can generate higher revenue per available seat mile (RASM) and more resilient cash flow than a commodity carrier. The widespread rollout of Polaris, the growth of United Premium Plus, and the United Next fleet modernization program are all designed to support that thesis.

Premium seats drive outsized revenue contribution relative to their footprint on the aircraft. If United can keep those cabins full, especially on business-heavy routes, it can offset volatility in lower-yield economy cabins. Likewise, newer aircraft with better fuel efficiency and more seats per departure improve unit costs and margin potential. Both levers are directly linked to the perceived upside of United Airlines Aktie.

Risks and upside

The flip side is risk. Capital expenditures on new aircraft, cabin retrofits, lounges, and digital infrastructure are enormous. If global business travel underperforms, or if geopolitical shocks hit key long-haul markets, United Airlines could find itself with too much high-end capacity chasing too little premium demand. In that scenario, investors would likely punish the stock for overreaching.

But if international and premium leisure demand remain robust—and early post-pandemic patterns suggest these segments are structurally healthier than many expected—United Airlines’ product strategy offers real upside. A well-executed, premium-oriented, tech-enabled, globally networked airline has a better chance of convincing markets that airline stocks don’t have to be perpetual boom-and-bust trades.

Ultimately, the fate of United Airlines Aktie depends on more than quarterly earnings beats. It depends on whether travelers, especially those in the front of the cabin, decide that the United Airlines product has finally crossed the line from legacy necessity to deliberate choice. If they do, the airline’s massive investment in cabins, aircraft, and digital tools could turn one of America’s most complex airlines into one of its most compelling long-term aviation bets.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2404982_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-03 23:11:41.668964

Emerging markets are willing to invest in local solutions, like increased adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers and local car manufacturing.

Three CEOs share approaches specific to sustainable mobility in India, Brazil and Africa that are worth exploring to accelerate the green transition.

Road mobility accounts for about a quarter of global energy-related carbon emissions and is increasing, so its decarbonization is critical for global climate crisis mitigation. Cars account for the largest portion of increasing emissions sources globally, making the transition to zero tailpipe emissions attractive, especially to electric vehicles (EVs) in developed markets.

It is no wonder that major developed markets committed to the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicles and EV value chains investments. Luckily, despite the backdrop of supply chain disruptions, geopolitical shocks, and high commodity and energy prices, electric vehicles sales (hybrid and pure) exceeded 10 million last year, up 55% relative to 2021.

However, not all markets can electrify their car fleets at the pace the climate crisis warrants. For several emerging markets, car ownership continues to be quite low, but sales are growing. There is a need to look at mobility holistically in order to take a more nuanced and collaborative approach.

China, Europe and US dominate EV sales

China, Europe and the United States accounted for about 95% of global electric car sales in 2022. Emerging and developing economies outside China account for only a fraction of global EV markets.

In many key emerging and developing economies, transport remains largely based on smaller mobility solutions in urban centres, such as two- and three-wheelers, and shared mobility for regional commutes.

In 2021, electric two- and three- wheelers accounted for one million barrels of oil demand displacement per day – 66% of the overall oil demand displacement by EVs in the year, making electrification of this segment more globally significant than many imagine.

Even in large car markets in the emerging world, governments find it more attractive to invest in assembly and manufacturing of vehicles and parts in which they can have a long-lasting relative advantage.

The World Economic Forum asked three CEOs and senior executives for their views on the challenge. Here’s what they said:

‘Energy transition in many emerging markets driven by electric two-wheeler adoption’

Two-wheelers are the most important transport mode in several emerging markets across Asia and Africa, with India being the world’s largest two-wheeler market. The energy transition in mobility in many emerging markets, including India, is being led by electric two-wheeler adoption.

Led by electric two-wheelers sales, the accelerated pace of EV adoption in India industry volumes tripled in 2022, with growth continuing into 2023. This growth has been driven, in part, by the support extended in form of incentives from the Central and State governments in India.

The vision of accelerated EV adoption is being driven by the government and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are responding with investments in technology and building capacity to help realize this vision.

Apart from driving growth, during 2022-23, there were consistent policy and regulatory interventions by the government to ensure high quality and enhanced safety levels of electric two-wheelers for consumers.

This has led to the formalization of the industry, and the result is a product mix, that moved from low-quality, low-cost options, in favour of the offerings meeting quality and safety requirements.

The enhanced safety, localization and quality norms have a threefold impact. First, they enhance the quality of products received by the customers. Secondly, they aid the formalization of the sector, ensuring quality players. Thirdly, product quality is on par with global levels, enabling the industry to export overseas.

As for internal combustion engine two wheelers, in addition to India’s large domestic market, the country is also expected to emerge as a major hub for electric two-wheeler exports.

The heightened consumer interest in electric two-wheelers in India and across the emerging world, continues to be driven by the attractive total cost of operation and the technology proposition offer by EVs. This is made even more relevant with increasing fuel prices.

We expect the EV industry will grow rapidly as the consumer interest is buttressed with active policy support. Not only will electric two-wheelers provide low-cost mobility to millions in emerging markets, they will also be an important piece of the puzzle for clean cities, net-zero transport and energy security.

‘Tax incentives and stimulus schemes would accelerate decarbonization’

Daniel Randon, President, Randoncorp

The most challenging aspect for accelerating decarbonization of road transport in emerging markets is the lack of common understanding about local realities, which leads to two fundamental suggestions:

The creation of programmes to stimulate the development of new markets, in which companies are not present or where they are still not competitive enough.

The adoption of tax incentives to encourage local entrepreneurs to invest more aggressively in the development and transformation of products in this sustainable logic.

This would benefit not only the industrial chain, but also other chains such as infrastructure companies and associated services. Our experience in Brazil shows us that this is the most appropriate path.

This is not only because of Brazil's potential to lead the green economy, but also because of the level of adaptability that we can achieve, given the multiplicity of characteristics we have within the same country and the bureaucracy we still face.

Cars equipped with flex-fuel engines – which can run on both petrol and ethanol – have a strong presence in Brazil, for example. The potential for developing biofuels has also grown.

Another example is the electric auxiliary axle system that we developed at Randoncorp, together with partners and start-ups, which can reduce up to 25% of trucks' fossil fuel consumption. This solution also has the potential to be used in other heavy vehicles, such as buses or tractors.

This mechanism could have great application in South America and Africa, or even in countries in Central Asia, due to the very different relief conditions and poor infrastructure conditions, which may enable more intensive use of the auxiliary axle, thereby reducing other consumption harmful to nature.

This is just one of the technologies we created. We have also invested a lot in the design of automotive parts with lighter materials, such as composites, and with the application of niobium on a nanometric scale – a technology with an exclusive patent that improves the properties of countless materials, from paints to casting parts, among others.

‘2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry’

Dave Coffey, CEO, African Association of Automotive Manufacturers (AAAM)

Africa’s automotive sector is well poised for industrialization and growth. 2023 is a year of step change for the African automotive industry, with five hub countries – Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Egypt and Kenya –either implementing progressive automotive policies or due to approve and implement such policies.

Other African countries are exploring their competitive advantage. Up to now, only Morocco and South Africa have successfully and competitively industrialized their automotive industries with production volumes of around one million vehicles.

There is an understanding that not every country can assemble a vehicle – hub countries will assemble vehicles with neighbouring economies sharing in the value chain determined by their competitive and sustainable advantage – and much work is taking place on the ground to explore and develop value chains with regional collaboration key to driving scale.

The annual importation of 3 million to 5 million used cars into Africa, is an unregulated environment with many cars being unroadworthy and with outdated emission standards. A used vehicle ecosystem is key for affordable mobility, but the source will transition to vehicles assembled in Africa which will comply with minimum standards.

How is the World Economic Forum promoting sustainable and inclusive mobility systems?

The World Economic Forum’s Platform for Shaping the Future of Mobility works across four industries: aerospace and drones; automotive and new mobility; aviation travel and tourism; and supply chain and transport. It aims to ensure that the future of mobility is safe, clean, and inclusive.

Through the Clean Skies for Tomorrow Coalition, more than 100 companies are working together to power global aviation with 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030.

In collaboration with UNICEF, the Forum developed a charter with leading shipping, airlines and logistics to support COVAX in delivering more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to vulnerable communities worldwide.

The Road Freight Zero Project and P4G-Getting to Zero Coalition have led to outcomes demonstrating the rationale, costs and opportunities for accelerating the transition to zero emission freight.

The Medicine from the Sky initiative is using drones to deliver vaccines and medicine to remote areas in India, completing over 300 successful trials.

The Forum’s Target True Zero initiative is working to accelerate the deployment and scaling of zero emission aviation, leveraging electric and hydrogen flight technologies.

In collaboration with the City of Los Angeles, Federal Aviation Administration, and NASA, the Forum developed the Principles of the Urban Sky to help adopt Urban Air Mobility in cities worldwide.

The Forum led the development of the Space Sustainability Rating to incentivize and promote a more safe and sustainable approach to space mission management and debris mitigation in orbit.

The Circular Cars Initiative is informing the automotive circularity policy agenda, following the endorsement from European Commission and Zero Emission Vehicle Transition Council countries, and is now invited to support China’s policy roadmap.

The Moving India network is working with policymakers to advance electric vehicle manufacturing policies, ignite adoption of zero emission road freight vehicles, and finance the transition.

The Urban Mobility Scorecards initiative – led by the Forum’s Global New Mobility Coalition – is bringing together mobility operators and cities to benchmark the transition to sustainable urban mobility systems.

Contact us for more information on how to get involved.

The transition to new energy vehicles will depend on affordability and differ across mobility segments, with two- and three-wheelers setting the pace along with public transport in major cities.

Regulating the condition of imported used vehicles into Africa will also play a significant role in initially reducing carbon emissions. Effectively industrializing and growing the auto sector whilst providing affordable mobility is a huge employment opportunity for the continent.",https://assets.weforum.org/article/image/responsive_large_HY0pJoVS5qsYe3czvT9t3DV9jgutu8jwjuOzq8YtpWA.JPG,N,,2026-01-03 15:11:40.440170
