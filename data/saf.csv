As the year winds down, we humans typically reflect on what went well and not-so-well over the previous twelve months. A question that business leaders must consider today is, “How accountable are leaders and team members for delivering both results and respect?”

Over the past 35 years, our research reveals that accountability for results (performance expectations) in organizations around the globe is wildly inconsistent. Contributing factors typically include:

Poorly defined or a lack of specific expectations

Team members don’t have the skills, training, or tools required to meet expectations

Little to no regular monitoring or check-ins

Leaders don’t know how to coach team members to consistently meet expectations

Accountability for respect (values, expectations) varies as well, from inconsistent to completely absent. The factors driving this reality often include:

Poorly defined or a lack of observable, tangible and measurable valued behaviors

Little to no measurement of values alignment of leaders by their direct reports

Leaders don’t have the skills, training or tools to effectively coach for values alignment

Leaders tolerate toxic behaviors (by leaders and team members), which encourages demeaning treatment

Our accountability model puts the initial responsibility for holding people accountable for results and respect on the shoulders of formal leaders. We coach leaders in five accountability practices: model, celebrate, measure, coach and mentor. Building skills in these practices improves demonstrated respect and delivered results.

Over time, if team members see their leaders holding others accountable, frontline staff proactively engage in accountability conversations with their peers.

The WD40 Company accelerated this process, with remarkable impact. Garry Ridge and the company leaders decided to help every tribe member take initiative, ask questions, make decisions and share information proactively. How? Through a commitment to the “Maniac Pledge.”

“I am responsible for taking action, asking questions, getting answers and making decisions. I won’t wait for someone to tell me. If I need to know, I’m responsible for asking. I have no right to be offended that I didn’t ‘get this sooner.’ If I’m doing something others should know about, I’m responsible for telling them.”

Embedding the Maniac Pledge into daily operations and interactions shifted the responsibility from leaders driving accountability for results and respect to every leader and tribe member driving accountability themselves.

The impact on respect and results is impressive. Engagement is consistently at 90%+, along with record net sales and exceeding targets in gross margin and net income growth.

As SAF production capacity expands slowly, long-term agreements and supportive policies will be vital to growing the market.","On December 16, 2025, DHL Express confirmed a new fuel agreement. The company signed a binding offtake contract with the renewable fuels producer Neste. Under this deal, DHL will receive 50 million liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for deliveries in 2026.

The fuel will be used in DHL’s air cargo flights to help reduce carbon emissions. This deal is one of the first under the tightened ReFuelEU Aviation rules, which increase SAF requirements at European airports starting in 2026.

DHL moved early to lock in supply. The company expects SAF prices to rise once the new rules begin in January. Securing supply now helps DHL manage future costs and ensure fuel availability as demand grows.

ReFuelEU Aviation: Redrawing the Fuel Mix

The ReFuelEU Aviation regulation is part of the European Union’s plan to cut aviation emissions. The regulation sets minimum shares of SAF that fuel suppliers must deliver at EU airports. These required shares increase each year. The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from flights over time.

In 2025, fuel suppliers must blend about 2% SAF into jet fuel at EU airports. This percentage increases to 6% by 2030 under the regulation. Rules will continue rising toward 70% by 2050. Aircraft operators that fail to meet these requirements may face penalties.

These mandates follow global climate goals, including the aviation industry’s pledge to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF is central to these plans because it can cut lifecycle CO₂ emissions compared with traditional jet fuel.

However, SAF remains more costly and less widely produced than conventional jet fuel. That has raised concerns about supply, prices, and the ability of airlines and cargo carriers to meet future mandates.

The EU aims to help address this by revealing a $108 billion investment plan to help decarbonize the sector. The funding will help ramp up the production and use of cleaner fuels like SAF for aviation and maritime.

Why DHL’s SAF Contract Matters? Net Zero Goals and Emissions Reduction Progress

DHL’s contract with Neste covers 50 million liters of SAF for delivery in 2026. The fuel will help power part of DHL’s air cargo flights in Europe. Neste will supply SAF made from renewable waste and residue materials. These feedstocks reduce lifecycle emissions compared with fossil fuels.

This agreement puts DHL among the early adopters of SAF under the new EU rule changes. It shows the growing role of long-term fuel contracts in securing carbon-reducing fuels. These contracts also help SAF producers plan and finance future production capacity.

Deals like DHL’s offer two key benefits:

Price certainty: Buyers secure fuel at a set price before markets tighten and costs rise.

Supply assurance: Long-term contracts guarantee volumes when the total SAF supply is limited.

For logistic operators like DHL, these benefits help manage operational costs and regulatory compliance. Beyond these is the environmental benefit for the logistics company.

DHL Group has committed to reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 across all its logistics operations. This target aligns with global climate goals and covers air, road, and supply chain activities.

To stay on track, DHL has set clear interim goals and actions:

Cut total emissions to below 29 million metric tons of CO₂e by 2030, down from about 40 million metric tons.

Increase the use of sustainable fuels, including SAF, across air freight operations.

Source over 30 percent of transport fuels from sustainable alternatives by 2030.

Electrify more than 66% of last-mile delivery vehicles used for parcel delivery.

Improve fuel efficiency through better flight planning, routing, and load optimization.

Work with fuel suppliers and partners to secure long-term SAF supply contracts.

DHL has already begun using SAF on selected air routes and has signed multiple long-term fuel agreements, including this recent one with Neste. These steps help reduce emissions now while preparing for tighter climate rules in the coming years.

Inside the Global SAF Supply Crunch

The SAF market is still small compared with overall aviation fuel demand. Current production is limited but growing. In 2023, global SAF output climbed to around 600 million liters—about double the 300 million liters produced in 2022.

Total SAF in 2024 reached about 1.3 billion liters (nearly 1 million tonnes) worldwide. Even with this growth, SAF accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel use in 2024.

Despite these gains, production remains far below what is needed to meet future emissions targets. According to industry forecasts, global SAF output could grow sixteen-fold by 2030 to roughly 6.1–8.2 billion gallons per year (about 23–31 billion liters). Other reports estimate SAF production near 10 billion liters by 2030.

Even with this expansion, SAF would still represent a small share of total aviation fuel demand unless growth accelerates well beyond these projections.

In addition to volume limits, SAF supply faces other challenges:

High costs: SAF currently costs two to five times more than conventional jet fuel in many markets.

Feedstock limits: SAF feedstocks, such as used cooking oil and agricultural residues, are in demand from other industries, which limits scaling potential.

Infrastructure gaps: Distribution and blending facilities are still being built in many regions.

Because of these limits, SAF supply is expected to stay tight relative to demand through at least the late 2020s.

Growth Forecasts Meet Real-World Constraints

Despite challenges, the SAF market is forecast to grow strongly as policy mandates and corporate commitments expand.

Market analysts project the global SAF market value at around US$2.06–2.08 billion in 2025. By 2030, the industry could reach US$25–26 billion. This implies a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) above 60 percent through the late 2020s.

In terms of production volume, analysts expect large increases, with forecasts ranging from several billion gallons per year by 2030. The expansion reflects rising demand due to regulatory pressure, corporate sustainability goals, and growing aviation activity.

By 2050, much larger SAF volumes may be necessary. One global industry assessment suggests the aviation sector may need around 500 million tonnes of SAF by 2050 to achieve net-zero emissions.

Currently, global SAF production is only about 2 million tonnes and represents less than 1 percent of total aviation fuel consumption. Bridging the gap will require dramatic increases in production capacity and feedstock supply over the next 25 years.

What This Signals for Aviation’s Low-Carbon Shift

DHL’s 50 million-liter SAF agreement with Neste highlights several key trends in aviation fuel markets:

Early action: Fuel buyers are signing long-term contracts ahead of tighter regulations.

Supply competition: With limited SAF output, early offtake deals secure fuel before wider market tightening.

Growing corporate role: Logistics firms and airlines are increasingly active buyers of SAF.

Market scale-up: SAF volumes are rising, but still far short of future demand needs.

DHL’s contract is not an isolated case. Large buyers around the world are seeking stable SAF supply to meet regulatory targets and sustainability goals. As SAF production capacity expands slowly, long-term agreements and supportive policies will be vital to growing the market.

The company’s early move shows how policy changes are shaping business decisions today rather than in the distant future. In this environment, SAF is no longer a niche fuel. It is becoming a necessary part of the future aviation fuel supply.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/shutterstock_2624719791.jpg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:05.342185

But the message from the senior US official was clear: after almost two decades of estrangement between Washington and socialist governments in Bolivia, a new political, commercial and diplomatic era had begun.
Having campaigned with promises of “capitalism for all”, Paz has said this new era is “going to open Bolivia to the world and the world to Bolivia”.
But this “opening up”, combined with shifting geopolitics in the region, have left some observers fearful that environmental protections could be loosened in pursuit of economic development.
According to data collected by Gandarillas, between 2010 and 2019, Bolivia signed 38 bilateral agreements with China.","On the night of 19 October, Rodrigo Paz was celebrating his victory in the second-round runoff of the Bolivian elections when he received a call. Christopher Landau, the United States deputy secretary of state, representing Donald Trump’s government, had called to congratulate the new president.

Paz himself drew attention to this communication during his first public appearance, after the announcement of a win for his centre-right Christian Democratic Party, with 54% of the votes, over Jorge “Tuto” Quiroga’s Libre alliance.

That night, several world leaders and heads of state contacted Paz. But the message from the senior US official was clear: after almost two decades of estrangement between Washington and socialist governments in Bolivia, a new political, commercial and diplomatic era had begun.

The new president said this would be “a close relationship”. In the weeks before taking office on 8 November, Paz made a visit to the United States in search of support to resolve an economic and energy crisis that has gripped Bolivia since early 2023. Upon returning from his trip, he told Bolivian business leaders that his team had “already secured the dollars, petrol and diesel that we so desperately need”.

Washington has seen the change of government as an opportunity to rebuild diplomatic ties that had been strained since 2008, when then-president Evo Morales declared former US ambassador Philip Goldberg persona non grata, accusing him of leading the “division of Bolivia”. In a statement from the US Embassy on 20 October, secretary of state Marco Rubio said that his country “is ready to partner with Bolivia on shared priorities”.

On the other side of global geopolitics, China – Bolivia’s main trading partner during the leftist governments of Evo Morales (2006-2019) and Luis Arce (2021-2025) – also congratulated Paz, days after the election results were announced. On Friday, 24 October, Chinese leader Xi Jinping sent a message to the president, in which he said that since the establishment of their diplomatic relations 40 years ago, bilateral ties “have maintained good momentum for development”.

Parsifal D’Sola, director of the Andrés Bello Foundation, which studies relations between China and Latin America, said he was sure a call with Chinese officials would also have taken place on the night of Paz’s victory. “I have no proof, but I have no doubt that one of the first calls received by the new government was from China, precisely to initiate a new conversation, develop a new relationship, and find out exactly what the positions are,” he told Dialogue Earth.

Paz has taken office in a context of deep economic crisis, reflected in a 2.4% fall in GDP in the first half of 2025, and on 17 December declared the country to be in an “economic emergency”. The new president is seeking to move beyond the long-standing socialist ideology that has governed Bolivia, pursue international support, and set a new direction for his government. Having campaigned with promises of “capitalism for all”, Paz has said this new era is “going to open Bolivia to the world and the world to Bolivia”.

But this “opening up”, combined with shifting geopolitics in the region, have left some observers fearful that environmental protections could be loosened in pursuit of economic development.

“We are in a very complex economic situation, the result of economic decisions taken over the last decade,” said Óscar Campanini, a sociologist specialising in environment and development, and director of the Bolivian Centre for Documentation and Information (Cedib), an NGO. “In this context it is possible that environmental and social requirements could be relaxed, under the pretext of facilitating foreign investment.”

Bolivia in the spotlight

Bolivia and China have had diplomatic relations since 1985. In 2006, with the arrival to power of Evo Morales and his Movement for Socialism, those ties began to grow from simple exchanges of ambassadors and helped contribute to making China, today, Bolivia’s main trading partner.

“From 2010 onwards, it is clear that investments involving Chinese cooperation intensified,” said Marco Gandarillas, a senior researcher at the environmental organisation Latinoamérica Sustentable (LAS). China is Bolivia’s main bilateral creditor, with loans mainly for infrastructure. In addition, its companies – state-owned, private and mixed – have become the main contractors for road works. Gandarillas, who is soon to publish a report focused on Chinese investments in the country, told Dialogue Earth that according to his calculations, more than 1,466 kilometres of roads and bridges have been built by Chinese companies in the Bolivian Amazon alone. He said that these are key to connecting rivers, which also serve as important routes for transit and trade in these often remote regions.

According to data collected by Gandarillas, between 2010 and 2019, Bolivia signed 38 bilateral agreements with China. Citing research on economic cooperation agreements and national ratification laws, he counts 16 Chinese loans totalling over USD 2 billion and during that period; other sources tracking Chinese overseas finance have put this figure even higher, at over USD 3 billion. Alongside significant support for a planned hydroelectric dam and a vast steel project, much of this financing went towards three major road infrastructure projects: the Rurrenabaque–Riberalta highway, the El Sillar dual carriageway and the Espino–Charagua–Boyuibe highway.

The latest data available on the official website of the Central Bank of Bolivia refers to a debt with China of USD 1.37 billion as of June 2024.

Ning Leng, a professor of political science at Georgetown University whose research has focused on China and its overseas finance, told Dialogue Earth that China has three key interests in Bolivia: minerals such as lithium; agriculture, especially soybeans; and infrastructure, which is the area where it has had the greatest impact.

Analysts agree that the arrival of a new government, far from generating suspicion in China due to economic and geopolitical rivalry with the United States, is an opportunity to reaffirm ties.

“The pragmatic approach that Beijing has adopted with centre-right or right-wing leaders – Bolsonaro in Brazil, or Milei in Argentina – is an example of how China can adapt to political changes in the region without affecting or compromising its foreign policy objectives,” said Carlos Piña, a political scientist specialising in China-Latin America relations.

In the case of Argentina, Javier Milei recently received new financial support from the Trump administration, amounting to USD 20 billion, without this interfering with previous projects and initiatives that his left-wing predecessors, Cristina Fernández and Alberto Fernández, had established with China.

The same thing happened with Brazil. At present, relations between China and President Luiz Inácio Lula Da Silva are “comprehensively strategic”, researcher Gandarillas said, but he added that they had also largely been so when the far-right Jair Bolsonaro was in power from 2019 to 2022.

In Bolivia, the letter sent by Chinese leader Xi Jinping to his counterpart Rodrigo Paz indicated a similar consistency, and goes further, offering to take the China-Bolivia strategic partnership “to a new level” of “comprehensive strategic”, an official designation in Chinese diplomacy. This is the level of relations China has determined with other South American countries, including Brazil and Venezuela, explained Gandarillas.

From necessity to environmental flexibility

Construction projects led by Chinese companies in Bolivia, and across Latin America, in recent decades have often met with environmental and social concerns, although in 2024 China accepted a number of recommendations from the UN Human Rights Council in relation to its overseas investments, including to consider more robust legislation incorporating the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.

Analysts such as Campanini of Cedib and Gandarillas from Latinoamerica Sustentable are concerned that the new Bolivian government has so far shown a great imbalance between its emphasis on economic and environmental issues. “In the name of saving the crisis, we will end up raffling off or sacrificing areas, ecosystems and communities that subsist on very valuable resources,” said Campanini.

Indigenous peoples of the Bolivian Amazon and civil society organisations have voiced similar concerns, particularly following the recent dissolution of the Ministry of the Environment, which has been merged into a unified Ministry of Development Planning and the Environment. Furthermore, the appointment of agro-industrial businessman José Fernando Romero Pinto as minister for the new department prompted the Block of Peasant and Indigenous Organisations of the Northern Amazon of Bolivia (Bocinab) to declare a “state of alert”, further describing their concern on the changes to the environment ministry, and around a reported “strengthening of the Ministry of Mining and Metallurgy”.

Speaking to Dialogue Earth, Bocinab founder Luis Rojas Mogrovejo said they would not allow further mining activity in their territories, which have already been affected by mercury pollution. At a time when the new government is seen to be organising itself to try to lift the country’s economy, Jenny Duri, president of the Yaminahua-Machineri Indigenous Peasant Territory, told Dialogue Earth that “mining in our territory is a danger”.

The Paz administration has rejected initial criticisms around its environmental prospects, emphasising that it sees development and environment as complimentary rather than opposing forces, and pitching its ministry reshuffle as breaking down a disconnect between conservation and production.

In an interview with Dialogue Earth, Jorge Ávila, vice-minister of environment, biodiversity, climate change and forest management and development, said that Bolivia “is not in a position to abandon development, because the country is bankrupt, which doesn’t mean we’re going to disregard the environmental aspect”.

An attorney with experience in environmental, forestry and public policy issues, Ávila argued that Bolivia needs to abandon an approach that sees certain sectors forced to comply with environmental regulations “as if it were a punishment”. On the contrary, “we have to persuade and demonstrate that by doing things right from an environmental perspective, we are creating better conditions for development in our country”.",https://dialogue.earth/content/uploads/2025/12/A-shepherd-looks-after-her-sheep-in-the-Bolivian-highlands_Arianna-Rosso_Flickr_fae992032a_cropped-1200px-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:17.015310

The company says this is the country’s largest and most advanced private eVTOL of its kind.

The Bengaluru-based startup developed the Sylla SYL-X1 in just about nine months, with significantly lower capital outlay compared to most global eVTOL programmes. The company has begun ground testing, marking the key transition from virtual development and laboratory-scale work to its core validation phase. It is using the half-scale prototype to assess the structural behaviour, the integration of the propulsion system, and the overall safety system.

In a brief conversation with electrive.com about the new phase of development, Sarla Aviation stated that the Sylla SYL-X1 is fully electric, but the production version will have a hybrid system to enable longer-range operations. The company plans to carry forward the name of the concept it unveiled at this year’s Bharat Mobility Expo, ’Shunya,’ with a suffix for the 15-metre full-scale aircraft. Sarla Aviation had a little over ten people working on engineering and conceptualisation nine months ago, and now, it has a team of nearly 70 engineers.

It has raised $13 million dollars (approximately €11 million euros) to date to support its first air taxi project. Adrian Schmidt, the company’s co-founder and CEO, previously worked in design roles at prominent carmakers like Mercedes-Benz, Nio, and Volkswagen, as well as German air taxi startup Lilium. Rakesh Gaonkar, the co-founder and CTO of Sarla Aviation, holds a much stronger background in automotive design, having worked at GM, Italdesign, Mahindra & Mahindra, Citroën, Audi, Nio, and BMW, as well as Lilium.

Commenting on the commencement of ground testing, Gaonkar said: “This milestone reflects what’s possible when globally experienced Indian engineering teams build with rigour, patience, and world-class standards. Our focus has never been on being first, but on building to last — on creating an aviation giant.”

Earlier this month, Sarla Aviation signed an MoU with Goa, a popular tourist state along India’s west coast, to jointly evaluate deploying air taxis across the state. If the plan succeeds, this could make Goa India’s first Coastal Aerial Mobility State. Last month, the company signed an MoU with its home state, Karnataka, to explore the launch of its air taxi from airports and city centres to the flagship properties of Jungle Lodges & Resorts, a state-owned wildlife and eco-tourism company.

The Shunya concept Sarla Aviation introduced in January is a six-seat hybrid electric air taxi powered by seven electric motors that can provide speeds of up to 250 km/h.Two battery packs can help it fly up to 150 kilometres, and a SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) tank can extend the range to up to 800 kilometres. The company will build the production version at a new factory in Thimmasamudram, a village in Andhra Pradesh, a neighbouring state of Karnataka.",https://www.electrive.com/media/2025/12/sarla-aviation-sylla-syl-x1-cropped.jpeg,N,,2025-12-23 10:12:23.586991

The Freight Partner That Shapes Your Next Growth Stage

Picking a freight forwarder is not just a logistics decision. It is a decision about reliability, cash flow, customer trust, and how confidently you can expand into new markets. The five companies in this list succeed for different reasons. Some win on global scale and carrier access, some win on deep industry specialization, and some win on technology that makes complex shipping feel manageable.

What stands out in 2026 is how quickly expectations are changing. Businesses now want instant quoting, clear documentation, real time visibility, and support that does not disappear outside office hours. They also want options that reduce waste and emissions as sustainability standards tighten across supply chains.

Through her work on SAF emissions, she highlights the importance of including occupational health considerations in national and international aviation sustainability agendas.
The findings from her study are expected to contribute to ongoing discussions by research boards, regulatory agencies, and technical committees working toward safer and cleaner aviation systems.","In recent years, the global aviation sector has faced mounting pressure to reduce its environmental footprint while safeguarding the health of the workers who support its operations. Against this backdrop, Onyinye Ezeifeka, a Nigerian doctoral researcher specializing in industrial hygiene and air quality assessment at the University of Cincinnati, USA, has emerged as one of the early-career scientists investigating how the transition to Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAFs) could shape occupational exposures in aviation environments.

Her research focuses on understanding turbine engine emissions produced when SAFs and SAF–jet fuel blends are combusted, and how these emissions may influence human health outcomes among aviation personnel. The work is part of a broader scientific effort to evaluate whether SAFs, widely promoted for their ability to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, also lead to measurable improvements in near-field air quality for workers such as aircraft mechanics, ground crew, and fuel handlers.

Ezeifeka’s project integrates aerosol science, occupational exposure assessment, and combustion chemistry. Working within the University of Cincinnati’s Safe Air Lab, she examines particle size distributions, organic pollutant composition, and toxicological profiles of emissions generated from controlled turbine engine combustion scenarios using laboratory-grade SAF samples. Her team employs advanced aerosol measurement tools, including the Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS), Optical Particle Sizer (OPS), and other real-time monitoring instruments, to characterize nanoparticulates and volatile organic compounds formed during SAF combustion.

The study is one of the emerging efforts in the United States to link aviation decarbonization strategies with worker health. While international regulatory bodies have emphasized lifecycle carbon reduction metrics, far less attention has been given to the potential occupational implications of fuel transitions. Ezeifeka’s work aims to fill this gap by producing data that aviation authorities, airport operators, aircraft manufacturers, and occupational health agencies can use to guide evidence- based decisions regarding SAF deployment.

Her interest in the topic reflects a broader scientific trajectory rooted in environmental health and exposure science. Building on her earlier training in soil science and environmental contamination, she brings an interdisciplinary lens that connects emissions behavior with real-world exposure pathways. Colleagues describe her research approach as structured, methodical, and guided by a strong commitment to worker safety.

The project also positions her as part of a growing network of African researchers contributing meaningfully to global environmental and technological transitions. Through her work on SAF emissions, she highlights the importance of including occupational health considerations in national and international aviation sustainability agendas.

As airlines worldwide intensify efforts to achieve ambitious decarbonization targets, the sector confronts significant obstacles. In particular, fragmented and costly government policies—especially across Europe—have hindered SAF production and escalated costs. Industry leaders warn that these regulatory complexities threaten to undermine the aviation sector’s capacity to scale SAF usage, jeopardizing progress toward net-zero emissions by 2050.

Challenges in SAF Production and Distribution

FlyORO, a Singapore-based technology company, is at the forefront of addressing these challenges by developing novel approaches to SAF distribution. The firm’s patented modular blending units can be deployed flexibly from production sites to airports, facilitating a more distributed and responsive delivery network. McLoughlin underscores that while much of the industry’s focus remains on SAF production, significant difficulties persist downstream in the supply chain. Without localized and adaptable solutions, he cautions, the sector risks creating disparities between airports—some gaining access to SAF while others are left behind.

The global SAF landscape remains uneven. Europe continues to struggle with policy fragmentation, impeding cohesive growth. In contrast, Asia currently stands as the only region experiencing tangible expansion in SAF capacity. Australia, despite recent momentum in its SAF transition, still lacks the structural certainty, coordinated government support, and clear investment signals necessary to establish a sustainable domestic industry. Aviation leaders in Australia emphasize that without these foundational elements, the country will face considerable challenges in building a viable SAF supply chain.

Emerging Pressures and Solutions

Compounding these issues is the rapid growth of artificial intelligence technologies, whose soaring energy demands increasingly compete for the same renewable energy resources required for SAF production. This competition poses a further risk to airlines’ sustainability ambitions.

In response to these complexities, demand is rising for SAF certificates and greater flexibility in accounting for Scope 3 emissions. McLoughlin highlights the critical role of robust traceability and the “book-and-claim” system, which enables airlines to claim environmental benefits from SAF even when physical delivery is not feasible. He argues that this mechanism is essential for scaling SAF demand and maintaining credibility, as it complements physical deployment with transparent and accountable tracking.

While experts acknowledge that the aviation industry is unlikely to meet its 2030 targets for sustainable fuel adoption, innovations such as FlyORO’s modular blending technology and an emphasis on traceable, flexible supply chains offer promising avenues.

(NYSE: LUCK).
Formerly known as Bowlero Corp before its late 2024 rebranding, Lucky Strike has been a poster child for the location-based entertainment trend.
The sell-off comes as Lucky Strike shares have struggled, trading down approximately 13% year-over-year at $9.02, despite reporting double-digit revenue growth.
In the entertainment space, the reduction in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) reflects a broader skepticism toward ""high-touch"" brick-and-mortar businesses.
What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Hurdles Looking ahead, both Calumet and Lucky Strike face critical junctures in 2026.","In a series of strategic maneuvers that have caught the attention of mid-cap investors, Alta Fundamental Advisers has significantly reshaped its portfolio as of late 2025. The New York-based hedge fund, known for its deep-value approach and focus on special situations, has completely liquidated its position in Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT) and slashed its stake in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) by nearly half. These moves, revealed in recent regulatory filings and market data, suggest a growing caution regarding capital-intensive businesses grappling with high leverage and shifting consumer or regulatory landscapes.

The timing of these exits is particularly noteworthy as the market enters the final weeks of 2025. While the broader indices have shown resilience, Alta’s decision to pull back from these specific names highlights a divergence in sentiment between high-growth narratives and the harsh reality of balance sheet constraints. For Calumet, the exit marks the end of a long-standing institutional relationship, while the reduction in Lucky Strike signals a re-evaluation of the ""experiential economy"" that dominated post-pandemic investment themes.

A Strategic Liquidation: The Numbers Behind the Moves

According to SEC filings released in November 2025 and subsequent market activity through December 22, 2025, Alta Fundamental Advisers executed a total exit from Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT). The fund sold its remaining 459,937 shares, a position previously valued at approximately $7.25 million. This liquidation follows a period of significant transition for Calumet, which shifted from a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) to a C-Corporation in mid-2024. Despite the company’s efforts to attract a wider institutional base through this conversion and its aggressive push into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) via its Montana Renewables subsidiary, Alta appears to have lost patience with the company's persistent debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which hovered near 9x earlier in the year.

Simultaneously, Alta turned its attention to the entertainment sector, specifically Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK). Formerly known as Bowlero Corp before its late 2024 rebranding, Lucky Strike has been a poster child for the location-based entertainment trend. However, Alta reduced its exposure by selling nearly 1.1 million shares, a move valued at roughly $8.73 million. While the fund still retains a 4.78% stake in the company—down from over 10% earlier in the year—the reduction is a clear signal of cooling enthusiasm. The sell-off comes as Lucky Strike shares have struggled, trading down approximately 13% year-over-year at $9.02, despite reporting double-digit revenue growth.

The timeline of these events suggests a calculated year-end rebalancing. The bulk of the selling occurred during the third quarter of 2025, with the final tranches of the Calumet position cleared by late October. Market observers note that Alta’s primary focus has shifted toward more stable cash-flow generators, such as Gannett Co., Inc. (NYSE: GCI), which remains the fund's largest holding, accounting for over 20% of its total assets under management.

Winners and Losers in the Wake of Alta’s Exit

The immediate losers of this institutional retreat are undoubtedly the target companies themselves. For Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT), the loss of a fundamental-oriented backer like Alta could pressure the stock price in the short term, especially as the company seeks to finalize crucial Department of Energy (DOE) loans for its renewable projects. The exit may signal to other institutional players that the ""turnaround story"" for Calumet is taking longer than anticipated, potentially leading to a ""show me"" period where the stock remains range-bound until debt levels are meaningfully addressed.

On the other hand, larger, more liquid energy competitors like Valero Energy Corp. (NYSE: VLO) or Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) may emerge as winners. As funds like Alta rotate out of high-leverage specialty refiners, they often seek refuge in blue-chip energy names with stronger balance sheets and more diversified revenue streams. These ""refining giants"" are better positioned to weather the volatility in crack spreads and the capital requirements of the energy transition, making them attractive alternatives for investors still wanting energy exposure without the idiosyncratic risks of a mid-cap player like Calumet.

In the entertainment space, the reduction in Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) reflects a broader skepticism toward ""high-touch"" brick-and-mortar businesses. While Lucky Strike has successfully integrated acquisitions like Boomers and various water parks, its net losses—driven by high interest expenses—have become a liability in a ""higher-for-longer"" interest rate environment. Winners in this sector are likely to be digital-first entertainment platforms or lean operators with minimal physical overhead, such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX), which continue to capture discretionary spending without the burden of maintaining massive physical footprints.

Broader Significance: Energy Security and the Experiential Squeeze

Alta’s moves fit into a larger narrative defining the 2025 market: the collision of ambitious growth projects with fiscal reality. In the energy sector, the focus has shifted from pure ""green energy"" hype back to energy security and affordability. While Calumet’s Montana Renewables project is strategically aligned with the global push for SAF, the capital intensity of such projects is immense. As of December 2025, U.S. natural gas prices have spiked toward $4.30/MMBtu, increasing operational costs for refiners. Alta’s exit suggests that for some investors, the regulatory and operational risks of the energy transition no longer justify the wait for a deleveraging event.

In the entertainment sector, the ""experiential squeeze"" is becoming evident. Throughout 2024 and early 2025, consumers prioritized experiences over goods, benefiting companies like Lucky Strike. However, by late 2025, the cumulative effect of inflation and high borrowing costs has begun to weigh on discretionary spending. Lucky Strike’s model, which relies on continuous expansion and high operating leverage, is particularly vulnerable when consumer foot traffic slows or interest rates remain elevated. This mirror's historical precedents where over-leveraged roll-up strategies in the leisure sector faced significant headwinds during economic cooling periods.

Furthermore, these trades highlight a shift in institutional sentiment toward ""specialty"" plays. In a market where the S&P 500 has been dominated by a handful of tech giants, mid-cap specialty companies must prove their profitability more aggressively than ever. The ""growth at any cost"" mentality has been replaced by a ""cash flow at all costs"" requirement, leaving companies like Calumet and Lucky Strike in a precarious position as they navigate their respective growth phases.

What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Hurdles

Looking ahead, both Calumet and Lucky Strike face critical junctures in 2026. For Calumet, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLMT), the priority must be debt reduction and the successful scaling of Montana Renewables. If the company can secure its pending DOE loan and demonstrate consistent profitability in its SAF segment, it may be able to win back institutional confidence. However, any further delays in its renewable timeline or a downturn in specialty chemical margins could force the company into more drastic measures, such as asset sales or equity raises, which would be dilutive to remaining shareholders.

Lucky Strike Entertainment Corp. (NYSE: LUCK) is likely to pivot toward an ""optimization phase,"" slowing its aggressive acquisition pace to focus on internal efficiencies and debt servicing. The market will be watching its upcoming quarterly reports closely for signs of margin expansion. If the company can prove that its diversified portfolio of bowling alleys and amusement parks can generate consistent net income despite high interest costs, it may see a valuation recovery. Conversely, if losses continue to widen, the stock could face further institutional selling, potentially making it a target for private equity firms looking to take the brand private and restructure its debt away from the public eye.

In the short term, expect increased volatility for both tickers as the market digests the loss of a significant fundamental holder. Investors should watch for ""insider buying"" as a potential signal of confidence from management, or conversely, any further 13F filings from other hedge funds that might be following Alta’s lead out the door.

Summary and Investor Outlook

The exit of Alta Fundamental Advisers from Calumet and its reduction in Lucky Strike serves as a stark reminder of the risks inherent in mid-cap, high-leverage investments. The key takeaways for investors are clear: balance sheet health is paramount in 2025, and even the most promising growth stories—whether in renewable energy or experiential entertainment—can be derailed by the cost of capital. Alta’s rotation suggests a preference for more stable, cash-generating assets as the market navigates a complex macroeconomic environment.

Moving forward, the market for energy and entertainment will likely remain bifurcated. Companies with the scale and liquidity to self-fund their growth will thrive, while those reliant on debt markets will face continuous scrutiny. For Calumet, the path to redemption lies in its renewable execution; for Lucky Strike, it lies in proving that its ""location-based"" empire can be as profitable as it is popular. Investors should remain vigilant, monitoring debt levels and interest coverage ratios as the primary indicators of health for these specialty plays in the coming months.

The upgrade applies to one of four daily services and will be operated by the Airbus A350 Long Haul, improving comfort and consistency for passengers connecting on ultra-long-haul itineraries.

Singapore Airlines A350 Brisbane Flights

From 1 November 2026, Singapore Airlines will upgrade the SQ265/266 rotation between Singapore (SIN) and Brisbane (BNE) from the Airbus A350 Medium Haul to the Airbus A350 Long Haul configuration.

Advertisement

This aircraft features the airline’s 2013 long-haul Business Class seats and a dedicated Premium Economy cabin.

According to Mainly Miles, this marks the first time since October 2022 that Brisbane will again receive Singapore Airlines’ long-haul cabin products, which were a regular feature on at least one daily service prior to the pandemic.

While overall seat capacity on the route will fall by approximately four percent, Business Class capacity will increase.

The A350 Long Haul’s premium-heavy layout adds 14 additional Business Class seats per week in each direction compared to the Medium Haul configuration.

Aircraft Assignment and Operational Shift

The change represents a clear operational shift. In both 2022 and pre-pandemic operations, the 3-class Airbus A350 Long Haul aircraft was assigned to the SQ245/246 service. From November 2026, this designation moves to SQ265/266.

The SQ265/266 rotation is notable as it was the final Brisbane frequency to be restored to daily service following the pandemic. The flight was upgraded from four weekly services to daily operation in mid-June 2025.

Brisbane’s Long-Haul Cabin History

In 2018, Singapore Airlines operated all four daily Brisbane services with long-haul Business Class seating, using either the 2013 Business Class product or the now-retired 2006 configuration.

These seats were progressively replaced by the Regional Business Class product from 2018 onward.

Although technically newer, the regional seat is narrower and is widely regarded by passengers as less comfortable than the older long-haul design. The return of the A350 Long Haul therefore, represents a qualitative improvement rather than a simple fleet substitution.

Daily Schedule from 1 November 2026

Singapore Airlines will operate four daily flights in each direction between Singapore and Brisbane. All services operate every day.

Singapore to Brisbane

Brisbane to Singapore

This structure provides a daytime service from Singapore to Brisbane with an evening return, supporting both local demand and onward connectivity.

Connectivity for Ultra-Long-Haul Passengers

The timing of SQ265 and SQ266 is optimized for long-haul connections via Singapore.

Inbound connections to SQ265 include arrivals from London Gatwick, London Heathrow, Paris, Amsterdam, Zurich, Rome, Johannesburg, and Cape Town, alongside selected services from India and China.

Outbound connections from SQ266 include London Heathrow, Zurich, Rome, Manchester, Johannesburg, Cape Town, and multiple destinations across India and North Asia.

Many passengers on these itineraries undertake journeys exceeding 22 hours. The availability of long-haul Business Class and Premium Economy on the Brisbane sector eliminates the current downgrade in comfort experienced by connecting passengers.

Strategic Importance

Singapore is Brisbane Airport’s second-busiest international route after Auckland. In 2024, Brisbane Airport CEO Gert-Jan de Graaff stated that more than half of all visitors from India to Brisbane traveled via Singapore Airlines.

Indian nationals were the largest group of non-Australian passport holders arriving in Brisbane on Singapore Airlines flights in 2024, followed by Singaporean and British travelers. This highlights the airline’s critical role in Queensland’s inbound tourism market.

KrisFlyer Award Redemption Rates

Singapore Airlines KrisFlyer members can redeem miles for one-way flights between Singapore and Brisbane at the following rates per person:

Taxes and fees apply in addition to mileage and typically total around S$102 from Singapore to Brisbane and S$97 in the return direction.

These amounts are higher than many other routes due to Australia’s international arrival and departure taxes.

Redemptions made on or after 1 April 2026, for travel on or after 1 October 2026, will also incur Singapore’s new Sustainable Aviation Fuel levy on this route.

New Closed-Door Business Class Suites

Singapore Airlines plans to introduce its new closed-door Business Class suites on the Airbus A350 Long Haul from the second quarter of 2026.

The airline aims to complete the full fleet retrofit by late 2030, although similar programs have historically taken longer than initially projected.

While Brisbane may not be among the first destinations to receive the new seats, continued A350 Long Haul deployment positions the route alongside Sydney and Melbourne, both of which already see flights operated by this aircraft type.

Bottom Line

Singapore Airlines’ decision to restore long-haul cabin products on the Singapore–Brisbane route from November 2026 strengthens the route’s appeal for premium and long-haul travelers.

The upgrade of SQ265/266 to the Airbus A350 Long Haul reintroduces Premium Economy and increases Business Class capacity.

For passengers connecting between Australia, Europe, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent, the change delivers consistent comfort across the entire journey.

Compared with 2018, when all four daily flights featured long-haul seating, this represents a measured but meaningful step toward rebuilding Brisbane’s long-haul product offering.

Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of US$1.00 per share, and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company’s American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”) for the 30 consecutive business days from November 7, 2025 to December 19, 2025, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.

The Notification Letter does not impact the Company’s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market at this time. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been provided 180 calendar days, or until June 22, 2026, to regain compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). To regain compliance, the Company’s ADSs must have a closing bid price of at least US$1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days. In the event the Company does not regain compliance by June 22, 2026, the Company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance or may face delisting.

The Company’s business operations are not affected by the receipt of the Notification Letter. The Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs and may, if appropriate, consider implementing available options, including, but not limited to, implementing a reverse share split of its outstanding ADSs, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement under the Nasdaq Listing Rules.

KISSIMMEE, Fla., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ECD Automotive Design, Inc. (“ECD” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: ECDA), the world’s largest Land Rover and Jaguar restoration company known for its custom luxury builds, including bespoke Defenders, Range Rovers, Jaguar E-Types, Ford Mustangs and Toyota FJs, announced that it will implement a 1-for-5 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common stock (“Reverse Stock Split”), effective at market opening time on December 26, 2025. ECD common stock will remain on the Nasdaq Capital Market and begin trading on a split-adjusted basis when the markets open on December 26, 2025, under the Company’s existing trading symbol “ECDA,” with the new CUSIP number 27877D302.

The Reverse Stock Split was previously approved by stockholders at the Company’s annual meeting of stockholders held on July 22, 2025, with the final ratio determined by the Company’s Board of Directors. The Reverse Stock Split is intended to increase the per share trading price of ECD’s common stock to satisfy the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market (Rule 550(a)(1)).

As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every five pre-split shares of common stock outstanding will automatically be reclassified and combined into one share of common stock. This will reduce the number of outstanding shares of ECD’s common stock from approximately 6,925,006 shares to approximately 1,385,002 shares. The Reverse Stock Split will not change the number of authorized shares of the company’s common stock or the par value of the common stock. Proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the company’s outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, as well as the applicable exercise price of the stock options.

Shareholders holding their shares electronically in book-entry form are not required to take any action to receive the post-split shares. Shareholders who hold certificated shares will receive instructions from Continental Stock Transfer and Trust, the Company’s transfer agent who is acting as the exchange agent for the Reverse Stock Split. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional share will instead have their fractional share rounded up to the nearest whole share.

Additional information regarding the Reverse Stock Split can be found in the Proxy Statement filed with the SEC.

SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales. LanzaTech’s increased equity interest does not imply a change in governance or control.

LanzaTech and LanzaJet continue to collaborate on new projects and licensing opportunities via their CirculAir™ offering, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to work towards delivering new energy solutions and driving lasting impact in the aviation industry.

Accounting Impact of Transaction

The Company’s interest in LanzaJet is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with income (loss) from equity method investments, net, including gain on dilution, recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and equity method investments recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

About LanzaTech

LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) is a carbon management solutions company that transforms industrial emissions, gasified solid waste and carbon dioxide into recycled carbon ethanol via proprietary bio-fermentation technology. Ethanol is a crucial building block in the world – a key feedstock for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), marine fuel and other downstream chemical derivatives. Operating commercially at six assets today, LanzaTech’s technology unlocks value across the supply chain, reducing the carbon footprint of hard-to-abate sectors while shepherding recycled carbon fuels and products to the world, building a circular carbon economy. www.lanzatech.com

EDISON, N.J., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eos Energy Enterprises, Inc. (NASDAQ: EOSE) (""Eos"" or the “Company”) an American energy company and the leading innovator in designing, sourcing, manufacturing, and providing zinc-based battery energy storage systems (BESS) manufactured in the United States, today announced that Russ Stidolph, who has served as non-executive Chair since April 2018 and whose firm, AltEnergy, LLC, has been a lead investor in Eos for the past eleven years, has decided to step down from the Board of Directors, effective December 31, 2025, to focus his efforts, full time, on AltEnergy Acquisition Corp. The Board has appointed Joseph Nigro to succeed Stidolph as non-executive Chair, effective January 1, 2026.

“I am proud to have played an integral role in guiding Eos from an early-stage research and development company into a scaled leader of stationary energy storage. When AltEnergy first invested in Eos, the Company built prototype battery cells that to this day cycle twice daily. Watching that product then successfully be piloted in the field, establishing a U.S. manufacturing strategy, building a robust pipeline and backlog and successfully deploying over 5 GWh of operations in the field are accomplishments I will always be proud of,” stated Stidolph. “Bringing Joe Nigro onto the Board earlier this year, with his more than three decades of global energy, utility, and infrastructure experience, positioned Eos for a seamless leadership transition to its next phase of operations and growth.”

Stidolph played a foundational role in Eos’ evolution from its early commercialization efforts to its NASDAQ listing and growth into a scaled American manufacturer. Stidolph has been one of Eos’ earliest and most enduring champions – first as an investor more than a decade ago and later as a Director and Chair.

“Without Russ’ leadership, there would be no Eos,” said Joe Mastrangelo, Eos Chief Executive Officer. “From bringing the required capital along with always recognizing the long-term potential of Eos to recruiting me to the Company, Russ has been instrumental in getting us to where we stand today and we are grateful for his leadership and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ evolution.”

“Russ leaves Eos with a strong foundation for the future,” said Nigro. “His leadership and continued investment allowed Eos to innovate, commercialize, and build one of the most advanced long-duration storage manufacturing platforms in the country. We are grateful for his steady leadership, partnership, and the many contributions he has made to Eos’ development.”

Nigro has held numerous senior leadership roles across the energy industry, including Chief Financial Officer of Exelon Corporation, CEO of Constellation, a former Exelon operating company, and multiple strategic and operational roles across power and gas. Since joining the Eos Board in early 2025, Nigro has play a critical role in shaping the Company’s strategic direction during a period of rapid commercial momentum and U.S. manufacturing expansion.

“Joe’s deep expertise across energy markets, finance, and large-scale operational execution makes him the right leader to guide our Board at this pivotal stage,” said Mastrangelo. “As Eos continues to scale production and meet growing demand for flexible, American-made long-duration storage, Joe’s strategic vision and industry perspective will provide invaluable guidance to our leadership team and shareholders.”

“Eos is building one of the most important energy-infrastructure platforms and is positioned to play a critical role in the future energy mix. As power demand accelerates with AI and electrification, long-duration storage will be essential to strengthen the grid and complement existing generation,” said Nigro. “Eos’ technology is uniquely suited to deliver that flexibility and reliability, and I look forward to partnering closely with Joe, the executive team, and my fellow directors as we support the Company’s next chapter of operational execution and market expansion.”

Proposed acquisition will add direct mortgage lending capabilities to complement the Company’s existing mortgage brokerage operations

Expected to close in the first half of 2026 following regulatory approval

DUBLIN, Ohio, Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- reAlpha Tech Corp. (Nasdaq: AIRE) (the “Company” or “reAlpha”), an AI-powered real estate technology company, today announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire InstaMortgage Inc. (“InstaMortgage”), an independent mortgage lender.

reAlpha currently operates a mortgage brokerage. The proposed acquisition is intended to complement reAlpha’s existing mortgage brokerage operations by adding direct mortgage lending capabilities and extending reAlpha’s footprint into additional key markets, and enabling greater alignment between brokerage and lending workflows to support a more coordinated borrower experience across the mortgage process.

Founded in 2008 and headquartered in San Jose, California, InstaMortgage is an originations-focused mortgage lender specializing in purchase and refinance loans. Through its technology-enabled platform and experienced lending team, InstaMortgage has helped more than 3,500 borrowers secure residential mortgage financing across 32 states, including New York, New Jersey, Illinois, and Ohio, which would be new markets for reAlpha. InstaMortgage has reported more than $4 billion over the past five years and has received multiple recognitions, being named by the Financial Times as one of America's Fastest-Growing Companies, and being included on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 and Inc.’s Inc. 500 list of fastest-growing private companies.

“This agreement is about building the operating system for modern homebuying,” said Mike Logozzo, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha. “Buyers don’t experience brokerage, lending, and closing as separate categories. They experience one process where clarity and execution matter. Following the completion of the acquisition, InstaMortgage will bring direct lending infrastructure and multi-state licensing that fits our platform strategy. When combined with our existing mortgage brokerage, it will position us to further reduce friction across handoffs and deliver a more coordinated experience, while operating with the discipline this industry demands.”

“Once completed, this transaction will materially expand our mortgage business capabilities,"" said Jamie Cavanaugh, Chief Executive Officer of reAlpha Mortgage. “A direct lender platform will give us another execution path alongside brokerage and support tighter workflow alignment from intake through closing.”

Shashank Shekhar, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of InstaMortgage, said, “We built InstaMortgage with a clear focus: deliver a modern origination experience powered by strong operators and a digital-first process. reAlpha’s vision for an integrated AI-powered homebuying platform aligns with how we see the market evolving, and we’re excited about what this could mean for borrowers, loan officers, and partners as we work toward closing.”

Under the terms of the definitive agreement, reAlpha would acquire 100% of the outstanding equity of InstaMortgage for total consideration of approximately $8.5 million, payable in a combination of cash and reAlpha common stock, including deferred consideration, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. reAlpha expects to fund the cash portion of the consideration from cash on hand at the appropriate time, subject to closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026 following the receipt of required regulatory approvals.

For additional details regarding the terms of the agreement, please refer to the Company’s Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on December 22, 2025.

LanzaTech Global ( (LNZA) ) has shared an announcement.

On December 22, 2025, LanzaTech Global announced that its ownership in sustainable aviation fuel specialist LanzaJet, Inc. had risen to 53% from about 36%, after receiving final tranches of LanzaJet common stock on December 16, 2025 under a pre‑existing investment agreement that required no new capital outlay and leaves governance and control unchanged. The move follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM‑certified sustainable fuels, including SPK and renewable diesel, at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Georgia—the first commercial‑scale plant to make jet fuel from ethanol—and underscores LanzaTech’s strategic focus on scaling ethanol‑to‑jet technology, leveraging diverse waste‑ and agriculture‑based feedstocks to cut aviation emissions, bolster energy security and rural economies, while LanzaJet continues to face the capital‑intensive, regulation‑sensitive realities of the sustainable aviation fuel market and remains accounted for as an equity‑method, non‑controlling investment.

Spark’s Take on LNZA Stock

According to Spark, TipRanks’ AI Analyst, LNZA is a Underperform.

LanzaTech Global’s overall stock score is primarily impacted by its poor financial performance, characterized by declining revenues, high leverage, and negative cash flows. The technical analysis indicates a bearish trend, further weighing down the score. Valuation metrics are unfavorable, with a negative P/E ratio and no dividend yield. While there are positive corporate developments, they are not sufficient to offset the significant financial and technical challenges.

SKOKIE, Ill., Dec. 22, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- LanzaTech Global, Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) (“LanzaTech” or the “Company”), a leader in carbon transformation technology, today announced an increase in its holdings of LanzaJet, Inc. (“LanzaJet”), a leading sustainable aviation fuel technology provider and fuels producer, to 53%. This announcement follows the successful commissioning and production of ASTM-certified sustainable fuels including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Renewable Diesel (RD) at LanzaJet’s Freedom Pines Fuels facility in Soperton, Georgia, the world’s first commercial-scale plant to produce jet fuel from ethanol.

On December 16, 2025, LanzaTech received its final tranches of LanzaJet common stock, which brings the Company’s ownership percentage and non-controlling interest in LanzaJet to 53%. These issuances of common stock were made pursuant to the Second Amended & Restated LanzaJet Investment Agreement and represent the final equity tranches under that agreement. The shares were issued in accordance with pre-agreed terms and do not reflect any new capital investment by LanzaTech.

This ownership increase is in accordance with a previously signed agreement which allowed LanzaJet to further sublicense the Alcohol-to-Jet (“ATJ”) technology in exchange for additional equity issued to LanzaTech.

LanzaTech’s platform, originally developed in collaboration with the Pacific Northwest National Lab and the U.S. Department of Energy, enables the production of ethanol from a variety of carbon sources, including agricultural residues, which LanzaJet can use to produce sustainable aviation fuel, or “SAF”, using its industry-leading Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) technology. By utilizing a diverse array of domestic and waste feedstocks, including those from the agricultural sector, this approach has the potential to both reduce aviation emissions by up to 85% and strengthen supply chain resilience and energy security. Through distributed production and flexible sourcing, LanzaTech and LanzaJet are striving to open new economic opportunities for rural communities and fortify the reliability and sustainability of fuel supply chains.

LanzaTech’s strategic decision to spin out LanzaJet in 2020 was driven by a vision to accelerate the development and deployment of ethanol-to-jet solutions. Today, with a 53% ownership stake, LanzaTech is reinforcing its commitment to LanzaJet’s success and to scaling this vital technology worldwide.

“LanzaTech’s increased stake in LanzaJet comes at an important time for the sustainable fuels sector,” said Dr. Jennifer Holmgren, CEO of LanzaTech and Chair of LanzaJet. “The success of LanzaJet’s Freedom Pine’s facility shows that ethanol from diverse domestic and recycled feedstocks—such as waste gases, municipal solid waste, captured CO₂ with hydrogen, and agricultural residues—can be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. We believe that this innovation not only expands supply options but also establishes ethanol as a vital connector between distributed carbon sources and global aviation markets.”

The sustainable aviation fuel industry remains capital-intensive and subject to evolving regulatory and market dynamics. LanzaJet, like many in the sector, is managing operational and financial pressures as it scales. LanzaTech’s increased equity interest does not imply a change in governance or control.

LanzaTech and LanzaJet continue to collaborate on new projects and licensing opportunities via their CirculAir™ offering, leveraging the strengths of both organizations to work towards delivering new energy solutions and driving lasting impact in the aviation industry.

Accounting Impact of Transaction

The Company’s interest in LanzaJet is accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with income (loss) from equity method investments, net, including gain on dilution, recognized in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss and equity method investments recognized on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Hydrogen transportation suffers from efficiency losses at every conversion step.","Support CleanTechnica's work through a Substack subscription or on Stripe.

This year marked the point where hydrogen transportation stopped being a future tense conversation and became an accounting exercise. Across light duty vehicles, buses, trucks, trains, mining equipment, refueling infrastructure, and even aviation, withdrawals outpaced commitments. These were not isolated pilots failing at the margins. They were coordinated retreats spread across continents, business models, and political systems. Most were announced quietly through strategy updates, end of week disclosures, or year end statements framed as focus or discipline. Taken together, they form a coherent pattern of abandonment driven by operational reality rather than ideology.

In light duty transportation, hydrogen failed completely as demand collapsed. The French hydrogen taxi firm Hype ended hydrogen operations entirely and moved to battery electric vehicles. Global fuel cell car sales fell to near zero outside South Korea. South Korea remained an outlier only because vehicles were subsidized at roughly 50% to 60% and hydrogen fuel received direct support. Hydrogen refueling stations closed across Europe, North America, and Asia. California stations experienced outages, rationing, and closures that undermined now almost non-existent consumer trust. Automakers stopped marketing fuel cell cars in most markets without issuing formal exit statements. The absence of new city or fleet commitments was more telling than any individual cancellation.

Heavy trucks were supposed to be hydrogen’s strongest case. Long distances, high payloads, and centralized depots were repeatedly cited as advantages. Reality moved in the opposite direction. Fuel cell heavy truck sales declined globally while battery electric heavy truck deployments surged, especially in China. Chinese fleets adopted battery electric trucks at scale for port drayage, construction haulage, and regional freight. Meanwhile, major manufacturers including Stellantis, GM, Daimler, Honda, and MAN withdrew from hydrogen truck programs, sometimes with a face-saving statement about deferring them. Startups built around hydrogen trucking collapsed. Hyzon, Nikola, and Quantron entered bankruptcy along with a long tail of suppliers and integrators. Cummins initiated a strategic assessment of its hydrogen business, a signal that further contraction is likely. Bosch reduced emphasis on hydrogen mobility while shifting investment toward electrification. No hydrogen truck platform reached sustained serial production. At the same time, battery electric trucks demonstrated daily freight operations with predictable costs and maintenance regimes. Fleets chose vehicles that arrived, worked, and stayed in service.

Public transit exposed hydrogen’s operating cost problem more clearly than any other segment. Cities learned that capital grants did not solve fuel and maintenance risk. Dijon abandoned hydrogen bus acquisitions after committing real capital and infrastructure. Van Hool, heavily exposed to hydrogen buses, went bankrupt. McPhy, a supplier of hydrogen fueling and electrolysis systems tied to bus deployments, collapsed, leaving stranded assets. In Poland, 26 cities that had bought or were buying hydrogen buses appealed to the national government for emergency fuel subsidies after discovering that hydrogen prices were far higher than expected. Similar dynamics played out across Europe and North America as transit agencies paused or canceled hydrogen procurements. Canada improved its zero emission transit fund, and in the process eliminated the sole-source advisory role for a think tank that kept inserting hydrogen into fleet plans through modeling tricks and bad data. Battery electric buses delivered predictable energy costs, simpler maintenance, and higher availability. Transit agencies reverted to technologies that fit their budgets and workforce skills.

Rail was another sector where hydrogen was framed as unavoidable. The claim was that lightly used or rural lines could not justify electrification. In practice, hydrogen trains added complexity without solving infrastructure constraints. Lower Saxony reduced its hydrogen train operations with only a fraction of the original fleet remaining active and dropped plans to acquire more. Alstom dropped hydrogen trains from its product focus after years of promotion. In the United Kingdom, hydrogen traction quietly disappeared from rail planning. India hit 99.2% heavy rail electrification with overhead wires. Switzerland and Austria reaffirmed electrification strategies and battery assisted solutions for non electrified segments. Rail operators favored overhead wires, partial electrification, and batteries because they reduced operating risk and fit existing maintenance models. Hydrogen trains failed to demonstrate reliability or cost advantages at scale.

The same pattern played out on water. Hydrogen ferries and marine vessels have delivered a small number of demonstration projects over the past few years that featured higher capital costs, higher operating costs, and in many cases higher lifecycle emissions once upstream hydrogen production was included. Hydrogen storage displaced payload and passenger space, bunkering infrastructure failed to appear at scale, and utilization rates remained low. Hydrogen marine projects depended on subsidies and novelty rather than economics and did not progress beyond pilots. In contrast, battery electric vessels moved rapidly from demonstration to deployment. Electric ferries scaled across Norway, Europe, China, and North America on fixed routes with high utilization, supported by declining battery costs and straightforward shore power infrastructure. Orders for 2,100 passenger pure electric ferries were booked. Battery electric container ships also entered service in Europe and China on short sea and inland routes, with ports installing megawatt scale charging and containerized battery swapping to support high frequency operations. Installed battery capacity in marine vessels increased year over year, while hydrogen activity remained flat or declined as projects were canceled or quietly reframed as research. In marine transport, as on land, hydrogen delivered higher costs and worse emissions profiles without market growth, while battery electric systems expanded because they worked.

Off road and industrial mobility removed one of hydrogen’s last rhetorical defenses. Mining, construction, and port equipment were often cited as sectors where batteries would struggle. Fortescue formally abandoned hydrogen plans and ordered billions of dollars of battery electric mining trucks and equipment. Construction equipment manufacturers advanced electrified platforms without hydrogen pilots. Ports electrified yard tractors, cranes, material handling equipment and tugs rather than pursuing hydrogen. Even in remote and heavy duty applications, electricity proved easier to manage than compressed hydrogen. Maintenance, energy delivery, and system efficiency favored electrification.

Refueling infrastructure collapsed in parallel with vehicle demand. Shell exited the hydrogen refueling station business entirely. BP closed its hydrogen fuels division. Stations shut down across Europe, North America, and China. Japan saw declining utilization rates despite long standing national support. No private capital stepped in to replace oil major investment. Hydrogen stations had no secondary economic use and could not be repurposed easily. Infrastructure built ahead of demand remained idle while operating costs accumulated. Without vehicles, stations closed. Without stations, vehicles had no reason to exist.

Corporate balance sheets confirmed what deployments already showed. Fuel cell manufacturers focused on transportation bled cash at accelerating rates. Ballard Power, Plug Power, and FuelCell Energy reported ongoing losses, shrinking backlogs, and geographic retrenchment. Firms like Lhyfe continued their fiscal delivery of massive losses and declining cash reserves, along with rhetorical claims of success, while the reality is staff layoffs, cost cutting, and geographical and segment retrenchment. Reverse stock splits were used to maintain listings as share prices fell. Venture capital avoided hydrogen transportation startups. Project finance dried up even where government guarantees existed. Revenues increasingly came from non transportation segments or one off contracts. Public markets reflected operational reality rather than long term narratives.

Aviation marked the final symbolic retreat. Airbus shelved its hydrogen aviation programs after years of promotional work. Hydrogen aviation startup ZeroAvia continues to burn cash without delivering any certified aircraft, missing its 2025 target and laying off needed staff on both sides of the Atlantic this year. Hydrogen aircraft were always speculative to the point of being science fiction, dependent on breakthroughs in storage, weight, and infrastructure. As costs and timelines became clearer, even symbolic long term bets were abandoned. Aviation attention returned to efficiency improvements and sustainable aviation fuel pathways that align with existing aircraft and infrastructure, as well as hybrid and fully electric aircraft.

None of this should have been surprising. Hydrogen transportation suffers from efficiency losses at every conversion step. Electricity must be generated, converted to hydrogen, compressed or liquefied, transported, stored, and converted back to electricity or mechanical energy. Each step adds cost, complexity, and energy loss. Capital requirements are high and operating costs volatile. Fuel delivery involves specialized equipment, safety constraints, and leakage risk. Institutions rewarded announcements and pilot projects rather than delivered outcomes. Subsidy uptake was treated as validation rather than a warning sign. Sunk cost bias, prestige projects, and salience effects kept programs alive longer than performance justified.

Hydrogen remains a necessary industrial feedstock that has to be decarbonized, a climate change problem on the scale of all of aviation. It does not function as a general purpose transportation energy carrier. The past year tested the proposition across every major vehicle class, geography, and subsidy regime. The results were consistent. This was not corruption or incompetence. It was systems reality asserting itself.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_j7276hj7276hj727-800x442.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:18.862395

This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.
“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.","Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines on Dec. 17 announced it has joined Par Hawaii to invest in pioneering the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Hawaiʻi using locally grown agriculture feedstock to reduce aviation carbon emissions.

This initiative will enable SAF production for more sustainable future flying and deliver economic benefits through the creation of a new energy sector and fuel supply chain in Hawai’i, while bringing new opportunities for local agriculture.

Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines, which together provide the most flights to, from and within Hawai‘i, and Par Hawaii, the largest producer of energy products in the islands, are partnering with Pono Pacific, through its Pono Energy, Inc. subsidiary, to study Camelina sativa (camelina) as a multi-purpose crop that can be used as SAF feedstock and to support agriculture.

The combined airlines also will become Par Hawaii’s launch SAF customer, with plans to take delivery of Hawaiʻi’s first locally produced SAF in the first quarter of 2026.

SAF, a safe drop-in fuel made from sustainable feedstock such as plant-based oils or used cooking oil, can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. Pono Pacific’s crop trials drew the attention of Alaska Star Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alaska Air Group that invests in technologies to drive aviation efficiency, performance and innovation.

“As Hawaiʻi’s airline, we have a responsibility to reduce our environmental impact while continuing to provide essential air service that connects our communities and strengthens our economy. Our company has a long-term strategy to reach net zero carbon emissions, and sustainable aviation fuel is essential for us to get there. We are grateful to have partners like Par Hawaii and Pono Pacific who share our commitment to making our operations more sustainable while creating a new fuel industry and strengthening Hawaiʻi’s energy independence,” said Alanna James, sustainability innovation director at Hawaiian Airlines and Alaska Airlines.

“We value the efforts of our airline partners as we work together to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase our energy security, while meeting Hawai‘i’s transportation needs. We applaud Hawaiian and Alaska airlines, Par Hawaii, and Pono Pacific for taking this important step to establish a locally based, lower-emissions supply chain for aviation fuel that supports our state’s clean energy goals,” said Ed Sniffen, director, Hawai‘i State Department of Transportation.

Pono Pacific, the state’s largest private resource company, will launch Pono Energy, Inc. in early 2026 to accelerate its work on camelina, a high-yield, pest-resistant cover crop that can be grown in rotation with food crops, reaching maturity in just eight to nine weeks. Its oil seeds can be crushed to produce renewable fuels, including SAF, while the remaining seedcake can be turned into government-approved, nutrient-rich feed for cattle and chickens. This revenue-generating cover crop will deliver more economic opportunity for Hawai‘i by creating jobs, supporting farmers and decreasing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

“Camelina represents a rare opportunity for Hawai‘i to build a true circular-economy model around renewable fuels. By growing this crop locally, we strengthen our agricultural sector, keep more dollars circulating within the state, and reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels. Camelina can be refined into sustainable aviation fuel while the remaining seedcake becomes a valuable, locally produced animal feed that supports Hawai‘i’s ranchers and livestock industry. We will explore food crops that can be grown alongside camelina to increase food security as well. It’s a win for our economy, a win for local agriculture, and a win for the environment — an example of how Hawai‘i can lead the way in innovative, homegrown climate solutions,” said Chris Bennett, vice president of sustainable energy solutions at Pono Pacific Land Management LLC.

Alaska Star Ventures has made a new investment that builds on Par Hawaii’s earlier support of Pono Pacific, which collaborated with the Hawaiʻi Agriculture Research Center to begin cultivating 50 non-GMO camelina varieties in 2023 to identify those best suited to Hawaiʻi’s year-round temperate climate.

The initial investment allowed Pono Pacific to conduct crop trials on four islands, in partnership with Aloun Farms, Mahi Pono and Meadow Gold Dairy. Pono Pacific identified suitable agricultural lands across the state and engaged Hawai‘i’s cattle and livestock industry to explore the use of camelina seedcake as animal feed.

As Pono Pacific advances the agricultural foundation for camelina, Par Hawaii, the state largest fuels manufacturer, is preparing to deliver SAF in the first quarter of 2026. Earlier this year, Par Pacific, parent company of Par Hawaii, formed Hawai‘i Renewables, and partnered with Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture between Mitsubishi Corporation and ENEOS Corporation, following a $100 million investment to convert and upgrade one of the refinery’s processing units into a renewable hydrotreater capable of processing plant-based and waste oils.

“In 2022, when we formed an agreement with Hawaiian Airlines to jointly study the commercial viability of locally produced sustainable aviation fuels, we didn’t think we would be able to progress so quickly. With renewable fuel production coming online in early 2026, it’s exciting to see the results of our team’s hard work. These fuels will have up to 80 percent lower carbon emissions compared to conventional fuels. This would not have been possible without a shared vision for our islands and our great teamwork,” said Eric Wright, president of Par Hawaii.

“We are thrilled to be the first customer to receive SAF from Par Hawaii next year,” added James.

“This is an important milestone for our company and Hawai’i, but there is still more work to do. While SAF is the best option to reduce aviation emissions, it is two to three times more expensive than regular jet fuel and supply is limited. We will need strong collaboration across airlines, fuel and feedstock producers, investors, including business partners seeking to offset their scope 3 emissions, and government, along with supportive policies, to grow the SAF industry and reach our decarbonization goals.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Biomass_updated_Logo_8d3314e0ca.png,N,,2025-12-22 17:57:23.121725

Through the end of the year, The Bedford Citizen will be sharing recaps of some of the major stories in town from 2025. The stories are in no particular order.

Happenings at Hanscom Field in 2025 included potential hangar expansion, the suspension and resumption of ICE flights at the facility and environmental matters.

About a year after a draft environmental impact report (DEIR) for the development of a proposed hangar complex at Hanscom Field was submitted but deemed unsatisfactory by Secretary of Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper, community members continued voicing their opposition to the project, with some calling on their elected representatives to step in and stop the expansion due to environmental impact concerns.

In February, Kathy Kerby called the proposed hangar expansion – commonly referred to as the North Airfield development – a “climate bomb in sheep’s clothing,” urging the community to not let the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), who owns Hanscom Field, “pull the wool over our eyes.”

In March, Janet Rothrock of the First Parish in Concord and Sue Swanson of Bedford, a member of Episcopal Creation Care Justice Network in Massachusetts, called on Gov. Maura Healey to stop the project, stating that faith communities throughout the region were concerned that the proposed expansion would “intensify both the climate crisis and environmental injustice impacts.”

That same month, Warren Senders also urged Healey to stop the proposed expansion, calling it “a recipe for inequality and irresponsibility.”

A State House rally was held in April in an effort to publicize and stop the proposed expansion. At the rally, a letter from more than 40 historians, scientists, and climate and environmental advocates was delivered to Healey, urging her to “preserve the area’s endangered historic sites and protect the climate by halting the proposed private jet hangar expansion at Hanscom [Field].”

That same month, Lori Etringer of the Bedford chapter of Mothers Out Front thanked state Sen. Michael Barrett for sentiments he shared at the rally. Etringer said Barrett described the proposed expansion as “the worst conjoining of wealth disparity and climate destructiveness.”

In May, climate activist Brian Okum was acquitted in Concord District Court on charges of felony malicious destruction of property more than $1,200 and disorderly conduct in relation to an April 2024 protest of the proposed expansion at Hanscom Field. Okum was convicted on a trespassing count and sentenced to one year of probation.

The advocacy group Extinction Rebellion organized the protest, and police arrested Okum and 20 others after they allegedly breached a secure area at the airport. Roughly 50 police officers responded, according to court testimony, and the incident disrupted activity at Hanscom Field for roughly 3 1/2 hours.

Navy Hangar Activity

Potential use of the Navy hangar space on Hartwell Road became a topic of interest for research and development and medical services companies.

Autonomous aviation startup Merlin Labs showed interest in May in setting up a research and development facility at the Navy hangar site, which was included in the North Airfield development. The idea was to initially set up a facility with a few dozen positions, the majority of which would be engineers and pilots running testing.

Future plans possibly included moving the headquarters, along with more than 100 new and existing jobs, from Boston to Bedford.

Runway Realty Ventures LLC previously purchased the space with the intention of incorporating the Navy hangar into a substantial infrastructure project. The project intent was to add aviation support – aircraft storage hangar and administration space – to the area close to Hartwell Road, by renovating the Navy hangar and also adding approximately 450,000 square feet of hangar space across 17 new construction buildings.

Negotiations between Merlin Labs and Runway Realty Ventures LLC and North Airfield Ventures LLC included plans for the company to lease 75% to 80% of the Navy hangar space – which had been vacant for around 25 years – in a long-term lease. The proponents would fund renovation of the hangar space, formerly used for research and development by Raytheon and the Navy operations.

In June, North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC submitted a Notice of Project Change (NPC) with a phase one waiver request to remove the existing Navy hangar building and some surrounding property from the larger North Airfield expansion project proposal into its own separate project.

In addition to the hangar being renovated for research and development purposes, the proposal called for updating an existing ramp to access the Hanscom Field runway and creating an access to Hartwell Road, as well as creating a surface parking lot with 140 spaces.

North Airfield Ventures LLC and Runway Realty Ventures LLC held a public information session that same month to provide an overview and answer questions about the Navy hangar project.

The information session included a presentation of the project by Rick Muse, North Airfield Ventures director of operations, and an overview of the contents and technical studies in the NPC by Lauren DeVoe, environmental review consultant with VHB.

Additionally, the project team claimed one to two Merlin test flights per day with at least one human operator on board, with some additional flights from other potential Navy hangar tenants. Experimental flights were proposed to take place in uncongested areas like the New Hampshire coastline, as well as some takeoffs and landings.

A handful of people commented and asked questions, with a few raising concerns over adding any amount of greenhouse gasses as the state, Bedford, and other neighboring towns work toward Net Zero. The team said that plans for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Hanscom Field are in the near future (including in the larger project plan), and the use of clean or electric aircraft is not out of the question, but availability of that technology is not here yet.

In July, members of the Hanscom Field Advisory Commission (HFAC), which represents the residents of the four towns surrounding Hanscom Field, had questions regarding the Navy hangar project and voiced concerns about the safety of experimental autonomous technology over the populated areas neighboring Hanscom Field.

Additionally, some HFAC members were wary about the larger North Airfield development. HFAC members decided to create and submit individual statements of concern ahead of the July 25 NPC comment period deadline, with potential wording including: “We feel that any increase in aviation traffic will harm the communities and should be opposed.”

In September, Merlin Labs officially announced it will establish a new test flight center at Hanscom Field, with operations likely beginning in early 2027. It will occupy hangar, office, and lab space in the former Navy hangar.

According to the company’s announcement, the move to Hanscom Field began the next phase of its ongoing flight test campaign with its Cessna Caravan aircraft, “which is the world’s first and only approved certification basis for AI-enabled, takeoff-to-touchdown onboard autonomy.”

The company also stated that test operations at Hanscom Field support Merlin’s partnership with the U.S. Special Operations Command and the Air Force to integrate the Merlin Pilot on the C-130J and the KC-135 aircraft platforms.

ICE Flights

HFAC Lincoln representative Christopher Eliot was quoted about U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) flights out of Hanscom Field in a WBUR story that was released ahead of HFAC’s June meeting. There was some discussion about the reported “dramatic increase” in flights leaving from Hanscom Field to transport detainees to holding facilities in Texas and Louisiana.

When asked to verify or quantify the activities, Amber Goodspeed, manager of airport administration for Hanscom Field, said that “as a general aviation airport, nobody is required permission,” and charter clients and passengers are not registered with Massport.

While commission members had personal opinions, they decided that, like Massport, it was not HFAC business. Margaret Coppe, HFAC chair and Lexington representative, said that while it seemed important to publicly shine a light on the activities going on so close by, from the commission’s purview, there is “no basis for objecting to them using Hanscom [Field].”

In July, ICE stopped using Hanscom Field for local detainee flights. Prior to that announcement, reports said that many Massachusetts ICE detainees had been sent to Hanscom Field from the Plymouth County Jail. Detainees were then reportedly flown from Hanscom Field to larger detention centers around the country.

ICE Boston spokesperson James Covington, quoted in a story by The Concord Bridge, did not know why the move away from Hanscom Field was made, but did believe it was not just a temporary halt.

When the topic of ICE flights was revisited at HFAC’s July meeting, the group consensus had changed somewhat, seeing that it was an issue of concern to the community and that the commission had a right to have its input considered.

ICE resumed its use of Hanscom Field in September. Covington said ICE’s use of the airport had resumed “to support Operation Patriot 2.0. Flying aliens out of Hanscom [Field] allows ICE to move detainees quickly from the intake center at Burlington to a detention center once they have been processed.”

Coppe said HFAC was not notified, instead receiving reports from the community that ICE had resumed flights to Hanscom Field.

“In order to properly carry out our charge, we need to know this information,” she said. “We have a role to perform, and we can’t do it unless we’re properly informed.”

In response to questions and concerns voiced by community members, HFAC asked for more transparency from Massport and ICE in regard to ICE activity at Hanscom Field.

HFAC’s September meeting had what members described as an “unprecedented” number of participants, as nearly 80 people logged onto the Zoom meeting to join in on the commission’s conversation about ICE’s use of Hanscom Field. Participants included community members from Hanscom’s towns, as well as activists from the region and other states, such as Vermont, who were protesting against ICE’s actions.

HFAC sent a letter to Massport CEO Richard Davey, calling on ICE and Massport “to supply information for any and all upcoming ICE flights including date, time, and type of aircraft.” Additionally, the letter requested commentary on the safety and legality of ICE’s activity.

Hanscom Field Director Christopher Willenborg responded on behalf of Davey on Sept. 24. In his response, Willenborg wrote that Hanscom Field is “legally obligated to allow all types of aircraft operations without unjust discrimination, including those sponsored by the federal government.” He also advised HFAC to contact ICE directly, as airport representatives do not receive advance notification of the agency’s flight activity.

However, the assertion that airport representatives do not receive advance notice of ICE activity was disputed in November when The Lexington Observer received an email exchange acquired by a local activist through a public records request. According to the Observer, the source wished to remain anonymous, but The Bedford Citizen independently confirmed the existence of the emails.

In the exchange, Anthony Caruso – a general manager with Hanscom airfield services operations company Signature Aviation – wrote to Willenborg and Keith Leonhardt, Massport airport and operations manager for Hanscom, that Signature had received information about two ICE charter flights at Hanscom.

Rev. Jamie Hinson-Rieger, senior minister at First Parish–Unitarian Universalist, and Rev. John Gibbons, minister emeritus at First Parish, called the Observer’s story and the email exchange “a blockbuster revelation that reveals covert collaboration between ICE, Hanscom Field, and Massport that previously has been denied.”

Due to the significance of the concerns brought to the commission in September, HFAC also wrote a letter to Covington and ICE leadership, outlining the same concerns as written in the commission’s letter to Massport.

On Dec. 12, Healey wrote a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, calling on ICE to stop flying detainees out of Hanscom Field.

Fuel Emissions/Air Quality

In March, HFAC reviewed challenges and potential solutions to reducing the use of leaded aviation gasoline (avgas) at Hanscom Field, as well as the impact of leaded aviation fuel emissions on public health.

Eliot shared that according to his research, low levels of lead exposure can have major health implications. He said that studies at other airports have shown that lead pollution is most concentrated within a one-kilometer (0.62-mile) radius of an airport.

The culmination of months of work, HFAC put together a statement of its “best guess as to what the concern is” surrounding the use of leaded avgas at Hanscom Field.

While “the danger of lead poisoning is so well documented,” said Eliot in the April meeting, the group’s research found some conflicting – some alarming and some reassuring – scientific and anecdotal results in studies concerning lead exposure surrounding airports.

The statement mentioned the Northeast region as a hot spot for lead exposure, and, locally, “Hanscom Field is among the top 50 most lead polluting airports in the country.”

The statement called for “Massport and the [Federal Aviation Administration] to recognize the severity of this problem both nationally and locally and to take all necessary measures to implement a solution at Hanscom Airport with urgent priority.”

A research project regarding air quality impacts in the towns that border Hanscom Field found that there is a high concentration of ultrafine particles (UFP) and airborne lead.

Neelakshi Hudda of Tufts University presented the results of the study in September. The study was requested due to concern that the proposed North Airfield development project will result in a significant increase in greenhouse gas and UFP emissions.

The study showed that the highest concentration of UFPs occurred at sites downwind of the airport during periods of moderate wind and high flight activity. Hudda said the Bedford sampling sites showed higher concentrations of UFPs when the wind was coming from the southwest.

Hudda also noted that airborne lead was detected in 100% of samples taken from the testing sites in the Hanscom communities. Hudda compared her team’s measured lead concentrations – hypothesized to be affected by the combustion of leaded fuel used by aircraft with piston engines – to measurements made at the Massachusetts Environmental Protection Agency data-collection site in Boston and found that concentrations of lead around Hanscom Field are, on average, larger than in the Boston area.

The World Health Organization issued “good practice” statements on UFPs to guide researchers and other decisionmakers toward measures to reduce ambient UFP concentrations. Information about UFPs can be found on pages 149 to 151 of WHO’s global air quality guidelines.

The study found that UFP concentrations exceed World Health Organization (WHO) thresholds at varying levels at each study site under at least one of the testing conditions. While many exceeded the WHO threshold by 4% and below, three of the test sites – the two closest to runways and one along the landing path – exceeded the threshold by an average of 35% and by as much as 79% during a monitoring period.

In October, The Coalition to Stop Private Jet Expansion at Hanscom or Anywhere (SPJE) held a rally at the State House against the potential use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to reduce the spread of greenhouse gases in Massachusetts and to continue the fight against expansion at Hanscom Field.

SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft that has similar properties to conventional jet fuel, but with a smaller carbon footprint. SAF can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including food and yard waste, portions of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats, greases, oils, and other feedstocks.

Rally participants argued that SAFs will not be beneficial in reducing lifecycle aviation emissions to near zero by 2050 to contribute to the state’s clean energy and climate plan. Diane Proctor of the Concord-Carlisle League of Women Voters presented a letter to the governor and state legislators, urging them to reject policies and subsidies promoting the production and distribution of SAFs in Massachusetts. The letter was signed by over 50 organizations, six of which are based in Bedford.

Other Activities at Hanscom Field

In April, Massport appointed Willenborg as the new director of Hanscom Field. He succeeded Sharon Williams, who was named director of aviation facilities and passenger services at Boston Logan International Airport.

Willenborg had more than 25 years of leadership experience in the airport industry as an airport manager, state aeronautics director, and airport consultant.

He previously served as the airport manager of Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport in Westfield, where he was responsible for overseeing daily operations, managing the development and execution of annual budgets, and leading strategic initiatives. Over the past four years, this included directing more than $60 million in airside and landside capital improvement projects.

HFAC member and pilot Tom Hirsch provided insight, history, pilot perspective, and technical information about Hanscom Field in June.

About 100 animals from shelters impacted by flooding in Texas made their way to Hanscom Field in July. Two staff members from the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals-Angell Animal Medical Center (MSPCA-Angell) were on the ground in Texas to aid in the transport.

MSPCA-Angell staff members prepared about 100 cats and dogs to make the journey from Texas to shelters in the Northeast. Of those 100, approximately 50 animals were taken to a transport space at MSPCA-Angell’s Cape Cod Adoption Center.

Roughly 20 cats and 30 dogs came from the Williamson Animal Shelter, which is located about five miles from the flood zone. Williamson Animal Shelter had been taking in animals to help two other local shelters, Lampasas Animal Shelter and Georgetown Animal Shelter, which did not have access to drinkable water.

The animals that were transported were living in the shelters prior to the floods and were not displaced by them.

In October, Massport, alongside several mutual aid partners, held an emergency response exercise at Hanscom Field. This exercise is mandated by the FAA every three years.

The drill tested the coordination, communication, and response in the event of a major incident at Hanscom Field. Mutual aid partners taking part in the drill alongside Massport Fire Rescue included the Bedford, Lexington, Concord, Lincoln, and Waltham fire and police departments, Massachusetts State Police, the Hanscom Air Force Base Fire Department, Armstrong Ambulance, Action Ambulance, and Boston MedFlight.",https://cdn.thebedfordcitizen.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/phoMOF-at-State-House.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 18:57:00.177695

Proposed by Nova Sustainable Fuels, the project has received environmental approval from the province, according to a report by CBC News. The company, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as ""two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.""

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia's environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf. Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a ""major economic opportunity.""

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

Boeing has intensified its oversight of a vast global supplier network in an effort to reduce defects and streamline aircraft production. Company executives report that these measures are already yielding significant improvements as the aerospace giant works to stabilize its complex supply chain. India remains a pivotal market for Boeing, with over 325 suppliers contributing more than $1.25 billion annually in sourcing. The country operates more than 265 Boeing commercial and military aircraft, underscoring its strategic importance within Boeing’s global operations.

The aviation industry has faced persistent supply chain disruptions in recent years, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties. These challenges have resulted in delayed aircraft deliveries and shortages of critical components and materials, prompting Boeing to adopt a more rigorous approach to supplier management.

Impact of Increased Oversight and Data-Driven Risk Mitigation

Hector Silva, Vice President of Regulatory Compliance & Quality Core for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, revealed that since March 2024, the company has significantly ramped up its supplier oversight. This initiative has contributed to a reduction in defects by as much as 40 percent. Additionally, pending jobs on aircraft prior to delivery have decreased by 60 percent. Silva highlighted the proactive use of data analytics as a key tool in identifying and mitigating supply chain risks, enabling Boeing to address potential issues before they impact production.

Scott Stocker, Vice President and General Manager of the 787 Program and Boeing South Carolina Site Leader, emphasized the scale and complexity of Boeing’s supply chain organization, which employs several thousand personnel. He explained that the company continuously monitors factors that could affect suppliers and is prepared to allocate resources to support them when necessary. This includes conducting detailed production reviews focusing on supplier capacity, staffing, and the health of sub-tier supply chains. These efforts form part of Boeing’s “rate readiness” process, designed to support planned increases in monthly 787 production rates.

Addressing concerns that heightened oversight might impede production, Stocker stated that the opposite has occurred. The enhanced focus on the supply chain has actually facilitated Boeing’s ramp-up plans by improving operational clarity and responsiveness.

Strategic Supplier Partnerships and Future Outlook

Katie Ringgold, Vice President and General Manager of the 737 Program and Renton Site Leader, underscored India’s critical role in Boeing’s supply chain. She noted that a robust supply chain is essential for maintaining factory stability and that recent diversification of suppliers has positioned Boeing well for future growth. Key Indian partners include Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, which supplies floor beams for Dreamliners, and Mahindra Aerostructures Pvt Ltd, responsible for inlet outer barrel components.

Boeing’s intensified supplier oversight coincides with the company’s broader strategic initiatives, including a shift toward greater vertical integration following its acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems. Managing the seamless integration of new production lines and mitigating potential supply chain disruptions remain top priorities. The market has responded favorably to these developments, with Boeing’s stock rising following the completion of the Spirit AeroSystems deal. Meanwhile, competitors are reassessing their own supply chain strategies, and suppliers to both Boeing and Airbus anticipate increased production demands and potential price adjustments beginning in 2026.

As Boeing strives to stabilize production and achieve positive free cash flow by 2026, its supply chain management strategies continue to attract close attention from investors and industry analysts alike.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/7f9d2dba4ddb4ddb880190bcacba5f18.avif,N,,2025-12-22 17:07:21.202749

Airlines are collaborating with fuel suppliers, airports and industries like tech and agriculture to boost SAF supply chains. They are also signing multi-year agreements with fuel producers like Neste and World Energy.

Despite these developments, the ramp-up of Sustainable Aviation Fuel has been slower than expected due to high costs and economic uncertainty, putting global clean jet fuel supply off course to reach the 2030 targets, according to a March report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG).

Airlines and airports globally invest just 1-3% of their revenues or capex on SAF, per the report cited by Reuters.

High production costs remain the key barriers to faster adoption of SAF, according to BCG's findings.

Last year, for example, Shell paused on-site construction work at a biofuels plant in Rotterdam amid weak market conditions. The plant is designed to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel made from waste.

In 2023, Willie Walsh, director general at the International Air Transport Association (IATA), said that the airline industry would be ready to embrace the fact that SAF would always be more expensive than oil-based jet fuel.

Now it could be put on the map for an entirely different reason: low-carbon, sustainable jet fuel.

CBC News reported this week that a proposal for an industrial plant on Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore has passed its first regulatory hurdle: environmental approval from the province.

The proponent, Nova Sustainable Fuels, backed by European energy giant Octopus Energy, plans to build a $4-6 billion facility to produce sustainable aviation fuel and renewable ethanol, using solar and wind power and biomass. The company describes the products as “two critical low-carbon fuels for decarbonizing the transportation sector.”

The project would proceed in two phases. The first phase is building a production facility near the mouth of Isaacs Harbour, NS. In the second phase, wind and solar farms would be built to connect to the plant. That, says CBC, would require another environmental assessment, which the company said it plans to submit in 2027.

The jet fuel plant would require 60 truckloads of biomass (wood waste) per day and 586 cubic meters of fresh water per hour, which would be pulled from two nearby lakes.

Related: $60 Oil Is No Longer a Floor

Nova Sustainable Fuels expects it will take two to three years to construct and have a 50-year lifespan. Nova Scotia’s environment minister, Tim Halman, has put a few conditions on the project, including that it must be built within two years.

Nova Scotia has recently turned toward traditional oil and gas sources, despite strategizing a shift from fossil fuels to renewables focused on wind power. In July the province announced it is returning to offshore petroleum exploration for the first time since 2018, offering 13 new parcels covering 3.3 million hectares near the Scotian Shelf.

Energy Minister Trevor Boudreau said offshore natural gas presents a “major economic opportunity”.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel, made from sustainable sources such as biofuels, biomass, and captured carbon from oil and gas operations. It is said to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% and can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure without modifications.

SAF has another Canadian connection in Parkland Corporation, which in 2024 produced the first batch of made-in-Canada low-carbon jet fuel from its facility in Burnaby, British Columbia, just outside of Vancouver.

The 10,000 liters of fuel were sourced from non-food-grade canola and tallow. The entire batch of the production run was bought by Air Canada.

Previously, the Canadian aviation industry purchased SAF from other countries and imported it into Canada.

The one-day hiking program offered immersive nature experiences that highlight the importance of sustainability and the preservation of Japan’s natural environment for future generations.

Organized by Mirai no Mori, 13 FedEx volunteers accompanied 28 children on a 4-kilometer hike at Mt. Mitake in western Tokyo. FedEx volunteers served as mentors throughout the day, guiding participants and sharing practical knowledge about protecting the environment. The program gave the children the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors, explore a new environment, and simply have fun—experiences that are just as important as the lessons learned.

“We believe in empowering our team members and our communities to help create a healthier and more positive future for the environment,” said Kei Alan Kubota, managing director of FedEx Japan. “Through sustainability initiatives within the communities we serve, we can foster meaningful connections between future generations and nature while promoting environmental stewardship that benefits Japan’s sustainable future. It is a privilege for our team members to contribute to this important environmental project in our community.”

Across Japan, an estimated 23,000 children live in care homes, many of whom face significant challenges as they prepare to transition into adulthood. [1] Mirai no Mori offers these young people transformative experiences through nature-based activities such as trekking, forestry work, and river rafting. The program fosters cognitive, personal and social skills – the key life skills that empower them to navigate life after leaving the care system at age 18.

This initiative reflects Borealis’ continued commitment to pushing the limits of digital innovation by embedding AI-driven intelligence directly into core production processes. The worldwide deployment of the Borstar Digital Twin represents a major step forward in transforming how manufacturing plants operate, make decisions, and continuously improve performance.

At its core, the Borstar Digital Twin is a sophisticated suite of digital solutions that merges cutting-edge technology with Borealis’ deep expertise in process engineering. By combining artificial intelligence, real-time optimization tools, and advanced data analytics, the platform delivers a highly accurate virtual representation of the physical production process. This digital replica allows plants to monitor operations in real time, anticipate future process behavior, and run advanced simulations without disrupting actual production. As a result, Borealis facilities can achieve new levels of efficiency, productivity, and operational reliability.

The capabilities of the Borstar Digital Twin extend across multiple dimensions of plant performance. It supports data-driven decision-making by enabling operators and engineers to optimize processes using predictive insights and scenario-based simulations. Safety is enhanced through early identification and prediction of potential process or equipment issues, allowing preventive action before problems escalate. Sustainability objectives are also strengthened, as the system helps reduce waste, lower energy consumption, and minimize overall environmental impact. In addition, the platform accelerates innovation by shortening product development cycles and enabling virtual operator training in a risk-free digital environment.

The Borstar Digital Twin program was initially launched in 2023, with a specific focus on Borealis’ proprietary Borstar® technology used in the production of polyethylene and polypropylene. From the outset, the program was designed to ensure that production plants operate at peak efficiency while maintaining consistently high product quality. By 2025, Borealis reached a digital maturity milestone that made it possible to scale this solution globally. The program is now being rolled out across all Borstar units worldwide, including those operated by licensees such as Baystar™ and Borouge. This global expansion signals a new phase in which digital tools and AI-enabled workflows are becoming standard practice within Borealis’ core manufacturing operations.

According to Wolfram Krenn, Executive Vice President Operations at Borealis, the adoption of the Borstar Digital Twin goes far beyond simply introducing new technology. He explains that by integrating AI-based predictions with rigorous process models, plants can operate more efficiently, execute faster and more controlled grade transitions, and consistently deliver prime-quality products. Real-time monitoring also enables early detection and mitigation of process deviations or equipment anomalies, reducing unplanned shutdowns and improving overall reliability.

From a strategic perspective, Borealis CEO Stefan Doboczky highlights the broader value of the initiative. He emphasizes that the Borstar Digital Twin transforms advanced technology into a tangible customer benefit by delivering greater speed, reliability, and quality. In doing so, the program directly supports Borealis’ We4Customers strategy, reinforcing the company’s focus on customer success while strengthening its competitive position in the global polymers market.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-12-22 17:11:54.135158

Salvador Bahia Airport (SSA), part of VINCI Airports’ network since 2018, is pioneering Brazil’s aviation decarbonisation by becoming the country’s first airport to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for commercial operations. Regular use of SAF begins this November, marking a significant milestone for both the airport and VINCI Airports’ commitment to accelerating the energy transition across its mobility infrastructure and stakeholders.

The airport already serves as a regional benchmark for environmental performance. It was the first in the Americas to achieve the highest level of Airport Carbon Accreditation, ACA 5, implementing advanced practices for carbon management and reduction. More than 15 airports in the VINCI network now offer SAF, and Salvador Bahia’s introduction of regular SAF operations further strengthens its environmental position and aligns with decarbonisation goals across the network.

In Brazil, SAF is commercially distributed by Vibra. The fuel blend used at Salvador meets international sustainability criteria and can help lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Two daily flights from Salvador Bahia, operated by Gol Linhas Aéreas and LATAM Airlines Brasil, now use a blend of 10 per cent pure SAF and 90 per cent conventional jet fuel, the highest proportion currently applied in Brazilian aviation. The pure SAF, produced from used cooking oil, is presently the only type available nationally. While flight emissions fall under airlines’ scope 1 and the airport’s scope 3, the renewable fuel reduces lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and represents a first step in expanding SAF use in Brazil.

Governor Jerônimo Rodrigues said, “Bahia has made significant progress in clean energy production and in building a more sustainable future, where development and social justice move forward together.”

Julio Ribas, CEO of VINCI Airports in Brazil, added, “SAF is currently the most effective tool for reducing emissions in commercial aviation. Being able to offer flights fuelled with SAF in Salvador on a continuous basis places Bahia at the forefront of the energy transition and reinforces our commitment to transforming passenger journeys with increasingly sustainable solutions.”

Hydrogen Q3 2025 hydrogen investments also declined from Q2, but hydrogen investments still comprised the majority of industry sector announcements.
EPA’s proposed rollback of the GHGRP could impact the ability of carbon-based hydrogen projects to claim 45Q or 45V, and hydrogen projects seeking to claim 45V.","Billions of dollars in federal investments, including tax credits and funds authorized through legislation such as the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, have stimulated private investment in clean energy deployment. Now federal priorities are shifting, narrowing the federal incentives available for climate and clean energy investments. To deploy more innovative energy technologies for U.S. energy security, resilience, and growth, it is crucial to understand how shifts in federal policy and executive actions impact private investment. CATF’s new clean energy investment tracker is designed to do just that.

This tool tracks private investments that have been catalyzed by federal incentives and those that have been canceled while also tracking how changes to federal policy and executive actions impact the range of federal incentives available to projects. The data for this tracker comes from Rhodium’s Clean Investment Monitor combined with CATF’s data and analysis of federal incentives.

Federal incentives may be impacted by legislation and agency actions, which can limit project access to tax credits, grants, and loans. Where CATF has identified federal incentives as impacted by federal actions, the tracker labels project investments eligible for these incentives as “incentive eligibility impacted” (see top dashboard and status filter for investment totals for this label, and project details showing impacted incentives when selecting a project on the tracker to learn more). This label does not mean a project will not move forward, but that federal support is being withheld in some way. This information is essential to understand how federal activities impact private investments.

What’s impacting investments this quarter?

Federal legislation

Through the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) in July 2025, many clean energy tax credits were repealed or narrowed by new restrictions and/or accelerated phasedowns. The table below summarizes key changes to the tax credits:

Executive actions

The following executive agency actions could limit access to many of these tax credits, depending how they are implemented.

Proposed EPA Rule: Reconsideration of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). On September 12, 2025, EPA proposed to permanently remove program reporting obligations for 46 of 47 source categories of the GHGRP. EPA’s proposal also includes permanently removing the natural gas distribution segment of the petroleum and natural gas source category (subpart W) and suspending reporting of the remaining nine subpart W segments until reporting year 2034. The Treasury Department and IRS rely on the GHGRP to administer Section 45Q Carbon Sequestration Tax Credits, Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Tax Credits, and Section 45Y Clean Electricity Tax Credits. Revising the GHGRP as proposed could hinder compliance with tax credit reporting requirements reliant on GHGRP data, and therefore the ability to claim the credits, unless IRS regulations are revised, and/or sufficient alternatives for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) and lifecycle analysis (LCA) are implemented.

Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFE)/Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions. FEOC is shorthand for a type of tax provision that restricts entities with ties to certain countries considered national security threats from claiming or otherwise benefiting from federal clean energy tax credits. Previously, the IRA applied FEOC restrictions only to the 30D clean vehicle credit. OBBBA expanded upon IRA’s FEOC definition and created two new categories of Prohibited Foreign Entities (PFEs): (1) Specified Foreign Entities and (2) Foreign Influenced Entities. PFE/FEOC restrictions added by OBBBA apply to six energy tax credits: 45U, 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, and 45Z, increasing compliance burdens and impacting projects claiming those credits, including enhanced geothermal and advanced nuclear. Treasury and IRS have yet to publish implementation guidance, contributing to industry uncertainty on compliance. A recent market analysis found that industry preparation is underway, but only 38% of firms surveyed describe themselves as “fully prepared” to comply with PFE/FEOC rules for 2026.

DOE announced project funding cuts and additional cuts being considered for existing awards. DOE canceled federal cost-share funding for hundreds of existing grant awards. In May and early October, DOE announced it was rescinding awards (grants and loans). Another leaked list, yet unconfirmed by DOE, was reported later in October. These nationwide funding cuts impact industrial and transportation sectors, near-term infrastructure deployment of solar and wind and grid resiliency projects, as well as methane pollution reduction investments. It is currently unknown which projects will ultimately proceed without the relied upon federal cost-share from DOE. Private sector and state level cost-share investments into these projects also face risk.

Findings

The majority of federal incentives driving private investments are impacted by recent federal activities, including OBBBA tax credit provisions, uncertainty in Treasury’s approach to PFE/FEOC implementation, EPA’s proposed GHGRP rollback, and DOE’s announced and reported cancellations of funding.

Sectors impacted by these federal actions include electric power, manufacturing, and energy and industry, which include transportation throughout. In Q3 2025, new manufacturing investment totaled $10 billion in actual investment and project cancellations totaled $2 billion, mostly from the cancellation of battery manufacturing projects. New energy and industry sector investment totaled $25 billion in actual investment in Q3, and project cancellations totaled $2 billion, primarily solar, storage, and hydrogen projects.

Read on for a few sector snapshots of how federal activities are currently impacting investments.

Electric power

Solar and wind

Utility-scale solar, together with storage installations, accounted for most clean electricity investments, and wind investments increased over 30% from the previous quarter. This is partly driven by projects accelerating timelines to fit within narrowed eligibility timelines, which is accelerating timelines, distorting supply chains, and raising costs but not driving new projects. However, recent federal actions are driving deep uncertainty for these industries with still unknown consequences for private investments in solar and wind. In particular, OBBBA narrows the time horizons for wind and solar projects (to commence construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by December 31, 2027) to access the 45Y and 48E tax credits, eliminates eligibility for wind components sold after December 31, 2027 for 45X tax credit access, and creates uncertainty related to PFE/FEOC implementation. Uncertainty in solar investment will also have implications for battery investment and deployment, even if incentives for battery technologies remain largely intact.

Additionally, while most solar and wind projects are on private land, they can be sited on federal lands or otherwise require federal permits. Recent executive actions, such as the U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary’s Order prioritizing permits based on an energy project’s capacity density and the requirements for the Secretary of the Interior to personally sign off on solar and wind projects on federal lands could severely limit the solar and wind sectors’ ability to secure necessary permits. The administration has also taken several steps to slow or stop the development of offshore wind projects, which require federal approvals as they are sited in federal waters. The administration issued a halt on project approvals – a move a federal judge recently deemed unlawful – and has issued stop work orders on projects already under construction. These tax credit and permitting uncertainties upend the federal policy environment for solar and wind projects.

Looking ahead

DOE’s October project cuts announcement and additional project awards being considered for termination will likely affect wind and solar investments. EPA recently terminated the $7 billion Solar for All program within the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. These cuts are a withdrawal of federal support for communities across the country that applied for and received funding support to invest in these technologies.

Manufacturing

Fueling equipment and zero emission vehicles

While zero emission vehicle supply chains drove manufacturing investments in Q3 2025, these investment numbers were likely tied to investors taking action prior to the September 30, 2025, termination of 30D Clean Vehicle, 25E Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle, and 45W Commercial Clean Vehicle tax credits. OBBBA’s PFE/FEOC restrictions apply to the 45Y, 48E, and 45X tax credits that incentivize investment in the EV manufacturing supply chain – including critical minerals and batteries – creating investment uncertainty in those sectors while the industry waits for Treasury to release guidance that explains how they are implementing FEOC restrictions. The additional narrowing of the 48C Advanced Energy Project credit and the June 30, 2026, termination of the 30C Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property credit creates further uncertainty for future investments in fuel fabrication, fueling equipment, and EVs.

Separately, the administration continues to withdraw federal support for zero-emission vehicles and charging infrastructure. In addition to actions earlier this year to delay the release of funds for EV charging stations, the October DOE project cancellations further target EV supply chains for producing low-carbon fuels, building EV charging and freight corridors, and electrifying heavy-duty and public transit fleets.

Energy and industry

Sustainable aviation fuel

Investment in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) technology continued to decline in Q3 2025. While OBBBA extended the 45Z tax credit through 2029, it dramatically reduced the maximum per-gallon credit value available to SAF producers from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon, limiting the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. OBBBA also amended 45Z to require feedstocks to be from the U.S., Canada, or Mexico. The SAF industry had been positioned to expand, but these changes create new uncertainties for the domestic SAF industry.

Hydrogen

Q3 2025 hydrogen investments also declined from Q2, but hydrogen investments still comprised the majority of industry sector announcements. Subsequent quarters are likely to illustrate more of the impacts from recent federal actions, such as the OBBBA’s 45V Clean Hydrogen Credit phasedown (terminating the credit for projects that begin construction after December 31, 2027, instead of the original phaseout in 2033).

EPA’s proposed rollback of the GHGRP could impact the ability of carbon-based hydrogen projects to claim 45Q or 45V, and hydrogen projects seeking to claim 45V. The proposed delay of subpart W until reporting year 2034 would negatively impact the ability of taxpayers to receive higher incentives for better performance (i.e. lower-emissions hydrogen production) and potentially render some projects uneconomical. Carbon-based hydrogen projects can opt to claim either 45V or 45Q Carbon Sequestration tax credits; if the GHGRP is rolled back and data from subpart W is no longer available, 45Q may be the better route, but 45Q also relies on GHGRP to verify tax credit eligibility.

DOE’s announced hydrogen funding cuts in October, and the additional cuts being considered, are destabilizing for the U.S. hydrogen sector and may further alter 2025 Q4 investment data for the hydrogen sector. The announced cuts and additional cuts under consideration include eliminating federal cost share for all of the Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs as well as 76 other hydrogen projects that support the buildout of a domestic hydrogen industry. It is unclear if projects will be able to move forward without federal cost share; at least one Hydrogen Hub announced it would pause activities in response to recent changes, including DOE’s decision to cut federal funding. Exxon announced it was halting plans for its blue hydrogen facility in Baytown, Texas – a project selected to receive up to ~$322 million in federal-cost share from DOE that was terminated in the spring.

Carbon management

Q3 2025 carbon management investments were slightly lower than Q2 levels. While OBBBA maintained the 45Q Carbon Sequestration tax credit and even included parity for enhanced oil recovery, other recent federal actions, including EPA’s proposed GHGRP rollback and DOE project cuts, have contributed to industry investment uncertainty.

Recent reporting indicates that Treasury and the IRS plan to issue guidance by the end of 2025 to clarify how taxpayers can verify their projects by an independent engineer or geologist to meet the 45Q credit requirement for tax year 2025. Until that guidance is finalized, there will be no way for taxpayers to substantiate 45Q claims if the GHGRP is eliminated.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/21170632/united-states.jpg,N,,2025-12-22 17:12:06.902305

US interest in Greenland has intensified since Trump returned to office in January, with the president repeatedly citing national security concerns to justify his claims.","Denmark has condemned the United States’ decision to appoint a special envoy to Greenland, calling the move “totally unacceptable” and summoning the US ambassador for explanations.

The reaction followed the nomination by US President Donald Trump of Louisiana republican Governor Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory that the former president has repeatedly suggested should become part of the United States.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said he was “deeply angry” about the appointment, adding that Copenhagen would formally raise the issue with Washington in the coming days.

Trump announced the nomination on his Truth Social platform, arguing that Greenland was of strategic importance to US national security. He said Landry would work to defend American interests, as well as those of US allies.

Danish MEP Anders Vistisen told Brussels Signal that the appointment reflected what he described as a flawed view of national security.

“Contrary to what US President Trump thinks, the territories of other countries are not put there simply to geographically defend the United States,” he said, adding that Denmark was a committed NATO member whose soldiers had taken part in alliance missions.

While Denmark shared concerns about the growing influence of China and Russia in the Arctic, Vistisen said this did not justify what he described as expansionist rhetoric directed at a NATO ally.

He stressed that Greenland was both an integral and autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark and that its status was not up for negotiation. “It is not for sale, nor is it an item to be robbed,” he said.

Greenland governs its own domestic affairs, while Denmark retains responsibility for foreign policy, defence and security. Decisions affecting the territory’s international position are traditionally taken with both Danish and Greenlandic representatives involved.

US interest in Greenland has intensified since Trump returned to office in January, with the president repeatedly citing national security concerns to justify his claims. Danish media have recently reported efforts by Washington to establish more direct contacts with Greenland’s government, a move that has caused unease in Copenhagen.

Landry posted on X that it was an honour to take on the role, adding that he would work to make Greenland “a part of the US”.

European leaders also weighed in following the announcement. Germany’s foreign ministry said it had “taken note of the new announcement” and stressed that its position remained unchanged.

“The future of Greenland lies in the hands of the Greenlanders,” a spokesperson said.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen echoed that view, saying respect for sovereignty remained fundamental. “We have said it before. Now, we say it again. National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” they said together.

The aircraft arrived in Manila at 4:43 p.m., following a delivery ceremony in Toulouse, France, led by PAL Holdings Inc. president Lucio Tan III, PAL announced in a press release.

Tan was joined by senior company officials, including PAL board adviser Kyle Tan, PAL president Richard Nuttall, and executive vice president and chief operating officer Atty. Carlos Luis Fernandez.

The delivery is the first of nine A350-1000s PAL ordered as part of its fleet expansion program, bringing the airline’s total fleet to 82 aircraft.

The aircraft, expected to serve PAL’s transpacific routes, features a tri-class cabin layout with 42 Business Class seats, 24 Premium Economy seats, and 316 Economy seats, accommodating up to 382 passengers.

Powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 turbofan engines, each capable of delivering up to 97,000 pounds of thrust, the A350-1000 offers enhanced efficiency and reliability.

It also sets new standards in sustainable aviation, with up to a 25% reduction in fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions compared with previous-generation aircraft, and the capability to operate with sustainable aviation fuel or SAF.

With the news that the government is backing Heathrow's £49 billion plan for a third runway, the long running debate over airport expansion is back at the top of the agenda.

Supporters say the move is vital for UK competitiveness and future connectivity.

Critics question the environmental and community impact.

So what does this decision really mean for Britain's place in global aviation? And what happens if we don't expand?

Aviation expert and special advisor to the Secretary General of UN Tourism, Anita Menderrata, speaks to The Standard’s Tech and Science Daily podcast to help unpack the story.

The expansion of Heathrow, namely the addition of a third runway, is incredibly important to the UK as a whole.

Not just Heathrow, because it strengthens the competitiveness of the UK both in terms of travel and tourism, but also importantly trade.

A computer image of an expanded Heathrow Airport after the third runway has been built

Heathrow

Any airport that operates will have a busyness factor. It's all about the efficiency of how the busyness is managed, and this is where airport operations, airlines, and air traffic control needs to come in incredibly effectively.

So the beauty of adding in a third runway, which will only be operational in 2035, is that you can actually elevate the efficiency of the aircraft taking off and landing rather than having the risk of bottlenecks, because you now have the flexibility of a third runway, especially if for any reason any of the other runways come into any operational challenges.

The net effect will be very good because when it comes to a project like this, which is core infrastructure for a nation, it's always about the opportunity cost. It's not just should we; it’s if we don't make this investment, what will this mean for the UK economy, for all of its productivity and its identity?

So there is potentially some big national upside, but what about the people living around the airport?

The entire process of developing the third runway at Heathrow is very much about upgrading the entire infrastructure itself.

If we look at other airports in the world, whether it's JFK, Charles de Gaulle, Schiphol, those are in high density areas. Heathrow has the benefit of being outside of central London, so it actually has the environment around it to be able to stretch with minimal disruption.

Any community living on the edges effectively of an airport is going to be impacted by growth of the airport, and it's understandable that there's frustration.

The consultation process and the engagement process with the local community is vital, so they actually understand the benefits of this, not only some potential hardships they may face.

Lib Dem MPs gathered in Westminster to oppose a third Heathrow runway

.

From the middle of next year, the public consultation process is going to begin. Heathrow is needing to put through not just an economic impact assessment, but an environmental and a social impact assessment that will allow the casemaking to be clear, because once again it's about the opportunity cost of if we don't do this. Communities might stay in place, but there will be a limitation to their own growth.

It's very important that Heathrow as an airport establishment and the ecosystem around it work very closely with the community ecosystem so it's very clear the benefits. Equally, communities must be able to voice concerns they might have, in order to have those concerns answered.

But more planes equals more pollution, right? What are the environmental implications of adding a new runway to Heathrow Airport?

What's very important is that the expansion of Heathrow and the third runway actually strengthens the UK's ability when it comes to reaching net zero by 2050.

Not only is it more effective operations of the runway, it's going to be a completely electric powered terminal itself.

It's using much more efficient air traffic control, and it's bringing in the aircraft that are allowed to utilise a sustainable aviation fuel, which cuts emissions by 80%.

There will be higher traffic flows of people. But a third runway that allows for larger aircraft could actually mean fewer aircraft taking off with more people and cargo rather than increasing the number of smaller aircraft.

The interesting thing, and something that is often completely underestimated and under-celebrated, is how much the aviation industry per se is at the forefront of innovation in sustainable engineering for all other industries.

The investment that aviation has been putting into sustainability for decades now and the billions that have gone into it have gone into other modes of transport have gone into other industries. So in many ways aviation almost becomes an incubator for innovation itself.

So much learning from the Heathrow expansion will be cascaded through the UK as a whole. So this is very important.

When we look at any nation's competitiveness, productivity growth is essential. But scaling up growth does not have to mean scaling up negative environmental impact.

So ironically, while people might question why aviation is not damaging to the environment, it's actually going to help the environment because it's going to catapult the UK's ability to continue to grow through essential aviation, but through smart green aviation that works towards net zero by 2050.

Airlines across Asia Pacific are enjoying a strong rebound in passenger demand, but beneath the headline growth, chief executives are grappling with persistent supply chain disruptions, geopolitical instability, and outdated air traffic management systems.

In November, the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA) held its 69th Assembly of Presidents in Bangkok, bringing together airline CEOs and senior leaders from across the region. The event, hosted by Bangkok Airways, was supported by major aircraft and engine OEMs, aviation experts, and international media, including Aerospace Global News.

Nearly 200 delegates attended, representing carriers including Air Astana, Air India, Air New Zealand, ANA, Cathay Pacific, China Airlines, EVA Airways, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Lion Group, Malaysia Airlines, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Royal Brunei, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Vietnam Airlines.

Strong passenger growth masks mounting operational pressures

With global passenger numbers now exceeding pre-pandemic levels, it would be easy to assume commercial aviation is firmly back on track. Conversations with Asia Pacific airline leaders, however, paint a more complex picture.

Across the region, airlines are struggling with delayed aircraft deliveries, engines stuck off-wing, shortages in maintenance and repair capacity, constrained spare parts availability, and difficulties sourcing trained personnel. These challenges are limiting growth just as demand accelerates.

Supply chain disruption, tariffs, and airspace closures compound costs

Opening the assembly, AAPA Director General Subhas Menon warned that fragile supply chain recovery is now being undermined by rising tariffs, driving up supplier costs while simultaneously dampening demand through inflation.

He added that regulatory burdens and military conflicts are further inflating operating costs. At various points over the past year, airspace across more than 14 countries has been closed, forcing longer routings, delays, and cancellations.

“It is an inefficient operating environment,” Menon said, warning of the risks posed by civil aircraft operating near active conflict zones, including spoofing of air navigation systems and the threat of aircraft being caught in military crossfire.

SAF ambitions clash with limited supply and high costs

Sustainability featured prominently on the agenda. AAPA airlines have committed to a collective target of 5% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) utilisation by 2030, but concern is growing over the slow pace of supply development.

“Aviation is a hard-to-abate sector for carbon emissions, yet we are asked to rely mostly on a hard-to-get commodity called SAF,” Menon told delegates, arguing that fuel suppliers must shoulder greater responsibility for delivering SAF at scale and at competitive prices.

IATA highlights Asia Pacific growth and air traffic management risks

IATA data presented at the assembly underlined Asia Pacific’s role as the fastest-growing aviation market globally. October passenger demand grew 8.1% year-on-year in the region, compared with 2.5% in North America and 6.7% in Europe, with international traffic to and from China, Japan, and Vietnam all posting double-digit growth.

IATA Director General Willie Walsh described the region as “the largest market in the world,” accounting for around 35% of global commercial traffic. However, he warned that airline expansion and airport investment risk being constrained by outdated air traffic management systems.

Walsh also addressed safety concerns, including lithium-ion battery risks and passenger behaviour during evacuations, noting an increase in incidents involving travellers attempting to retrieve cabin baggage.

Resolutions focus on safety, sustainability, and supply chain resilience

The assembly concluded with the adoption of four resolutions covering aviation sustainability, safety, taxes and charges, and supply chain strengthening. Looking ahead, AAPA signalled a clear focus on collaboration with regulators and suppliers to improve resilience and maintain connectivity across the region.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/4-Singapore-Airlines-Boeing-777-scaled.png,N,,2025-12-21 08:57:08.866635

Azzera Inc. has announced that JETEX is now one of its key strategic investors in their digital carbon-management initiative. This funding positions Azzera to further enhance its technology offerings and expand its global reach while providing new tools aimed at helping clients offset their emissions effectively.

The collaboration established during the Dubai Airshow represents a pivotal move towards promoting cleaner operations within the aviation industry. As part of this partnership, JETEX will collaborate with Azzera as it begins procuring sustainable aviation fuel for its fleet early next year-a landmark step in their commitment to sustainability.

Azzera also revealed that JETEX will serve as a primary partner on the new SAF Productivity Operations and Delivery (SAF POD) platform. This tool is specifically designed to alleviate administrative challenges associated with adopting SAF across supply chains-an essential factor for scaling up usage among operators globally. The platform will be integrated into CELESTE, allowing aircraft operators seamless access to manage fuel tracking and emission reductions efficiently.

Moreover, by incorporating the FlyBeyond API into its charter sales framework, JETEX enables real-time carbon offsetting options directly within flight quotes-making it easier than ever for customers and operators alike to make sustainable decisions when booking flights.

“Our collaboration with JETEX reflects our mutual commitment towards embedding sustainability into every aspect of air travel,” stated Puja Mahajan, CEO of Azzera. “Together we are transforming climate aspirations into actionable strategies through user-friendly technologies that promote transparency and accountability.”

Adel Mardini, CEO of JETEX remarked on this partnership: “As one of the largest entities in private aviation globally, we recognize our duty toward achieving ambitious climate goals within our industry. Partnering with Azzera allows us not only to innovate but also drive substantial progress toward decarbonization.”

This investment marks an important milestone as part of Azzera’s recent capital raise totaling USD $800 million aimed at advancing their digital ecosystem focused on emissions management compliance automation alongside access to premium carbon markets via CELESTE.",https://fullavantenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120989-jetex-invests-in-azzera-to-advance-sustainable-aviation-initiatives.jpg,N,,2025-12-21 07:57:22.369489

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov.","The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Friday, Dec. 19 issued a long-awaited Dakota Access Pipeline environmental impact statement, recommending that the pipeline keep operating, but with some new conditions for its Missouri River crossing in North Dakota.

The pipeline has been operating since June 2017, carrying crude oil from North Dakota’s Bakken oil field to Illinois. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe has opposed the project and challenged it in court, citing concerns about impacts to the tribe’s Missouri River water supply.

A federal judge in 2020 revoked the easement for the pipeline crossing under the Missouri River just north of the Standing Rock reservation, requiring additional environmental study.

The 464-page environmental impact statement evaluated five alternatives, including denying the easement or rerouting the pipeline. The corps said its preferred alternative grants the easement, allowing the pipeline to keep operating, but with some additional conditions.

The recommendation is not official until after a 30-day waiting period required under the National Environmental Policy Act. After that period concludes on Jan. 20, 2026, the corps may issue a record of decision.

The options evaluated were:

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline by removal.

Deny the easement and abandon the pipeline in place.

Grant the easement with the same conditions as the previous easement, which Dakota Access LLC prefers.

Grant the easement with additional conditions.

Construct and operate a pipeline reroute north of Bismarck.

In its analysis, the corps wrote that the fourth option, granting the easement with conditions, protects environmental resources and responds to comments raised by tribal nations.

The conditions aim to prevent an oil spill and minimize the impacts of a spill, such as implementing new leak detection technology as it becomes available and conducting groundwater monitoring and surface water sampling.

The corps held two meetings in Bismarck in November 2023 to collect public comment on the environmental impact statement. At the time, corps officials said the final statement was expected in 2024.

In interviews after those 2023 meetings, the chairs of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe said the Dakota Access Pipeline was operating illegally without a permit and should be shut down. Tribal leaders and environmental groups have also raised concerns about an inadequate spill response plan.

North Dakota officials, meanwhile, have supported the continuing operation of the pipeline.

“After eight years of operating safely, the Dakota Access Pipeline has become an essential part of our nation’s energy infrastructure,” Gov. Kelly Armstrong said in a statement. “Its continued operation will ensure energy security and affordability for the country while providing positive economic impact that touches every North Dakotan.”

“We are certainly working everyday on both fuels demand and opportunities,” says Caleb Ragland, President of the American Soybean Association (ASA). He is also a farmer based in Magnolia, Kentucky.

“Whether it be biodiesel, renewable diesel—there are opportunities with SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), and there’s different feed stocks that can be used in SAF,” says Ragland. “As the saying goes, ‘The rising tide lifts all boats,’ and biofuels are such an exciting opportunity for the soybean industry that we must be pursuing.”

He tells Hoosier Ag Today that he and other soybean producers will continue to press your lawmakers on Capitol Hill to pass legislation in 2026 to further expand the biofuels industry.

“We have opportunities right now that need to be completed by Congress,” says Ragland. “We have the 45Z tax credit that’s hanging out there that needs to be done. We have the Renewable Volume Obligations, RVO’s, that need to be completed. That number has been debated and beaten to death. It’s time to get the deal done.”

“We need Congress to step up and make it happen. That’s good for demand, and it brings stability and some certainty to our industry, as well, that we desperately need,” he says.

Ragland adds that the expansion of biodiesel would truly be a win for everyone.

“The American farmer is growing a product that is getting used here domestically. It’s creating fuel that is good for the environment. It’s good for the economy. It brings jobs. It brings economic opportunity to our farms, which ties back to economic opportunity for all of our rural communities. That local farmer dollar gets turned over 6-to-8 times, at least, locally. It’s also good for all of the small businesses and it’s just good for everybody involved,” says Ragland.

Indiana is home to one of the largest biodiesel production facilities in the U.S.—which is Louis Dreyfus near Claypool in Kosciusko County. The facility currently produces around 99 million gallons of biodiesel each year.

Brazil closes 2025 with a decisive step toward the decarbonization of aviation. In early December, Petrobras announced the first production and delivery of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) fully produced in the country.

The milestone gained further relevance with the official participation of Anac (Brazil’s National Civil Aviation Agency) in the launch, reinforcing that the product meets the most rigorous international sustainability standards.

The initiative places Brazil among the countries that have taken effective steps to transform the aviation sector, one of the most complex industries when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

What SAF is

SAF – or Sustainable Aviation Fuel – is designed to replace conventional jet fuel partially or entirely.

Its main advantage is full compatibility with aircraft and existing airport infrastructure, without the need for technical adaptations.

In practice, this allows airlines to reduce carbon emissions immediately by using a certified fuel that is internationally recognized as one of the leading solutions for decarbonizing air transport.

Fully Brazilian SAF production with international certification

Petrobras’ SAF was produced through coprocessing at the Duque de Caxias Refinery (Reduc), in Rio de Janeiro, using technical corn oil (TCO), a residual vegetable-based feedstock.

According to official data, the fuel can reduce net CO₂ emissions by up to 87 percent in the renewable portion of the product.

The Brazilian SAF received ISCC-CORSIA certification (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification – Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), confirming its compliance with the rules of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

This certification is essential for the fuel to be accepted in international operations, ensuring sustainability, traceability and quality standards recognized worldwide.

Anac reinforces regulatory certainty and credibility

Anac attended the ceremony marking Petrobras’ first SAF production and delivery, highlighting the relevance of the fuel for the future of aviation in Brazil.

According to the agency, the fact that SAF is produced entirely in the country and already meets international criteria represents an important step forward for the development of the domestic market.

In this first phase, 3,000 cubic meters (m³) of SAF were produced and sold to distributors operating at Rio de Janeiro/Galeão International Airport. This volume corresponds to approximately one day of aviation fuel consumption across airports in the state of Rio de Janeiro, demonstrating the product’s operational viability.

Contribution to global decarbonization targets

The launch of SAF comes at a strategic moment for the aviation sector.

From 2027 onward, airlines will be required to comply with CORSIA, ICAO’s global program aimed at reducing emissions from international flights. In Brazil, the use of sustainable fuels is also aligned with the guidelines established by the Future Fuel Law (Lei do Combustível do Futuro).

By anticipating SAF production and certification, Petrobras offers the domestic market a solution ready to meet future regulatory requirements, reducing dependence on imports and strengthening Brazil’s energy industry.

A tangible step forward in the just energy transition

With institutional backing from Anac and compliance with international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization, sustainable aviation fuel moves beyond promise and becomes a tangible part of the present and future of air transport in Brazil.

This strengthens the country’s industry and energy sovereignty, opening the way for a new cycle of innovation and sustainability in the national aviation sector.

By closing the year with this major achievement, Brazil demonstrates that it is prepared to lead the global decarbonization agenda with real, certified and competitive solutions.",https://bricsbrasil.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/BRICS-Brasil-SAF-da-Petrobras.png,N,,2025-12-20 20:56:34.753940
