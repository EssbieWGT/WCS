2025 ACE conference - Brian Jennings, ACE (16:19)","There is a lot of optimism in the ethanol industry right now that 2025 is the year the ethanol industry will finally win the ability to sell 15 percent ethanol blended fuel nationwide all year long.

American Coalition for Ethanol CEO Brian Jennings said at the organization’s annual meeting this week that the odds seem to favor passage of legislation before the end of the year. “The board asked me to give odds for our likelihood of getting the bipartisan National Fuel Retailer and Consumer Choice Act across the finish line this year. And I told them I thought it was better than 50 percent,” said Jennings. “Congressman Dusty Johnson bested me and he said it’s north of 70%. And that’s really encouraging to hear.”

Small refinery exemptions are back in the news this week with the Trump administration expected to possibly make an announcement today on the fate of nearly 200 pending SRE requests. Jennings hopes the roller coaster saga of exemptions over the past two presidential administrations will finally find some middle ground.

“It’s a really challenging job and they’re not going to make everyone happy. And we know that they’re likely to approve some, they’re likely to deny some. The refiners are gonna complain, and we might too,” said Jennings. “The good news is that the second Trump administration is taking the approach we were hoping for all along for the future…For 2026 and 2027 when, and there will be some, when the Trump EPA allows refinery exemptions, the gallons of renewable fuel those small refineries were supposed to blend will be reallocated to other refiners. In other words, the RVOs remain whole. And that’s exactly the way we wanted it done.”

Jennings also talks about 45Z and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as the RFS 20 years later, in this interview from the ACE Annual Conference in Sioux Falls, SD.

Contact us Develop your energy tax credit strategy with professional guidance.","Tax credit transferability remains a powerful cash planning strategy for developers and investors. Introduced by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), project owners can sell their tax clean energy credits for cash — making it easier to access capital and plan strategically.

While the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) rolled back certain energy incentives, tax credit transferability remains largely intact, creating a clear runway to transact credits for the next several years and keeping this powerful tax planning strategy firmly in play.

What is tax credit transferability?

Enacted under the IRA, Section 6418 of the Internal Revenue Code allows entities that generate certain federal clean energy tax credits to sell them to unrelated parties for cash. This is especially beneficial for developers who lack sufficient tax liabilities to use the credits themselves. It’s also an attractive alternative to historical tax equity structures that typically lock investors into partnerships for a number of years.

On the buy side of the transfer market, taxpaying C corporations can’t seem to get enough of the savings afforded by transferable credits. Due to the way Section 6418 was drafted, individuals with passive activity tax liabilities can also benefit from credit purchases; however, C corporation buyers have dominated the market.

Paying less than face value for a credit (sometimes as much as 15%), and not being taxed on the savings, seems like one of those too-good-to-be-true opportunities. But these savings are real, and corporations have flocked to the transfer market to lighten their tax bills and improve cash flow.

What the OBBBA changed — and didn’t change

Despite early drafts of the OBBBA proposing rollbacks to tax credit transferability, the final legislation preserved Section 6418’s framework, albeit with some restrictions.

Most notably, credits now cannot be transferred to prohibited foreign entities, aligning with broader national security and trade policy goals.

Additionally, the OBBBA chipped away at some of the underlying credits eligible for transfer. The most significant of these changes relates to wind and solar projects, which have been highly transacted in the market.

These projects are now facing a loss of eligibility due to the OBBBA’s accelerated termination date. Namely, projects that begin construction after July 4, 2026, must now be placed in service by the end of 2027 to qualify for investment and production tax credits under Sections 48E and 45Y, respectively. Projects that start before this date are not subject to the accelerated deadline but must still be placed in service within four years after the year construction begins to meet the continuity safe harbor.

In conjunction with the accelerated termination for wind and solar credits, the IRS further tightened compliance and documentation standards, particularly around the beginning of construction safe harbor provisions.

These changes will force many wind and solar developers to accelerate project plans to preserve tax credit eligibility.

Manufacturing credits are becoming buyer favorites

Two of the newly created credits under the IRA — Sections 45X and 45Z — directly benefit certain clean energy manufacturing activities. They’re also becoming favorites among buyers since they can generate a steady stream of credits, can be transacted in tranches on a quarterly basis, and are viewed as less risky than other credits because they’re generally not subject to recapture.

Section 45X: The tax code’s ultimate manufacturing incentive

Effective January 1, 2023, the Section 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit has been a golden goose of sorts for clean energy manufacturers in the United States.

Applicable to a wide range of clean energy components — from solar equipment to critical minerals — Section 45X has developed a unique position in the market due to the large credits it can generate and the flexibility it can give buyers from a transferability perspective.

Additionally, it’s safer risk profile in the eyes of many buyers has often led to higher market pricing when compared to other transferable credits.

The OBBBA left Section 45X largely intact, although it did accelerate the phaseout of wind energy components. On the flipside, a new qualified mineral was added: metallurgical coal.

Perhaps the biggest change relates to the new prohibited foreign entity rules effective for tax years beginning after July 4, 2025. The new provisions will require many manufacturers to evaluate their supply chains to avoid tripping the “material assistance” rules, although further guidance is needed to define their meaning and scope.

Section 45Z: A new era for clean fuel tax credits

Effective January 1, 2025, Section 45Z introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, an incentive aimed at decarbonizing the transportation sector. The credit rewards producers of transportation fuels — both sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and non-SAF fuels — based on their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.

The OBBBA extended Section 45Z through December 31, 2029, originally slated for termination at the end of 2027 under the IRA.

Section 45Z consolidates and replaces several pre-IRA fuel credits and is expected to bring a surge of new production tax credits to the marketplace. Moreover, it’s expected to gain popularity with buyers due to its flexibility in terms of timing and cash flows.

How CLA can help with tax credit transactions

Despite some rollbacks of the IRA, the retention of Section 6418 in the OBBBA fosters tax credit monetization opportunities for both renewable energy developers and corporate taxpayers.

New changes to the SRE data dashboard, as reflected on Aug. 22, include the approval of two SRE petitions for 2016, with one SRE petition approved for 2017.
The EPA previously listed five 2022 petitions as being denied, but now only lists three SRE petitions as denied.","The U.S. EPA on Aug. issued decisions on 175 small refinery exemption (SRE) petitions, granting full or partial exemptions of Renewable Fuel Standard blending obligations for 143 petitions. According to the EPA, 13 SRE petitions remain pending.

The 175 SRE petitions the agency issued decisions for were filed by 38 refineries and span RFS compliance years 2016-2024. In consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy, the EPA said it reviewed all information submitted by each individual refinery in support of its petition. The agency said it also evaluated each SRE petition consistent with the Clean Air Act and case law.

After reviewing all information, the EPA said it granted full exemptions to 63 petitions, granted partial exemptions to 77 petitions, denied 28 petitions and determined 7 petitions to be ineligible. In a document detailing its SRE decisions, the EPA clarified that 82 of the 175 petitions were not previously adjudicated, meaning the agency had not previously issued a decision to approve to deny those 82 petitions. The remaining 93 SRE petitions had previously been ruled on by the agency but were subject to legal challenges and ultimately remanded to the agency for reconsideration.

According to the EPA, its online data dashboard also reflects the status of 34 SRE petitions for 2016-2018 that were previously approved by the agency and challenged via lawsuits. “We are not adjudicating these petitions in this document; instead, we rely on our prior actions to determine their status,” the EPA said in a document outlining its SRE decisions.

Changes made in EPA’s online data dashboard reflect status changes for both the 175 SRE petitions the agency ruled on Aug. 22 and the agency’s decision articulate the status of the 34 legally challenged SRE petitions, as referenced above.

New changes to the SRE data dashboard, as reflected on Aug. 22, include the approval of two SRE petitions for 2016, with one SRE petition approved for 2017. For RFS compliance year 2018, the dashboard indicates 29 full approvals, three partial approvals, and six denials. For compliance year 2019, the dashboard shows 25 full approvals and four partial approvals. Only seven SRE petitions received full approvals for RFS compliance year 2020, with 17 partial approvals and six denials. For 2021, the dashboard reflects 15 full approvals and six partial approvals. The EPA had previously listed four SRE petitions for 2021 as being denied, but as of Aug. 22 only one denial is listed on the agency’s SRE data dashboard. The EPA also declared two 2021 petitions as ineligible, with two petitions currently listed as pending. For 2022, the EPA issued six full approvals and 14 partial approvals. The EPA previously listed five 2022 petitions as being denied, but now only lists three SRE petitions as denied. In addition, one 2022 petition was declared ineligible. For compliance year 2023, the dashboard shows six full approvals and 14 partial approvals, with one SRE petition declared ineligible, while for 2025, the agency issued four full approvals, 18 partial approvals, five denials and declared three SRE petitions ineligible. The EPA did not act on the 11 SRE petitions currently pending for compliance year 2025.

Overall, 293 SRE petitions have been filed for compliance year 2016-2025, with 146 fully approved, 77 partially approved, 36 denied, 13 declared ineligible, eight withdrawn and 13 pending.

The number of full and partial denials for 2016-2024 effectively waives RFS blending requirements for 8.49 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel, equating to an estimated 9.37 billion renewable identification numbers (RINs). For 2024 alone, the approved SRE petitions account for 730 million RINs, or approximately 3.39% of the year’s total RVO, which was estimated at 21.54 billion RINs.

The agency said its actions reaffirm a policy set during the first Trump administration in the 2020 renewable volume obligation (RVO) rulemaking to grant a 50% exemption where a small refinery has demonstrated it has faced a partial hardship. Under the DOE’s 2011 small refinery study, small refineries would have been denied any relief despite demonstrating partial hardship.

“With today’s action, EPA is getting the SRE program back on track with an approach that recognizes some small refineries are impacted more significantly than others and that EPA’s relief should reflect those differences,” the agency said in an announcement.

The EPA also reaffirmed a policy to return RINs that were previously retired for compliance when a small refinery receives an exemption for a prior compliance year. Because RINs have a two-year window for use, the EPA said 2022 and earlier vintage RINs will not impact the number of RINs available to meet 2024 and future compliance obligations and are not expected to impact demand for biofuels.

In addition, the EPA said it will “in the near future” submit a draft supplemental proposed rule to the White House Office of Management and Budget on proposed reallocations of the 2023 and later compliance year exempted volumes. The EPA said it will also provide updated information on how the agency intends to project SREs for 2026 and 2027 in the context of establishing percentage standards for those years. “The proposed adjustments will help ensure that refineries blend the intended volumes of renewable fuel into the nation’s fuel supply in 2026 and 2027 after accounting for the SREs granted for 2023 and 2024 in today’s actions and projected SREs granted for 2025 – 2027 in Set 2,” the agency said. “The supplemental proposal will seek to balance the goals of the RFS in supporting the production and use of renewable fuels while taking into account economic impacts, following the law, and ensuring opportunity for stakeholder comment.”

The Renewable Fuels Association said it continues to question whether these SREs are truly justified, but noted the EPA’s approve for implementing these exemptions appears reasonable and should not disrupt the market place or reduce actual renewable fuel consumption.

“While RFA continues to doubt that the small refineries receiving exemptions today truly experienced ‘disproportionate economic hardship’ due to the RFS, we are pleased to see EPA taking an approach to implementation of these exemptions that is minimally disruptive to the marketplace and affirms the agency’s intent to reallocate renewable fuel volumes lost to SREs,” said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the RFA. “We appreciate that EPA is focused on an approach that maintains stability in the marketplace and ensures finalized annual volumes under the RFS are maintained. The exemptions granted today should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use. It is critical, however, that the renewable fuel blending volumes associated with SREs for 2023 and 2024 are fully reallocated.

“In the days ahead, RFA will be further analyzing EPA’s new approach and rationale for determining disproportionate economic hardship,” Cooper added. “According to EPA’s previous analysis, all refiners—both small and large—recoup their RIN costs when they sell gasoline and diesel. Thus, there is no credible evidence that small refiners are disproportionately affected by RFS compliance, or that the financial impact of RFS compliance rises to a level anywhere close to ‘economic hardship.’ In any case, SREs were always intended to be a temporary measure and a bridge to compliance—not a permanent handout. Small refiners have now had two full decades to adapt their operations to comply with the RFS.”

Growth Energy is calling on EPA to reallocate waived RVOs. “With more than 140 granted refinery exemptions, today's decision alone does not give farmers and biofuel producers the certainty they need,"" said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “It is imperative that EPA reallocates each and every exempt gallon in a forthcoming rule to mitigate the potentially devastating impact on biofuel demand. We appreciate EPA’s commitment to issue a rule that ensures promised homegrown biofuel gallons reach the marketplace and upholds the administration’s commitment to American energy dominance.”

The American Coalition for Ethanol also called EPA’s approach “reasonable.”

“EPA appears to be carefully trying to balance the recent caselaw and the RFS statute when it comes to their new methodology for small refinery exemptions,” said Brian Jennings, CEO of ACE. “The good news is that EPA is proposing to reallocate any and all small refinery exemptions they grant for 2023 and beyond, which is how the SRE program should be implemented. EPA will issue a supplemental proposal on how they intend to reallocate exempted gallons for 2023 and beyond, and their reallocation methodology will be incorporated into the final ‘Set 2’ rule later this year which also covers the 2026 and 2027 renewable volume obligations.

“The agency argues they’re not going to reallocate for exempted gallons granted to small refineries for the 2016 through 2022 RFS compliance years because those RINs are expired and it will not have an impact on blending,” Jennings continued. “That may be true, and we will carefully monitor how the D6 RIN market reacts to this news. In the past, SREs led to depressed RIN values which discourages blending of E15 and higher blends. Overall, however, the approach proposed by EPA looks reasonable.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America expressed wariness of the agency’s award to the refiners of more than 1.4 billion RINs from compliance years 2023 and 2024 to be used for the delayed compliance deadline for 2024. “EPA’s course correction on RFS small refinery exemptions creates fresh uncertainty for America’s farmers and biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF producers,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs at Clean Fuels. “We look forward to working with the agency to ensure today’s decision does not unwind the strong signal of support issued in June through robust RFS volumes meant to drive growth and recognize investment in domestic fuels and American agriculture.”

Clean Fuel stressed that in the recently proposed RVOs for 2026 and 2027 and draft regulatory impact analysis, EPA reiterated that its analyses consistently show “all obligated parties—including small refiners—fully recover the costs of RFS compliance” through fuel sales.

“EPA’s announcement conflicts with its consistent finding that small refiners are not facing disproportionate economic hardships from RFS compliance,” Kovarik continued. “Refunding retired RINs has the potential to undercut current markets for domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel, and SAF as well as for American oilseed crops and other feedstocks. This announcement comes just as farmers begin planning to harvest the year’s soybean crop, which is expected to achieve a record-setting yield. We urge EPA to ensure that small refinery exemptions do not undermine the market for farmers and clean fuel producers.”

The Advanced Biofuels Association (ABFA) has spoken out in support of EPA’s plan to reallocate waived volumes. “We are grateful to see EPA take action addressing the extensive backlog of small refinery exemptions,” said Michael McAdams, president of the ABFA. “ABFA is also pleased that the agency plans to prepare a supplemental proposed rule for the reallocation of the exempted volumes for those years where compliance is yet to be demonstrated as well as how to account for exemptions in future years.

“Exemptions have a significant impact on the value of Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs),” McAdams continued. “When RIN values drop, the entire advanced biofuels market is destabilized and put at risk, significantly impacting consumers downstream. ABFA looks forward to reviewing the proposed rule for reallocation and forecasting adjustments that can strengthen the market for all parties""

“A ban on landfilling wind turbine blades will help accelerate the development of sustainable recycling technologies.
This is alongside some countries aiming to introduce strict requirements for wind turbine recycling.
When wind turbine blades are decommissioned, they normally end up in landfill.
Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I and Siemens Gamesa UK, says: ""Seeing the first recyclable blades being installed in UK waters is a major landmark moment.","The standard lifespan of an onshore windfarm is 20-25 years.

Around 90% of a wind farm being can be recycled, but the blades are sometimes seen as a challenge.

WindEurope is calling for a Europe-wide ban on landfilling turbine blades by 2025.

Giles Dickson, CEO at WindEurope, says: “Wind energy is a green technology. Sustainability is part of our DNA.

“That’s why we are constantly striving to further reduce our impact on the environment.

“A ban on landfilling wind turbine blades will help accelerate the development of sustainable recycling technologies. Austria, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands already have a landfill ban in place.

“But we call upon the European Commission to propose a harmonised European approach”

RWE has partnered with Siemens Gamesa to support the first large-scale installation of recyclable blades at a UK offshore windfarm.

How will the project work?

The rotor blades will be made from innovative resin.

The aim is that when the blade has come to the end of its operating life, the materials can be separated and as a result be recycled.

This could also be used in vehicle components and consumer goods like bicycles, helmets and suitcases.

RWE’s Sofia Offshore Wind Farm is now being fitted with 150 recycled blades across half of its 100 wind turbines.

“Deploying recyclable blades at this scale is an indicator of RWE’s drive to deliver sustainability across its renewables fleet.

“By working with partners like Siemens Gamesa, we are setting a new sustainability benchmark for renewables development and helping significantly improve the circularity of offshore wind technology.”

What is Siemen Gamesa's new technology?

Siemens says it is aiming to improve the circularity of windfarms due to the number of installations and turbine size increasing.

This is alongside some countries aiming to introduce strict requirements for wind turbine recycling.

The company says it is committed to producing 100% recyclable turbines by 2040.

When wind turbine blades are decommissioned, they normally end up in landfill.

Siemens Gamesa has pioneered RecyclableBlade technology so the blades can be reused in other industries.

It says the change was simple with and only required the introduction of its new resin.

Darren Davidson, Vice President of Siemens Energy UK&I and Siemens Gamesa UK, says: ""Seeing the first recyclable blades being installed in UK waters is a major landmark moment.

“Our Hull factory is at the cutting edge of blade technology development & manufacturing.

“As a global leader in energy technology, we’re proud to be partnering with RWE on Sofia, one of the largest offshore wind farms in the world.”

RWE's sustainability goals

Within a year, RWE says halved its emissions from the plants it operates, aiming to continue this journey through building more wind and solar assets to make climate-friendly energy systems a reality.

By 2030, the company aims to have more than a 70% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, with the end goal of achieving net zero by 2040.

Likely because of Bockstael’s connections, that includes more than 40 employees of KLM and Air France, Europe’s largest airline group.
“The fact that the calls for change are coming from within the aviation sector and from the employees themselves and even some senior leaders is very promising,” said Deborah McNamara, executive director of ClimateVoice, a non-profit that supports employee-led climate action.","Staff at major aviation companies, including Air France, KLM, Airbus and Lufthansa, are among hundreds of industry insiders calling on their leaders to undertake dramatically more ambitious action on climate.

The demands, organized by a pressure group known as Call Aviation to Action (CAA), include several that are at odds with the industry’s position on climate change, such as setting absolute emissions reduction targets. Hitting such targets would likely require limiting service, another strategy at odds with current plans.

“Call Aviation to Action started because we discovered that there are many, many people in the industry who are really concerned about climate change, but also very committed to aviation, and who were not able to speak up,” said Karel Bockstael, an aviation consultant and former vice president of sustainability at KLM who initiated the project with four other aviation professionals.

The industry’s existing net-zero ambition rests in part on the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), a 2016 agreement that requires participating airlines to cap emissions at 85 percent of 2019 levels. Any subsequent growth must be offset by purchasing CORSIA-approved carbon credits.

Around 30 airlines have also committed to near-term goals with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), or had those goals validated by the organization. To align with warming of no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the SBTi requires airlines to reduce emissions intensity by 30 percent and 50 percent in 2030 and 2035, respectively.

Fossil fuels ‘until the end of time’

Neither standard is sufficient if the industry is to stay within planetary boundaries, say the 443 people who have signed the CAA’s statement since it was issued in May.

Bockstael argued that CORSIA is flawed because many offset projects have failed to deliver claimed climate benefits. “It will support the fossil kerosene solution until the end of time,” he said. “If we do that then the growth will go on and at some point the availability of the offsets will not be enough.”

He praised the intent of the SBTi aviation standard, which requires that the industry as a whole stay within a total carbon budget identified as consistent with 1.5 degrees of warming. But CAA says the standard is undermined by overly optimistic assumptions about efficiency improvements and the idea that fossil jet fuel can be eliminated by 2050.

The organization argues instead that airlines should set a carbon budget for the industry — acknowledging a fair distribution of the budget across populations — then bring their goals in line with it. Signatories are also asking companies to lobby for regulation that “takes all players in our industry along in what is needed to respect the boundaries we are currently transgressing,” be more realistic about future technology gains and better manage demand, particularly in regions that have a larger share of historic emissions.

Insider influence

Environmental groups have long made similar demands, but the CAA is notable for its insider approach. Among the signatories are professionals working in supply chain, business development and strategy, as well as several pilots. Likely because of Bockstael’s connections, that includes more than 40 employees of KLM and Air France, Europe’s largest airline group.

“At KLM, we are doing everything we can to make flying cleaner, quieter and more fuel-efficient, step by step,” a company spokesperson told Trellis. “Making aviation more sustainable takes time, and progress isn’t as fast as we would like. But that doesn’t mean we’re standing still.” The airline is investing more than $8 billion in more efficient aircraft, the spokesperson added, and is one of the world’s largest purchasers of sustainable aviation fuel.

“The fact that the calls for change are coming from within the aviation sector and from the employees themselves and even some senior leaders is very promising,” said Deborah McNamara, executive director of ClimateVoice, a non-profit that supports employee-led climate action. “They’re the people who know what it’s like to work in this industry and who shape it.”

The group has continued to consult backers on next steps, which Bockstael said would be announced this fall.",https://trellis.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/trellis_editorial_aviation_emissions_1470x894.png,N,,2025-08-22 14:56:22.963510

Circularity Fuels has developed the Ouro reactor, a compact system that converts raw biogas from cow manure into synthesis gas, a key building block for sustainable jet fuel.

From Waste Lagoons to Flight Paths

The process begins with manure decomposing in farm lagoons, releasing methane and carbon dioxide. The Ouro reactor captures this raw biogas and transforms it directly into synthesis gas, which can then be refined into aviation-grade fuel through the Fischer–Tropsch process, a well-established industrial method. Crucially, Circularity Fuels says the reactor can operate without combustion and handle contaminants that would typically disable other reformers, eliminating the need for costly pre-treatment.

Company founder and CEO Dr Stephen Beaton believes the approach could turn farms into producers of renewable energy. “Farmers in the US and around the world are sitting on an untapped gold mine,” he said. “We are enabling them to turn waste into a profitable product that airlines desperately need.”

A Cheaper Path to Sustainable Fuel

The company claims the Ouro reactor is 100 times cheaper than conventional syngas systems. This makes it financially viable on a much smaller scale. The technology can connect to existing power grids. It can also be deployed directly on farms. It could allow the fuel production chain to begin at the source of the waste.

The potential supply is vast. The US livestock industry generates nearly half a billion tonnes of manure each year. Yet less than 6% currently feeds into biogas production. Circularity Fuels says wider adoption of its technology could unlock a significant portion of that untapped resource.

Meeting Aviation’s Sustainability Targets

Airlines are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions by incorporating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). At present, SAF accounts for barely 1% of global jet fuel consumption. Circularity Fuels suggests that if its technology were rolled out across US farms, landfills, and wastewater plants, it could generate up to 42 million gallons of fuel per day. It is enough to cover around 70% of America’s aviation demand.

The company is planning to stage a full demonstration at a California dairy farm later this year, converting manure-derived biogas all the way through to jet fuel. If successful, the Ouro reactor could offer a scalable route to both cleaner skies and new revenue streams for farmers, positioning waste as a critical part of the future energy mix.",https://orbitaltoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ouro-reactor.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 13:56:37.240023

This innovative technology, backed by the NEDO Green Innovation Fund, marks a major step in the chemical industry’s shift toward alternative, more sustainable feedstocks. The company plans to accelerate demonstration efforts with the goal of commercializing the process and offering it for licensing by the early 2030s.

Propylene, a fundamental building block in the chemical industry, is currently produced in Japan primarily from naphtha, a fossil fuel derivative. Ethanol, however, offers a renewable alternative, as it can be derived from biomass sources such as sugarcane, corn, and even non-edible materials like pulp. Recent advances have also made large-scale ethanol production from combustible waste more feasible, further strengthening its potential as a sustainable feedstock.

Sumitomo Chemical’s new process stands out by enabling the direct, single-step production of propylene from ethanol—eliminating the need for intermediates like ethylene, which are commonly involved in other methods. This streamlined approach not only promises to reduce production costs but also produces hydrogen as a by-product. When bioethanol is used, the hydrogen generated is also bio-based, adding further environmental value.

The company will continue collecting the technical data required to scale up the process and is preparing to promote polypropylene made from propylene produced via this new method. Commercialization and technology licensing are targeted for early next decade.

As part of its broader strategy, Sumitomo Chemical is reorienting its petrochemical operations to emphasize technologies that support environmental sustainability. Structural reforms are underway in both domestic and international markets, alongside increased efforts in technology licensing and catalyst sales, including for the ethanol-to-propylene process.

Looking ahead, Sumitomo Chemical plans to establish a green transformation (GX) solutions business beyond 2030. This new model will focus on building a circular value chain in collaboration with raw material providers and brand owners, while also monetizing carbon reduction efforts achieved through its technologies.

US exempts small refiners from biofuel quotas: Update

Updates throughout New York, 22 August (Argus) — The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today fully or partially granted the majority of small refiners' requests for waivers from federal biofuel blend mandates, while limiting the windfall for newly exempt refiners. The agency fully accepted 63 petitions, offered 50pc relief in response to 77 petitions, denied 28 requests, and determined that 7 were ineligible. Program data shows 13 petitions still pending, mostly from the 2025 compliance year. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires oil refiners and importers to blend biofuels into the conventional fuel supply or buy Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits from those that do. Refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d can request hardship exemptions from the mandates, which they have long cast as financially onerous. President Donald Trump's administration had an unprecedented backlog of requests to decide after courts took issue with former president Joe Biden's reasoning for mass denials. While the number of exemptions frustrated biofuel and farm advocates, small refiners that lobbied officials for retroactive compensation were denied more sweeping relief. EPA said on Friday that it would return already-surrendered RINs to newly exempt companies but that only credits from 2023 and later could be used for future compliance. Returned older credits, effectively worthless, ""are not expected to impact demand for biofuels"", the agency said. Because the older credits have no value, EPA does not plan to force oil companies to blend more biofuels to account for those exemptions. But EPA signaled a different approach for more recent years, saying that it planned to account for actual exemptions in 2023 and 2024 and expected exemptions in 2025 when setting future biofuel quotas. The agency said it would ""in the near future"" submit a proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget that will clarify its plan. EPA had already signaled that it would estimate future exemptions when setting biofuel mandates, but accounting for actual exemptions from active compliance years in addition would be a major shift that could increase costs for larger oil companies, if implemented. Program data show that affected small refiners have to submit about 1.4bn fewer RINs across 2023 and 2024 following Friday's exemptions — but companies without exemptions could have to make up that lost volume in the future depending on EPA's pending proposal. The total mandates in those years were 20.9bn RINs and 21.5bn RINs respectively. EPA said Friday it aimed to ensure stability in the often-volatile RIN market, noting that replacing expired credits with active ones would have flooded the market with 3bn more RINs. Current-year D6 ethanol credits rose 4pc and D4 biomass-based diesel credits rose 3pc on Friday, as traders saw EPA's solution to older-vintage credits as limiting supply increases. Biofuel groups, while frustrated that most eligible refiners won at least some relief, expressed cautious optimism about EPA's plan. Renewable Fuels Association president Geoff Cooper said Friday's exemptions ""should have little or no effect on current and future levels of renewable fuel production and use"". But companies will eagerly await more details about EPA's proposal to account for 2023 and 2024 waivers, which could come as soon as next week. EPA has signaled that it wants to finalize new biofuel mandates before November, but that timeline appears ambitious if the agency has to first take comment on a proposal that could drastically shift its formula for setting those mandates. Clean Fuels Alliance America, which represents biomass-based diesel producers, said that the new plan ""will delay the finalization of the 2026 and 2027 rule"". In a draft regulation earlier this year, EPA proposed record-high biofuel blending for those years. Court fights await Legal challenges are virtually guaranteed. The agency said that its decisions had ""nationwide scope or effect"" — an effort to steer litigation toward one federal circuit court rather than a hodgepodge of regional courts that might issue conflicting rulings. Small refiners denied full relief are likely to challenge the Trump administration's reasoning. EPA said it almost entirely relied on recommendations from the Department of Energy (DOE), which scores individual applications for ""disproportionate economic hardship"" and considers factors like a refiner's output of diesel compared to gasoline and its local market's acceptance of renewables. While EPA is legally required to consult with DOE, the new policy of largely deferring to that department's recommendations would be a major change from recent years. A 2022 study from the US Government Accountability Office concluded that DOE's methodology was ""critically flawed"", and EPA officials at the time told the watchdog agency that DOE's analysis no longer provided useful information. Accepting DOE scores appears to have led to some counterintuitive results, though specific details from applications are kept confidential. Par Pacific's 18,000 b/d Wyoming refinery earned full exemptions for three straight years before losing relief the next. Ergon's 23,000 b/d facility in West Virginia won partial exemptions for 2021 and 2024, but not the years in between. And EPA offered at least some relief to Suncor's 36,000 b/d Commerce City East refinery over six straight years — while denying any relief for four of those years to Suncor's 67,000 b/d Commerce City West refinery at the same Colorado site. ""Not a lot of rhyme or reason to it"", a refining source told Argus . The unpredictability of the exemptions — with essentially all refiners receiving different answers depending on the year — could also make it hard for EPA to estimate future waivers when finalizing biofuel quotas. The agency has received some exemption petitions for 2025 but has yet to decide any for that year or beyond. Large oil refiners will also hotly oppose any effort from EPA to raise their biofuel blending to compensate for their smaller competitors winning exemptions. While some oil companies joined with farm groups this year to push for higher biofuel mandates, the industry has more recently expressed frustration with Trump-backed biofuel policies that they say are boosting feedstock and fuel costs. ""It is inexplicable that EPA is even considering adding more mandated biofuels on top of the largest and most expensive [Renewable Fuel Standard] mandate ever proposed by reallocating exempted volumes"", the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers said.

Brazil updates Cop 30 forest fund plan

Sao Paulo, 22 August (Argus) — Brazil has advanced its Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) initiative, a fund to preserve global tropical forests that will be launched at the UN Cop 30 summit, adding new governance and financing structures. Under the updated plan, TFFF will act through two distinct entities: the Tropical Forest Investment Fund (TFIF), a legally independent investment vehicle, and TFFF itself, hosted initially by the World Bank. The TFIF will blend sponsor capital — 20pc from sovereign and philanthropic sources and 80pc raised via bond issuance to institutional investors. Returns from this portfolio will fund annual payments to participating countries, starting at $4/ha of preserved forest. Payments are subject to an inflation adjustment, capped at 2pc/yr. It aims to raise $25bn in sponsor capital and an additional $100bn in senior market debt. TFIF will ""exclude investments that cause significant environmental impact"", such as those in activities related coal, peat, oil and natural gas. The updated plan also adds that funded countries must maintain deforestation rates below 0.5pc and will face steep payment discounts for forest loss or degradation. Each hectare (ha) deforested could reduce payments by up to 200ha worth of funding, depending on severity. It also includes a canopy coverage threshold of 20–30pc within specific mapping for countries to apply to the fund. That threshold is subject to updated degradation and deforestation discount ratios. It also highlights that TFFF will not generate or issue carbon or biodiversity credits, nor will it replace other existing forest finance initiatives such as REDD+. Instead, it is ""designed to complement, not duplicate, existing programs"". Finally, the TFFF has reduced its repayment term to 30 years — adding a 10-year grace period — and will require that at least 20pc of payments be allocated to indigenous peoples and local communities. Brazil plans to launch TFFF during Cop 30, which it will host in November in northern Para state. Deforestation is one of Brazil's flagship issues for the summit. The TFFF working group expects to conclude the details of the fund's financial model by September. It then expects initial pledges from sponsor countries to begin after the World Bank board's meeting from 13-18 October. The Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization countries — Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela — will sign a joint declaration in favor of TFFF on Friday, Brazil's government said. Brazil is working to eliminate deforestation — both legal and illegal — by 2030, to meet its emissions reductions targets under the Paris climate agreement.

Incentive to book German Rehden gas storage decreases

London, 22 August (Argus) — The financial incentive to book capacity at the largest German gas storage site Rehden for the remainder of this storage year continues to decrease. Available injection capacity at Sefe's Rehden storage site in combination with maintenance in October have rendered bookings at the storage site unattractive, with a worse outlook each day that passes without additional bookings. Sefe has offered a doubled injection rate of 1.75 GWh/d since 16 July from 882 MWh/d in previous auctions. As of today, the firm had only sold 13.96TWh of capacity out of 44.68TWh of technical capacity. As a result of the increased injection rate on offer, Sefe can only sell 24.6TWh or 55pc of the site's technical capacity. The boosted injection rate did contribute to further bookings at first, but has not done so in recent auctions. It would take 64 days to completely fill a bundle, and given maintenance on 6-24 October at the storage site, if firms were to book capacity today and inject at the increased firm injection rate from Saturday, it would only fill the bundle by 8 November. Factoring in injection days in each month, the average THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.35/MWh. Market participants have indicated that a €1.80-2/MWh spread is needed for them to profitably book and make use of Rehden space. And every day that capacity is not booked brings the required injection period further into November, reducing the incentive. The THE November first-quarter 2026 spread is narrower than that of earlier months, closing at -€0.305/MWh at the last close, much tighter than the THE balance-of-August first-quarter 2026 spread of -€1.87/MWh. But if Sefe were to offer additional injection capacity, this would improve the incentive to book space at the site. Sefe could offer 3.11 GWh/d of injection capacity — which would further reduce the storage capacity it can offer — and still fill the site to 45pc of capacity, in line with Germany's national storage law. This would allow firms to fill a bundle in 36 days, before the start of October maintenance. If a firm were to book capacity today and inject at this rate from Saturday, it would fill the storage space by 28 September. Considering these injection days, the THE spread to the first-quarter 2026 contract at the last close would be -€1.81/MWh, bringing it within the profitable margin. Other storage sites currently more attractive Storage capacity at other storage sites in Germany is currently more attractive to book than at Rehden, when only considering injection rates. Space at the Etzel ESE (Uniper Energy Storage), Epe-L (RWE), Nuttermoor H-5 (EWE), Jemgum H (EWE) and Nuttermoor H-4 (EWE) storage sites is currently more attractive to book than Rehden based on their firm injection rates ( see table ). All these storage sites, where a total of 7.32TWh of capacity is available, currently offer higher firm injection rates per GWh of capacity than Rehden.

The agreement focuses on using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and adopting wider environmental performance measures.
Lufthansa Cargo, which already uses SAF in its operations, agrees to supply the fuel for SHEIN shipments, backed by documentation known as 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates.
Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.
“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” says Ashwin Bhat, CEO at Lufthansa Cargo.","SHEIN has entered a partnership with Lufthansa Cargo to examine how its global deliveries can move towards lower-emission air transport.

The agreement focuses on using sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and adopting wider environmental performance measures.

SAF adoption and carbon-cutting plans

Sustainable aviation fuel is a liquid fuel alternative produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues or non-food crops.

It can replace traditional jet fuel with fewer lifecycle carbon emissions.

Lufthansa Cargo, which already uses SAF in its operations, agrees to supply the fuel for SHEIN shipments, backed by documentation known as 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates.

These certificates record the emissions saved when SAF replaces fossil-based aviation fuel and are verified by third-party standards.

The MoU outlines plans for SAF-based offsetting solutions to be in place within six months.

Both companies agree to treat SAF not as a final fix but as one part of a broader carbon reduction strategy.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network.”

This includes the potential for lower-carbon energy sources, alongside operational measures aimed at improving overall transport efficiency.

Lufthansa Cargo brings its experience in SAF procurement and deployment to the table, sharing knowledge with SHEIN as both sides commit to a joint learning approach.

For SHEIN, which does not operate its own aircraft but uses third-party air freight to move products between suppliers and global markets, the partnership opens new avenues to cut emissions across supply routes.

Transparency and traceability take centre stage

A key part of the agreement lies in the focus on data. Both companies agree to collaborate on environmental reporting and data sharing to improve traceability in emissions tracking.

This will include analysis of operational efficiency, such as how fuel use relates to freight volumes and flight routing.

By combining their data, the two organisations aim to uncover patterns that could inform emissions reductions across logistics.

The MoU also signals an intent to explore shared methodologies for assessing sustainability performance, particularly in relation to fleet efficiency and process quality.

“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” says Ashwin Bhat, CEO at Lufthansa Cargo.

“It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.”

“Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.""

The companies have also committed to exploring how better traceability tools can support measurable improvements in sustainability, looking into fleet-wide performance metrics and quality assurance within air transport systems.

Broader goals but no binding targets

While the MoU signals intent, it does not include binding commitments or legally enforced emissions targets. Instead, it sets a framework for pilot projects and trial initiatives that could feed into wider efforts across the logistics sector.

It leaves the door open for the expansion of SAF use, dependent on feasibility and the evolving supply of fuel sources.

The focus is on enabling practical steps that can be tested and refined over time.

“While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions,” says Ethan.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/89bcaea1738e91114836a871c9cd9626:a216ebbcf408aafac09e8a7040710442/shein-lufthansa-1.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 12:56:50.407471

By pioneering the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), these industry giants aim to revolutionize the way goods are transported. While the adoption of SAF presents a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions in the air cargo sector, challenges around availability and scalability persist. This groundbreaking partnership not only sets a new standard for eco-conscious logistics but also signals a pivotal shift towards greener practices in global supply chains.

The Potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

The collaboration between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo marks a significant milestone in the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) within the air freight industry. As the world grapples with the urgent need to reduce carbon emissions, SAF presents a promising solution to mitigate the environmental impact of air cargo operations. Despite the current challenges surrounding the availability and scalability of SAF, the partnership between these two industry leaders showcases a proactive approach towards embracing greener practices in logistics. By piloting the integration of SAF into Shein's supply chain, the companies are not only setting a new standard for sustainability but also paving the way for other players to follow suit in reducing their carbon footprint.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that SAF accounted for just 0.3 percent of global jet fuel production in 2024, highlighting the nascent stage of this eco-friendly alternative. However, the potential impact of SAF on reducing carbon emissions is substantial, with studies showing that it can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. As Shein ships thousands of tonnes of cargo daily, even a single flight powered by SAF could lead to a significant reduction in emissions for that journey. This initiative not only aligns with the companies' environmental goals but also sets a precedent for the industry to embrace sustainable practices in air freight operations.

Addressing Environmental Challenges in Air Cargo

The environmental impact of air cargo transportation has long been a concern due to its high carbon footprint compared to other modes of shipping. According to Freightos, air freight shipments generate significantly more pollution than ocean freight shipments, underscoring the urgency for sustainable alternatives in the logistics sector. Shein, a major player in the fast-fashion industry, heavily relies on air cargo for its product deliveries, contributing to substantial upstream transportation emissions. Despite efforts to shift towards land or sea routes where feasible, the company's reliance on air freight remains a critical aspect of its business model, necessitating innovative solutions to reduce its carbon emissions effectively.

The partnership between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo not only focuses on integrating SAF into air freight operations but also emphasizes the importance of offsetting carbon emissions through supporting the growth of the SAF market. By purchasing SAF offsets and obtaining ""Proof of Sustainability"" certificates, the companies are demonstrating their commitment to environmental stewardship. This holistic approach to addressing environmental challenges in air cargo signifies a strategic shift towards more sustainable practices in the global supply chain landscape.

Driving Industry-Wide Change Through Collaboration

The memorandum of understanding (MoU) between Shein and Lufthansa Cargo extends beyond just implementing SAF in air freight operations; it also aims to catalyze broader change within the industry. By collaborating on environmental and traceability initiatives, the companies are not only setting a precedent for eco-conscious logistics but also creating a ripple effect that could influence other e-commerce players and cargo operators to explore similar sustainable measures. The strategic decision to work towards long-term collaboration underscores a shared commitment to driving positive environmental impact and fostering innovation in supply chain sustainability.

The partnership's focus on building the market for SAF and encouraging the adoption of sustainable practices sends a clear signal to the industry that sustainability is no longer a choice but a necessity. As Shein leverages its reliance on air cargo to advocate for SAF's potential, it sets a precedent for other major brands and retailers to prioritize eco-friendly transportation solutions. The demand signals generated by this collaboration have the potential to accelerate the transition towards greener logistics practices, ultimately reshaping the way goods are transported globally.

Mills in Savannah and Riceboro will shut down by the end of next month, as will the company's Savannah packaging facility. The combined changes will result in a net reduction of International Paper's annual containerboard capacity by about 1 million tons.

The company will offer severance packages along with outplacement assistance for eligible employees, said Tom Hamic, president of International Paper's North America Packing Solutions business.

""We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,"" he said. ""We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.""

""These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,"" added Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns, R-Newington.

The pulp and paper industry has been buffeted by a long-term reduction in demand for its products. The number of mills in Georgia has fallen from 18 at the height of production in 1977 to just nine with Thursday's closure announcements, Marshall Thomas, president of Albany-based F&W Forest Services, told an audience of political and ag business leaders at the annual Ag Issues Summit at the Georgia National Fairgrounds in Perry.

Thomas said Georgia lawmakers are working to increase demand for timber products, including a state Senate study committee that began meeting last year to explore developing sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, which has become popular in Europe.

""Why aren't we doing this?"" he said. ""The world wants green stuff ... and we've got some of the greatest forestry in the world.""

Thomas said another way to increase demand for timber is being worked on at the federal level. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's renewable fuel standard is aimed at increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it bans the use of commercially produced trees in producing those fuels.

""If we could get that relaxed to include trees, it would go a long way,"" he said.

""I, along with each member of our delegation in the House, remain committed to working tirelessly with our state leaders, federal partners and timber producers to navigate this difficult transition, secure new employment opportunities for the hundreds of citizens impacted by the closures and safeguard the long-term strength and viability of Georgia’s timber industry,"" Burns added.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/griceconnect/sports/savannah-paper-mill.png;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-08-22 13:56:45.322218

In 2025, a confluence of rising fuel costs, operational delays, and the relentless push for sustainability has created a landscape where risk and opportunity are inextricably linked. For investors, the challenge lies in discerning which companies are weathering these headwinds with resilience—and which are being swept away by them.

The Fuel Efficiency Paradox

Fuel remains the second-largest operating expense for airlines, and its volatility continues to test the mettle of even the most seasoned operators. U.S. airlines, for instance, saw fuel costs per gallon rise 4.2% in January 2025 compared to December 2024, despite a 5.1% drop in total fuel expenditure. This apparent contradiction is a testament to the industry's progress in fuel efficiency: consumption fell by 8.9% year-over-year, driven by newer aircraft and route optimization. Yet, the cost per gallon has climbed steadily since January 2020, from $1.98 to $2.42, squeezing margins.

The broader logistics sector faces similar pressures. Air freight demand surged 6.1% year-over-year in January 2025, fueled by Red Sea disruptions and e-commerce growth. However, capacity expansion lagged behind, with carriers adding only 4–5% more cargo space compared to demand's 6–10% rise. This imbalance has driven up freight rates, creating a double-edged sword: higher revenue for carriers but increased costs for shippers.

Operational Delays: A Hidden Tax on Value

Operational delays, whether due to supply chain bottlenecks or regulatory hurdles, are another drag on performance. For traditional airlines, delays in aircraft deliveries—particularly for next-gen models like the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo—have forced carriers to operate older, less efficient fleets longer than planned. Delta Air Lines, for example, has had to absorb higher maintenance costs and fuel burn while awaiting new aircraft, a situation that has weighed on its stock despite its strong brand and customer loyalty.

The eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) sector, meanwhile, is grappling with a different kind of delay. Archer Aviation, a key player in urban air mobility, is in the final phase of FAA certification for its Midnight eVTOL. Only 15% of compliance documents have been approved to date, and any further delays could erode investor confidence. The stock's 5.69% drop in August 2025 following a high-volume test flight underscores the market's sensitivity to regulatory progress.

The Tailwinds of Innovation

Yet, for every headwind, there is a potential tailwind. The push for sustainability is reshaping the industry in ways that could redefine competitive advantage. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), for instance, is gaining traction despite its higher cost. Airlines like Delta and United are investing in SAF partnerships, betting that regulatory incentives and consumer demand for green travel will offset the premium.

Technology is another area of opportunity. Southwest Airlines' recent $750 million accelerated share repurchase program is a case in point. The airline's disciplined approach to fleet modernization—retiring older 737-700s and acquiring more efficient 737-8s—has improved fuel efficiency and reduced costs. Its 47% hedging coverage for 2025 fuel needs further insulates it from price shocks, a strategy that has bolstered investor confidence.

The Investor's Dilemma: Risk vs. Reward

For investors, the key is to identify companies that are not just surviving but thriving in this environment. Delta's recent pilot labor agreements, while costly, have stabilized its workforce and positioned it for long-term growth. Similarly, Southwest's ability to balance cost discipline with customer experience investments—such as enhanced in-flight Wi-Fi—has made it a standout in a crowded market.

The eVTOL sector, though riskier, offers high-reward potential. Archer Aviation's partnerships with Abu Dhabi Aviation and Ethiopian Airlines signal international demand, but success hinges on timely FAA certification. Investors with a higher risk tolerance may find value in early-stage players like Archer, provided they monitor regulatory progress closely.

A Call for Strategic Patience

The aviation and logistics sectors are at a crossroads. While fuel efficiency gains and technological innovation are creating new avenues for growth, they also require significant upfront investment. For companies like Delta and Southwest, the path to profitability lies in balancing these costs with operational discipline. For eVTOL pioneers, the stakes are even higher: regulatory approval is the difference between a moonshot and a market leader.

Investors must weigh these dynamics carefully. Short-term volatility is inevitable, but long-term success will belong to those who can navigate the headwinds with agility—and who recognize that the greatest opportunities often lie in the most challenging skies.

In the end, the aviation and logistics sectors are not just about flying higher—they're about flying smarter. And for those who can see the forest for the trees, the rewards could be substantial.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-22 11:57:07.593914

3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF by 2030.
35 billion gallons of SAF to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050.
For all that to happen, the farmers and ethanol plants will need to comply with the 45ZCF-GREET model that has been adopted by the U.S. Treasury.
That is because the gasoline manufacturers are making more per gallon of ethanol sold than the farmers who raise the grain.","I recently attended a Sustainable Aviation Fuel conference, which was at the Strategic Air Command and Aerospace Museum near Ashland, Nebraska.

Overwhelmingly, the message from presenters, in my opinion, was, “this is great fuel technology; we just can’t afford it yet. We need big government funds.” Most concerning was the person who called for the meeting and kicked it off, U.S. Rep. Mike Flood, of Nebraska, who plans to champion the authorization of more tax credits to make this happen.

To put this into context, supporters suggested that 27 million gallons of SAF would be generated in 2025, a measly portion of what the entire airline travel industry uses at 126 billion gallons per year. Let me cut right to the chase, despite how they try to position this, it requires the farmer and ethanol plants to increase costs and comply with emission standards that allow the airline industry to offset these savings for their own emissions.

No matter how you shake this moving target, that is what is planned. Let’s not forget that this plan is 100% driven by tax credits, something only the wealthy care about, not the farmer who will be selling corn for $2 a bushel this year.

We can’t blame just one agency for this situation. From the Department of Energy website, you will find this rhetoric:

The SAF Grand Challenge is the result of DOE, DOT, and USDA launching a government-wide Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that will attempt to reduce the cost, enhance energy security, and expand the production and use of SAF while meeting the following goals:

A minimum of a 50% reduction in life cycle emissions compared to conventional fuel.

3 billion gallons per year of domestic SAF by 2030.

35 billion gallons of SAF to satisfy 100% of domestic demand by 2050.

For all that to happen, the farmers and ethanol plants will need to comply with the 45ZCF-GREET model that has been adopted by the U.S. Treasury. I don’t even know how many times presenters at this conference referenced that, “We are waiting on Treasury to give us guidance on this.”

Once again looking at the Department of Energy website, I encourage all of you that think this is good for the farmer to look at closely should you choose to comply:

45ZCF-GREET is available at: https://www.energy.gov/eere/GREET. The 45ZCF GREET model was developed as a specific version of the GREET model to determine emissions rates that also meet three key parameters: (1) user-friendliness and consistency, (2) technical robustness of the pathways represented, and (3) consistency with the requirements of section 45Z. The model includes transportation fuel production pathways that are of sufficient methodological certainty to be appropriate for determining eligibility for the 45Z tax credit.

At the end of the day, the story is the same as the Renewable Fuel Standard. The concept is correct, but requires government involvement. In the same week that our national debt blows past $38 trillion, we are talking about spending massive amounts for subsidies.

The gut punch, which is still not brought to light in these discussions, is the fact that the petroleum industry still controls distribution of all fuel. Why is no one talking about the fact that E-15 is selling at the pump for 50 cents less than 100% gasoline? That is because the gasoline manufacturers are making more per gallon of ethanol sold than the farmers who raise the grain.

If the farmer does not regain leverage in the marketplace and come up with a distribution system that does not including the Prince of Saudi Arabia, we will continue to lose farmers. No farmers, no food, no fuel. Share that with your friends, neighbors and policy-makers before it’s too late.

The fast fashion giant has agreed alongside the cargo airline to explore the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), alongside wider measures that promote a shift toward lower-emission operations across air transport.

The MoU lays out a framework for collaboration, including a plan to adopt SAF-based offsetting solutions for SHEIN’s shipments within the next six months. Other objectives include using lower-carbon energy sources for transport and improving transparency around environmental performance.

Ethan Shen, General Manager of Global Fulfilment at SHEIN, explains: ""Lufthansa Cargo has extensive experience in driving the adoption of SAF and will provide SHEIN with opportunities to adopt lower-carbon air cargo options.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network.”

SAF's rising prominence in logistics

Sustainable aviation fuel is a liquid fuel made from renewable feedstocks. It serves as a direct substitute for conventional jet fuel but with lower lifecycle carbon emissions.

Lufthansa Cargo has committed to supplying SHEIN with SAF and will back this with certified documentation in the form of 'Proof of Sustainability' certificates built on third-party verified standards, recording the emissions saved when SAF is used instead of fossil-based aviation fuel.

The freight carrier is also contributing its experience in SAF procurement and deployment, sharing knowledge with SHEIN as part of a joint learning approach.

Both organisations have agreed to treat SAF not as a standalone solution, but as a single element of a wider carbon reduction effort across transport.

Ethan adds: ""While the use of SAF is one step towards reducing our transportation and distribution emissions, we recognise it as part of a broader decarbonisation strategy that should also include optimising logistics, fleet efficiency and exploring other low-carbon solutions.”

The partnership reflects SHEIN’s intent to deal with emissions across its transport operations. While SHEIN is a digital retailer without its own air fleet, it relies heavily on air freight to deliver goods quickly from manufacturers to different markets.

Partnership includes data and traceability

Lufthansa Cargo CEO Ashwin Bhat underlines the broader purpose behind the agreement.

“Signing this memorandum with SHEIN represents Lufthansa Cargo´s commitment to implementing high-performance logistics solutions responsibly and with operational excellence,” he says. “It demonstrates the importance of concrete measures and reliable implementation in the international air freight business.”

“Together with all stakeholders within the supply chain, we are driving the development of more sustainable global supply chains in line with our purpose: Enabling Global Business.""

Beyond SAF, the agreement includes cooperation on environmental reporting and operational data sharing.

The two companies have committed to exploring shared approaches to traceability, looking at how data can support measurable improvements in emissions and sustainability performance. This includes assessments of fleet efficiency and process quality – two areas that sit at the centre of the collaboration.

They will also examine knowledge-sharing initiatives, aiming to raise standards around sustainability reporting and low-carbon innovation in global logistics.

While SHEIN and Lufthansa Cargo's MoU does not set out mandatory emissions targets or binding commitments, it signals intent to trial new approaches and apply lessons from early projects across broader logistics operations.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/236d64dd59283b707117fc45e4b2d201:1c87732e137062893472dfa78bb66414/shein-lufthansa.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:14.576637

The pressure is on for the aviation sector. Alongside power generation and heavy industry, air travel is one of the most prominent targets for governments pursuing ambitious

net-zero objectives.

But it’s not realistic to cut out carbon emissions from aircraft quickly. The lifecycle of a commercial airliner is around 30 years. So, despite significant progress, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production is not enough in itself to have the substantial impact on emissions needed.

That’s why any pragmatic approach to speeding up the decarbonisation of air travel depends on tackling other aviation emissions, which brings the focus to airports. Airport operators are now on the front line of the decarbonisation of the industry.

But, because of the complexity involved, collaboration is indispensable if airports are to lead the way in decarbonising the aviation industry.

COMPLEXITY DEMANDS COLLABORATION

Most airports are similar in size to a small town, but with vastly higher numbers of people constantly passing through. That means airport emissions are both significant and highly fragmented, involving everything from exhaust gases produced by ground service equipment (GSE) to luggage conveyor belts and HVAC systems for terminal buildings. Removing carbon from the airport equation is no simple undertaking.

Because the sources of airport emissions are so diverse, there can be no ‘magic bullet’, no one action that allows airport operators to dispense with the problem.

In other words, despite reducing airport emissions being aviation’s most immediate route towards net zero, it is by no means a straightforward task.

The size of the challenge and the different options open to airport operators means that delivering decarbonisation quickly and at scale is unlikely to be easy for airports acting in isolation.

This is where collaboration is nothing short of vital. Collaboration means different approaches can be tested at different airports without any one operator footing the bill alone.

It means airports can gain insights from the experiences of others, moving directly to an optimal approach to decarbonising a particular source of emissions without the time and costs involved in pursuing a test and learn phase first.

TULIPS – LESSONS FROM EUROPE

There is precedent for such an approach. The TULIPS consortium, of which Egis is a member, began in 2022 with €25 million in EU funding.

Centred on Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, the project is intended to deliver a roadmap to achieving zero waste and zero airport emissions by 2030, and net zero for aviation as-a-whole by 2050.

These goals are reflected in the project’s main ambitions of:

Accelerating emission reductions

Demonstrating, measuring and prescribing innovative technologies and concepts that can support the ongoing transition towards sustainable airport operations

Developing sustainability roadmaps based on evidence from seven focus areas with a total of 17 demonstrations.

These 17 demonstrator projects are taking place at airports across Europe. They involve the testing of intermodal transport services, including for freight transport and public transport connections to and within airports, as well as zero-emissions airside operations and circular airport buildings.

They also include work to develop mitigation measures airside for ultrafine particulates (UFPs) and the sequestering of carbon with biochar on airport land.

The co-ordinated nature of the project means airports across Europe will have easy access to an evidence base covering the decarbonisation approaches that are open to them.

As a result, we can expect the decarbonisation of European airports to be considerably easier and less costly for airport operators to deliver than would otherwise have been case.

The burden testing different approaches is shared across operators, rather than duplicated across them. This doesn’t just simplify adoption, it also has the potential to influence policy change and feeds into scientific articles, supporting an evidence-based approach.

A MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH FOR THE UK

There can be little doubt as to the promise collaboration holds for the decarbonisation of airports in the UK. Yet this remains an ambitious challenge for the sector.

Private operators already collaborate through industry groups, however, there is an opportunity to go further. To deliver more cost-effective and timely decarbonisation initiatives, together.

A framework that allows UK airports to maintain commercial competition while collaborating to deliver the rapid decarbonisation of airport operations would be immensely valuable but would likely require the support of government.

A WAY FORWARD?

Airports offer the most immediate avenue for the decarbonisation of the aviation industry. Yet the sheer variety of sources of emissions means achieving meaningful change is a complex undertaking. That demands collaboration if it is to be delivered quickly and cost-effectively.

While there are legitimate reasons why collaboration between airport operators might be restricted, we believe a co-ordinated approach offers significant promise.

Greater knowledge sharing, of both successes and setbacks, benefits the entire industry. It accelerates innovation and supports the widespread adoption of solutions needed to navigate the complexities of decarbonisation.

There are 275 employees working at the Chevron REG Ames campus, where they focus on developing technology that can produce lower-carbon fuels by using renewable sources, like fats and oils. Parent company Chevron is investing more than $8 billion to create a higher return on converting byproduct fats and oils, known as feedstocks, into biodiesel and renewable diesel. In the new Ames facility, 25 employees focus on scaling and commercializing biodiesel, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, renewable natural gas and other biofuels. The company recently expanded renewable diesel production at its Geismar, La., facility, from 90 million gallons to 340 million gallons per year. That kind of production increase is the result, in part, of the research done in Ames.

“The mission of the lab and the folks who are associated with the work being done here is to accelerate the development of technologies and technical capabilities to deliver higher returns for our lower-carbon transportation fuels, specifically, biodiesel and renewable diesel,” said Martin Haverly, director of research and development and innovation at Chevron REG in Ames.

Ames lab

The Ames center is one of two Chevron technology centers in the country. The other is Chevron’s Richmond Technology Center in Richmond, Calif., where more than 170 doctoral-level scientists research automotive engines at the 1.2 million-square-foot facility.

In Ames, the new building has 27,000 square feet of lab space. Ames Chevron REG researchers previously worked in a 4,000-square-foot lab, making the new space a 575% increase in space for workers. The new facility has a 40%-50% utilization rate, leaving room for growth and expansion, Haverly said.

“We’re well positioned for whatever is going to come, and also the future that we create through the innovations coming out of this building,” he said.

At the lab, researchers work on several scientific processes that involve identifying the materials within the biofuels and improving the catalytic process used to create the fuels. Renewable diesel is a low-carbon fuel that, through a catalytic process utilizing heat, pressure and hydrogen, known as hydrotreating, can convert feedstocks into a hydrocarbon fuel that is chemically similar to traditional diesel, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Chevron REG researchers are working on ways to improve that catalytic process.

At the Ames lab, safety comes first. The building is outfitted with automated control systems for gas monitoring, chemical spill detection, alarm systems and more. The larger space gives researchers more room for more advanced experiments. The previous building had 11-foot-high ceilings, while the new center has 22- to 27-foot-high ceilings, allowing scientists to complete distillation, which can separate liquids and remove unwanted components to improve the quality of biodiesel. The new building has wide hallways to easily transport experiments and projects.

“When we talk about things like separations, one of the primary separation techniques that we use is distillation. And distillation is typically done in columns; we use these really tall vessels. Now we’re able to install an actual distillation column in here and run it,” he said. “The distillation process is one that has led to the creation of new products.”

Something as simple as a higher ceiling could translate into research breakthroughs for Chevron REG.

“We weren’t able to do it before, and that type of work is critical, because we’re really pushing the envelope always in the industry,” Haverly said. “We’ve been an industry leader for renewable fuels for a long time. High-quality fuels typically means more and more separation. That’s something that we’ve pioneered. We’re the first group to really lean in on distillation of biodiesel.”

The facility also has a hydrogen generator. Chevron REG researchers use hydrogen as a catalyst to react with feedstock to make a specific hydrocarbon fuel, he said.

“It’s a huge advancement, because [without the generator] instead we would have to have large stores of hydrogen, like large tubes and vessels of hydrogen, and those have a lot of potential energy. They could light on fire. It’s under high pressure, all those things. Instead, we only generate hydrogen when we need it,” he said.

Researchers now have warehouse space so they can stagger experiments.

“If something isn’t being used, we’ve got the warehouse to park it in,” Haverly said. “We only built the building as large as it needed to be to support actual work, rather than sometimes you see technology centers that are quite large, but that’s because there’s a lot of idle assets.”

Partnerships

Chevron REG’s Louisiana renewable diesel plant’s capacity increase was made possible partly because of the company’s partnership with ISU. Chevron REG and ISU worked together to create the ISU BioCentury Research Farm, a hydrotreater pilot plant dedicated to biomass production and processing. This hydrotreater pilot plant relies on the expertise of both organizations to better understand how various biomass feedstocks can play a role in the production of renewable fuels with a specific focus on renewable diesel. Research at the hydrotreater pilot plant supports the Louisiana plant by helping to evaluate new low-carbon feedstocks and improve production of renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel.

“We were reliant on Iowa State University all the way back in the very beginning for lab space, for research and development capabilities,” Haverly said. “I would say that our past and our future is really intertwined with Iowa State in that way.”

The company has worked with the ISU Center for Industrial Research and Service on occasion, and has employed ISU students.

“We’re constantly working with Iowa State on the feedstock side, that’s a really critical thing for the future of renewable fuels industry as a whole,” he said. “Iowa State being a huge ag school, with the agronomy department, and then also with the chemical engineering and mechanical engineering departments, even with some of the political science and business school connections, all the different value chain drivers, and we’ve got, honestly, too many different points of connection with them, to mention all of them.”

Not ethanol

Chevron REG researches and produces biofuels, not ethanol, an important distinction, Haverly said. Ethanol, he pointed out, is produced through the fermentation of the starch in corn. The ethanol molecule is a light alcohol and goes into gasoline engines. Biofuels, typically used in heavy-duty transportation, use different feedstock, technologies and processes than what is used in the production of ethanol.

“Ethanol can’t go into diesel engines because it’s got a really high flash point, it will burn too quickly,” he said. “What we produce using those lipids or fats and greases, which is a totally different starting point than the starch that ethanol is produced from, that becomes this biodiesel and renewable diesel via a totally different process.”

While ethanol comes from corn, biodiesel and renewable diesel aremade from fats, oils and greases, like soybean oil.

“In the late 1990s, the soybean oil was not worth very much,” he said. “We’ve added value to things like used cooking oil, which, not that long ago, was just dumped in landfills as well. Now, used cooking oil trades for more than soybean oil was.”

Biofuels policy

According to the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association, Iowa is the top state for renewable fuels production. The state has 42 ethanol refineries capable of producing 4.7 billion gallons annually – including 34 million gallons of annual cellulosic ethanol production capacity. It also boasts 10 biodiesel facilities with the capacity to produce 416 million gallons annually.

Haverly said there is strong support for biofuels in Iowa, but consistency is important.

“We see really strong support for our industry in the state of Iowa,” he said. “We’re really grateful to the administration for that, and for our congressmen and women for their support. But consistent policy support is critical to the growth.”

When REG first started, there was little policy on the biofuels industry, he said.

“There was nothing to support via policy, so we’re used to demonstrating to policymakers globally that this thing is real, it’s growing and it needs more support,” he said. “That’s where coming together through partnerships across the value chain is going to continue to drive that policy support, where we can get that to be really durable and long term. That’s where we can really accelerate growth.”

In California, diesel fuel is 75% biodiesel or renewable diesel. That level of biofuel integration into diesel is possible in other states, Haverly said. In Iowa, biofuel blends range from 6% to 20%.

“[Seventy-five percent] is a testament to strong and consistent policy support,” he said. “Here in Iowa, you’ll see that biodiesel sticker, B6 to B20 and we’re really excited about that. The fact that we have production here in the state, that fuel is ending up in people’s fuel tanks right here – it’s pretty exciting.”",https://www.businessrecord.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/USA2023008_CREG_Shoot_Ames_Iowa_HQ_3646.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:33.644846

The Challenges With Hydrogen Hydrogen is extremely flammable.","California-based aerospace startup JetZero is advancing its ambition to reshape commercial aviation with the announcement of a new partnership focused on hydrogen propulsion. The company revealed it is teaming up with SHZ Advanced Technologies to develop liquid hydrogen storage and distribution solutions tailored for JetZero’s blended-wing airliner.

The move underscores growing industry interest in moving away from conventional jet fuel. Solutions such as electric air taxis or Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) are already taking form, with JetZero betting that hydrogen will be the way forward. By aligning with SHZ, the company aims to demonstrate the viability of its zero-emissions flying wing.

Looking At The Clean, Super Efficient Blended Wing

Key to JetZero's goal of creating the airliner of tomorrow is the blended-wing design. This design does away with the ""tube"" part of a traditional airliner, opting to instead make the entire aircraft one large wing. By blending the wings and fuselage into a single lifting surface, the design is expected to reduce drag and improve fuel efficiency while also offering more internal space for fuel tanks or passenger amenities.

The interior efficiency is especially critical when introducing liquid hydrogen, as hydrogen fuel requires bulkier, cryogenically cooled storage compared to traditional jet fuel. Exit configurations could prove an obstacle to fitting more seats, and passenger comfort is also a consideration, given the increased forces that travelers in a blended-wing aircraft would feel. As such, using some of this added space for hydrogen storage makes both concepts more viable.

While the concept is bold, it fits within a broader wave of experimental designs being pursued globally as aviation confronts its decarbonization challenge. The combination of new airframe architectures with alternative propulsion may be necessary to achieve net-zero emissions targets by mid-century. Designing aircraft to include new propulsion technology would also likely be significantly easier than attempting to retrofit older designs.

The Challenges With Hydrogen

Hydrogen is extremely flammable. As such, liquid hydrogen must be stored at extremely low temperatures, requiring complex systems of sensors, fuel transfers, and safety protocols; far more complicated than storing jet fuel. Partnering with SHZ reflects a recognition that solving these engineering hurdles is critical to proving the viability of its concept, with SHZ's expertise in cryogenic systems permitting design teams to develop more advanced and effective storage tanks.

Beyond the tanks themselves, integration into the aircraft is equally important. The systems must be designed to distribute fuel efficiently while ensuring redundancy and reliability. Any solution involving hydrogen must also comply with stringent aviation safety regulations, adding further complexity to the engineering effort. By focusing on these issues early in its development cycle, JetZero is attempting to position itself ahead of competitors exploring similar technologies.

This partnership does not resolve the broader question of ground infrastructure. Even if JetZero’s aircraft is technically viable, widespread adoption of hydrogen-powered commercial aviation will require airports to invest in refueling and storage facilities, a step that will require significant time and funding.

Where JetZero Is Moving In The Future

JetZero has set ambitious goals, aiming to roll out a demonstrator aircraft by the end of the decade. Governments around the world are beginning to put pressure on the aviation industry to lower carbon emissions, so this new hydrogen-powered aircraft is a promising response to the demands. As such, it has the potential to shape short or medium-haul flying in the next several years.

The collaboration with SHZ is one of several partnerships JetZero is pursuing. By leveraging outside experience in hydrogen storage, the company can focus on integrating these solutions into its unique aircraft architecture while continuing to raise awareness and funding. This also means less research and work has to be performed in-house.

There are numerous ideas for alternative fuels currently on the drawing boards, with SAF and electric motors being the two front-runners. SAF is already flying with some airlines, while manufacturers are working with partners to develop ground infrastructure for electric planes. While hydrogen as a concept hasn't been developed to the same extent, it does hold huge promise for an industry that is looking for new options.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/jetzero_envpan_blue_still2-600w.jpg,N,,2025-08-22 09:57:40.695077

The aviation sector faces a particular challenge to decarbonise in the face of global warming.

But the Government said the development and deployment of SAFs will play a crucial role in 'helping us reach our decarbonisation goals, which will enable our aviation industry to operate and develop in a sustainable manner.'

To assist in the development of the Roadmap, the Department of Transport established the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Task Force in December of 2023.

The global approach to decarbonisation of the aviation industry is based on the International Civil Aviation Organisation ‘basket of measures’ which identifies four pillars from which reductions are to be realised.

Business Bulletin

These are aircraft technology improvements, operational improvements, increased development and use of SAFs, and a global market-based measure known as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

SAFs are a ‘drop in’ fuel which means that they can be blended into fossil-based aviation fuels and can be used in existing aircraft without modification.

They are considered sustainable because they have lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuels.

The Roadmap sets out four SAF Policy Pathways to advance: supporting production, market certainty, collaboration and supporting uptake.

It was described by Government, as representing an important first step in developing Ireland’s national SAF policy.

The Department said in a statement that it identifies a number of actions which will be built upon in future iterations, and setting a path for future SAF policy development.

Minister O'Brien said: “I am delighted to officially launch Ireland’s first Sustainable Aviation Fuel Policy Roadmap. Publication of this Roadmap represents the realisation of a clear commitment in our Programme for Government.

NEIL HARRIS, Professor of Atmospheric Informatics, Cranfield University, provides an overview.

Reductions in the formation of contrail cirrus resulting from aviation are being seriously considered to mitigate the growing impact of aviation emissions on climate change (eg RAeS-IATA workshop: Contrails: From modification and avoidance to management, March 2025(3,4). This could be achieved by changing either the flight patterns or the type of fuel burnt.

The regions where contrail cirrus form are limited by the prevalent weather patterns, and the majority of the climate impact comes from a small fraction of flights. For current flight patterns, climate metrics can be integrated into flight planning and so give a way to judge whether it is worth changing flight route. Given the discussion about which metric is most appropriate(4), the involvement of the aviation industry and regulators would help develop more appropriate metrics. The key point here is to maximise possible contrail cirrus avoidance while minimising the climate impact of cases where more fuel is consumed as a consequence.

Changes in flight patterns could be implemented in the near term(3). Implementation relies on models using meteorological predictions (especially of water vapour and temperature at flight levels), engine characteristics, etc which are used to estimate the contrail cirrus formation along particular flight routes. The accuracy of the predictions and the models is improving and the effectiveness is well characterised.

The success of this approach will depend on how decisions are made within the operational aviation system. So understanding the opportunities and constraints within the system is critical to ensuring the success of any contrail reduction system. This has been one of the aims of the several field trials already performed involving airlines, air traffic control organisations and others, and it is important to build on that experience.

Research on how fuel composition could be changed to reduce contrail cirrus persistence shows that lower sulphur or aromatic content in the fuel generally reduces contrail cirrus formation, and that the specific aromatic compound is important. This work has been principally focused on the composition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) but it also applies to the formulation of kerosene which superficially has the potential to be more of a ‘drop in’ solution. However, significant challenges exist with this approach too(4).

Who influences decisions about climate-friendly flights?

(All images via Pixabay unless stated)

The decision-making processes and responsibilities are critical for either approach being implemented in routine operations. Figure 1 shows a schematic of the aviation industry as it relates to making changes in flights to reduce climate impact. The dark arrows illustrate the main physical processes which affect reductions in climate impact. The light arrows illustrate the institutions which have influence to effect reductions.

Much work has been expended looking at whether different approaches to contrail cirrus avoidance work physically. It is also important to consider how the overall operational system could work with minimal changes to the current flight system, building on the reported experience from contrail avoidance trials. Success will require the involvement or support of all the main decision-makers indicated by light blue arrows in Figure 1. So what is their interest?

Pilots

(Collins Aerospace)

The people making the final decision on changes to flight routes are the pilots as they are in charge of the aircraft during flight. The British Airline Pilots’ Association has recommended that any excess fuel available in flight due to, for example, having to wait for a landing spot could be used to avoid regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. Such a policy could provide significant benefits for flights in and out of the UK. This, coupled with giving airlines more freedom to plan their own routes rather than be limited to air traffic corridors, could provide significant benefits for flights in and out of the UK. This approach would require willing co-operation of the pilots and a simple information system that does not put the pilots under pressure and safety at risk.

Air Traffic Control

(NATS)

ATC is responsible for the efficient and safe running of the overall flight system before and during flight. While they currently have no environmental mandate, they are participating in contrail avoidance tests. Working within the current system, they could develop operational tools to provide guidance to pilots and flight planners on the existence of regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. ATC already include some meteorological data in their software systems, which could be increased considerably. In principle, air traffic controllers could either calculate contrail cirrus zones themselves (involving an increase in the meteorological data use) or use zones from other providers, including the meteorological agencies. Ready access to such information would allow ATC to inform pilots in real time. As with the pilots, any system should be simple for the air traffic controllers to use.

Airline flight planners

(CAA)

Airline flight planners are critical pre-flight. Different airlines have different in-house and contracted systems which take into account factors, such as cost (fuel burn, staff, charges and fines) and weather conditions. In principle, a climate measure could be added as an additional factor, and some companies (eg Flightkeys and Satavia) are actively developing operational systems. These systems are not yet used in routine flight operations but are being widely tested and embedded to increase confidence in their quality and reliability. The choice of methods to compare the climate impacts of CO2 and contrail cirrus is critical here. It seems likely that a certification system will be required as well.

Airlines

Ultimately airlines have the most influence in this part of the aviation sector. They are most aware of passenger preferences, they choose the aircraft, engines and fuel, as well as control how their planners are managed. While these are all indirect means of influencing decisions made about individual flights, the airlines have the major influence in setting the rules for other parts of the system and their active involvement in contrail cirrus reduction is essential.

Fuel suppliers

(airBP)

Fuel suppliers will be deciding if they want to offer other fuels, whether SAF or alternative kerosenes. This in turn will depend on the business case, the airport capabilities and government regulations. Given that contrail cirrus only form in certain meteorological conditions, two or more fuel supply systems may be advantageous at an airport in a region where contrail cirrus is prevalent, although this would come at additional cost.

Airports

(London Gatwick Airport)

The airports only have a small influence on making changes to flight routes through the availability of take-off and landing slots. They do have a major influence on the availability of fuels through providing the infrastructure required for operations.

Engine manufacturers

(Stephen Bridgewater/RAeS)

Engine manufacturers are not directly involved in the short-term decision-making involved in reducing contrail cirrus. They are indirectly involved through their central, enabling role in testing and certification of fuel. For example, engine manufacturers must be confident that any changes in fuel do not impair engine safety.

Engine manufacturers make decisions about the likely long-term needs for aircraft. They can have important influences on future options and are the only ones that could reduce NOx emissions. Even early decisions on engine design will take their time to have a major climate impact due to the need for development, certification and investment. These processes would have to be significantly speeded up for aviation to decarbonise on a significant scale by 2050.

Aircraft manufacturers

(Airbus)

Aircraft manufacturers can influence the altitudes at which new aircraft fly most fuel efficiently. So it may be possible to reduce the overlap between flight altitudes and the ice super-saturated regions (ISSR) where contrail cirrus can form. As with the introduction of new engine designs, considerable development, certification and available investment capital could have a significant impact by 2050.

Governance and governments

(WikiCommons)

Any large change of the type considered here requires public and political will, coupled with effective policies. Internal flights are regulated at national level and so could be subject to national governance. However, the majority of fuel burnt (60%) is international and flights are regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), a specialised agency of the United Nations. Its scheme to reduce its climate impact is the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) which currently relies to a large extent on future offsetting of CO2 emissions and the widespread introduction of SAF. CORSIA provides a mechanism for international discussion, agreement and improvements over time. It, therefore, acts as a backstop for regional and national action and pressure, including incentives for developing a more sustainable aviation. CORSIA does not currently apply to contrail cirrus but could, in principle, be expanded to do so.

Implementing climate-friendly flight routes

There are two ways to integrate climate information into the existing decision-making system: (i) focus on regions where contrail cirrus is most likely to form; and (ii) develop systems which are widely applied but which do not affect flights where no contrail cirrus is likely to form. The latter approach may be the better end goal as it is simpler for all concerned to have one operational system which could be covered by ICAO through CORSIA. In the short term, system development and testing are more likely to be regional as with the field trials that have already taken place. This is true for contrail cirrus reduction or for the introduction of lower contrail cirrus fuels, though the airports involved would have to be able to supply more than one type of aviation fuel.

Reduced contrail cirrus flights

Pre-flight planning involves airlines, flight planners and ATC. Once a flight is under way, the responsibility lies with the pilots supported by ATC and, in some cases, the flight planners. Given that excess fuel is used on many routes (1% on long-haul flights(6) and 10-15% on short-haul flights in Europe(7)), agency could be given to pilots to use the excess fuel to avoid contrail formation. That would require simple tools to know how to do that and would have to be subject to the usual safety and ATC requirements. ATC could support the pilots in making the decisions by, for example, identifying regions where contrail cirrus is likely to form. It seems unlikely that decision-making would be the responsibility of ATC but it would play an essential role in supporting it, especially for short-haul flights, while ensuring a safe and efficient system.

The question then arises as to what governance would provide motivation to the different players in the aviation industry. Options include ensuring that there is a market cost of a climate impact (tax or incentive) or it could be through regulation. Either way, it needs to be included in business decisions made in flight planning. It is not obvious that the overall financial cost would be large, given the coincidence of key regions for contrail cirrus formation with areas of delays to flights (eg Western Europe) and the relatively small number of flights likely to be involved in re-routing. Algorithms calculating the impact should be certified to show they reach an appropriate agreed standard. The odds of success of individual flight routings will increase through improved meteorology or in the metrics used – and this possibility needs to be encouraged in the certification of the algorithms.

From a global climate perspective, the measure of success would be a reduction in the overall climate forcing from contrail cirrus. In busy regions, a regional approach could be taken so that cumulative effect of all flight changes is monitored (otherwise all aircraft would want to fly in the same airspace!) This would require the central involvement of ATC. Climate forcing cannot be measured directly and the measure of success would be a reduction of the contrail cirrus coverage. Satellite-based detection systems are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are suitable for this, especially when complemented by ground-based observations. The climate forcing would have to be calculated (as it is for all other greenhouse gases) and compared with any increases in the amount of CO2 and NOx emitted as a result of the flight route changes.

Implementing changes in aviation fuel

(United)

Changes in the formulation of aviation fuel could also achieve reductions in contrail cirrus from the current aircraft fleet. This requires changes in the trace components of the fuel. Work on the formulation of SAF indicates that reductions in the sulphur content or in the aromatic content could be successful. This work should be broadened to include the current aviation kerosene(4). If successful and if it could be implemented reasonably quickly, it would lead to an immediate climate benefit as the introduction of SAF is likely to be gradual due to the need to expand its production and supply.

Since contrail cirrus is formed on a minority of flights, any special fuel (whether SAF or adapted kerosene) could be made preferentially available at those airports with the greatest odds of arrivals/departures forming contrail cirrus. The number of such airports could be limited to start with if they are part of designated pairing systems where two airports agree to form a sustainable aviation corridor. Such a system would be complex, and possibly costly, to introduce given current airport fuel systems which tend to have just one fuel. Segregated fuel systems at the airport could be avoided if benefits are produced with mixed fuels for all flights from that airport. That would depend on the systems and related infrastructure at individual airports.

Summary

Reducing contrail cirrus formation is the only way for aviation to achieve a quick climate win aside from the existing, but unproven, carbon offset schemes. This could be achieved in the short term through flight modification or, more slowly, through changes in fuel formulation. Contrail cirrus management systems should improve as predictions of contrail cirrus improve and as more experience is gained and built on. The fundamental target is a net climate gain and, whichever commonly accepted metrics are used, contrail cirrus management offers that. In this analysis major remaining research challenges include:

(a) developing incentive schemes for airlines to include climate impact in their flight planning;

(b) identifying a structure to clarify who makes decisions to adjust flight plans;

(c) improving predictions of persistent contrail cirrus used in flight planning;

(d) researching what fuel improvements could lead to reductions in cirrus persistence;

(e) improving how CO2 and NOx emissions are compared with those of contrail cirrus to provide a basis for decisions on flight changes;

(f) developing a certification system to guarantee the quality of the climate impact schemes used.

There are solid arguments for action to be taken now in implementing contrail cirrus management schemes while work continues on solving these remaining research challenges. Doing so would reduce the climate change in the coming years compared to business-as-usual operations. The implementation of a contrail cirrus avoidance scheme is quickly reversible if it does not work, so the downside risk is small. As argued in [3], the North Atlantic is a good region to do this: the potential reduction in contrail cirrus is large and one ATC (NATS) can take the lead. This offers the best way for aviation to minimise its impact on our climate and environment in the coming decades.

“Airbus is very interested in developing SAF from biomass and has identified Indonesia as a major potential supplier,” he said.

He noted that SAF currently made from used cooking oil, waste palm oil, and low-grade vegetable oils faces output limitations due to competition with food supplies.

Airbus estimates that by 2030, SAF will need to be sourced mainly from biomass.

Indonesia could produce up to 500 million tonnes annually - five times the company’s projected requirements.

Large volumes of unused palm fruit bunches in Sumatra and Kalimantan, along with rice straw in Java that is often discarded or burned, could provide key feedstocks.

However, Meika highlighted challenges including the difficulty of collecting biomass from smallholder farmers in areas with poor infrastructure, regulatory gaps and limited research on processing biomass into aviation fuel at scale.

Indonesia has seen rising biomass exports and domestic use, particularly of wood pellets and chips.

Environmental groups caution that the expansion of biomass could come at a cost. Auriga Nusantara, an environmental watchdog, reported that about 10,000 hectares of forest were cleared for biomass production between 2020 and 2024, with potential threats to endangered species such as orangutans if monoculture plantations expand.

As climate change intensifies, air turbulence is projected to worsen, posing risks to passenger safety and increasing fuel consumption. Clear-air turbulence, particularly dangerous due to its invisibility, is on the rise because of shifting jet stream patterns. Scientists are exploring improved forecasting and route optimization, while airlines consider stricter seatbelt policies and cleaner fuels to mitigate the impact.

The seatbelt sign pings on, trays rattle, drinks slosh in their glasses. For many flyers, air turbulence can be an unnerving experience -- and in a world warming under the effects of climate change, it is only set to worsen, according to a growing body of scientific evidence.

Here are the key things to know during another searing summer in 2025:

Why turbulence matters

Beyond making people uneasy, turbulence is also the leading cause of in-flight weather accidents, according to official data.

The numbers remain relatively small: there were 207 reported injuries on US commercial flights between 2009 and 2024. But high-profile incidents have thrust the issue into the spotlight.

These include an Air Europa flight last year, in which 40 passengers were hurt, and a Singapore Airlines flight where one elderly passenger died and dozens were injured.

Live Events

""Typically injuries (are) to unbelted passengers or cabin crew rather than structural damage,"" John Abraham, a mechanical engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas told AFP.

""Modern aircraft withstand turbulence, so the main risk is occupant injury, not loss of the plane.""

Still, planes must be inspected after ""severe"" encounters with turbulence -- about 1.5 times the normal force of Earth's gravity -- which occur some 5,000 times a year over the US, said Robert Sharman, a senior scientist emeritus at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.

Turbulence also increases fuel consumption when pilots must leave optimal altitudes, alter routes or change speeds, Abraham added.

How climate change is making it worse

Mohamed Foudad, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading in the UK, explained there are three main types of turbulence: convective, mountain wave and clear-air turbulence (CAT).

Convective turbulence is linked to rising or sinking air currents from clouds or thunderstorms that can be detected visually or by onboard radar, while mountain wave turbulence occurs over mountain ranges.

CAT, by contrast, is invisible - and therefore the most dangerous.

It generally arises from jet streams: fast-moving westerly winds in the upper atmosphere at the same altitude as commercial jets, about 10-12 kilometers up.

With climate change, the tropics are warming faster at cruising altitude than higher latitudes.

That increases the temperature difference between the higher- and lower-latitudes, driving up jet stream velocity and wind shear -- volatile shifts in vertical air currents that trigger CAT.

Foudad and colleagues published a paper last year in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres analyzing data from 1980 to 2021.

""We find a clear, positive trend -- an increase in turbulence frequency over many regions, including the North Atlantic, North America, East Asia, the Middle East and North Africa,"" he told AFP, with increases ranging from 60 to 155 percent.

Further analysis attributed the rising turbulence in certain regions to increased greenhouse gas emissions.

What happens next?

A 2023 paper led by Isabel Smith at the University of Reading found that for every degree Celsius of near-surface warming, winters would see an increase of about nine percent in moderate CAT in the North Atlantic, and summers a rise of 14 percent.

Winter has historically been the roughest season for turbulence, but warming is now amplifying CAT in summer and autumn, closing the gap.

Jet stream disruption is not the only concern: climate change is also fueling stronger storms.

""Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of thunderstorms under future scenarios, and turbulence encounters near thunderstorms are a major component of turbulence accidents,"" Sharman told AFP.

In terms of mitigation strategies, Foudad is working on two studies: optimizing flight routes to avoid turbulence hotspots and improving forecasting accuracy.

Some airlines are moving towards strategies involving passengers wearing seatbelts more often, such as ending cabin service earlier.

Promising technologies are also being tested, says Sharman, including onboard LIDAR, which beams lasers into the atmosphere to detect subtle shifts in air density and wind speed.

Ultimately, cutting greenhouse gas emissions will be essential, Foudad added.

Aviation is responsible for about 3.5 percent of human-caused warming. Airlines are exploring cleaner fuels to help reduce the industry's footprint, though progress has been ""disappointingly slow,"" according to the International Air Transport Association.

Biofuel markets brace for Trump waiver decisions

Biofuel markets brace for Trump waiver decisions

New York, 21 August (Argus) — US biofuel and crop feedstock markets were volatile today as traders awaited answers on how federal regulators will decide which refiners are exempt from biofuel blending mandates. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires oil refiners and importers to blend minimum amounts of biofuels into the US fuel supply or buy credits from those that do. But refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d of crude can request full exemptions, potentially saving themselves tens of millions of dollars in compliance costs. President Donald Trump's administration told federal courts this week in various pending cases that it ""has now developed a new approach for reviewing small refinery exemptions"" and is planning to ""issue decisions"". The administration is expected to provide some clarity on its small refinery exemption policy on Friday, three sources said. A fourth was told by an official that some policy signal was coming ""soon"". EPA did not respond to a request for comment. But it is unclear how officials will clarify their policy, which could take the form of a proposal, a memo describing the new approach, or separate rulings on the dozens of pending exemption requests stretching back ten years. Federal courts took issue with President Joe Biden's en masse denials of exemption requests, leaving the Trump administration with an unprecedented backlog to resolve. The issue is politically and legally thorny for EPA, pitting two lobbies Trump has pledged to support — oil refiners and farmers — against one other. Public data on small refinery exemptions updated Thursday showed nine new requests but no decisions over the last month. The September CBOT US soybean oil contract rose nearly 5pc Thursday to settle at a two-week high of 53.64¢/lb, outpacing gains in crude futures as traders bet on potentially higher biofuel demand if exemptions end up being less generous than they were during Trump's first term. Upward pressure from a higher bean oil-heating oil spread lifted the price of D4 biomass-based diesel and D6 ethanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Current-year D4 RINs traded as high as 114¢/RIN, while D6s traded up to 106.25¢/RIN over the busy trading session. Thorny questions remain It is unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to immediately clarify its approach to all aspects of this complicated corner of the federal biofuel program. Exemption requests made as recently as last week give the Department of Energy little time to review applications and consult with EPA, as is required by law. And the bulk of potentially eligible refiners have not yet applied for exemptions from this year's blend mandates, since EPA has historically asked applicants to provide at least three quarters of financial data for the relevant compliance year. Other open questions include whether EPA will require oil companies that remain in the program to blend more biofuels to make up for their exempt competitors and whether EPA will compensate newly exempt companies for past compliance. EPA's separate plan to halve RIN credits in future years for foreign biofuels also complicates the agency's enforcement — since refiners making up for old exemptions might have to bring to market more volume to meet the same mandate if some biofuels start earning fewer program credits than previously. Legal challenges are highly likely no matter what the administration decides. Oil refiners in particular have expressed increasing frustration with the Trump administration's approach to biofuel policy, which they say is increasing feedstock and fuel costs. EPA has signaled it wants to finalize new biofuel blend mandates for the next two years before November, an ambitious timeline given the amount of questions still unanswered about the program's future.

Rising capacity investments, shifting wood fiber supply, and evolving trade policies are creating a turbulent market environment. At the center of this transformation is China, whose rapidly expanding integrated pulp industry is reshaping cost curves and trade flows worldwide. Understanding these dynamics is essential for producers, buyers, and investors to navigate the next phase of industry evolution.

China's Overcapacity and Margin Compression

China's pulp and paper sector has grown rapidly over the past decade, especially in virgin cartonboard production. In just five years, capacity has more than doubled, but operating rates remain low, hovering around 60%, levels at which most Western companies could not survive at.

This imbalance between supply and demand has led to significant margin compression, with many producers operating below sustainable profitability thresholds. The industry is now seeing some of its largest players report financial struggles, highlighting the current market's vulnerability.

China's Push Toward Integration

To manage the risks of volatile price fluctuations in pulp, and to increase global competitiveness, Chinese producers are investing in integrated pulp lines. By producing pulp in-house, they gain greater control over costs and reduce exposure to global market swings. Much of this marginal wood supply comes from Southeast Asia, where lower costs support competitive production.

While integration can improve cost resilience, it raises important long-term questions about fiber sustainability. China's heavy dependence on external wood sources makes its integrated strategy tightly linked to Southeast Asian forestry practices and policies.

Global Impacts of Chinese Expansion

China’s expansion could lead to several consequences that impact global trade and competitiveness. These include:

Oversupply risks: With Latin America also adding large pulp projects, structural oversupply looms. This could keep prices close to all-time lows for some time.

Packaging prices collapsing: Packaging grade prices have been sliding steadily, with signs they may bottom out.

Rising Chinese exports: As domestic markets struggle to absorb new volumes, China is pushing more products abroad, raising pressure on mid-cost regions where Chinese producers can undercut prices.

Trade disruption from tariffs: US tariffs are reshaping import patterns and are set to add more supply to global trade. This is expected to particularly hurt Nordic producers. With Finnish wood costs under strain, the ability to compete against cheaper Southeast Asian alternatives is uncertain. This raises the question of whether Finnish wood can compete with cheap Vietnamese wood.

Looking Ahead

The global pulp market is poised for continued volatility as supply races ahead of demand growth. Several scenarios are possible:

Prolonged oversupply pushing weaker players out of the market.

Selective competitiveness where integrated mills dominate while non-integrated producers struggle.

Trade realignment as China increases exports and traditional exporters lose ground.

For global producers, the key to navigating this turbulence will be robust scenario planning, close monitoring of fiber dynamics, and clear strategies for differentiation—whether through sustainability, specialty products, or supply chain positioning.

The escalating global burden of municipal solid waste (MSW), projected to reach 3.88 billion tons annually by 2050, calls for innovative valorization strategies to mitigate environmental impacts and promote a circular bioeconomy. This thesis investigates the conversion of MSW into two high-value products: sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) bioplastics. Chapter one presents comprehensive physicochemical characterization and pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis of MSW feedstocks. The physicochemical results reveal that densification enhances handling and storage properties, while pyrolysis-GC/MS analysis indicates that plastic-rich MSW streams produce bio-oils with favorable hydrocarbon profiles suitable for SAF production, potentially contributing to decarbonization efforts in the aviation sector. Chapter two explores microbial conversion of the pyrolytic bio-oil aqueous fraction (BAF) by Haloferax mediterranei archaea for PHA biosynthesis. Results show that low BAF concentrations (0.1%) support moderate PHA production (0.133 ± 0.04 mg/mL on Day 4), while higher concentrations highlight the need for detoxification or other strategies to mitigate the effects of inhibitory compounds. This work explores valorizing an underutilized byproduct of MSW pyrolysis to produce a biodegradable alternative to conventional plastics, whose global production is projected to exceed 1,000 million tons by 2050. By integrating thermochemical and microbial pathways, this study demonstrates MSW’s potential as an abundant, low-cost feedstock for sustainable materials and fuels, contributing actionable insights for advancing waste-to-resource innovations within circular bioeconomy frameworks.",,N,,2025-08-22 01:56:15.470878

The Paradox of Progress

The aviation industry stands at a crossroads. On one hand, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) has emerged as the single most viable pathway to decarbonize commercial aviation in the near- to medium-term.

On the other hand, the challenges surrounding its adoption are complex, deeply entrenched, and global in scale. Adoption is happening — SAF volumes are rising, airlines are making commitments, and governments are introducing policies — yet the pace is far from sufficient to meet net zero targets by 2050.

In this article, I want to go beyond the headlines of SAF being “the solution” and unpack the very real barriers that define its adoption journey. These challenges span economics, policy, feedstock availability, technology, infrastructure, and consumer acceptance. They are not reasons to abandon SAF, but rather the very landscape we must navigate if we are to unlock its full potential.

1. Policy and Regulatory Challenges

1.1 Fragmented Global Policy Frameworks

One of the foremost obstacles to SAF adoption is the lack of a unified global framework. Unlike the automotive sector, where electrification benefits from relatively coordinated incentives, SAF policies are fragmented across regions:

Europe is pursuing binding mandates under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative, requiring airlines to blend increasing percentages of SAF starting in 2025.

The United States relies on financial incentives like the Blender’s Tax Credit and the Inflation Reduction Act, offering economic rewards rather than obligations.

Asia, home to some of the fastest-growing aviation markets, remains largely unregulated in this space, with SAF adoption driven more by corporate ambition than policy enforcement.

This patchwork creates an uneven playing field, discouraging airlines and fuel producers from committing to large-scale investments that rely on policy certainty.

1.2 Regulatory Certainty vs. Investment Cycles

Developing an SAF refinery or investing in advanced feedstock production requires timelines of 5–10 years. Yet policy frameworks often shift with election cycles or political priorities. This mismatch between regulatory timelines and investment cycles introduces risk, slowing adoption.

2. Economic and Financing Barriers

2.1 The Cost Premium Problem

At present, SAF is two to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Airlines operate in a notoriously low-margin industry, and absorbing this cost without passing it to consumers is unsustainable. Corporate travel programs and voluntary “green fares” have helped bridge the gap, but the scale remains tiny compared to global jet fuel demand.

2.2 Financing Challenges for Refineries

Banks and institutional investors are wary of funding multi-billion-dollar SAF plants when offtake agreements are limited, feedstock supply is uncertain, and policy frameworks lack durability. Without innovative financing mechanisms — such as green bonds, blended finance, or long-term airline commitments — the capital bottleneck persists.

2.3 Price Volatility of Feedstocks

Waste oils, fats, and agricultural residues — the backbone of today’s SAF production — are commodities subject to price volatility. Competing uses for biodiesel, renewable diesel, and oleochemicals can drive feedstock costs higher, making SAF economics even harder.

3. Feedstock Constraints

3.1 Limited Supply of Waste Oils and Fats

Used cooking oil (UCO), tallow, palm oil mill effluent (POME), and other waste streams form the foundation of SAF today. But global supply is finite, scattered, and highly competitive. Even with aggressive collection, these streams cannot fully meet aviation’s future demand.

3.2 Competing Uses for Feedstock

The renewable diesel sector, particularly in North America and Europe, is growing rapidly and often pays a premium for the same waste-based oils SAF producers need. This “feedstock tug-of-war” reduces availability and raises costs.

3.3 Land-Use and Sustainability Risks

Turning to purpose-grown crops like palm or soybean oil risks indirect land-use change (ILUC), deforestation, and food-vs-fuel debates. Public backlash and regulatory scrutiny limit these pathways, even if they offer short-term volume expansion.

4. Technology and Certification Challenges

4.1 Slow Technology Approvals

Every SAF pathway must go through ASTM certification to be blended into jet fuel. While seven pathways are currently approved, each new one takes years of testing and validation. This slows innovation and locks producers into limited feedstock-technology combinations.

4.2 Infrastructure Readiness

Most airports are not yet equipped with dedicated SAF pipelines, storage tanks, or blending infrastructure. This means SAF often needs to be transported by truck over long distances, adding costs and emissions.

4.3 Refinery Conversion Complexity

Converting existing fossil refineries to SAF-compatible operations is technically feasible but capital-intensive, requiring years of engineering and construction. For many oil majors, the business case remains unproven.

5. Airline Adoption Challenges

5.1 Cost Pass-Through Dilemmas

Airlines face a delicate balancing act: adopting SAF boosts their ESG credentials but risks alienating price-sensitive customers if ticket prices rise. In markets like Southeast Asia, where low-cost carriers dominate, this challenge is even sharper.

5.2 Voluntary vs. Mandatory Commitments

While several airlines (e.g., Lufthansa, United, Singapore Airlines) have made bold SAF pledges, most commitments are voluntary and subject to financial pressure. Without mandates, uptake remains limited to marketing-friendly pilots rather than industry-wide adoption.

6. Global Supply Chain and Logistics

6.1 Geographic Imbalances

Feedstock is often abundant in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and parts of Africa, but refining capacity is concentrated in Europe and North America. This creates long shipping routes, eroding both economics and sustainability gains.

6.2 Traceability and Fraud Risks

The SAF industry relies on trust that feedstocks are truly waste-based and sustainable. Yet instances of fraud — such as virgin oils being disguised as waste — undermine confidence. Robust digital traceability systems are still in development and not uniformly applied.

6.3 Cross-Border Complexity

Every shipment of SAF or its feedstocks must comply with varying sustainability standards, customs regulations, and emissions accounting frameworks. This complexity slows down adoption and adds compliance costs.

7. Consumer and Public Perception

7.1 Awareness Gaps

The average passenger is only vaguely aware of SAF. Unlike electric cars, where consumers can see and feel the shift, SAF is invisible — it powers the same aircraft in the same way. Communicating its value proposition is a challenge.

7.2 Willingness to Pay

Surveys show mixed results: while many passengers say they care about climate change, fewer are willing to pay higher ticket prices for SAF-powered flights. Bridging this intention-action gap is critical.

8. Case Studies of Adoption Challenges

8.1 Europe’s Mandates and Airline Pushback

Airlines in Europe have warned that ambitious SAF blending mandates will raise ticket prices and reduce competitiveness, especially on long-haul routes where alternatives are limited.

8.2 United States: Incentive-Driven but Fragmented

While incentives have spurred investment, uncertainty about tax credit renewals creates hesitation. Airlines and producers are left guessing about long-term economics.

8.3 Asia: Ambition vs. Reality

Despite bold climate commitments, most Asian countries lack binding SAF mandates. Adoption is limited to flagship demonstrations rather than systemic change.

Conclusion: Framing the Road Ahead

The adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not a simple story of linear progress. It is a story of competing pressures — cost vs. sustainability, policy vs. politics, ambition vs. reality.

But here’s the critical insight: the very existence of these challenges signals the industry’s transformation is underway. SAF is no longer an academic debate; it is a commercial reality wrestling with the same obstacles any major industrial transition faces.

Understanding these challenges is the first step. The next — and the focus of Article 8 — is to chart the pathways to overcome them. Because the future of aviation depends not just on acknowledging the hurdles, but on building the solutions to clear them.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQEfsVpPUpYBtg/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZjBJJ0vHQAQ-/0/1755587060147?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=H9ogp3EIuucpkCeka6mmYos0G3QiuoRzyDaKQKHA3J8,N,,2025-08-22 00:56:30.992135

The goal of the pilot is to create a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland. The EU’s renewable fuel blending mandate for aviation opens up a significant opportunity for Finland to become a leading producer of synthetic fuels in the future.

The Finnish company Liquid Sun is starting a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable eSAF from biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Originating from the University of Tampere, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis technology (LTE) that refines carbon dioxide emissions and renewable electricity-based hydrogen into eSAF jet fuel. For this pilot, Liquid Sun has secured Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia as partners. In Finland, biogenic CO2 emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The experimental e-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational in the autumn of 2025. This is the first pre-commercial phase production pilot, with the aim of creating a functioning synthetic fuel production ecosystem and value chain in Finland. In this joint project, companies will openly collaborate to develop eSAF production, carry out validations, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes that can secure domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in the future.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the emerging eSAF market over the next few years. To achieve this goal, it is critical to involve industrial partners across the eSAF value chain who share a common ambition and the will to accelerate the transition towards sustainable fuels,” commented Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

At the beginning of 2025, the EU’s aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation up to 2050. From 2030 onwards, the mandate will also cover fully synthetic fuels produced from carbon dioxide. By 2050, the blending mandate will rise to 70%, half of which must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800 000 passengers or 100 000 tpy of cargo. In Finland, this includes Helsinki Airport and Rovaniemi Airport.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland now has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry generates 20 million tpy of biogenic CO2, with additional volumes coming from biogas plants. These emission sources enable decentralised eSAF production, which increases energy security and balances the national electricity grid.

“Aviation is one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, and its energy transition will require new kinds of innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to help develop Finland’s potential in synthetic jet fuel production while also advancing aviation’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Head of Energy Transition at Finnair.

“Fortum’s mission is to help society achieve carbon neutrality and enable our customers to decarbonise their processes. For jet fuel production, we are pleased to provide renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen – with our pilot hydrogen production plant currently under construction,” added Satu Sipola, Head of Fortum’s Hydrogen Business.

“ABB’s H2 Springboard programme aims to strengthen Finland’s hydrogen economy ecosystem and accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration to develop pioneering solutions,” stated Simo Säynevirta, Partner Ecosystem Lead for ABB’s H2 Springboard programme.

If successful, the project could provide Finland with a significant competitive edge, as there is a global technological race underway to develop cost-effective and scalable solutions.",https://d3vavkuuuw54vu.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/finland-03.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 22:56:24.337501

The latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favors green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.
“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” said Alan Gelder.
Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%.
Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost.","High costs have kept green hydrogen projects from taking off, but new regulations in the European Union’s (EU) refining sector offers a solution to launching this carbon friendly technology at scale, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Isn’t it ironic? How Europe’s oil refiners could offer a route to scale up green hydrogen”, European refiners are set to require ~0.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to comply with EU regulations, replacing about 30% of current CO2-emitting hydrogen production. Refining represents one of the largest hydrogen opportunities globally, which, alongside ammonia and methanol production, accounts for 98% of current demand.

The latest revision of the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favors green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.

“European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,” said Alan Gelder. “Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector.”

The report finds that of the 6 Mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

Refiners demonstrate strongest market appetite

Recent EU Hydrogen Bank auction results reveal refineries’ commitment to green hydrogen adoption, with the sector showing the highest willingness to pay premium prices at an average levelised cost of hydrogen of US$9.23/kg – demonstrating their requirement to meet regulatory mandates. This compares favorably with Wood Mackenzie’s asset-level modeling of refinery-targeted projects, which produces costs of US$7.04 to US$8.30/kg.

The encouraging market signals extend beyond pricing. Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%. However, progress remains uneven across the bloc, with slow national adoption of RED III legislation hampering project development in many member states.

Long-term growth lies in transport fuels

While refinery decarbonization offers the strongest near-term investment case, the marine and aviation sectors present massive long-term growth opportunities for green hydrogen derivatives. The EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation framework alone requires sustainable aviation fuel to power 6% of the jet pool by 2030, with 1.2% coming from green hydrogen-based e-fuels.

By 2050, sustainable aviation fuel mandates could require 8 million tonnes of green hydrogen – representing a compound annual growth rate of over 15% for this sector alone. Similarly, Europe’s FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organization’s Net Zero Framework are driving interest in hydrogen-derived marine fuels.

“The opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen have come full circle,” said Murray Douglas, Vice President of Hydrogen Research at Wood Mackenzie. “The traditional sectors of refining, ammonia and methanol are showing the most progress, ahead of the many other new demand sectors being touted for hydrogen. Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost. But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries’ offtake.”

Douglas added: “Marine and aviation hold much of the long-term potential for hydrogen derivatives, as these sectors are the most challenging to electrify. The challenge lies in competing fuels, the costs of production and the final shape of the policies providing support.”

Policy gaps remain key barrier

Despite the progress, significant hurdles remain. Current EU policy requires RFNBOs to account for only 1% of transport sector energy use by 2030 – a modest target that reflects the challenges in expanding supply. Member states have been slow to transpose RED III into national legislation, creating regulatory uncertainty that has slowed project development across most of the EU.

The report concludes that while European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry, success depends on continued cost reductions and stronger policy support to fully kick-start demand across the continent.

The conference launched with a leadership “Fireside Chat,” setting the stage for the Homefield Advantage theme by spotlighting the top issues and opportunities facing the industry. ACE CEO Brian Jennings, ACE CMO Ron Lamberty, and ACE Board President representing Golden Grain Energy, Dave Sovereign, who is also an Iowa farmer and fuel retailer, began with the implications of a projected record corn crop, underscoring the need for near-term demand drivers—like year-round E15, strong Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) volumes, and export growth—while also exploring longer-term opportunities through low-carbon farming practices and the 45Z tax credit.

“Year-round E15 is the single most impactful step Congress can take right now to strengthen the farm economy by driving greater demand for ethanol,” Jennings said. “At the same time, the Administration can do its part by finalizing robust RFS volumes and making sure those volumes aren’t undercut by excessive refinery exemptions—reallocating any that are granted. Expanding ethanol demand is a better long-term solution for managing a surplus corn crop than short-term government assistance.”

“From the RFS to expanding exports, we have the tools to keep American ethanol competitive at home and abroad,” Sovereign said. “As a grower and a plant board member, I see firsthand the difference these policies make in our communities.”

“Low-carbon farming and tax incentives like 45Z can transform ethanol’s long-term value,” Lamberty said. “We’re working to ensure both producers and farmers get full credit for the carbon reductions they deliver.”

Following the Fireside Chat, attendees listened to a series of general session panels covering:

• The Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (45Z), what it means for ethanol producers, and what steps are needed now to position for eligibility and success.

• A global perspective on ethanol trade and market development, with a focus on overcoming tariff, policy, and regulatory hurdles to expand international demand.

• Advancing ethanol opportunities into new markets such as chemical value chains and ensuring farmer premiums and carbon intensity accountability endure past 45Z.

The first delivery is part of a series of SAFc trades by the company aimed at expanding the corporate buyers’ market access to SAFc and leveraging the firm’s expertise and global sourcing network.

SAFc is an established market-based mechanism decoupling the environmental attribute of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from the physical product through a ‘book and claim’ system and has become an important tool to reduce the environmental impact of essential business travel and air freight. Aviation accounts for 2-3% of global CO2 emissions and as corporate sustainability ambitions grow, so does the need to address these emissions. SAF has emerged as a trusted solution to decarbonize the aviation industry as it can reduce life cycle CO2e emissions by up to 80%, according to IATA. Corporate investment in SAFc supports the global SAF production scale-up, therefore reducing long-term costs and ensuring future SAF supply availability.

Due to its accessibility, SAFc is often used by corporates to claim the environmental attributes of SAF against their business travel or air freight emissions. Purchasing SAFc supports the replacement of fossil kerosene with SAF which has less life-cycle emissions and therefore offers a readily implementable, transparent and scalable solution for corporates looking to address their Scope 3 emissions.

STX Group’s global presence and industry expertise allows the sourcing of high quality SAFc at competitive prices. The SAFc traded by STX Group is always on a third-party public registry, meets stringent additionality guidelines and is always third-party certified. Furthermore, no large minimum purchase volumes are required, providing SAFc access to any corporate.

“We are thrilled to play a role in shaping the SAFc industry by bringing more liquidity to the market. Our long history of trading niche environmental commodity products underlines our role in enhancing liquidity on the new commodity markets. We are therefore well positioned to grow the SAFc industry further, help to scale production and provide access,” says Fabian Roobeek, Managing Partner at STX Group.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/STX_Logo_80e89d0412.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 18:56:14.702047

According to Freightos, air freight shipments creates 20 to 30 times as much pollution as ocean freight shipments.
Last year, by shifting some of its shorter routes to trucking rather than air cargo, it saved about 502,000 tonnes of CO2e.
That said, the company’s cargo emissions were staggeringly large,” Pucker said.
Lufthansa Cargo reportedly told the Loadstar that a binding contract focused on SAFs has not yet been signed.","Fast-fashion giant Shein and logistics player Lufthansa Cargo announced Wednesday that they have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) meant to help them “explore a range of initiatives to drive the adoption of sustainable solutions for air freight.”

The MoU includes a plan to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage on Lufthansa Cargo flights carrying Shein products. Ethan Shen, Shein’s general manager of global fulfillment, said the two companies will work in tandem on integrating SAF into Shein’s supply chain.

“Through this partnership, we aim to pilot and gradually expand the use of SAF where feasible, while continuing to explore additional ways to reduce the carbon footprint across our delivery network,” Shen said in a statement, noting that the company sees the move as “part of a broader decarbonization strategy.”

Today, SAF is not easily accessible in mass quantities; the International Air Transport Association (IATA) noted that SAF accounted for 0.3 percent of all jet fuel production globally last year. The organization expects SAF to hit 0.7 percent of all jet fuel production by the end of this year.

According to Reuters, 2024 Cargo Facts Consulting data showed that Shein ships about 5,000 tonnes of cargo daily.

Arif Gasilov, sustainability and ESG strategy partner at consultancy Gasilov Group, said that while Shein and Lufthansa Cargo’s pilot could see decreased emissions for one-off flights, it’s unlikely that a will significantly impact Shein’s at-large emissions in the immediate near term, in part because of availability challenges.

“In 2024 global production [of SAF] was about one million tonnes, which is only around 0.3 percent of total jet fuel use. That means SAF is still a drop in the bucket, but on the flights where it is used it can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by roughly 80 to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel. For a company like Shein, which ships more than 5,000 tonnes of air cargo per day, running even a single Boeing 777 freighter on SAF would dramatically cut emissions on that flight, but it would barely move the needle on their overall footprint until supply grows,” Gasilov told Sourcing Journal.

Air cargo is widely considered one of the least environmentally friendly ways to ship goods. According to Freightos, air freight shipments creates 20 to 30 times as much pollution as ocean freight shipments.

Shein ships much of its product to customers using air freight, though its 2024 impact report noted that it plans to “promote the greater use of land, sea or multimodal routes, thereby reducing the need for air freight” in the future. Last year, by shifting some of its shorter routes to trucking rather than air cargo, it saved about 502,000 tonnes of CO2e.

Still, that same impact report showed that in 2024 the company’s upstream transportation and distribution emissions accounted for more than 8.5 million tonnes of CO2e, up 13.7 percent from 2023. Its fuel and energy-related activities spiked 106 percent, as compared with 2023.

Ken Pucker, professor of the practice at The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said that Shein’s latest pilot doesn’t change the fact that it relies heavily on air cargo to support its business.

“Good that Shein is exploring low carbon transportation options. That said, the company’s cargo emissions were staggeringly large,” Pucker said. “Their air shipment-based delivery model is profligate and damaging.”

In addition to the SAF pilot, the MoU between Lufthansa Cargo and Shein will see the e-tailer offsetting carbon emissions by supporting the growth of the SAF market. In return for the offsets purchased, Lufthansa Cargo will issue what it calls “Proof of Sustainability” certificates that indicate the SAF quantities used. Betsey Rafeld, senior client engagement manager at Carbon Direct, said purchasing SAF offsets may be a viable option for some markets because of the difficulty of accessing SAF in certain geographic regions; she noted that the U.S. and Europe lead regular adoption.

“Because SAF is relatively limited geographically, the use of SAF Scope 3 certificates is critical to enable buyers globally to interact with the market even if they are not able to physically utilize a flight running on SAF,” Rafeld explained, noting that the impact such certificates could have would be determined by how large an investment Shein decides to make.

Gasilov said that because Shein has built its business model around the use of air cargo for shipping, it could help convince major brands and retailers of SAF’s potential, in turn building up the demand for the alternative fuel. Like many other sustainability initiatives, including the rise of next-generation materials, demand signals help producers make strides toward production at scale. Still, as Rafeld said, without contracts in place, movement can be slow going and difficult.

“[This partnership] puts pressure on other large e-commerce players to explore similar steps and helps build the market for SAF,” Gasilov said.

Lufthansa Cargo reportedly told the Loadstar that a binding contract focused on SAFs has not yet been signed. In the announcement about the MoU, the companies noted that they plan to engage in a “long-term collaboration,” both on SAF and on other environmental and traceability-related initiatives. Rafeld said that a contract outlining the requirements of the partnership could procure more meaningful results.

“Airlines and cargo operators really rely on corporate fliers like Shein to pay the green premium for SAF, so these kinds of partnerships and demand signals are important to support the growth of SAF globally. Ultimately, however, the real impacts are realized when these exploratory relationships become firm deals and completed offtakes,” she said.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires oil refiners and importers to blend minimum amounts of biofuels into the US fuel supply or buy credits from those that do. But refiners that process no more than 75,000 b/d of crude can request full exemptions, potentially saving themselves tens of millions of dollars in compliance costs. President Donald Trump's administration told federal courts this week in various pending cases that it ""has now developed a new approach for reviewing small refinery exemptions"" and is planning to ""issue decisions"".

The administration is expected to provide some clarity on its small refinery exemption policy on Friday, three sources said. A fourth was told by an official that some policy signal was coming ""soon"". EPA did not respond to a request for comment.

But it is unclear how officials will clarify their policy, which could take the form of a proposal, a memo describing the new approach, or separate rulings on the dozens of pending exemption requests stretching back ten years. Federal courts took issue with President Joe Biden's en masse denials of exemption requests, leaving the Trump administration with an unprecedented backlog to resolve. The issue is politically and legally thorny for EPA, pitting two lobbies Trump has pledged to support — oil refiners and farmers — against one other.

Public data on small refinery exemptions updated Thursday showed nine new requests but no decisions over the last month.

The September CBOT US soybean oil contract rose nearly 5pc Thursday to settle at a two-week high of 53.64¢/lb, outpacing gains in crude futures as traders bet on potentially higher biofuel demand if exemptions end up being less generous than they were during Trump's first term. Upward pressure from a higher bean oil-heating oil spread lifted the price of D4 biomass-based diesel and D6 ethanol Renewable Identification Number (RIN) credits. Current-year D4 RINs traded as high as 114¢/RIN, while D6s traded up to 106.25¢/RIN over the busy trading session.

Thorny questions remain

It is unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to immediately clarify its approach to all aspects of this complicated corner of the federal biofuel program. Exemption requests made as recently as last week give the Department of Energy little time to review applications and consult with EPA, as is required by law. And the bulk of potentially eligible refiners have not yet applied for exemptions from this year's blend mandates, since EPA has historically asked applicants to provide at least three quarters of financial data for the relevant compliance year.

Other open questions include whether EPA will require oil companies that remain in the program to blend more biofuels to make up for their exempt competitors and whether EPA will compensate newly exempt companies for past compliance. EPA's separate plan to halve RIN credits in future years for foreign biofuels also complicates the agency's enforcement — since refiners making up for old exemptions might have to bring to market more volume to meet the same mandate if some biofuels start earning fewer program credits than previously.

Legal challenges are highly likely no matter what the administration decides. Oil refiners in particular have expressed increasing frustration with the Trump administration's approach to biofuel policy, which they say is increasing feedstock and fuel costs.

Source: Circularity Fuels via Business Wire","U.S. startup Circularity Fuels has developed an electrical conversion unit capable of directly transforming biogas into electricity. biogas generated on dairy farms dairy farms into synthesis gas, an essential component for the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

This technology allows decentralized production with a capital cost 100 times lower than traditional methane reformers.

The Ouro reactor and waste transformation

On Ouroreactor, designed by Circularity, operates with standard electrical connection and does not require the usual costly pretreatment of biogas. Its innovative system allows direct conversion of methane and carbon dioxide contained in the manure, avoiding their release into the atmosphere and generating feedstock ready to be converted into PBS by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.

The company has validated this operation on a California dairy farm, marking the first case of electric reforming of raw biogas from a covered lagoon digester.

Distributed jet fuel production

One of the main challenges in the adoption of renewable fuels has been infrastructure. Circularity proposes a distributed solution: by enabling the generation of liquid fuel directly on farms, dependence on gas grids is eliminated.

This fuel can be transported by road or rail, and can be easily integrated into existing logistics channels.

With more than 20,000 farms in the United States producing untapped biogas, the possibility of converting this waste into fuel represents a new source of revenue for the agricultural sector.

Impact on aviation and commercial deployment

Airlines face regulatory mandates to incorporate PBS, but currently only a fraction of what is needed is produced. Circularity estimates that, if its technology is implemented at all viable waste sites in the country, it could meet up to 70% of the nation’s demand for jet fuel.

The company will present its technology at the SAF Global Summit in London and plans a full demonstration of biogas production to SAF on a farm later this year. Initial commercial deployment is planned for 2026.

The company’s founder, Dr. Stephen Beaton, former head of the U.S. Air Force Petroleum Office laboratory, stresses that this technology democratizes the production of renewable fuelsby allowing livestock farms to become energy centers.

With catalysts adapted from the automotive automotive industryThe Ouro reactor maintains stable operation even in the presence of contaminants typical of agricultural biogas.

Originating from research at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that converts CO2 emissions and renewable hydrogen into eSAF.

For this pilot, Liquid Sun has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum and Finavia.

In Finland, biogenic CO2 emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The pilot electro-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational this fall.

This is the first precommercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland.

In this collaborative project, the companies will jointly develop eSAF production, conduct validation, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced sustainable aviation fuel.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market,” said Pasi Keinänen, the CEO of Liquid Sun. “To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels.”

At the beginning of 2025, the EU aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation through 2050.

From 2030, the mandate will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO2.

By 2050, the blending requirement will rise to 70 percent, of which half must be eSAF.

The mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo annually.

In Finland, this includes Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airports.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel,” said Henri Hansson, an executive with Finavia. “This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations.”

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels.

The Finnish forest industry alone generates 20 million tons of biogenic CO2 annually, with additional emissions from biogas plants.

These diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, which in turn strengthens energy security and balances electricity grid load nationwide.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require new innovation and collaboration across the value chain,” said Riku Aho, Finnair’s vice president of energy transition. “We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon-neutrality goals.”

Satu Sipola, the vice president of hydrogen and project execution at Fortum, added, “Fortum’s target is to help societies to reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonize their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen from the pilot plant we are currently building.”

Simo Säynevirta, ABB’s head of the H2 Springboard ecosystem, said, “The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s hydrogen-economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions.”

Keinänen with Liquid Sun concluded, “There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage.”","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_d8ba81cf7524412a9951dd12bea9135e~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_915,h_610,al_c,q_85/80995f_d8ba81cf7524412a9951dd12bea9135e~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-08-21 17:56:38.191734

At the beginning of 2025, the EU aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation through 2050. From 2030, the mandate will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO₂. By 2050, the blending requirement will rise to 70%, of which half must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tons of cargo annually. In Finland, this includes Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi airports.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” says Henri Hansson, SVP, Airport Infrastructure, Sustainability, Safety, Security & Compliance at Finavia.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry alone generates 20 million tons of biogenic CO₂ annually, with additional emissions from biogas plants. These diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, which in turn strengthens energy security and balances electricity grid load nationwide.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require new innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon neutrality goals,” says Riku Aho, Vice President Energy Transition, at Finnair.

“Fortum’s target is to help societies to reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonise their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen from the pilot plant we are currently building,” says Satu Sipola, Vice President, Hydrogen and Project Execution at Fortum.

“The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s hydrogen economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions,” says Simo Säynevirta, Head of H2 Springboard ecosystem at ABB.

“There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage,” says Pasi Keinänen, Liquid Sun.",https://www.both2nia.com/application/files/9717/5576/7470/250527-finnair-berlin.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 16:56:55.858679

With corn prices potentially falling below $4 a bushel, Nebraska Corn Board Chairman Brandon Hunnicutt emphasized the challenges faced by local farmers.
In addition to low prices and an abundance of corn, Hunnicutt expressed concerns about the rising costs of fertilizer.
""Right now, fertilizer prices are really high with the combination of corn prices being very low.
Nebraska ethanol plants currently consume nearly 750 million bushels of corn annually, but Hunnicutt says they aim to increase that number.","The Nebraska Corn Board, in collaboration with the National Corn Growers Association (NCGA) and other organizations, convened to discuss pressing issues as the harvest season approaches. With corn prices potentially falling below $4 a bushel, Nebraska Corn Board Chairman Brandon Hunnicutt emphasized the challenges faced by local farmers.

""One thing to be aware of is just...if you if you know a farmer and they do look a little down, try to talk to make sure everything's okay, because these are challenging times,"" said Hunnicutt.

In addition to low prices and an abundance of corn, Hunnicutt expressed concerns about the rising costs of fertilizer. The NCGA reported that fertilizer is expected to account for 36% of a corn farmer's operating costs, with some fertilizers, like ammonium nitrate, increasing in cost by 37% since the beginning of the year due to tariffs and supply chain issues.

""Right now, fertilizer prices are really high with the combination of corn prices being very low. So it's hard for the farmer to try to figure out what to do next year, you know, when we're past this year,"" said Hunnicutt.

The corn board is in discussions with suppliers about prices, and the NCGA has sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, urging action on what they describe as prices approaching 'disastrous levels'.

Meanwhile, Hunnicutt highlighted efforts to innovate within the ethanol industry. ""We're looking at how we can expand ethanol usage, not just in our state, but throughout the nation, throughout the world,"" he said.

Topics such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and year-round nationwide E-15 were addressed. Concerns were raised about the reduction of the $1.75 tax credit for sustainable aviation fuels to $1 under the ""one big beautiful bill,"" which could impact producers.

""We were disappointed that they did that just because, you know, anything we could do to help prop up sustainable aviation fuel, much like we did on the ethanol industry back 40 years ago, 30 years ago, to really get it thriving on its own,"" said Hunnicutt.

Expanding the ethanol market overseas, particularly in Japan, and exploring the maritime fuel industry as a potential market were also discussed, as the maritime fuel industry uses hundreds of millions of tons of fuel annually, but very little ethanol. ""One of the biggest uses of fuel is the marine industry, especially when we talk to large cargo ships. There are bigger, bigger market than SAF will ever be,"" said Hunnicutt.

Research on the maritime industry is underway, and discussions with California about introducing E-15 to their market continue. Nebraska ethanol plants currently consume nearly 750 million bushels of corn annually, but Hunnicutt says they aim to increase that number.

""If we can get that as the drop in fuel, that'll be a big win for the corn farmers and ethanol producers in the state,"" he said.",https://nebraska.tv/resources/media2/16x9/579/986/4x0/90/04364e98-727a-4342-8a35-313e07dcfbf3-Screenshot20250821121216.png,N,,2025-08-21 17:56:42.162070

Mills in Savannah and Riceboro will shut down by the end of next month, as will the company’s Savannah packaging facility. The combined changes will result in a net reduction of International Paper’s annual containerboard capacity by about 1 million tons.

The company will offer severance packages along with outplacement assistance for eligible employees, said Tom Hamic, president of International Paper’s North America Packing Solutions business.

“We understand how deeply these decisions affect our employees, their loved ones, and the surrounding communities,” he said. “We are committed to supporting both our employees and customers as we navigate this transition.”

“These mill closures will undoubtedly deal a devastating blow not only to Georgia’s timber industry, but to the economic fabric of the entire Southeast Georgia region,” added Georgia House Speaker Jon Burns, R-Newington.

The pulp and paper industry has been buffeted by a long-term reduction in demand for its products. The number of mills in Georgia has fallen from 18 at the height of production in 1977 to just nine with Thursday’s closure announcements, Marshall Thomas, president of Albany-based F&W Forest Services, told an audience of political and ag business leaders at the annual Ag Issues Summit at the Georgia National Fairgrounds in Perry.

Thomas said Georgia lawmakers are working to increase demand for timber products, including a state Senate study committee that began meeting last year to explore developing sustainable aviation fuel from biomass, which has become popular in Europe.

“Why aren’t we doing this?” he said. “The world wants green stuff … and we’ve got some of the greatest forestry in the world.”

Thomas said another way to increase demand for timber is being worked on at the federal level. While the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s renewable fuel standard is aimed at increasing the use of renewable fuels to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it bans the use of commercially produced trees in producing those fuels.

“If we could get that relaxed to include trees, it would go a long way,” he said.

“I, along with each member of our delegation in the House, remain committed to working tirelessly with our state leaders, federal partners and timber producers to navigate this difficult transition, secure new employment opportunities for the hundreds of citizens impacted by the closures and safeguard the long-term strength and viability of Georgia’s timber industry,” Burns added.",https://capitol-beat.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cropped-square-logo-2-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 13:56:27.602891

Harbour-Friendly Ships and Quieter Construction

Transportation is one of the largest sectors worldwide, which is why technologies to advance sustainability and efficiency are more prevalent than ever. IDTechEx's portfolios of Electric Vehicles and Robotics & Autonomy Research Reports cover what the future of travel could look like - with fewer emissions, lower carbon footprints, and healthier environments.

Battery electric vehicles are no longer a new phenomenon, but the expansion of electrification across not only cars, but micro vehicles, trucks, ships, and construction vehicles, suggests there is much more to be expected from the EV sector going forward.

Figure 1. The Technology of Sustainable Transportation. Source: IDTechEx.

Considerate construction sites

The quiet hums of diggers and forklifts could replace the once jarring sounds of heavy engines on construction sites in the future with the rise of battery powered vehicles, especially in built-up areas. Diesel engine construction vehicles not only create recurrent fuel costs and air pollution but can create a disturbance amongst the community, meaning the future wellbeing of workers and the wider community will also be enhanced as the future of construction steers towards being increasingly environmentally friendly. From a safety perspective, construction sites may become easier to communicate across, with workers better able to hear instruction over quieter noise levels.

Building companies could incur fewer costs and reduce total costs of ownership by making larger initial investments in electric machinery, and cutting out the need for the continuous purchasing of fuel down the line. Battery types will also come into play, as power density for machinery doesn't need to be as great as with passenger vehicles. The requirement for steady power over longer periods means there is greater versatility in battery solutions, potentially simplifying electrification and creating a greater incentive to make the switch. IDTechEx's report, ""Electric Vehicles in Construction 2024-2044: Technologies, Players, Forecasts"", covers developments being made within the sector that will create this new future of construction.

City navigation with micro EVs and long-haul trucks

Nimble navigation around large cities could be allowed with micro EVs, with ease of movement between traffic jams and amongst the busyness of densely populated areas. Due to smaller battery and motor requirements than with cars, micro EVs are poised as good candidates for early electrification, with lower costs. Electric scooters, mopeds, and three-wheelers are all examples of these small yet efficient vehicles, that could change the future of moving around cities. IDTechEx's report, ""Micro EVs 2026-2046: Electric Two-Wheelers, Three-Wheelers, and Microcars"", explores expected uptake over the next two decades.

Figure 2. Source: IDTechEx.

On a larger scale, trucks rack up a much greater annual mileage than cars and other vehicles, with some doing long haul deliveries across countries. Unlike passenger cars, trucks are a capital good for firms and businesses, with lifecycles of approximately 10 years. Making the initial investments into deploying electric trucks could therefore be more profitable in the long run, as they are likely to cost less to refuel over their lifetime.

The reduced noise of large engines on highways and service stations may also be appreciated for not only other road users, but the truck drivers themselves, making driving more pleasant. Along with the reduction in emissions, electric trucks could boast not only operational and financial benefits, but environmental benefits. Visit IDTechEx's report, ""Electric and Fuel Cell Trucks 2025-2045: Technologies, Markets, Forecasts"", for more details.

Making waves with electrification

Seaside and port towns of the future may be home to even more tranquillity and the peaceful sightings of ships, unaccompanied by the large vibration of engines.

Hybrid ships, functioning with both an engine and a battery, could turn off their engines miles out from shore, and eradicate the need for them to be running while a ship is stationary in port, so that air quality can improve, and surrounding areas don't need observe fuel emissions. The electrification of ships can also allow for greater speed and efficiency during travel. For leisure boats, less maintenance may be required, while passengers can benefit from increased performance and responsiveness, enhancing the overall experience.

The reductions in emissions offered by electric ships could be beneficial all over the world, with most goods being transported by sea at some time during their journey, meaning electric ships could lead to cleaner ocean air everywhere.

Electric ships could also act as microgrids for local power operations, benefitting communities with their large batteries and electrical capabilities by taking on excess power and returning the favour when a balance is needed. In this way, ships can also rely on local power sources to recharge for their next journey, without the need for large amounts of fuel. IDTechEx's reports, ""Electric Boats & Ships 2024-2044"" and ""Electric Vehicles: Land, Sea, and Air 2025-2045"" cover the waves being made within the marine transportation sector.

Fast fuelling hydrogen stations

Driving with only water vapour as a tailpipe emission could make road users feel good about not contributing to harmful emissions and improving local air quality. Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) provide a zero-emission solution to travelling, for cars, buses, trucks, and other road vehicles. For consumers opting to buy these cars, there may be a feeling of doing right by the environment, while OEMs benefit from meeting emission reduction targets. With the possibility of refuelling at hydrogen pumps taking as little as 5 minutes, FCEVs can also offer increased convenience, without waiting around for batteries to charge.

FCEVs also have the edge on energy density over battery electric cars. FCEVs therefore provide improved range, more comparable to ICE cars, but without the harmful emissions. IDTechEx's report, ""Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles 2025-2045: Markets, Technologies, Forecasts"" covers the technologies behind FCEVs that allow them to use hydrogen as a fuel, including the most commonly adopted proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC).

Fuel cells travelling sky-high

The possibility for planes to be fitted with fuel cells alongside the closer implementation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could lead to flying becoming a more environmentally friendly form of travel. Some major aircraft manufacturers are already looking to the future where planes could be fitted with hydrogen fuel cells to incur the same emission-free benefits that are currently possible on the road. Passengers travelling for leisure or work won't have to be concerned with the responsibility of a hefty carbon footprint, knowing that water vapour is the only emission produced while flying.

The costs and availability of resources, however, mean that in the near future, SAF is likely to be the first sustainable and most feasible option. SAF is already being combined with regular jet fuel to reduce the overall carbon footprint of air travel, as it is responsible for less production emissions. IDTechEx's report, ""Sustainable Future Aviation 2025-2045: Trends, Technologies, Forecasts"", explores a number of possibilities for the future of sustainable air travel, with predictions on the uptake of fuel cells and SAF in planes.

In autumn 2025, a pre-commercial electro Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF) pilot in Espoo will launch, harnessing low-temperature electrolysis to turn biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen into jet fuel. And this is no mere demo—it’s Finland’s first pre-commercial facility aimed squarely at bridging the gap between bench-scale experiments and a full industrial rollout. With the EU’s 2030 SAF blending rules looming, the hope is to slash hundreds of millions of tonnes off aviation’s carbon footprint and show that synthetic fuels can truly scale.

What’s Happening

Liquid Sun, a Tampere University spin-off, has sprinted to the front of the pack in electrolysis tech for green fuels. They’ve pulled in nearly €4 million in seed and VC rounds, working with Soletair Power on Direct Air Capture and teaming up with Austria’s GIG Karasek for process engineering savvy. Now they’re joining forces with national carrier Finnair, electrification titan ABB, energy heavyweight Fortum, and airport operator Finavia to build Finland’s first pre-commercial eSAF pilot plant in Espoo’s industrial park. The cherry on top? That synthetic jet fuel will flow straight into the Helsinki-Vantaa supply chain.

Why This Matters

Cutting emissions in aviation is no walk in the park: biofuels hit feedstock walls, and fully electric or green hydrogen planes aren’t ready for long-haul routes yet. Enter eSAF. By using renewable electricity, captured CO2, and green hydrogen, it truly closes the carbon loop—potentially slashing life-cycle greenhouse gases by up to 90% versus fossil jet fuel. It’s tailor-made for the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation rule, which requires at least 6% of jet fuel to be sustainable by 2030. It’s also a prime example of industrial decarbonization in action, with Finland vying to lead the charge in the global e-fuel market—if they can scale up and hit the right price point.

How It Works

At the heart of this pilot is low-temperature electrolysis (LTE), which uses moderate heat—think under 100 °C—to split water and CO2 into a ready-made syngas cocktail. Here’s the gist:

Renewable juice from Fortum wind and solar parks powers a custom Liquid Sun electrolyser, making hydrogen production a reality.

The electrolyser feeds on water (H2O) and biogenic CO2—sourced from nearby forest and biogas plants—to churn out CO and H2.

That syngas mix gets cleaned up and sent into a Fischer–Tropsch reactor, stitching together long-chain hydrocarbons perfect for jet engines.

The final result? A drop-in eSAF blend that slots straight into existing fuel systems at Finavia-run airports, no engine mods needed.

From Lab to Pilot

There’s no shortage of demo-scale electrolysers across Europe and North America, but few have edged close to commercialization. Liquid Sun burst out of Tampere University in 2023 on the back of new electrode materials and cell designs that boost both energy efficiency and durability—critical for upscaling. Partnerships with Soletair Power added Direct Air Capture modules for flexible CO2 sourcing—either forest-industry emissions or ambient air. Meanwhile, GIG Karasek provided the scale-up know-how, translating bench-scale reactor kinetics into a pilot-ready process skid. After fine-tuning in Tampere, they picked Espoo for its industrial network and proximity to aviation infrastructure. It’s all part of a bigger push toward industrial decarbonization.

Finland’s Edge

Espoo, Finland’s second-largest city, has transformed from pastoral farmland into a cleantech powerhouse over the last four decades. Home to Aalto University and an array of R&D hubs, the city offers deep talent pools, pilot-scale fabrication facilities, and steady sustainable energy from district heating and on-grid renewables. Plus, Finland’s forest industry churns out millions of tonnes of biogenic CO2 each year—a feedstock hardly anyone else taps for fuel synthesis. By basing the eSAF pilot here, partners cut transport and energy loss, sketching a blueprint for circular carbon management in aviation.

Broader Impact

Beyond the obvious emissions cuts, this pilot could spark a slew of positive knock-on effects:

Domestic value chain: From CO2 capture to fuel distribution, Finland could build an end-to-end ecosystem spanning R&D, manufacturing, and logistics.

Jobs & skills: Expect new roles in electrolysis engineering, catalyst development, and modular plant ops—boosting local economies.

Technology export: If Espoo’s model flies, Finnish electrolysis units and process know-how could find eager markets in global decarbonization efforts.

Policy momentum: Demonstrating a real-world eSAF supply may accelerate carbon pricing, investment grants, and SAF blending incentives.

Funding & Partnerships

Securing nearly €4 million in early-stage backing—from Voima Ventures and others—underscores investor confidence in green hydrogen and synthetic fuel tech. The multi-industry consortium—airline, energy supplier, airport operator, industrial tech firm, and cleantech start-ups—reflects the complexity of industrial decarbonization. Each partner brings a unique piece: Finnair provides fuel off-take and regulatory insight; ABB integrates automation and grid interfaces; Fortum supplies renewable power; Finavia manages storage and blending at airports; while Liquid Sun, Soletair Power, and GIG Karasek deliver the core process technologies.

Challenges Ahead

Of course, there are hurdles. Electrolysis is energy-hungry—operational costs ride on electricity pricing and how often you can crank up the plant. Scaling from kilowatt demos to multi-megawatt installations will demand tougher materials and more durable stacks. Sustainable CO2 sourcing must ramp up without triggering land-use conflicts or bottlenecks. And the global SAF market is still taking shape, so high production costs may need policy support—think carbon credits or minimum blending quotas—to level the playing field.

As the aviation sector seeks to decarbonize, interest in power-to-liquid sustainable aviation fuels – or eSAFs – is rapidly gaining momentum. With regulatory pressure increasing and the promise of high greenhouse gas savings, many industry players are exploring how best to initiate an eSAF project. But while the technology is ready, other forces are not: policy uncertainty, offtake commitments, feedstock availability and project costs continue to hold back scale-up. For any project team considering this complex space, the question is no longer if eSAF can be made, but how best to make it economically viable. That begins with choosing the right production method.

Key project drivers: technology, policy and profitability

There are three pillars to consider when assessing eSAF projects: the technology platform, the policy environment in your region, and how you intend to improve financial returns.

From a regulatory perspective, projects are navigating evolving certification rules, lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting methods and uneven policy support across jurisdictions. The right time-to-market can significantly affect your exposure to carbon price incentives and funding schemes.

Then there’s offtake. Investors will not back a project without clear product demand. Your choice of technology can influence your offtake success – by determining the fuel mix, emissions profile and operational reliability. Above all, the project must focus on maximizing yield, minimizing energy use and translating as much of your electricity and hydrogen input into certified kerosene as possible.

Why energy efficiency is non-negotiable

At the heart of every eSAF project is a basic truth: you are working against the laws of thermodynamics. Producing liquid hydrocarbons from electricity and carbon dioxide is, by nature, energy intensive. This is especially true for reverse combustion pathways, where energy is consumed to recreate fuels that were originally burned.

Because of this, energy efficiency isn’t just a technical metric – it’s an economic imperative. Hydrogen, produced via electrolysis, represents over half of the total cost of eSAF production.1 Minimizing hydrogen and electricity consumption across the entire process chain can significantly reduce the cost per ton of fuel. For any project, the question becomes: how do we get the most certified kerosene out of every electron and every kilogram of hydrogen?

Comparing the three core technology routes

While multiple technologies are under development, three primary pathways are frontrunners:

Fischer-Tropsch with Combustion RWGS (Reverse Water-Gas Shift)

Fischer-Tropsch with eREACT™ (electrified RWGS)

Methanol-to-Jet (MtJ), including methanol synthesis followed by olefin oligomerization

All three aim to convert CO2 and hydrogen into synthetic hydrocarbons. Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes first create syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, which is then converted into hydrocarbons. In the FT-Combustion pathway a traditional tubular reformer or autothermal reformer is required to convert H₂ and CO₂ to synthesis gas (CO + H2) for the Fischer-Tropsch reaction. The heat of reaction must be supplied through combustion of methane (converted from CO₂ and H₂) or by burning pure H2 (directly or indirectly) – a high energy and cost penalty solution. By contrast, eREACT™ replaces combustion with electric heating, improving hydrogen and electricity efficiency.

MtJ seems deceptively simple, involving direct methanol synthesis from CO2 and H2, followed by conversion into jet-range hydrocarbons. However, this route introduces its own complexities, particularly with carbon losses during the methanol-to-olefins (MTO) step, which directly translates to lost hydrogen.

Hydrogen and electricity - the economic heartbeat

The economic success of any eSAF pathway hinges on how efficiently it uses hydrogen and electricity. In the FT-Combustion route, a significant amount of hydrogen is sacrificed to drive the RWGS reaction through combustion, releasing heat but converting hydrogen into water rather than fuel. This makes it the least hydrogen-efficient option, and thus the most expensive in an environment where hydrogen accounts for over 55% of total production cost.

Both FT with eREACT™ and MtJ offer clear improvements in this regard. FT with eREACT™, which uses electrically heated reactors, avoids hydrogen combustion entirely. MtJ appears slightly less efficient than eREACT™ due to carbon deposition losses during the methanol upgrading step, but the two are broadly comparable in once-through analysis. Yet once you look beyond total liquid output and focus specifically on jet fuel yields, critical differences begin to emerge.

Unlocking efficiency with recycle and integration

One of the major advantages of FT with eREACT™ lies in its flexibility to recycle unused hydrocarbons. In a once-through system, lighter products such as naphtha are typically removed and sold separately – reducing overall kerosene yield and potentially complicating offtake strategies. With the G2L™ e-fuels approach - a fully integrated process where the Topsoe technologies are fully integrated with Sasol LTFT® technology - these light ends can be redirected into the front of the process, converted again alongside fresh CO2 and hydrogen.

This recycling loop not only increases kerosene yield to 100% of product output, while maintaining a higher than 95% CO2 efficiency but also significantly reduces hydrogen and electricity demand. By eliminating the need to produce non-target products, the system becomes highly selective – and far more efficient. Compared to once-through production, naphtha recycling alone cuts electricity use by around 15%, all while maintaining the same level of certified SAF output.

The case for Fischer-Tropsch with eREACTTM

Fischer-Tropsch with eREACT™ becomes even more compelling when deeper system integration is introduced. One key innovation is the use of high-temperature steam – naturally produced by the exothermic FT process – to integrate with a Solid Oxide Electrolyzer Cell (SOEC) plant for hydrogen generation. This creates a tightly integrated loop, where process waste heat is repurposed to lower the electricity required for electrolysis.

The result is striking: electricity demand drops by as much as 33% compared to conventional alkaline electrolysis systems. When combined with naphtha recycle, the FT with eREACT™ system achieves over 95% carbon efficiency, 97% hydrogen efficiency and delivers 100% of its output as ASTM-certified kerosene. These figures are not theoretical – they represent a practical, highly integrated approach that aligns technical performance with economic viability.

Summary comparison and takeaway

When comparing the three major technology routes, FT with combustion RWGS stands out as the least favorable due to high hydrogen wastage. Methanol-to-Jet and FT with eREACT™ appear similar on a once-through basis, but when optimized for 100% SAF production through recycling and heat integration, FT with eREACT™ pulls clearly ahead. It reduces capital burden on electrolyzers, lowers electricity and hydrogen usage and maximizes kerosene yield – simplifying offtake and improving return on investment.

For today’s eSAF projects, the most cost-effective and efficient route is a fully integrated G2l™ eFuels solution including Fischer-Tropsch system with eREACT™, naphtha recycle and SOEC-based hydrogen production. It not only addresses the thermodynamic and economic challenges of reverse combustion but sets a benchmark for how thoughtful technology choice can unlock real project value.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/Do%20clear%20skies%20or%20stiff%20headwinds%20lie%20ahead%20as%20SAF%20heads%20for%20a%20major%20takeoff.png,N,,2025-08-21 14:57:23.948146

— Air India, a Tata group airline, and India’s largest refiner and fuel supplier, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), have signed a memorandum of understanding to supply Air India with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) manufactured by IOC. Hence, statement 3 is not correct.

Story continues below this ad

— IOC was the first firm in India to acquire ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat refinery in Haryana. ISCC CORSIA is a certification method for SAF that ensures compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) requirements. It is a requirement for commercial SAF manufacture. According to IOC, the certification serves as a baseline for other domestic refiners and industry participants looking to increase SAF production.

— SAF is a biofuel that is produced from sustainable feedstocks and has chemistry similar to conventional aviation turbine fuel (ATF) or jet fuel, which is derived from crude oil. This means that existing aircraft engines can easily use the SAF-ATF blend. For instance, Airbus claims that all its aircraft are capable of flying on a maximum 50 per cent blend of SAF and conventional fuel. Various Indian airlines have already operated successfully a few test and demonstration flights using jet fuel doped with SAF in various proportions. According to aviation industry and energy experts, SAF alone is likely to account for over 60 per cent of the global aviation industry’s decarbonisation efforts. Hence, statement 1 is correct.

— With the mandatory phase of CORSIA beginning in 2027, the year 2027 will be a watershed moment for global SAF implementation. CORSIA, which applies to international flights, would mandate airlines worldwide to offset any increase in CO2 emissions above 2020 levels. Using jet fuel blended with SAF is one option for carriers to keep their emissions under acceptable levels.

— India, too, will have to comply with the mandatory phase starting 2027. In line with the CORSIA framework, India’s National Biofuel Coordination Committee (NBCC) has set the initial indicative targets for blending of SAF with jet fuel 2027 onwards, starting with international flights. The indicative targets are: 1 per cent blending in 2027 and 2 per cent in 2028. The government is expected to announce SAF blending mandates for domestic flights in India as well, but only after blending for international flights begins 2027 onwards. Hence, statement 2 is not correct.

Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

QUESTION 2

Consider the following countries:

1. United Arab Emirates (UAE)

2. United Kingdom (UK)

3. United States of America (USA)

4. Singapore

Story continues below this ad

What is the correct order of non-residents from the above countries (from high to low) who own a share of domestic mutual fund (MF) units in terms of face value?

(a) 3—2—1—4

(b) 3—4—1—2

(c) 1—3—4—2

(d) 1—3—2—4

Explanation

— Domestic mutual fund industry’s foreign liabilities surged 19.9 per cent to $30.5 billion, in market value terms during financial year 2025, primarily driven by an increase in units issued to non-residents, a Reserve Bank of India survey showed.

— Among major countries, non-residents of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) held the largest share in mutual fund (MF) units, both in terms of face value (21.2 per cent) as well as at market value (20.2 per cent) during fiscal 2025. In face value terms, foreign liabilities in units of MFs held by non-residents of UAE increased by 32.8 per cent to Rs 3,305 crore in FY25, while in market value terms, they rose by 28 per cent to Rs 11,508 crore.

— The non-residents of other countries that own a large share of domestic MF units, in face value terms, include the United States of America (USA) – 11.2 per cent, the United Kingdom (UK) – 10.8, and Singapore – 6.6 per cent.

Story continues below this ad

— The survey showed that overseas assets of MFs declined by 5.6 per cent and stood at $8.3 billion in March 2025, due to lower holdings of foreign equity securities.

Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

QUESTION 3

Consider the following statements:

1. Indian coffee exporters have benefitted from global ending stocks for 2024-25 due to subpar crops in Brazil and Vietnam.

2. India mostly exports arabica beans.

3. In India, Kerala is the largest coffee-producing state.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one

(b) Only two

(c) All three

(d) None

Explanation

— India exported goods valued at $437.4 billion during 2024-25, which was 0.1% higher than the $437.1 billion in the previous financial year ended March 31, 2025. During April-June 2025, total exports, at $112 billion, were 1.7% up over the $110.1 billion for April-June 2024.

— Indian coffee exporters have benefitted from global ending stocks for 2024-25 depleting to their lowest since 1999-2000, mainly courtesy of subpar crops in Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s biggest producers of arabica and robusta varieties respectively. India mostly exports robusta beans and powder used in instant coffee and espresso blends. Tobacco exports have similarly got a boost from output shortfalls in Brazil and Zimbabwe. Hence, statement 1 is correct and statement 2 is not correct.

QUESTION 4

Consider the following statements:

1. Eliminating the duty on cotton imports could soften the impact of high US tariffs on the labour-intensive sector.

2. The elimination of duty is largely aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only

(b) 2 only

(c) Both 1 and 2

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Explanation

— The government agreed to a long-standing demand of the textile industry to eliminate the 11 per cent duty on cotton imports, in a bid to soften the impact of high US tariffs on the labour-intensive sector, which is expected to take the hardest hit from the 50 per cent US levy. Hence, statement 1 is correct.

Story continues below this ad

— However, the calibrated relief measure to eliminate the duty until September 30 could also help ease trade tensions with the US, as Washington is the second-largest cotton exporter to India and has been pushing for broader access to the Indian market during negotiations for a trade deal.

— While the elimination of duty is largely aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the industry — ranging from steep US tariffs to high cotton prices — it also acts as a signal to US negotiators that India could be willing to negotiate imports of cotton from Washington, an industry executive said. Hence, statement 2 is correct.

— New Delhi-based think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI) said that almost all of India’s $1.20 billion cotton imports in FY2025 were of staple length 28 mm or above and that under the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, 51,000 MT of such cotton already enters duty-free. This means the biggest winner from India’s new duty-free window will be the US, GTRI said.

Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.

QUESTION 5

MCLR, or Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate, is a:

Story continues below this ad

(a) benchmark interest rate set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for banks to determine the minimum interest rate they can charge on loans.

(b) Rate fixed by RBI at which it lends money to commercial banks.

(c) Interest rate paid by the government on its borrowings from the public.

(d) Benchmark rate at which banks borrow from international financial institutions.

Explanation

Story continues below this ad

— Public sector lenders, including the State Bank of India (SBI), Bank of Baroda (BoB) and Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) have reduced their marginal cost of funds-based lending rates (MCLR) by up to 35 basis points (bps) across various tenors.

— The reduction follows a cumulative reduction of 100 bps in the repo rate to 5.5 per cent by the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) between February and June. In the August monetary policy meeting, the six-member MPC left the repo rate unchanged. One basis point is one hundredth of one percentage point.

— MCLR, or Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate, is a benchmark interest rate set by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for banks to determine the minimum interest rate they can charge on loans.

Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

Today, the sector is doing more than just supplying fuels; it is redefining its role in an evolving energy landscape. The focus is now on balancing reliable fossil fuel output with growing investments in cleaner, lower-carbon solutions. Refiners are pushing into renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, using government incentives and rising corporate demand to create durable growth opportunities. At the same time, U.S. refiners are exporting more fuels to Latin America and Europe, capturing healthy margins while diversifying revenue streams. Volatility in crude prices and inflation-driven costs still threaten near-term earnings, but the sector’s adaptability remains evident. Against this backdrop, four names — Marathon Petroleum (MPC), Phillips 66 (PSX), Galp Energia (GLPEY) and Par Pacific Holdings (PARR) — stand out as uniquely positioned to balance profitability today with opportunity tomorrow.

Industry Overview

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing industry consists of companies involved in selling refined petroleum products (including heating oil, gasoline, jet fuel, residual oil, etc.) and a plethora of non-energy materials (like asphalt, road salt, clay and gypsum). Some companies also operate refined product terminals, storage facilities and transportation services. The primary activity of these firms involves buying crude/other feedstocks and processing them into a wide variety of refined products. Refining margins are extremely volatile and generally reflect the state of petroleum product inventories, demand for refined products, imports, regional differences and capacity utilization in the industry. Other major determinants of refining profitability are the light/heavy and sweet/sour spreads. Refiners are also prone to unplanned outages.

3 Trends Defining the Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing Industry's Future

Growing Role of Low-Carbon Solutions: While conventional fuels remain critical, refiners are expanding into renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, and other low-carbon alternatives. Government incentives and rising corporate demand for cleaner fuels are accelerating these investments, positioning refiners for long-term relevance in a decarbonizing economy. Importantly, integrating renewable projects into existing infrastructure lowers costs and allows companies to balance near-term fossil fuel strength with long-term energy transition opportunities. This dual approach adds resilience to the industry’s future earnings profile.

Advantaged Export Opportunities: The refining industry is increasingly leveraging global arbitrage opportunities. Strong demand from international markets, particularly Latin America and Europe, has created an outlet for U.S. refined product exports, allowing refiners to capture higher margins abroad. Export access provides a natural hedge against domestic market softness while diversifying revenue streams. This global connectivity not only enhances profitability but also underscores the strategic importance of U.S. refining capacity in balancing global fuel supplies.

Margin Pressure from Volatile Crude and Product Prices: Despite recent strength, refining margins remain highly exposed to swings in crude oil prices and product spreads. A sudden easing of geopolitical tensions or an unexpected surge in global supply could compress crack spreads, squeezing profitability across the sector. Meanwhile, inflationary cost pressures—ranging from maintenance expenses to compliance with environmental regulations—further challenge earnings stability. Without consistent pricing tailwinds, refiners face the risk of earnings volatility and weaker shareholder returns.

Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Positive Outlook

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing is a 15-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil - Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #56, which places it in the top 23% of 246 Zacks industries.

The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates fairly strong near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.

Considering the encouraging dynamics of the industry, we will present a few stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio. But it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.

Industry Underperforms Sector & S&P 500

The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing industry has fared worse than the broader Zacks Oil - Energy Sector as well as the Zacks S&P 500 composite over the past year.

The industry has gone down 10.1% over this period compared with the broader sector’s decrease of 0.6%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has gained 15.9%.

One-Year Price Performance

Industry's Current Valuation

Since oil and gas companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. This is because the valuation metric takes into account not just equity but also the level of debt. For capital-intensive companies, EV/EBITDA is a better valuation metric because it is not influenced by changing capital structures and ignores the effect of noncash expenses.

On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value-to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 4.24X, significantly lower than the S&P 500’s 17.60X. It is also below the sector’s trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA of 4.92X.

Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 6.95X and as low as 1.79X, with a median of 3.63X, as the chart below shows.

Celebi, a Turkiye-based ground handling services company, has withdrawn its plea in the Bombay High Court. This plea contested the revocation of its security clearance by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. The revocation followed backlash over Turkiye's support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor. The Bombay HC was awaiting a verdict from Delhi HC on a similar plea.

The subsidiary of Turkiye-based airport ground handling services major Celebi on Thursday withdrew its plea in the Bombay High Court against revocation of its security clearance by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) in the aftermath of Operation Sindoor.

A bench of Justices B P Colabawalla and Firdosh Pooniwalla allowed the same and disposed of the plea.

The Bombay HC had been deferring hearing of the plea awaiting a verdict on an identical plea before Delhi HC, which was dismissed last month.

On July 7, the Delhi HC dismissed a writ petition by another Celebi subsidiary seeking suspension and annulment of the security clearance cancellation.

Celebi's counsel Chetan Kapadia on Thursday told Bombay HC bench that the firm seeks to withdraw its plea, which the court accepted.

Live Events

The petition had sought suspension and annulment of the administrative decision of security clearance cancellation granted by Bureau of Civil Aviation Security under the Ministry of Civil Aviation of India.

The HC had last month also vacated its earlier interim order restraining Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) from finalising tenders for ground and bridge handling services post termination of Celebi's contract.

A single bench had then said the interim protection granted in May cannot be continued in view of the judgment passed by the Delhi High Court in July dismissing the petition filed by Celebi against similar contract termination of the Delhi airport and revocation of security clearance.

Amid the backlash in India over Turkiye's support to Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, India's aviation security regulator BCAS revoked the security clearance of Celebi Airport Services India on grounds related to national security with immediate effect.

The company had moved the High Court against revocation of its security clearance and subsequent termination of its contract with MIAL.

• EU regulations favor green over blue hydrogen

• Strong policy is needed to reach targets and costs must come down

• Marine and aviation sectors offer significant growth potential

LONDON/HOUSTON/SINGAPORE, 21 August 2025 - High costs have kept green hydrogen projects from taking off, but new regulations in the European Union's (EU) refining sector offers a solution to launching this carbon friendly technology at scale, according to a new Horizons report from Wood Mackenzie.

According to the report, “Isn’t it ironic? How Europe’s oil refiners could offer a route to scale up green hydrogen”, European refiners are set to require ~0.5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030 to comply with EU regulations, replacing about 30% of current CO2-emitting hydrogen production. Refining represents one of the largest hydrogen opportunities globally, which, alongside ammonia and methanol production, accounts for 98% of current demand.

The latest revision of the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED III), favors green hydrogen over blue hydrogen, helping to minimise the delays and cancellations now all too common when it comes to green hydrogen globally.

""European refiners are set to become significant producers or buyers of green hydrogen, initially to decarbonise the refining sector and its derivatives as fuel for marine and aviation,"" said Alan Gelder. ""Numerous green hydrogen projects have already targeted the sector.""

The report finds that of the 6 Mtpa of low-carbon hydrogen capacity that has taken a final investment decision (FID), European refineries have already committed more than US$5 billion of capital.

Refiners demonstrate strongest market appetite

Recent EU Hydrogen Bank auction results reveal refineries' commitment to green hydrogen adoption, with the sector showing the highest willingness to pay premium prices at an average levelised cost of hydrogen of US$9.23/kg - demonstrating their requirement to meet regulatory mandates. This compares favorably with Wood Mackenzie's asset-level modeling of refinery-targeted projects, which produces costs of US$7.04 to US$8.30/kg.

The encouraging market signals extend beyond pricing. Average green hydrogen costs dropped 18% in the latest EU auctions, with German bids falling more than 55%. However, progress remains uneven across the bloc, with slow national adoption of RED III legislation hampering project development in many member states.

Long-term growth lies in transport fuels

While refinery decarbonization offers the strongest near-term investment case, the marine and aviation sectors present massive long-term growth opportunities for green hydrogen derivatives. The EU's ReFuelEU Aviation framework alone requires sustainable aviation fuel to power 6% of the jet pool by 2030, with 1.2% coming from green hydrogen-based e-fuels.

By 2050, sustainable aviation fuel mandates could require 8 million tonnes of green hydrogen - representing a compound annual growth rate of over 15% for this sector alone. Similarly, Europe's FuelEU Maritime Regulation and the International Maritime Organization's Net Zero Framework are driving interest in hydrogen-derived marine fuels.

""The opportunities for low-carbon hydrogen have come full circle,"" said Murray Douglas, Vice President of Hydrogen Research at Wood Mackenzie. ""The traditional sectors of refining, ammonia and methanol are showing the most progress, ahead of the many other new demand sectors being touted for hydrogen. Parts of the refining sector can be decarbonised quickly – and at an acceptable cost. But it requires policy intervention to lower green hydrogen production costs and increase the refineries' offtake.""

Douglas added: ""Marine and aviation hold much of the long-term potential for hydrogen derivatives, as these sectors are the most challenging to electrify. The challenge lies in competing fuels, the costs of production and the final shape of the policies providing support.""

Policy gaps remain key barrier

Despite the progress, significant hurdles remain. Current EU policy requires RFNBOs to account for only 1% of transport sector energy use by 2030 - a modest target that reflects the challenges in expanding supply. Member states have been slow to transpose RED III into national legislation, creating regulatory uncertainty that has slowed project development across most of the EU.

The report concludes that while European refiners could play a critical role in scaling up the green hydrogen industry, success depends on continued cost reductions and stronger policy support to fully kick-start demand across the continent.

MoU promotes low-carbon aviation and Air India’s net-zero 2050 goals

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has made a significant move toward greener aviation in India after signing a historic agreement to supply sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Air India. The agreement symbolizes the commitment of both companies to invest in low-carbon aviation and to support global decarbonisation efforts.

According to IOC Chairman Arvinder Singh Sahney, IOC plans to source used cooking oil to produce SAF at its Panipat refinery, starting in December of this year. The facility is expected to produce 35,000 tonnes of SAF annually, with the cooking oil sourced from major hotel and restaurant chains, including ITC and Haldiram's.

SAF, a non-petroleum alternative to conventional jet fuel, can be blended into aviation turbine fuel (ATF) based on SAF availability, up to 50%. India is going to require 1% SAF blending in jet fuel for international airlines by 2027.

The official statement said, ""This collaboration reaffirms IOC's role as a trailblazer in India's energy transition, bringing India closer to a greener, cleaner aviation future"".

This uniquely modified aircraft, capable of operating with five engines, has been a cornerstone in developing advanced engines like the Trent 1000 and Pearl 10X since 2005.

Its retirement marks the end of an era but highlights the company’s ongoing commitment to sustainable aviation.

Boeing 747-200 FTB Final Flight

The FTB’s final mission in July 2025 supported the Advanced Low Emissions Combustion System (ALECSys) demonstrator, advancing Rolls-Royce’s efforts to create more efficient, eco-friendly engines.

Over its 20-year service, the aircraft logged more than 2,000 hours of testing, playing a pivotal role in pushing engine development boundaries.

John Knight, Director of Test & Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, praised its legacy.

“The Flying Test Bed has been a workhorse for us, helping us innovate in engine development. While we bid farewell to this Queen of the Skies, we continue to advance testing through flying test beds, ground facilities, and digital modeling.”

Previous Test Highlights

Trent 1000 SAF testing

A standout moment came in 2021 when the FTB tested a Trent 1000 engine powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) during a nearly four-hour flight from Tucson, Arizona, over Texas and New Mexico.

The other three RB211 engines ran on standard jet fuel, and the test confirmed no engineering issues with SAF.

This flight was part of a broader program that certified all Rolls-Royce in-production engines for long-haul aircraft and business jets as compatible with 100% SAF.

This milestone made Rolls-Royce the first jet engine manufacturer to achieve this, supporting the aviation industry’s push toward sustainability.

The 2021 SAF test also paved the way for Virgin Atlantic’s historic 2023 transatlantic flight. This became the world’s first flight using 100% SAF on a Trent 1000-powered Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

This achievement underscored Rolls-Royce’s commitment to becoming a net-zero company by 2050 and helping customers reach similar goals.

The FTB’s work on the Trent 1000 also validated a durability enhancement package, significantly extending the engine’s time on wing.

Pearl 10X Engine Tests

Another notable chapter involved testing the Pearl 10X, the most powerful engine in Rolls-Royce’s leading Pearl family for business aviation.

Designed exclusively for Dassault’s Falcon 10X, the Pearl 10X required a custom pylon to mount on the FTB’s starboard wing alongside two RB211 engines.

The port wing carried a third RB211 and a Trent 1000, creating the aircraft’s distinctive five-engine configuration.

During tests, pilots controlled the RB211s and Trent 1000 from the cockpit. Meanwhile, a dedicated Pearl 10X operator on the engineering deck managed that engine, maintaining constant communication with the flight crew.

This setup showcased the aircraft’s flexibility and the ingenuity of Rolls-Royce’s teams and partners.

Conclusion

As Rolls-Royce retires the iconic Boeing 747 FTB, it continues to innovate through a combination of advanced testing methods.

The company’s focus remains on developing sustainable, high-performance engines to meet the aviation industry’s evolving needs.

The FTB’s legacy as a pioneer in engine testing will inspire future advancements, ensuring Rolls-Royce remains at the forefront of aviation technology.",https://aviationsourcenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GyxYh51WcAA6UQn-1-1.png,N,,2025-08-21 07:56:19.312282

United States long-haul flights power global aviation growth with bold routes, record demand, and new tourism opportunities. In 2025, United States long-haul flights remain the driving force of the aviation industry, proving how global aviation growth depends on bold routes and smart strategies. As airlines expand, they showcase record demand, while new tourism opportunities continue to reshape markets and destinations worldwide.

The United States is at the centre of this aviation shift. Long-haul flights from major hubs link continents, support record demand, and fuel tourism opportunities. Each bold route strengthens global aviation growth, allowing airlines to power ahead while securing revenue and market share. Travellers benefit as long-haul flights bring greater choice, comfort, and convenience. At the same time, global tourism grows when new connections attract record visitors to destinations that once felt out of reach.

Aviation growth depends on both demand and innovation. United States carriers invest in premium cabins, sustainable operations, and new bold routes to stay ahead. These long-haul flights create a cycle where record demand powers airports, tourism, and trade. New tourism opportunities also rise as United States airlines open direct links to Greenland, Australia, and beyond. Global aviation growth thrives as each long-haul service from the United States adds more value.

In this way, United States long-haul flights power not just bold aviation growth but also record tourism opportunities that shape the future of global travel.

Long-Haul Flights Transform the U.S. Aviation Industry

Long-haul flights from the United States are reshaping the global aviation industry. These routes connect cities across oceans, bring travellers closer, and unlock new business opportunities. Airlines rely on long-haul networks to boost revenue, fill premium cabins, and carry cargo across continents. In 2025, U.S. airlines and their partners are using long-haul strategies to grow steadily after years of rapid recovery. The importance is clear. Long-haul flights now act as the engine of growth for America’s biggest carriers, airports, and tourism markets.

Record Numbers Show Rising Demand

The data proves the strength of long-haul demand. U.S. and foreign airlines carried more than 258 million passengers on international nonstop flights in the 12 months to March 2025. That was a 5% increase on the year before. Seats grew by 5% and departures rose by 4%. Europe led the way as the top long-haul region, followed by Central America and Canada. Airports like JFK in New York, Los Angeles, Miami, San Francisco, and Newark handled the highest volumes. Popular corridors such as New York to London and Los Angeles to London show how long-haul links remain the backbone of the industry.

Transatlantic Routes Still Dominate

The transatlantic market is the most important long-haul region for U.S. airlines. Summer 2025 capacity is steady, with more than 33 million one-way seats available across the season. Airlines are keeping supply balanced to protect ticket prices and yields. The focus is now on improving premium cabins and offering more choice for business and leisure travellers. Joint ventures with European partners help airlines match schedules and make routes more efficient. Transatlantic remains a mature market, but one that generates strong revenue and drives competition among the biggest global carriers.

Bold New Routes Expand Horizons

Growth also comes from new long-haul routes that connect cities never linked before. United Airlines launched the first direct U.S.–Greenland service in almost two decades. The Newark–Nuuk route is a bold step that creates a brand-new leisure and adventure market. United also announced San Francisco–Adelaide, the first nonstop from the U.S. to South Australia, starting in December 2025. This route opens doors for wine tourism, education travel, and business links with Silicon Valley. Each new route brings benefits to both sides. U.S. airlines gain fresh revenue streams, and foreign cities receive new visitors, jobs, and trade flows.

Premium Cabins and Cargo Boost Profits

Long-haul flights are also profitable because of premium cabins and belly cargo. Airlines are investing heavily in business class and premium economy. Suites with doors, fine dining, and private spaces attract high-paying travellers. At the same time, cargo carried in the hold adds extra income. In the past year, international freight to and from the U.S. rose by 6% to more than 12 million tons. This combination of passengers and cargo makes long-haul routes vital for financial strength. Every wide-body flight carries not just people but also products, medical supplies, and trade goods.

Benefits for Airports and Tourism

The impact of long-haul flights goes far beyond airlines. U.S. airports become stronger hubs when they add more international links. Hotels near airports see higher occupancy. Restaurants, shops, and ground transport also gain from passenger spending. For tourism, long-haul flights are a game changer. Greenland now expects higher numbers of U.S. tourists as access becomes easier. Adelaide will see new flows of American visitors enjoying wine, beaches, and culture. These new links also support outbound travel, making it easier for U.S. residents to explore remote destinations.

Industry Growth With Careful Discipline

The aviation industry ended 2024 with more than $6 billion in net profits. That growth was powered by strong long-haul demand, healthy load factors, and steady ticket prices. Yet 2025 is expected to bring slower but more sustainable growth. Airlines are adding capacity carefully and watching costs, especially fuel and sustainable aviation fuel. The lesson of recent years is clear. Long-haul growth must be smart, not reckless. New routes need to pay their way, while established markets must continue to deliver high yields.

Looking Ahead to the Future

The future of U.S. long-haul flights looks strong. Transpacific recovery is building as Asia reopens fully. Premium economy will play a bigger role as companies balance budgets with comfort. Sustainability is a key challenge, with airlines needing to use more green fuel to cut emissions. Despite these hurdles, long-haul flights will stay at the heart of U.S. aviation. They connect economies, support tourism, and strengthen global trade. With bold new routes, strong demand, and careful planning, U.S. long-haul flights are set to power the industry for years to come.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/US-Long-Haul-Flights-1.jpeg,N,,2025-08-21 07:56:28.663069

While demand for ground transport fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, has plateaued, jet fuel consumption continues to rise.
Though currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, SAF could reduce Europe’s exposure to global hydrocarbon market risks while supporting decarbonization efforts.
“A strong regulatory framework and broad collaboration between public and private actors are essential, not only in Europe but also in regions facing similar jet fuel supply challenges,” IATA added.","Europe is confronting a persistent and widening jet fuel supply deficit, driven by declining domestic production and steadily rising demand, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) warned. According to the organization, by 2025 imports will account for roughly one-third of Europe’s total jet fuel consumption—a proportion expected to continue growing.

“The progressive closure of refineries and the decline in domestic jet fuel production have increased Europe’s reliance on imports, jeopardizing energy security for the aviation sector,” IATA stated.

A key factor behind the deficit is the age and low efficiency of many European refineries. Rising operational costs and stricter environmental regulations have made it difficult for older facilities to compete with modern refineries in other regions. “Several installations have closed in recent years, exacerbating the imbalance between production and demand,” IATA noted.

While demand for ground transport fuels, such as gasoline and diesel, has plateaued, jet fuel consumption continues to rise. This divergence is creating logistical bottlenecks and strategic vulnerabilities in the supply chain, requiring urgent attention from governments and industry stakeholders.

In this context, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is positioned as a potential solution. Though currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, SAF could reduce Europe’s exposure to global hydrocarbon market risks while supporting decarbonization efforts. “Despite its higher costs, strategic adoption of SAF can strengthen regional energy resilience,” IATA emphasized.

Experts underscore that developing a competitive SAF industry requires robust policy frameworks, long-term incentives, and clear regulatory signals to de-risk investment. “A strong regulatory framework and broad collaboration between public and private actors are essential, not only in Europe but also in regions facing similar jet fuel supply challenges,” IATA added.",https://mexicobusiness.news/sites/default/files/styles/crop_16_9/public/2025-08/Europe%20Faces%20Jet%20Fuel%20Shortfall%20as%20Demand%20Rises%2C%20IATA%20Says.jpg?h=da3be76f&itok=mfJgdKf2,N,,2025-08-21 07:56:33.602830

Finnish company Liquid Sun is launching a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable, sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) from biogenic CO₂ emissions. Originating from research at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed a low-temperature electrolysis (LTE) technology that converts CO₂ emissions and renewable hydrogen into eSAF.

For this pilot, the company has partnered with Finnair, ABB, Fortum and Finavia. The pilot production unit will be located in Espoo and is expected to be fully operational in autumn 2025. It represents the first pre-commercial production pilot of its kind, aiming to build a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland.

Biogenic CO₂ emissions in Finland are generated by sectors such as the forest industry and biogas plants. The Finnish forest industry alone produces 20 million tonnes annually, with further emissions from biogas facilities. This offers diverse sources for decentralised eSAF production, which could strengthen energy security and help balance the national electricity grid.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market. To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels,” said Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

The regulatory environment is also driving progress. From 2025 the EU aviation blending mandate requires a gradual increase in renewable fuel use. From 2030 this will expand to include fully synthetic fuels made from CO₂. By 2050 the mandate will rise to 70 per cent, with half required to be eSAF. The rules apply to airports with at least 800,000 passengers or 100,000 tonnes of cargo each year, covering Helsinki-Vantaa and Rovaniemi in Finland.

Finavia is backing the initiative. “As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” said Henri Hansson, Senior Vice President at Finavia.

The project has also drawn support from Finnair, Fortum and ABB. Each sees the pilot as a vital step in advancing hydrogen technology, renewable energy and aviation’s energy transition.

“There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favourable,” added Keinänen. “We believe rapid piloting and validation is the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels.”",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_1479000890-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 07:56:49.002898

The goal of the pilot is to create a functioning ecosystem and value chain for synthetic fuel production in Finland. The EU’s renewable fuel blending mandate for aviation opens up a significant opportunity for Finland to become a leading producer of synthetic fuels in the future.

The Finnish company Liquid Sun is starting a globally unique pilot project to produce renewable eSAF from biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. Originating from the University of Tampere, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolysis technology (LTE) that refines carbon dioxide emissions and renewable electricity-based hydrogen into eSAF jet fuel. For this pilot, Liquid Sun has secured Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia as partners. In Finland, biogenic CO2 emissions are generated, for example, by the forest industry and biogas plants.

The experimental e-fuel production unit, to be located in Espoo, will be fully operational in the autumn of 2025. This is the first pre-commercial phase production pilot, with the aim of creating a functioning synthetic fuel production ecosystem and value chain in Finland. In this joint project, companies will openly collaborate to develop eSAF production, carry out validations, and build capabilities for globally scalable processes that can secure domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel in the future.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the emerging eSAF market over the next few years. To achieve this goal, it is critical to involve industrial partners across the eSAF value chain who share a common ambition and the will to accelerate the transition towards sustainable fuels,” commented Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

At the beginning of 2025, the EU’s aviation blending mandate entered into force, requiring the gradual increase of renewable fuel use in aviation up to 2050. From 2030 onwards, the mandate will also cover fully synthetic fuels produced from carbon dioxide. By 2050, the blending mandate will rise to 70%, half of which must be eSAF. The mandate applies to airports with at least 800 000 passengers or 100 000 tpy of cargo. In Finland, this includes Helsinki Airport and Rovaniemi Airport.

Due to this regulatory framework, Finland now has a unique opportunity to become a leading producer of renewable aviation fuels. The Finnish forest industry generates 20 million tpy of biogenic CO2, with additional volumes coming from biogas plants. These emission sources enable decentralised eSAF production, which increases energy security and balances the national electricity grid.

“Aviation is one of the hardest-to-abate sectors, and its energy transition will require new kinds of innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to help develop Finland’s potential in synthetic jet fuel production while also advancing aviation’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Head of Energy Transition at Finnair.

“Fortum’s mission is to help society achieve carbon neutrality and enable our customers to decarbonise their processes. For jet fuel production, we are pleased to provide renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen – with our pilot hydrogen production plant currently under construction,” added Satu Sipola, Head of Fortum’s Hydrogen Business.

“ABB’s H2 Springboard programme aims to strengthen Finland’s hydrogen economy ecosystem and accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration to develop pioneering solutions,” stated Simo Säynevirta, Partner Ecosystem Lead for ABB’s H2 Springboard programme.

If successful, the project could provide Finland with a significant competitive edge, as there is a global technological race underway to develop cost-effective and scalable solutions.",https://dlgivnpf6gg8w.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/finland-03.jpg,N,,2025-08-21 07:56:54.957059

NYSERDA announced this week that nearly $8 million is now available to support pilot projects that convert waste into low-carbon fuels — part of an effort to cut emissions in transportation and industry while easing the strain on the electric grid.

The new funding opportunity, called the Waste to Low-Carbon Fuels Pilot and Demonstration solicitation, is aimed at hard-to-electrify sectors like aviation, maritime shipping, and heavy-duty industry. It targets projects that turn waste materials — like landfill gas, wastewater sludge, agricultural scraps, and solid waste organics — into renewable natural gas, renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel, methanol, or e-fuels.

Ammonia, biogas, and hydrogen aren’t eligible for this program.

“This is about helping early-stage fuel innovations scale up and deliver real results for New Yorkers,” said NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris. “These fuels can lower emissions and support the grid as energy demand rises.”

How the program works

The funding will support three key phases of development:

Phase 1: Secure a host site, feedstock partner, and feedstock supply agreement

Phase 2: Complete engineering design and safety reviews

Phase 3: Build and operate the facility, including commissioning and performance testing

To qualify, project teams must include a tech provider and an engineering or construction partner, plus commitment letters from a host site, feedstock provider, and end user. At least 50% of total costs must be covered by non-NYSERDA sources.

Funding can also cover fuel certification testing and third-party analysis to make sure final products meet standards.

Proposals are due by January 22 at 3 p.m. ET, and full details are available on NYSERDA’s website. An informational webinar is scheduled for October 6 from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. for anyone interested in applying.

Pushing toward a cleaner economy

The initiative is part of New York State’s broader climate plan, which aims for a fully emissions-free economy by 2050. That includes big pushes in clean energy, sustainable transportation, building electrification, and waste management — with at least 35% of benefits directed to disadvantaged communities.

Funding for the solicitation comes through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

NYSERDA has invested more than $800 million into innovation and commercialization over the past 15 years, helping launch over 300 clean energy products across 700 companies. Its Advanced Fuels and Thermal Energy Storage Program continues to support pollution-cutting tech that benefits communities statewide.

(VisaVerge) Aviation fuel demand rises 6% in 2025 to 107 billion gallons as travel recovers; EU and UK mandates enforce 2% SAF blending from January 1, 2025. Global SAF output doubled in 2024 but stays limited, creating cost pressures, prompting refineries and investors to scale production and secure offtake deals.

IATA projects 6% jet fuel demand growth in 2025 to 107 billion gallons.

EU and UK enforce 2% SAF blending from January 1, 2025; EU targets 6% by 2030.

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes; 2025 output ~713 million gallons.

Aviation fuel is the oil market’s outlier in 2025, with jet fuel demand still climbing while gasoline and diesel level off. Airlines worldwide are flying more as travel rebounds, and new rules are pushing more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into tanks.

...

The contrast is striking: aviation fuels expand as road fuels face long-term pressure from electric vehicles and efficiency gains.

...

Mandates are the biggest driver behind the shift toward SAF.

From January 1, 2025, the European Union and the United Kingdom began binding SAF blending rules.

The EU requires 2% SAF at all airports in 2025, ramping to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The UK starts at 2% in 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Both systems rely on verified emissions savings and tradable certificates to prove compliance. According to VisaVerge.com analysis, these policies, paired with airline purchase agreements, are giving suppliers firmer signals to invest in new plants.

Asia-Pacific governments are moving too:

Japan targets a 10% SAF blend by 2030.

Singapore plans 1% for departing flights in 2026, moving to 3–5% by 2030.

China and India are building local SAF output and preparing blend goals.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2025 Renewable Fuel Standard holds:

Advanced biofuel at 7.33 billion gallons

Biomass-based diesel at 3.35 billion gallons

New state SAF tax credits are expected in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

The European Commission’s ReFuelEU framework sets a template many markets are watching. See the regulation details here: https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-transport-policy/refueleu-aviation_en

Supply vs demand: catching up but not enough

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes (about 0.3 billion gallons), and output could reach about 713 million gallons in 2025. Yet that remains only a sliver of total aviation fuel use.

...

Costs remain the hard part. SAF continues to trade at a premium to conventional jet fuel.

IATA estimates SAF will add $3.8 billion to airlines’ fuel costs in 2025, more than double the $1.7 billion added in 2024.

In Europe, non-compliance with blending rules can trigger penalties, raising real costs for airlines that fall short.

The UK builds in a buy-out price to control the hit to consumers if supply is tight.

...

How EU and UK systems work in practice (2025)

Fuel suppliers blend the required 2% SAF into aviation fuel.

They document SAF volumes and greenhouse gas savings and submit evidence.

Authorities issue tradable certificates tied to those savings.

Suppliers use certificates to prove compliance or trade them if they have extra.

Penalties apply in the EU for shortfalls; the UK’s buy-out helps shield travelers.

For airline finance teams, these steps are now core to carbon accounting:

Certificates and credits show progress toward emissions goals and help meet legal rules across markets.

Procurement teams are locking in multi-year SAF deliveries, often linked to specific airports to align with local mandates.

...

If governments keep incentives steady and producers deliver on new technologies, the industry could meet higher blend levels without sharp shocks to travelers. But if build-out lags, airlines may lean on buy-outs and certificates while paying more for limited physical supply—especially in regions with strict rules and busy hubs. READ MORE

In conclusion, LanzaTech's Q2 2025 results reflect a company in transition.","LanzaTech Global (NASDAQ: LNZA) has long operated at the intersection of innovation and financial turbulence. Its Q2 2025 earnings report, released on August 19, 2025, offers a mixed bag of signals for investors assessing whether the company's aggressive restructuring efforts can catalyze a sustainable turnaround. While the firm's strategic pivot toward commercialization and cost optimization is promising, the financials reveal a company still grappling with profitability and liquidity constraints.

Financial Performance: A Tale of Two Revenues

LanzaTech's Q2 2025 revenue fell to $9.1 million, a 48% decline from $17.4 million in Q2 2024. The drop was driven by the absence of a $7.5 million sublicensing revenue from LanzaJet, which had been a one-time boost in the prior year. Engineering and contract research revenue also contracted, reflecting the completion of key projects. However, CarbonSmart revenue surged to $3.8 million from $0.9 million, signaling progress in scaling its carbon accounting software. This shift underscores LanzaTech's attempt to diversify revenue streams, though the lower-margin nature of CarbonSmart sales has pressured gross margins.

Cost of revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $6.2 million, while operating expenses climbed slightly to $35.1 million. The net loss widened to $32.5 million, despite a $6.7 million non-cash gain on financial instruments. Adjusted EBITDA loss of $29.7 million—a 67% increase from Q2 2024—highlights the company's struggle to balance strategic investments with profitability.

Strategic Restructuring: Efficiency Over Expansion

LanzaTech's restructuring efforts, including executive leadership changes and workforce reductions in May and June 2025, aim to align costs with its long-term vision. The company is transitioning from an R&D-centric model to a commercially driven enterprise, prioritizing capital-light growth through licensing and partnerships. This approach is critical in an industry where upfront capital expenditures for carbon capture and utilization (CCU) projects remain prohibitively high.

A key milestone was the £6.4 million UK government grant for Project Dragon, which will fund two commercial-scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) facilities. These projects leverage LanzaTech's ethanol-to-jet technology to convert waste carbon into SAF, positioning the firm to capitalize on the $1.2 trillion global aviation market's decarbonization push. The grant not only reduces financial risk but also validates LanzaTech's technology in a high-growth sector.

Capital Constraints and Liquidity Risks

Despite a $40 million preferred equity financing in May 2025, LanzaTech's cash reserves remain precarious. As of June 30, 2025, the company held $39.6 million in cash, a $16.2 million increase from March 2025 but still insufficient to cover its $128.3 million in liabilities. The net cash outflow of $6.1 million over six months raises concerns about operational sustainability, particularly as the firm ramps up commercial projects.

Long-Term Value: A High-Stakes Bet on Decarbonization

LanzaTech's core strength lies in its gas fermentation platform, which can convert industrial waste gases into SAF, chemicals, and materials. This technology aligns with global regulatory tailwinds, including the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act's tax credits for carbon capture. However, the company's ability to monetize these opportunities hinges on securing partnerships and scaling production at competitive costs.

The UK's Project Dragon is a test case. If successful, it could serve as a blueprint for replicating LanzaTech's model in other regions. Yet, the firm's reliance on government grants and third-party funding introduces execution risk. Investors must weigh the potential of LanzaTech's technology against its track record of consistent losses and bloated balance sheet.

Investment Outlook: Cautious Optimism with Conditions

For LanzaTech to deliver long-term value, it must demonstrate:

1. Operational efficiency: Sustained cost reductions and improved gross margins.

2. Commercial traction: Meaningful licensing deals or joint ventures in SAF and carbon accounting.

3. Financial discipline: Prudent use of capital to avoid overleveraging.

While the company's strategic direction is sound, the path to profitability remains uncertain. Investors with a high-risk tolerance might consider a small position in LanzaTech as a speculative bet on decarbonization, but only if the stock trades at a significant discount to its intrinsic value. For others, the risks—particularly liquidity constraints and regulatory uncertainties—may outweigh the potential rewards.

In conclusion, LanzaTech's Q2 2025 results reflect a company in transition. The restructuring efforts and Project Dragon grant are positive steps, but the financials underscore the urgency of achieving operational breakeven. Until LanzaTech can consistently generate revenue growth and reduce losses, its turnaround remains a work in progress—and a high-stakes gamble for investors.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-21 01:56:33.283506

The company's Q2 2025 financial results underscore a stark reality: total revenue plummeted 47.7% year-over-year to $9.1 million, while net losses widened to $32.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA losses also deteriorated to $29.7 million, driven by higher operating expenses and a shift in revenue mix toward lower-margin CarbonSmart sales. Yet, amid these challenges, LanzaTech's strategic pivot to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and aggressive cost-cutting measures could yet unlock long-term value for investors—if the company can execute its vision effectively.

The Financial Dilemma: A Company in Transition

LanzaTech's financial struggles are no secret. The collapse in licensing revenue—from $8.5 million to $1.1 million—reflects the end of a R&D-centric era. While CarbonSmart revenue grew to $3.8 million, it remains a niche segment with thin margins. The company's cash burn of $42.8 million in operating activities over six months highlights its reliance on external financing. However, a $40.0 million preferred equity infusion in May 2025 and a £6.4 million UK government grant for its DRAGON 1 and 2 projects have provided a lifeline, boosting cash reserves to $39.6 million.

The question for investors is whether these funds can catalyze a turnaround. LanzaTech's management has acknowledged the need for a “commercial execution” overhaul, including leadership changes and workforce reductions. These steps, while painful, are critical to aligning costs with a business model that prioritizes scalability over innovation. The challenge lies in balancing short-term financial discipline with long-term R&D investments in SAF technology.

The DRAGON Projects: A High-Stakes Bet on SAF

LanzaTech's DRAGON 1 and 2 projects represent its most ambitious foray into commercial-scale SAF production. DRAGON 1, set to begin operations in Port Talbot by 2026, will convert recycled ethanol into SAF using its proprietary LanzaJet Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) process. DRAGON 2, a Power-to-Liquid (PtL) facility, will generate ethanol from CO₂ and green hydrogen, further diversifying feedstock sources. Together, these projects aim to produce 102 million liters of SAF annually, contributing to the UK's 10% SAF mandate by 2030.

The UK government's £6.4 million grant is a vote of confidence in LanzaTech's technology and its alignment with decarbonization goals. However, the absence of detailed revenue projections for these projects raises questions about their financial viability. While the global SAF market is projected to grow at a 39.9% CAGR through 2032, LanzaTech's current cost structure—highlighted by a $29.7 million Adjusted EBITDA loss in Q2 2025—suggests it is still in an early-stage investment phase.

Strategic Shifts: Cost Efficiency and Capital-Light Growth

LanzaTech's transition from a research-driven entity to a commercially focused business is evident in its cost-cutting measures. Workforce reductions and leadership changes in 2025 aim to streamline operations, while a focus on licensing and partnerships reduces capital intensity. This approach mirrors successful models in the renewable energy sector, where companies like Tesla leveraged partnerships to scale production without shouldering full CAPEX burdens.

However, the company's reliance on government grants and external financing introduces execution risks. The DRAGON projects must achieve technical milestones and secure long-term offtake agreements with airlines or refiners to generate consistent revenue. For now, LanzaTech's balance sheet remains fragile, with cash reserves barely covering six months of operating expenses.

Investment Implications: Balancing Risk and Reward

For investors, LanzaTech presents a high-risk, high-reward proposition. The company's ethanol-to-jet technology is a proven differentiator, and the UK's aggressive SAF targets create a captive market. Yet, the path to profitability is fraught with challenges:

Execution Risk: Delays in DRAGON 1's 2026 timeline or technical hurdles in PtL production could derail revenue expectations.

Market Competition: The SAF space is attracting heavyweights like Neste and Shell, which may outpace LanzaTech in scaling production.

Regulatory Dependency: The UK's Advanced Fuels Fund grant is a lifeline, but future policy shifts could impact funding.

Despite these risks, the company's strategic alignment with decarbonization trends and its capital-light model offer a compelling long-term thesis. If LanzaTech can secure additional partnerships and reduce production costs through economies of scale, its DRAGON projects could become cash-generative by 2027.

Conclusion: A Gamble on the Future of Aviation

LanzaTech's Q2 2025 results paint a grim picture, but they also reveal a company in motion. The DRAGON projects and cost-cutting measures are not just survival tactics—they are foundational steps toward a future where SAF is a cornerstone of the aviation industry. For patient investors willing to tolerate near-term volatility, LanzaTech's transformation could yield outsized returns if it successfully navigates the next 18–24 months.

In the end, the question is not whether LanzaTech can turn a profit, but whether it can outpace its peers in a market that is poised to grow from $2.7 billion in 2025 to $28.6 billion by 2032. For those who believe in the power of innovation and the urgency of decarbonization, the answer may already be clear.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-21 07:58:00.166793

Doug?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Thanks, Lydia. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining today. I’ll start the call by giving you an overview of our second quarter, followed by a review of our current market conditions across our product lines as well as an update on our near term growth initiatives. Eric will then take you through the detailed financials and provide an outlook for the third quarter. I’m going to close our prepared remarks with a quick review of our seventeenth Annual Sustainability Report, which we just released earlier this week, before opening the call to questions.

Let me start with our Q2 numbers. This is a strong quarter for us both on a stand alone and historical basis with EPS coming in at 1.55 up 36% from Q1 and at a level only behind the second quarter of last year when market conditions were relatively stronger. Our ability to generate these results amid the recent global economic backdrop is an example of the strong operating culture of this company. As we shared on our last call, we started to see a significant uptick in sales at the end of the first quarter, and our sales rate expanded through the second quarter and resulted in $529,000,000 up 8% sequentially. Operating income came in at $79,000,000 up 25% sequentially, and operating margin was 14.9%, up 200 basis points from the first quarter and reverting to our natural level of 15%.

It’s important to put this performance into context given the challenges presented by changing tariffs and the ongoing uncertainties they continue to put on our end markets. Our results are a testament to MTI’s strong fundamentals, including our operational agility, prudent cost and expense control and our team’s ability to take quick action and make necessary adjustments. I’d like to highlight that we delivered strong cash conversion this quarter, in line with our historical average of around 7% of sales, a level that we expect to continue. We also returned $22,000,000 to shareholders this quarter, reflecting our ongoing commitment to steer capital back to investors. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition, giving us a strong foundation with the flexibility to pursue multiple avenues to drive growth in sales, earnings and cash flow.

Now let me talk a bit about what we’re seeing with market conditions and give you some insight into projects that we have coming online to drive both growth and margin expansion. Let’s start with the Consumer and Specialties business segment, which comprises our Household and Personal Care and Specialty Additives product lines. In Household and Personal Care, we’re seeing mixed conditions across these consumer end markets. The North America cat litter market has been slower this year compared to recent years and these conditions have created more competitive dynamics. We are navigating this with increased promotional activity with our customers and are seeing momentum building in our order books as a result.

We continue to see positive long term growth dynamics across global pet litter markets. To support this growing demand, we’ve been retooling our facilities in North America and Europe with new process and packaging equipment. These upgrades are designed not only to produce higher quality products, but also to improve efficiency and reduce production costs. In addition, we are opening a new pet litter packaging facility in Asia late in the third quarter to support the demand growth we are seeing there. In our other consumer oriented products, we are seeing significant increased demand for renewable fuel purification, animal health solutions and Fabric Care.

This is being driven by regulation changes for more sustainable aviation fuel, the continued trend toward natural livestock feed additives and the growing demand for more sustainable laundry detergents. We have several capacity expansion projects underway for these product lines as well. In the Specialty Additives product line, market conditions remain mixed. The paper market in North America is relatively flat and Europe remains weak. However, we continue to penetrate the paper and packaging market in Asia with strong customer pool for our packaging solutions and sustainable products like NewYield.

Three new satellite facilities, two of which are for packaging applications and one packaging and one capacity expansion are set to come online within the next seven to eight months. And we continue to see a strong pipeline of additional opportunities across the Paper and Packaging market further down the road. In other areas, the automotive market has been relatively flat this year, while residential construction markets vary for us by region, with stronger demand on The U. S. West Coast and continued softness on the East Coast.

Meanwhile, our Food and Pharmaceutical markets remain robust. Now let me turn to our Engineered Solutions segment, which includes our High Temperature Technologies and Environmental and Infrastructure product lines. In High Temperature Technologies, we continue to see strong demand in North America for our automated MINSCAN systems and for our newest steel refractory formulations. The North America steel market remains relatively stable and at a production level that provides good volumes for us. In Europe, the steel market remains weak and we expect these conditions to continue for the remainder of the year.

A bright spot in Europe is that we’ve secured our first Minscan LSC sale there, opening a new market for our technology. We’re pursuing the same strategy as we have in North America, helping our customers reduce costs and improve safety through high-tech automated refractory application and measuring systems. We expect to generate additional Minscan sales moving forward as other customers become comfortable with and adopt our new technology. The U. S.

Foundry market has generated solid demand for our greensand bonds through the first half from stable auto demand and despite the softer heavy truck and ag equipment markets. The China foundry market has remained resilient despite the introduction of increased tariffs. Our volumes of green sand bonds in China remain strong as foundry customers quickly adapt to the changing market conditions and seek the cost savings and productivity value that our products provide. On the Environmental Infrastructure side, the commercial construction and environmental lining markets have stabilized, but we have not yet seen the initiation of several planned large projects where we are specified. We expect commercial construction markets to remain relatively soft as long as interest rates remain higher.

However, we are seeing strong pull for our infrastructure drilling products, water remediation solutions, offshore energy services and PFAS remediation through FluoroZorf. As an overall market summary, we see similar market conditions to the second quarter continuing into the back half of the year. However, I would not characterize these conditions as robust by historical standards. But as I just mentioned, we are executing on several initiatives to support the strong near term demand we are seeing in multiple product lines. These initiatives include new capacity and plant expansions to support demand for sustainable aviation fuel, animal health, fabric care and pet care.

These specific projects will support $100,000,000 in revenue growth for products that will drive the margin profile of the company higher. This is just a subset of our growth initiatives. Other projects such as geographic expansion initiatives and new product introductions can be supported by our existing capacity. Now let me let Eric take you through some additional details of our financial results as well as the third quarter outlook. Eric?

Eric Aldag, Chief Financial Officer, Minerals Technologies: Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I’ll start by providing an overview of our second quarter results, followed by a review of the performance of our segments, and I’ll wrap up with our outlook for the third quarter. Following my remarks, I’ll turn the call back over to Doug to cover the highlights from our 2024 sustainability report. Now let’s review our second quarter results. Overall, we delivered a strong performance in the second quarter.

Across our end markets, conditions played out mostly as we expected, with sales continuing to show improvement from the levels we saw in the first quarter. Sales of $529,000,000 were up 8% sequentially, driven by higher volumes in both segments. Customer order patterns continued to normalize through the quarter, not quite to prior year levels, but a significant improvement from what we experienced in the beginning of the year. You can see from the bridge on the top right that higher volume drove $30,000,000 of the $37,000,000 sequential improvement in sales, with the balance of the increase coming from favorable pricing and foreign exchange. Consumer and Specialty sales increased by $9,000,000 sequentially, and in engineered solutions, sales were up by $28,000,000 Operating income increased by $16,000,000 or 25 percent sequentially to $79,000,000 matching the second highest operating income quarter for the company.

And that was despite the current macro challenges weighing on some of our end markets. In the sequential operating income bridge, you can see that higher volume drove a $9,000,000 improvement to income, which is a typical incremental margin for us on $30,000,000 of volume. In addition to favorable pricing and foreign exchange, we also benefited from $4,000,000 of lower costs driven by improved productivity and the ramp up of our cost savings program. As a result, operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 14.9% of sales. It’s worth noting that we incurred about $500,000 in incremental tariff costs in the second quarter, which our team has done a nice job mitigating through supply chain and commercial actions.

As Doug mentioned, we are working on several projects to expand capacity for high growth products and optimize our footprint for continued margin expansion. In the second quarter, we executed on some efficiency opportunities in Engineered Solutions by consolidating two facilities in The U. S, which will result in direct cost savings as well as productivity and efficiency improvements. In addition, we made adjustments to the layout of another facility in The U. S.

To accommodate future capacity expansion for Fluorozorb, our PFAS remediation technology. We recorded special charges in the quarter associated with these actions, which were mostly offset by a gain on the final installment for the sale of refractory manufacturing assets in China. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding these special items, was $1.55 up 36% sequentially. Now let’s turn to a review of our segments, beginning with Consumer and Specialty. Second quarter sales in the Consumer and Specialty segment were $278,000,000 up 4% sequentially as customer order patterns stabilized throughout the quarter.

Sales in our Household and Personal Care product line were $127,000,000 up slightly from prior year and up 3% sequentially. As Doug mentioned, we’ve got a lot of exciting initiatives in Household and Personal Care. Some of these specialty applications, natural oil purification and animal health, are growing at double digit rates with incremental margins above the company average. The growth of these products will continue to drive the margin profile of the company higher. And we are supporting this growth with capital investment to ensure our facilities can keep up with demand.

In our Specialty Additives product line, sales of $150,000,000 were 5% below prior year, driven by softer demand conditions, primarily in paper production in North America and Europe. On a sequential basis, sales in the product line were up 4%, primarily driven by seasonally higher sales into residential construction applications. The team remains focused on driving operational efficiency while also supporting our growth opportunities. And this segment delivered a much stronger operating performance in the second quarter. Operating income was $37,000,000 up 24% sequentially, and operating margin increased by two twenty basis points to 13.4% of sales.

Margins were lower than last year due to volume leverage and some higher raw material and energy costs that we are working to pass through. We’re also in the process of making significant upgrades to one of our cat litter facilities in The U. S. And this is resulting in temporarily higher freight costs as we’ve shifted production around our network to accommodate the work at this facility. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sales in the Household and Personal Care product line to increase sequentially, driven by an improving demand outlook and the ramp up of our growth initiatives.

And in Specialty Additives, we expect a similar quarter sequentially. Now let’s turn to the Engineered Solutions segment. Second quarter sales in the Engineered Solutions segment were $251,000,000 up 12% sequentially. In our High Temperature Technologies product line, sales were $178,000,000 3% below prior year but up 5% sequentially. Global sales to foundry customers were similar to prior year.

Demand in North America is holding relatively stable apart from some ongoing softness for castings going into the agricultural equipment and heavy truck markets. And in Asia, we continue to deliver year over year volume growth, including in China, despite lingering tariff uncertainties. Second quarter sales to steel customers were mixed. We saw a modest sequential improvement in sales to European steel customers after significant destocking in the first quarter. However, that market remains softer than last year.

Meanwhile, The U. S. Steel market has been solid, and our team is doing an excellent job executing on growth initiatives. Second quarter sales to steel customers in North America were higher than last year and up sequentially as well. In the Environmental and Infrastructure product line, second quarter sales were $73,000,000 1% higher than the prior year and 35% higher than the first quarter as we entered the seasonally stronger period for this product line.

Demand conditions across the product line have stabilized, although overall project activity is still lower than historical levels. Segment overall delivered another strong operating performance. Operating income was $44,000,000 and operating margin improved by 200 basis points sequentially to 17.4% of sales, matching last year’s record performance. Turning to the third quarter. We expect end market conditions to remain stable for the segment and overall sales to be similar sequentially.

Now let me turn to a summary of our balance sheet and cash flow highlights. We delivered a solid cash flow performance in the second quarter with free cash flow of $34,000,000 Looking ahead, we expect cash flow to continue to build through the second half. As we’ve mentioned, we’re making several key investments across the company that support the progress we’ve made on our strategic growth initiatives. In the second quarter, CapEx was $29,000,000 as activity on several projects picked up. And for the full year, we’re projecting capital of approximately $100,000,000 This figure includes the ramp up of several growth investments that Doug referred to in his remarks that will add $100,000,000 of annual revenue at above average margins.

These investments total about $50,000,000 of CapEx that we’ll be executing on over the next twelve months. We’re expecting to generate significant free cash flow in the second half. At this point, we expect full year free cash flow in the 6% of sales range, which factors in the slower start to the year, the higher level of investment and a very strong second half of cash flow generation. We also returned $22,000,000 to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in the second quarter, and we’ve returned $73,000,000 to shareholders over the last four quarters, maintaining our balanced approach to capital deployment. Turning to the balance sheet.

Total liquidity at the end of the second quarter stood at nearly $700,000,000 which is $150,000,000 higher than the last year. And our net leverage ratio is 1.7 times EBITDA, below our target of two times EBITDA. The company’s strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow generation provide the financial strength to navigate periods of uncertainty while also enabling significant flexibility to pursue growth and return cash to shareholders. Now I’ll summarize our outlook for the third quarter. We’re expecting a largely similar quarter sequentially for sales and income with a balance of potential upsides and some ongoing macro uncertainty.

Overall, we’re expecting sales of between $525,000,000 and $535,000,000 In Consumer and Specialties, we’re expecting higher sales from continued growth across the Household and Personal Care product line, including natural oil purification, personal care and animal health products, to name a few examples. And in Engineered Solutions, we see a similar level of sales sequentially as our stable market outlook is balanced by seasonal customer maintenance outages in high temperature technologies. Our operating income guidance of approximately $75,000,000 reflects the midpoint of our sales range and represents a balanced view with potential upsides as well as the potential for macro uncertainty around trade and tariffs to continue to impact our customers and end markets. And while our direct exposure to tariffs is relatively low, we are facing a higher tariff cost in the third quarter of $1,500,000 We’re confident we’ll be able to mitigate this tariff impact through our ongoing supply chain and commercial efforts. In summary, we feel confident that the second half will be stronger than the first half, and we are excited about the progress we are making on several key initiatives that will contribute to long term growth and continued margin expansion.

With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Doug for some remarks on our annual sustainability report. Doug?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Thanks, Eric. I want to close the call with a quick overview of our sustainability report, which we just released earlier this week. This is the seventeenth year that we’ve published this report, and it reflects the tremendous amount of ongoing activity across our company to enhance what we do and how we do it in order to drive value for our customers, employees, communities and investors. Sustainability is not new to MTI. It’s always been explicitly included in our values and how we run the company.

We’re committed to being responsible stewards of the environment, good neighbors in the places in which we work and dependable, supportable supportive and inclusive colleagues who are laser focused on keeping each other safe. This isn’t just talk. We put this commitment into action as you can see from the highlights in our report. Let me give you a few of them. Through 2024, we’ve achieved 11 out of 12 of the environmental goals we set for ourselves back in 2018, and we achieved them one year ahead of our 2025 target.

The progress we’ve made since 2018 is quite remarkable. We’ve reduced our overall Scope one emissions by 32%, Scope two emissions by 36 and reduced emission intensity for both Scope one and two on a per unit basis by over 50%. We’ve reduced our airborne pollutant emissions by 70%, cut our process water usage in half and reduced process waste disposal by 44%. Every year, we extract over 1,100,000 metric tons of waste CO2 from our customers and our own exhaust stacks and sequester those emissions used into consumer products. We operate at a world class safety level and consistently look for ways to make our work environment safer, though we will never be satisfied until we reach and maintain zero injuries as a company.

We support our customers in achieving their sustainability goals with 66% of our new products, which we define as products developed over the last five years, having a sustainable profile. These products range from natural solutions to emissions and waste reduction products that support pollution prevention, filtration and energy savings. You’ll also see several examples of how we engage within our communities by supporting education, installing systems to bring clean waters to areas in need and working alongside our neighbors in a variety of local initiatives. This is only a sample of what you’ll see in this year’s report, and I encourage you to take a deep dive into it. I’m extremely proud of what we’ve achieved thus far, but there’s so much more to do for us and for our industry.

We intend to outline this next chapter when we publish our new long term goals in next year’s report. With that, let me turn the call over to questions.

Gary, Conference Moderator: We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question today comes from Mike Harrison with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.

Mike Harrison, Analyst, Seaport Research Partners: Hi, good morning. Congrats on a nice quarter.

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Hi, Mike.

Mike Harrison, Analyst, Seaport Research Partners: I was hoping that we could talk a little bit and start out here with the Household and Personal Care segment. There was some improvement sequentially, but we’re still not back to the kinds of growth rates we’d like to see there. I know you mentioned that kind of the underlying pet care market is still not fantastic. But can you give us maybe some additional color on what you’re seeing in that HPC product line in terms of volume trends and when you might expect to get back to stronger growth rates?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Sure Mike. Let me start off and then I’ll hand it over to D. J. To give you a little bit more detail. Look, think the product line several of the products as we mentioned in this are doing quite well.

We’ve got some of the smaller products like our aviation, natural oil, purification, animal health, personal care. These are growing at kind of double digit and high double digit kind of rates. So they’re doing very well. They’re smaller piece of the profile. As I mentioned, we’re investing in them.

And I think as they grow they’re going to be continued to drive the growth profile of this product line much higher. They are also the higher margin products in the company, some of our newest technologies. And, they as I mentioned will drive the margin profile of the company higher as they grow. PetCare is the largest product in that product line. And yes, this year it’s been a bit of a slower year for the market in total.

And I think you’ll see that across any of the producers with that commentary. And I think that’s driven some higher competitive activity, some discounting that’s been going on that we’ve been working our way through. So with that, what I’ll I’ve answered the other products. DJ, why don’t you take us through the pet care and give us a little idea of the dynamics going on there?

D.J., Unnamed Executive, Minerals Technologies: Yes, sure. Glad to. Thanks for the question, Mike. So let’s kind of peel back the onion a little bit on what we’re seeing in the pet care market. A little surprised to see the sequential drop that we saw in the quarter.

It’s not uncommon for the second quarter to be a little bit lighter than the first, but we saw a 2% drop in that market and it particularly hit the private label sector. Doug was mentioning some discounts and just to give you a flavor of the discounts that we’re seeing done by the major brands. In a normal year, you’re seeing 15% to 20% of those major brands sell on deal. This year, they’re still up in the 20% to 30%. We’re starting to see some mitigation on that.

So we’re expecting the shift to private label to start improving a little bit, but the market has still been down. Against that down, we’ve kind of held our own, not bragging about it, but just that gives you some perspective on that. So let’s talk about then what’s going on in that context. On the Pet side, we enable our private label partners to execute their strategy. And what we’re doing lately with them is quite a bit of brand refresh and promotions.

So that brand refresh can be as simple as new placements and increased volumes that our partners want to put and display differently in the shelves. But they also could be as complicated as product refreshes, which could just be a label change, but could also be a reinvigoration of the whole product line that would include some things like new products, which would be in our case, it’s what we’re promoting is some lightweight litter products and some other things that have to do with the kind of a under the clean hygiene theme. So those promotions are ongoing now. We expect to see some better growth in that pet care market going forward. And then, I guess, top of that, as Doug was mentioning, the capital investments that we’re doing.

Towards the beginning of the fourth quarter, a little bit in the third quarter, you’re going to start seeing an increase in China as we bring that new facility online for us. So that’s the backdrop for pet care that we’ve got going on. The other element that Eric had mentioned, we did a major rework, a major optimization of our footprint in The U. S. And we also made some refinements to our Netherlands facility.

These changes will allow us to improve the productivity better enabling us to meet some promotions, but it also expands our capability to meet some requests we’ve got for customers in different channels on new grades, new products. So we’re pretty enthused about that. That’s the pet care story. And I guess I just want I guess, pile on to the other side of the equation in that household and personal care line. Big investment coming online early in 2026 to meet continue to meet the demands of this fast growing bleaching earth product that is helping purify the plant based fuels and plant based oils that include sustainable aviation.

Sustainable aviation is the primary pull that we’re seeing from there. We also have got some really good projects going on, especially in the Fabric Care line, where we’re introducing some new products to help with the macro trends of better washing in a cold water environment with those folks. So overall, we feel really good about that part of the product line within the segment. Still think Pet Care is on track to be a $500,000,000 plus business, feeling really good about the specialties growth trajectory, especially as embodied by Bleaching Earth, Animal Health, Fabric Care and the Personal Care products. Hope that helps.

Mike Harrison, Analyst, Seaport Research Partners: Very helpful. Thanks for all that additional color. I wanted to switch over to Engineered Solutions. The operating income, you guys had kind of given a range there in terms of guidance for the second quarter, and it looks like you came in pretty nicely ahead of those expectations. So can you talk about some of the key drivers of that better operating income performance in Q2?

And I guess just looking at your overall guidance, it seems like even though you expect a similar quarter in Q3, the op income guide is a little bit lower. So is that an engineered solutions step back that we should be expecting in operating income?

Eric Aldag, Chief Financial Officer, Minerals Technologies: Yes, Mike. This is Eric. Thanks for the question. So yes, I think from an engineered solutions perspective, they performed very well in the second quarter. Productivities were very strong.

The supply chain teams, in particular, have done a really nice job managing input costs for us. We mentioned that tariffs aren’t a huge direct impact for us, but the supply chain team in Engineered Solutions, in particular, has done a really nice job mitigating that impact for us. So margins, probably a little bit better than we guided to for the second quarter in that segment. I think in terms of what we’re looking at for the third quarter guidance, as I mentioned, we have upside to that number. I think what you’re hearing from us is there is still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of what’s going on with macro end markets and potential impacts on our customers.

But I would say you know, if things continue to play out and and continue to be relatively stable, we can do a similar level of margin performance in the third quarter. We are facing some slightly higher tariff costs in the third quarter, but we are we are confident that we’re going to be able to mitigate that. That’s what I would give you in terms of the color for the third quarter.

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Yes, Mike, the only thing I would add is, look, this product line, this segment is performing really well. I think they’re doing, as Eric mentioned, all the things they’ve got this is where the tariffs sit mostly in the company and they are having to navigate that and they have a heavier load in the third quarter which we’re confident we’ll do. So there’s some uncertainty there. But this is these margins are not they’ve been moving this direction for a while now and it is part of the strategy. It’s these it’s our higher tech greensand bond solutions.

It’s growing the business in underserved regions. These Minscan units which then come with kind of contracts for refractories. But then also there are new refractory formulations that we’re using that have good performance which help us with a higher margin capture. So there’s a number of different things that are going on. And yes, the steel market in Europe is pretty weak right now.

We got this tariff load. So I think we’re being a little bit middle of the road here. But yes, I think there’s some upside and I think even further margin expansion in this business long term.

Mike Harrison, Analyst, Seaport Research Partners: All right. Sounds good. Last question for me. The balance sheet is in pretty good shape. It was 2021 when you guys last did a more sizable acquisition.

I was hoping you could talk about your capacity and your appetite for a larger or more transformative deal, given that there are some potential targets out there, including some targets that you may have looked at in the past.

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Well, M and A has always been a piece of the growth strategy for the company. We’ve executed fairly regularly on acquisitions over the past five years. Think we’ve done four of them. The balance sheet is in good shape. Liquidity position is in good shape.

I think we have a nice portfolio of things that we’re looking at Mike. I think they are there’s some larger things that we would consider. And I think there’s also some bolt ons that give us faster penetration in regions or they bolt on to some of these higher margin products, in the consumer space. So, I think there’s a number of things that we would consider. I think, we look at these things obviously very carefully.

We model them, with the appropriate level of risk and concern and we make sure that we know exactly what we’re going to do with it if we were to get it. And so, we take a very measured approach to it. But I think the balance sheet is in good shape if something were to become actionable. That’s what I can give you.

Mike Harrison, Analyst, Seaport Research Partners: All right. Thanks very much.

Gary, Conference Moderator: next question is from Dan Moore with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.

Will, Analyst, CJS Securities: Hey, this is Will on for Dan. Can you add some more color to the schedule for new PCC satellites including new yield coming online in the second half and into 2026?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Sure. We’ll outline that for you. DJ, do you want to give some details? I mentioned Will was we have three new satellites and one expansion coming online in the next seven to eight months. Two of those satellites are for packaging in Asia.

One of them is kind of what we call our base PCC for paper and then another expansion and D. J. Can give you more details on what they are and where they are.

D.J., Unnamed Executive, Minerals Technologies: Yes. Well, so just as a baseline for you, we’re going to be we started a plant earlier this year that’s in the neighborhood of 60,000 tons. We’re still seeing that to ramp up a little bit. That’s not quite at full capacity yet. In the third quarter, we’ll be seeing two more satellites come on.

One of them is the expansion to which Doug was referring. That’s in India. And that will come online pretty quickly. The other one is a new yield facility in China. So that will be coming on and we’ll start seeing the impact of that towards the second half of this year.

As we go into next year, we’ve got another packaging facility that will actually have a combination of products. One is NewYield, but the other one is our satellite GCC. It’s a new to MTI technology that we’ve been getting a lot of market pull for. So that will be coming on towards the end of the first quarter as well as another site that we’ve got in China that will be coming on in and that would be a printing and writing site that will be coming on in China towards the end of that first quarter. So and that one is it’s about 60,000 ton sort of ballpark.

Will, Analyst, CJS Securities: Thank you. That’s super helpful. And then looking at Refractories, could you add some more color to the outlook for steel production for the remainder of the year? And then secondly, where are we in terms of penetration of scan systems in The U. S.

And Europe?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Sure. Brett Arjakos, you want to take that one?

Brett Arjakos, Unnamed Executive, Minerals Technologies: Sure, sure, Doug. Thanks, Will. The U. S. Steel penetration, the second quarter actually saw capacity utilization rates reached the highest level since Q3 of twenty twenty four.

So it’s in that high 70%, 78 range. Steel prices seem to be stable flat rolls over $900 a ton. So pretty stable market right now in North America. The service centers inventory has come down to around fifty five days. That’s a pretty that usually when you get into the mid-50s that seems like it keeps a pretty consistent steel production.

So, overall U. S. Is doing really well that it’s benefiting our refractory business. From the European side, of course, Doug mentioned, the European market is still remains really, really low. Their efforts converting to green steel technology has slowed.

That means going from integrated steel or basic oxygen furnace to electric furnace that slowed just because of the market. And the Turkey and Middle East market which we as part of we work as part of our European group has also slowed. So from a market standpoint, pretty really good market for us in North America and much suppressed market in Europe. So overall, it’s pretty it’s stable for our business. As far as the MINSCANs go, as Doug also mentioned, these MINSCANs provide us with a really custom application for our customers.

It improves safety and it improves the efficiencies of their operation and allows their furnaces to run longer by extending the refractory life. In 2025 for this year, we signed eight agreements. We installed one in the first half. The remaining will be in the second half possibly into the first quarter, but our target is to get the rest of them tied in this year. Over the past few years, we’ve had 17 MINS scans or scan trolls, which include the laser and the camera installed to date.

Two of those were in Turkey and the remaining were in North America. And we’re happy to say that we signed our first agreement in Austria that will go in sometime in the first quarter of next year. So we’re excited about that moving that technology to Europe. So, there is still a very sufficient runway to add more of these units. There’s plenty of electric furnaces out there both in North America and Europe.

So we’re not going to give up. We’re going to continue to pursue them both North America, Europe and Japan as well. So I hope that helps.

Eric Aldag, Chief Financial Officer, Minerals Technologies: Thank you.

Gary, Conference Moderator: The next question is from Pete Osterland with SunTrust. Please go ahead.

Pete Osterland, Analyst, SunTrust: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First, just wanted to ask one on the pet care business. Just given the increased competitive activity you’ve referenced, are you having to lower prices there in order to increase momentum in your order book? And is that a potential source of margin pressure in C and S in the second half until you see a more meaningful pickup for demand?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Yes. Think there’s promotional activity is generally a pricing issue. It’s either similar prices, higher sizes or more weight, two for ones those types of things. What we’re doing is working with as D. J.

Mentioned, we’re working with our customer. They own the brand and so it’s their decision as to how they want to put it on the shelf and price it. But we’re helping them with those packaging solutions, the labeling. And yes, we could help them with some pricing actions a little bit in this quarter to help with that promotional activity. What that does is that make sure that we maintain and help them maintain that value proposition and that value gap between the branded product and the private label and ensure that there is that value seen on the shelf and that tends to pull more of their product I.

E. Our product off the shelf. So yes, we’re working on all of those. And there has been some pricing that’s been through that. But as D.

J. Mentioned, we expect that some of this promotional activity in the marketplace in general to go back to more normal levels. We make sure that we keep our private label kind of value proposition. But I think longer term we see that private label is going to continue to grow. It’s not just in North America and in Europe but also in Asia.

We see positive fundamentals for the pet litter market in general globally. We’re investing in that growth, as we mentioned with investing in our expanding a facility in a new facility actually in Asia. That’s going to double the size of our business, in Asia. And I think that’s just the beginning because that is a much higher growth rate area. And so as we start there, you’re going to see that adding to the growth rate of the business, long term.

So hopefully that helps you with both short term kind of actions and long term dynamics, Peter.

Pete Osterland, Analyst, SunTrust: Yes. That’s very helpful. Thanks. And then, I wanted to ask one on talc as well. I guess is there anything you can share on the timeframe for a final resolution or any meaningful upcoming dates to be aware of?

And just kind of as a follow on question to that, is there a time frame within which it needs to be resolved in order for the reserve that you’ve established to be sufficient?

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Well, first, I can’t give you a solid answer on the timing. These are it’s quite dynamic, and it’s determined by a number of different items in terms of the courts and court dates. Regarding the reserve, it’s sufficient. It is a sufficient reserve and it’s we find it sufficient. There’s no time stamp on that.

We find that that is the liability that we see for resolving this. Look, I think, what I can give you in terms of over the past ninety days that’s happened, a couple of significant items. The hearing in the May, about May 14, where the bankruptcy court referred had a hearing and referred a key factual question in the case to a federal district court. And that was to determine whether BMI, Old Co, talc contained asbestos. That’s a relative positive development for us because we’ve always maintained that BMI Old Co has always maintained that Vitalik was safe and free of asbestos.

And so there is a forum by which that can be determined. At the same time, we’re still BMI is waiting for that kind of next steps in that hearing. And while we wait, we’re waiting on that clarity. We’re still working and hope that a consensual plan can be developed. We’re working through we’ve always been open to a plan and we feel that the reserve is sufficient to that end.

But there’s two steps here. One, through the district court and showing that our talc has been BMI’s talc has been free of asbestos and then also working on developing a consensual plan. So, that’s going to take some time. We’re open to both avenues, but I can’t give you a time frame when that will be concluded.

Pete Osterland, Analyst, SunTrust: That’s very helpful. Thanks a lot Doug.

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Yes.

Gary, Conference Moderator: This concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug Dietrich for any closing remarks.

Doug Dietrich, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Minerals Technologies: Well, everyone, I really appreciate you joining the call today. Again, thank you for the questions. Hopefully, it was informative and we look forward to talking to you after the third quarter in October. All right. Take care till then.

The state-controlled company plans to roll out SAF produced at its refineries by the end of the year.
SAF is made from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, similar to renewable diesel.
Petrobras expects to produce up to 10,000 barrels per day of SAF.
He noted that the initiative is still in its early stages and could lead to Petrobras launching its first commercial-scale, ethanol-based SAF plant by 2030.","Petrobras is preparing to launch production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a key component of its renewable energy portfolio. The state-controlled company plans to roll out SAF produced at its refineries by the end of the year. At the same time, it is studying other technological pathways, particularly the use of ethanol as a feedstock.

SAF is made from renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and animal fats, similar to renewable diesel. Both fuels can be blended with fossil-based fuels at refineries, but they rely on different technologies and have distinct compatibility requirements with aircraft engines.

Roberto David, Petrobras’s general manager of domestic market marketing, emphasized that by launching SAF by December, the company will move ahead of Brazil’s and the global aviation industry’s upcoming mandate to blend biofuels into fossil-based jet fuel. He spoke on Tuesday (19) at the second edition of “Dialogues for a Just Energy Transition – Biofuels and Sustainable Solutions,” an event supported by Petrobras and promoted by Valor, O Globo, and CBN radio.

Earlier this year, the company completed SAF production tests through co-processing at its Duque de Caxias refinery (Reduc) in Rio de Janeiro, blending up to 1.2% corn oil into aviation kerosene (QAV). Petrobras expects to produce up to 10,000 barrels per day of SAF.

Under Brazil’s Fuel of the Future biofuels framework, airlines must begin cutting CO2 emissions by 1 percentage point per year starting in 2027, reaching a 10% reduction by 2037. This target can be met through SAF blending or alternative measures.

Globally, the Corsia program—the international aviation emissions reduction scheme—requires Brazilian airlines, beginning in 2027, to offset emissions from international flights above the 2019-2020 baseline. Offsets can be achieved through carbon credits or the use of Corsia-approved fuels.

Petrobras also expects to bring online its first ethanol-based SAF unit within five years, “if everything goes as planned,” said Rodrigo Abramof, the company’s executive manager for refining technology and asset management. He noted that the initiative is still in its early stages and could lead to Petrobras launching its first commercial-scale, ethanol-based SAF plant by 2030.

“The studies have been announced to the market, but we have not yet announced the investment,” Mr. Abramof said. The project calls for a new unit at the Paulínia refinery (Replan) in São Paulo state, with capacity of 10,000 barrels per day of alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF.

Mr. Abramof added that Petrobras is also working on technology known as Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), which would allow the company to produce both renewable diesel and SAF from vegetable oils and animal fats at the same facility. The project is being developed at the Presidente Bernardes refinery in Cubatão (São Paulo), with planned capacity of 15,000 barrels per day. The construction bidding process is underway, with the goal of starting operations in 2029.",http://s.glbimg.com/en/ho/static/globocom2012/img/fb_marca.png,N,,2025-08-21 01:57:11.914870

The UCO SAF ecosystem is being developed by Pertamina in preparation for the SAF mandate scheduled for 2027. This ecosystem includes used cooking oil (UCO) collection and distribution managed by Pertamina Patra Niaga, UCO-to-SAF coprocessing by Pertamina International Refinery, SAF distribution to aviation by Pertamina Patra Niaga, and SAF-powered flights by Pelita Air.

The SAF used for this flight is derived from renewable raw materials, such as used cooking oil, and is processed using the “Merah-Putih” catalyst—developed by Indonesian scientists and manufactured by the national catalyst producer, PT Katalis Sinergi Indonesia (KSI).

The resulting jet fuel, branded as Pertamina SAF, has undergone rigorous quality analysis. It meets international standards for jet fuel, including ASTM D1655, the latest Defstan 91-91 specifications, and Indonesian regulation SK DJM No. 70.K/MG.06/DJM/2025. This confirms that Indonesia, through Pertamina SAF, is capable of producing high-quality, sustainable fuel.

Strategic Collaboration with ITB

One of the key pillars in the development of SAF has been the strategic partnership between Pertamina and academic institutions, particularly the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB). As a gesture of appreciation, ITB’s Rector, Prof. Dr. Ir. Tatacipta Dirgantara, M.T., along with the Red-White Catalyst Development Team and the Bioavtur Test Team, were specially invited to the event, acknowledging their long-standing collaboration and significant contributions to SAF development.

From the outset, ITB played a leading role as the technical coordinator for the SAF Bioavtur J2.4 commercial flight test, working in collaboration with the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (EBTKE), with funding support from the Indonesia Oil Palm Plantation Fund Management Agency (BPDPKS). The ITB team participated in a series of activities including ASTM-standard fuel quality testing, static engine testing, and in-flight testing using commercial aircraft.

ITB’s contribution to the development of locally-produced catalysts and SAF testing highlights the importance of synergy between academia and industry. This innovation is expected to accelerate clean energy adoption and strengthen national technological self-sufficiency.

All production and distribution activities within the SAF ecosystem have obtained the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA). This includes UCO collection, UCO-to-SAF coprocessing, and SAF distribution. Pertamina’s coprocessing facility has also received certification under the European Union Renewable Energy Directive (RED-EU). This recognition positions Pertamina as the first fully integrated SAF ecosystem in Southeast Asia to achieve such international accreditation.

Towards a Greener Indonesian Sky

Through this special flight, Pertamina introduces SAF as an emerging energy technology and reinforces its commitment to supporting the government’s Asta Cita vision in achieving energy resilience and sustainability. This initiative positions Indonesia as one of the pioneers in SAF usage within Southeast Asia.

This flight, powered by a blend of jet fuel and recycled cooking oil, stands as proof that research-based local innovation can effectively address global clean energy challenges.

Conclusion

Nothing too drastic here, beyond that earning higher-tier status has become significantly difficult on flying alone, but it’s probably easier if you want to integrate more into the Atmos Rewards ecosystem (not probably the wisest thing to do).

The new tier names are easily understandable, unlike the previous ones, which were from the time when Alaska was essentially a regional airline on the West Coast with Psalm cards on meal trays (yes, they did have them).

What was once hailed as a revolutionary step toward net-zero emissions in aviation now stands as a cautionary tale of high costs, financial hurdles, and unfulfilled government mandates.

Background: High Hopes for Waste-to-Fuel Innovation

Six years ago, British Airways (BA) unveiled plans for the UK’s first dedicated SAF factory, partnering with fuels firm Velocys to build a state-of-the-art plant near the Humber estuary in north Lincolnshire. The facility was designed to transform household rubbish—destined for landfills—into thousands of tonnes of eco-friendly jet fuel. Alex Cruz, BA’s then-CEO, described SAF as a “game-changer for aviation,” envisioning a future where waste powers sustainable flights.

This initiative aligned with broader industry goals to reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. SAF, produced from materials like cooking oil, animal fats, wood, and plastics, promised to cut emissions significantly compared to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. The project was expected to be operational by last year, symbolizing the UK’s leadership in the energy transition.

Government Push: The “Jet Zero” Policy

In 2022, under then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the UK government launched its “Jet Zero” strategy, aiming for zero-carbon flying by 2050. Johnson optimistically declared that “sustainable fuels and fully electric planes will achieve guilt-free flying for years to come.”

The policy mandated that British airlines incorporate SAF into their operations, starting with 2% this year, rising to 10% by 2030, and 22% by 2040. It also pledged the construction of five new SAF plants by now, which were projected to create jobs and establish the UK as a “clean energy superpower.”These targets were intended to drive investment and innovation in the sector, addressing aviation’s contribution to global emissions—estimated at around 2-3% worldwide, with the UK consuming 11 million tonnes of aviation fuel annually.

Current Reality: Empty Fields and Meager Production

Fast forward to today, and the vision has faltered. The Velocys site remains an undeveloped field, marked only by a lone portaloo, far from the bustling factory once promised.

Velocys itself faced severe financial difficulties, running out of money last year and being acquired by a private consortium, which has further delayed any progress. Across the UK, SAF production is virtually non-existent on the scale needed. The sole operational producer, Phillips 66 at its Humberside refinery, outputs just 20,000 tonnes of SAF per year—equivalent to a mere 0.2% of the nation’s total aviation fuel demand.

No other plants have come online, leaving airlines scrambling to meet the government’s escalating quotas through imports or alternative compliance measures.

The Brick Wall: Cost and Complexity

The primary barriers are economic and technical. SAF production is energy-intensive, requiring processes to break down waste materials into usable fuel. As a result, its cost is prohibitively high: On August 13, the European price for SAF stood at $2,280 (£1,681) per metric tonne—more than three times that of conventional jet fuel, according to biofuels analyst Simone Burgin of Argus Media.

This price disparity, coupled with limited feedstock availability and scaling challenges, has deterred investment. While the government has offered incentives, critics argue they fall short of bridging the gap. The failure of projects like Velocys underscores the broader difficulties in the energy transition for hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, where alternatives like electric or hydrogen-powered planes remain years away for long-haul flights.

Implications for the Energy Sector and Beyond

For the energy industry, this setback highlights the risks of over-reliance on policy mandates without sufficient technological maturity or economic support. Airlines may face higher costs passed on to consumers, potentially slowing travel recovery post-pandemic. Meanwhile, the UK’s ambitions to lead in clean energy are under scrutiny, as imported SAF—often from the US or Europe—fills the void, raising questions about energy security and domestic job creation.

As the world pushes toward net-zero, the UK’s SAF saga serves as a reminder that innovation requires not just vision, but viable economics. Without breakthroughs in cost reduction or stronger incentives, climate-friendly aviation fuel may remain a pipe dream for years to come.

For the first time in Vietnam, Petrolimex Aviation has blended and provided the first 1,200 cubic metres of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) for Vietjet flights, marking an important milestone in the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel in Vietnam.

The airline said that its fleet, with 576 modern aircraft on order, would increasingly incorporate this fuel. In October 2024, Vietjet had partnered with Petrolimex Aviation to conduct the first two flights being fueled SAF in Vietnam.

Produced from renewable and sustainable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass, and urban waste, SAF can help reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fuels. It meets stringent international aviation standards and is safe for commercial operations.

Before Vietjet, national flag-carrier Vietnam Airlines flew a commercial flight from Singapore to Hanoi in May 2024 using sustainable fuel; that fuel was, however, produced and supplied by international partners.

Petrolimex pioneers blending aviation fuel technology

Petrolimex Aviation is the fuel subsidiary of Petrolimex, which is the country’s state-owned national petroleum company and largest distributor of oil products.

Petrolimex Aviation said that it is the first company in Vietnam to master the technology behind blending aviation fuel that meets international standards. The green aviation fuel it uses is blended in Ho Chi Minh City, using imported synthetic blending components – hydrocarbons produced from biologically renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, agricultural by-products, wood biomass and urban waste.

Vietjet continues upward trajectory

In the first six months of this year, Vietjet, including Vietjet Thailand, transported 17.7 million passengers and nearly 65,200 tonnes of cargo.

At the 2025 Paris Air Show, Vietjet placed a new order for 100 aircraft and 50 options for new Airbus A321neo aircraft. This represented the largest aircraft order at the Paris Air Show 2025, positioning Vietjet among the top 10 airlines globally with the largest orders.

Vietjet was awarded the “Best Workplace in Asia” for a record fifth year in a row at the HR Asia Awards 2025. This achievement reflects the airline’s steadfast dedication to crafting an outstanding workplace culture for its 9,000 staff on four continents across 16 countries and territories.

Production cost of SAF remains high

Despite biofuels’ clean energy profile and growing global demand, they cost more to produce and face competition from fossil fuels, said GlobalData in a report in May. Processing advanced biomass sources, such as agricultural and forestry waste, remains expensive, limiting their scalability and widespread adoption.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said in June that the production of sustainable aviation fuel is expected to reach two million tonnes or 0.7 per cent of airlines’ total fuel consumption in 2025.

Willie Walsh, IATA’s director-general, said: “Even that relatively small amount will add US$4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”

However, he also criticised the European Union’s SAF mandate as a costly initiative that is not helping the environment as regional supplies there remain low. He made this comment during a recent visit to Singapore

Singapore’s Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint

Under the Singapore Sustainable Air Hub Blueprint launched in February 2024, flights departing from Singapore will be required to use this sustainable fuel from 2026; one per cent of the total fuel used for such departures will be of the sustainable type, rising to 3 to 5 per cent by 2030.

Under the Blueprint, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will work with aviation stakeholders to reduce domestic aviation emissions from airport operations by 20% from 2019 levels in 2030 and achieve net zero domestic and international aviation emissions by 2050.

A parliamentary panel has urged for autonomy for the DGCA, highlighting a critical staffing shortage that threatens aviation safety. The committee's report emphasizes the need for a National Capacity Alignment Plan to synchronize airport development with aircraft induction, addressing unsustainable pressure on existing facilities.

A Parliamentary panel on Wednesday suggested a time-bound plan to grant administrative as well as financial autonomy to DGCA and flagged that the staffing crisis at the regulator is an ""existential threat to the integrity of India's aviation safety system"".

Besides, the committee said the current imbalance, where aircraft induction is outpacing airport growth, is putting unsustainable pressure on existing facilities, degrading service quality, and dangerously straining safety margins, as it pitched for developing a comprehensive National Capacity Alignment Plan to synchronise airport infrastructure development with airline fleet induction schedules.

The Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture -- headed by Rajya Sabha member and JD(U) leader Sanjay Kumar Jha -- submitted its report on the 'Overall Review of Safety in the Civil Aviation Sector' on Wednesday.

One of the recommendations is to establish a time-bound mechanism for the closure of all safety deficiencies, with priority for serious Level I matters and implementing stronger enforcement actions, including financial penalties for non-compliance.

""This is a response to the significant and growing backlog of unresolved safety findings, which indicates a critical weakness in the post-surveillance rectification process that undermines the entire oversight programme. Concerns also exist about audit quality due to a lack of qualified DGCA staff and airlines prioritising profiteering over immediate maintenance,"" the report said.

Live Events

The report has not mentioned the Air India plane crash that killed 260 people on June 12.

Calling for a time-bound plan to grant the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) full administrative and financial autonomy, the committee said it is necessary to address critical technical staff shortages caused by ""an ineffective recruitment model"", a problem highlighted by past expert committees but never resolved.

Nearly 50 per cent of the 1,063 sanctioned posts at the regulator are vacant. Of the total posts, only 553 are filled.

""This deficit is not a mere administrative statistic; it is a critical vulnerability that exists at the very heart of India's safety oversight system, occurring precisely at a time when the sector's unprecedented growth demands more, not less, regulatory vigilance and capacity,"" the panel said, adding that the staffing crisis is not merely an administrative problem but an existential threat to the integrity of India's aviation safety system.

According to the report, the civil aviation ministry's current stance is that direct recruitment by DGCA is not under consideration.

Among the raft of suggestions, the panel also proposed mandating a detailed root-cause analysis for every runway incursion and other recurring high-risk events, and establishing focused remedial programs for these areas.

""This is necessary because key safety targets for events like runway incursions are consistently being exceeded, indicating that the current incident review process is failing to translate lessons learned into effective operational changes.

""Specific data on bird strikes and engine failures underscores the need for effective remedial measures despite existing systematic oversight,"" it said in the report.

Against the backdrop of recent helicopter crashes, the panel has recommended a uniform national regulatory framework for all state-operated helicopter services and mandatory, terrain-specific pilot training.

""This is prompted by a series of accidents in high-risk environments managed by state-level agencies with limited central oversight, revealing a regulatory ambiguity that creates unacceptable safety gaps. While the ministry defines central and state roles and DGCA has issued a circular for pilgrimage operations, the committee highlights the need for more proactive and uniform central oversight,"" it noted.

Among other recommendations, the committee has emphasised the need for having a 'just culture' and a legally-backed whistleblower protection framework.

This is to counter a punitive culture that deters the open reporting of errors, which is essential for proactive safety management. While DGCA has a confidential and non-punitive voluntary safety reporting system, there is a need for clearer protections, it added.

Amid strains between Washington and New Delhi over Russian oil exports, First Deputy Prime Minister Denis Manturov said on Wednesday that Russia sees potential to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) to India, according to news agency RIA.

He also said, according to RIA news agency, that Russia was counting on expanding nuclear energy cooperation with India.

His comments came after U.S. Donald Trump imposed extra 25% tariffs on India this month because of its purchases of Russian oil, in a move the Kremlin called illegal.

Earlier during the day, Russian embassy officials in New Delhi said that Russia expects to continue supplying oil to India despite warnings from the United States, adding that Moscow hopes trilateral talks will soon take place with India and China.

""I want to highlight that despite the political situation, we can predict that the same level of oil import (by India),"" Roman Babushkin, the charge d'affaires at the Russian embassy in India, told a press briefing.

The agreement, signed by key officials from both organizations, represents a major stride towards decarbonizing air travel in the country and reinforcing India's commitment to global climate goals.

The collaboration leverages IOCL's recent achievement of becoming the first Indian company to receive the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery. This certification is a critical milestone, validating the refinery's capability to produce SAF that adheres to the stringent international sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards set by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Speaking at the event, Chairman of IndianOil, AS Sahney highlighted the strategic importance of the partnership. ""The signing of this MoU with Air India represents a strategic step in India’s transition to sustainable aviation,"" Sahney said. ""With our ISCC-CORSIA-certified SAF from Panipat, IndianOil is ready to provide a sustainable fuel solution that will help decarbonize air travel.

This week on The SAF Podcast we are joined by Greg Constantine, Co-Founder & CEO, AIRCO (Formerly Air Company).

Originally from Australia, Greg explains the strategy behind building out technology development from revenue generating consumer products like carbon negative Vodka, hand sanitizer and perfume building towards production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This allows for ongoing revenue generation and less reliance on raising outside investment.

Constantine explains their technology-licensing business model, contrasting it with the capital-intensive mega-project approaches favored by many competitors in the power-to-liquid (PTL) space. This strategy allows them to avoid massive FID funding rounds while still scaling sustainable aviation fuel production globally.

Their strong partnerships with the US military have provided rigorous testing opportunities across air, land, and marine vehicles, validating their technology beyond what’s possible in purely commercial settings. After closing a $70 million Series B funding round with strategic investors including JetBlue, Alaska Airlines, and Toyota Ventures, AIRCO is positioning itself as a technology provider rather than a large-scale fuel producer—focusing on licensing their technology to established operators who can scale production globally.

Constantine also discusses the challenges of balancing emissions reduction with cost competitiveness in the eSAF market, where fuels can cost seven times more than conventional jet fuel. The conversation then moves to feedstock flexibility, policy implications for e-fuels development and which policy structures he finds most practical.

After EU sanctions, Nayara Energy is using dark-fleet tankers and a limited crude import selection to maintain operations, raising concerns in India about energy security. The government has approved coastal tankers, including sanctioned vessels, to assist Nayara. Despite challenges, Russia assures continued crude supplies, employing special mechanisms to bypass sanctions.

One month after being hit by European Union sanctions, India’s Nayara Energy Ltd. is relying on a growing pool of dark-fleet tankers to transport its products, and a narrowing menu of crude imports to keep its operations running.

The oil refiner’s struggle for survival has come to the attention of India’s government, which is concerned about disruptions to oil flows that could jeopardize national energy security, according to people familiar with the matter. New Delhi has approved at least one coastal tanker in recent days to help the company move cargoes domestically, they said.

The refiner, part-owned by Russian oil major Rosneft PJSC, is an important pillar of the Indian market. Its 400,000 barrels-a-day processing plant accounts for 8% of the country’s refining, and the company operates 7% of its fuel stations. It’s been forced to reduce run rates after being spurned by trade partners following the EU’s measures targeting Moscow’s oil revenues.

Some of the tankers already greenlit by the government to supply Nayara with oil, and transport its refined products, include sanctioned vessels. One such dark-fleet ship, the Leruo, has made at least three domestic runs for Nayara after getting the go-ahead from New Delhi, according to a shipowner, who declined to be named discussing sensitive information, and ship-tracking data.

The medium-range tanker was blacklisted by the EU on July 18, part of a broad sanctions package targeting Russian oil exports that also penalized Nayara. Leruo’s owner is listed as Key Marvel Ltd. on S&P Global Inc.’s maritime database, although no contact details were included.

Live Events

Long-range tanker Next, another EU-sanctioned vessel that’s also blacklisted by the UK, is due to arrive at Nayara’s Vadinar terminal on Wednesday to pick up a cargo of diesel, according to a port agent’s report and ship-tracking data. The database lists Istanbul-based Next Maritime & Trading Ltd. as its owner, again with no email or phone number.

Such vessels are filling the gap left by local shipowners that have stopped doing business with Nayara. They’ve been forced to cut ties to protect their dealings with European ports and insurers. Ships that are covered by Russian or Iranian insurance —and which have been approved by New Delhi — are eligible to service Nayara.

Nayara has more than 1.2 million barrels of refined products on four sanctioned vessels idling off Vadinar, according to shipping data.

The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement last week, it said it remains committed to transporting its products via coastal, rail and road networks in order to efficiently serve its Indian customers.

Tempest Dream, a tanker that recently made a ship-to-ship transfer of gasoline produced by Nayara, has returned to Vadinar to receive more product, according to ship-tracking data. The vessel that took the cargo, Wu Tai, has yet to discharge the shipment, the data show.

Also Read: Nayara’s sanctioned cargo quietly slips into new hands

Nayara has only taken Urals oil from Russia as feedstock since late July. The refiner is expected to receive two cargoes of Urals this week, totaling about 1.4 million barrels, on two Aframax tankers, the Mars 6 and Tiger 6, according to a shipowner, who declined to be named, port agent reports and ship-tracking data.

Another Greek-owned supertanker, Evgenia I, which was supposed to deliver Middle Eastern crude to Nayara last week, is still ballasting in the Persian Gulf.

Keeping up Russian crude supplies to Nayara isn’t a problem, Evgeny Griva, Moscow’s deputy trade representative in India, said at a briefing in New Delhi on Wednesday. More broadly, the country’s imports of Russian oil are expected to continue at current levels, despite the geopolitical situation, given the lack of alternatives, he said.

“There are special mechanisms to get around sanctions and tariffs,” Griva said.

With 570 new planes on order, Air India’s fleet renewal plan will allow the airline to run one of the least carbon-emitting fleets globally. The airline also plans to add more nonstop city pairs, leading to fewer emissions from its flights and itineraries. Air India has also signed an MoU with the Indian Institute of Petroleum and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to jointly conduct research, develop, and implement SAF. Along with implementing industry-leading flight planning and optimization systems, the company has also coordinated with air traffic management and updated its route planning software.

Over the last few years, Air India has adopted several green practices, including reducing single-use plastics and using lighter material for cutlery and dishes, and is optimizing processes such as more frequent engine and airframe washes and implementing single-engine taxiing and autonomous-EV towing to save jet fuel.

These initiatives are in line with India’s larger push for green aviation, which includes the establishment of SAF supply chains throughout the nation and the country’s goal of 5% SAF blending by 2030.

Recent Developments in SAF

IndianOil recently became the first Indian company to obtain ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery, a milestone that is being built upon by this partnership. Earlier in June, Honeywell and NTPC Green had signed an MoU to jointly explore the production of SAF in India. Their collaboration will assess the use of Honeywell’s proprietary eFining technology to convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) captured from NTPC’s power plants, along with green hydrogen, into SAF. As the aviation sector rapidly moves toward decarbonization, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is becoming a major topic of discussion in the climate debate.

How SAF is helping airlines reduce maintenance costs

Cleaner combustion: SAF generates fewer soot and particulates, which can eliminate deposits, lessen component wear, and keep engines cleaner.

Fuel quality: More stable and reliable than traditional kerosene, which could increase engine dependability and prolong maintenance schedules.

Indirect savings: SAF helps lessen operational stress on engines and systems, which indirectly lowers upkeep when combined with fleet renewal and efficiency initiatives.

The accreditation, which was given in accordance with the ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), confirms IndianOil’s capacity to manufacture SAF that satisfies the strictest global sustainability and lifecycle carbon emission standards. Together, IndianOil and Air India are strengthening India’s standing as a leader in sustainable aviation and the energy transition by incorporating certified green fuels into commercial operations.

With the help of this Memorandum of Understanding, IOCL and Air India hope to work together on the supply of SAF to meet CORSIA targets for international flights, guaranteeing a consistent, transparent, and sustainable fuel supply to support the environmental objectives of both businesses.",https://mrobusinesstoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/MRO-BT-2025-08-20T150739.682.png,N,,2025-08-21 00:56:16.347423

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a next-generation biofuel derived from renewable, sustainable feedstocks.

It is chemically similar to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) and can be used as a ‘drop-in’ fuel in existing aircraft engines without modifications.

Aviation contributes nearly 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, one of the fastest-growing sectors for emissions.

With limited alternatives like electric/hydrogen planes for long-haul, Sustainable Aviation Fuel is the most practical decarbonisation pathway.

Possible Feedstocks for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Oils & Fats

Used Cooking Oil (UCO)

Algal oils

Animal fats

Oil-rich seeds (jatropha, pongamia, camelina)

Agricultural & Forestry Residues: Sugarcane bagasse, rice husks, wheat straw, forestry waste

Municipal Solid Waste (MSW): Plastics, organic waste processed into syngas

Sugars & Starches (Alcohol-to-Jet or ATJ Pathway): Conversion of ethanol, butanol, isobutanol into hydrocarbons

IOC’s Panipat refinery will rely on UCO recycling, linking waste management with aviation decarbonisation.

Contributes to over 60% of aviation’s decarbonisation needs (as per IATA).

Energy Security

Reduces dependence on imported crude.

Promotes indigenous feedstocks & waste-to-fuel circular economy.

Green Jobs & Economy: SAF’s value chain can generate employment in waste collection, refining, logistics, and R&D.

Compatibility: Approved blends: up to 50% SAF + ATF in current aircraft engines.

Challenges in SAF Adoption

High Costs

SAF is 2-3 times more expensive than conventional ATF.

Without subsidies or mandates, airlines may resist adoption.

Feedstock Availability

UCO and residues are seasonal, scattered, and difficult to collect.

Risk of food-fuel conflict if oilseeds are diverted.

Infrastructure Gaps: SAF supply chains, dedicated storage, and blending facilities are underdeveloped in India.

Policy & Market Risks: No clear long-term incentives like carbon pricing, tax credits, or feedstock purchase guarantees.

ISCC CORSIA Certification

What is ISCC CORSIA?

A global sustainability certification ensuring that SAF complies with ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation).

1% SAF blending in 2027 (international flights)

2% in 2028

Domestic blending mandate post-2027

Policy Linkages:

Net Zero 2070 commitments.

Biofuel Mission 2022 (expansion of ethanol blending, biodiesel, and SAF).

Waste-to-Wealth and circular economy initiatives.

Opportunities:

India produces over 2.3 crore tonnes of UCO annually.

Potential to emerge as a regional SAF hub, especially supplying Europe (where stricter aviation decarbonisation mandates exist).

Way Forward

Financial Incentives

Viability Gap Funding (VGF) for SAF refineries.

Tax credits/subsidies for airlines adopting SAF.

Feedstock Mobilisation

UCO collection networks via FSSAI, food businesses, and MSMEs.

Dedicated farmer-producer organisations (FPOs) for agri-residues.

Policy Push

Mandatory blending targets with a clear timeline.

Green hydrogen-SAF hybrid R&D support.

Global Integration

Despite potential US tariff hikes and criticism, Russia anticipates India will maintain its current level of Russian oil imports. A Russian official highlighted the economic advantage for India, citing a 5% discount. India defends its right to purchase from the cheapest source, while strengthening ties with Russia and China.

Russia expects India to continue buying its oil, a senior official said, even as the South Asian nation faces higher US tariffs and harsh criticism from Trump administration officials for the trade.

India’s imports of Russian crude are likely to stay at current levels, Evgeny Griva, the deputy trade representative of Russia in India, told reporters in New Delhi on Wednesday.

The remarks come amid rising tariff tensions between the US and India. President Donald Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods and threatened to double it to 50% on Aug. 27 — a rate that would make India’s $85 billion in annual US exports uncompetitive.

Half of that penalty is for New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil, which the US sees as helping fund Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine. India has defended its right to buy from the cheapest source, calling the tariffs “unreasonable.”

Russia sells oil to India at about a 5% discount, leaving Asia’s third-largest economy with few alternatives, Griva said. He projected bilateral trade to grow by about 10% a year.

Live Events

For India, the advantage of Russian oil is that it can trade at a lower cost, making it a key tool for keeping domestic inflation in check.

India has edged away from the US in the face of tariff threats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Putin as a “friend” after a call with the Russian leader this week and New Delhi has moved to bolster relations with China. Modi is set to visit China in late August — his first trip to the country in seven years — to meet President Xi Jinping.

India’s External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar is on a three-day visit to Russia to co-chair bilateral talks on trade, science and other issues.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Tuesday repeated Washington’s threat to raise import duties on Indian goods, saying it was “secondary tariffs for buying the sanctioned Russian oil.” He said India was “profiteering” from the oil purchases, and “some of the richest families in India” were benefiting.

India historically relied more on the Middle East for oil, importing little from Russia. That changed in 2022, after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine and a $60-per-barrel price cap imposed by the Group of Seven nations that aimed to limit the Kremlin’s oil revenues while keeping supplies flowing globally.

India’s imports from Russia amounted to about 1.7 million barrels a day, or nearly 37% of the nation’s overseas purchases, in mid-2025. After a brief pause earlier this month, India’s state-run refiners have returned to buying Russian oil, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday.

The US is India’s top trading partner, while Russia ranks fourth. Roman Babushkin, a senior Russian diplomat in India, said Moscow is ready to take more of India’s tariff-hit goods and help India manufacture jet engines domestically.

With hundreds of aircraft on order, we will increasingly incorporate SAF into our fleet to promote clean energy, reduce emissions, and support the global push for a net-zero future by 2050.”

Mr. Uong Viet Dung, Director General of the Vietnam Civil Aviation Authority, also noted the strategic importance of domestically blended SAF: “The introduction of SAF is a significant step in creating a sustainable fuel supply chain in Vietnam. It paves the way for broader collaboration among airlines, fuel suppliers, regulators, and financial institutions to expand SAF use in the country.”

SAF, produced from renewable resources such as used cooking oil, agricultural waste, wood biomass, and urban waste, is fully certified for commercial use. It offers up to 80% reduction in carbon emissions compared to traditional jet fuel over its lifecycle, aligning with the global sustainability agenda.

Vietjet Recognized as One of Asia’s Best Workplaces

Alongside its leadership in sustainability, Vietjet has been named one of Asia’s “Best Workplaces” for the fifth consecutive year at the HR Asia Awards 2025.

Iowa county prepares to take carbon capture pipeline fight to Supreme Court

The Board of Supervisors voted unanimously to appeal its case after losing in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in June.

""All levels of government have a role in safeguarding the public for hazardous pipelines,"" said Steve Kenkel, CO2 pipeline liaison for the county board.

The county had passed an ordinance regulating carbon capture pipelines but was sued by Summit Carbon Solutions, a company trying to build pipelines throughout Iowa.

Summit wants to construct pipelines that would carry pressurized CO2 — an ethanol byproduct — from plants in Iowa to North Dakota where it would be buried underground. This would make the ethanol eligible to be processed into sustainable aviation fuel.

But local landowners, like Jan Reinig, object to the plan because of concerns about safety, conservation and property rights.

""Well, actually it was rather emotional to think that this board of supervisors and our people that are behind us here on the county level are willing to step up. That takes a lot of courage I think,"" Reinig said.

Summit praised the Eighth Court of Appeals ruling in June, saying in part, ""This supports a consistent, lawful permitting process...""

Supervisor Mike Kolbe said the lawsuit will be funded by insurance and grant money, not the taxpayers.

Story County, which includes Ames, is also poised to continue the appeals process.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ee93907/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+643/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7b%2Fad%2Fb9dd8099464ab074720333c828a5%2Fimg-3135.jpeg,N,,2025-08-20 15:56:18.900637

Here's how to position your portfolio: ETF Exposure: The iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) offers broad access to the sector.
Since 2020, the S&P 500 Energy sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by 12% during periods of declining refinery utilization, while the airline sector has outperformed by 8%.
Final Takeaway The next time you see a refinery utilization rate miss expectations, don't panic.","The U.S. Energy Information Administration's latest report—showing a refinery utilization rate of 91.6% for the week ending August 20, 2025—has sparked a critical debate among investors. This figure, down from 95.4% in early July, isn't just a number; it's a canary in the coal mine for the energy sector. For those with a contrarian mindset, it's also a green light for airline stocks. Let's unpack why.

The Refinery Utilization Paradox

Refinery utilization rates measure how much of the U.S. refining capacity is being used. A high rate (like the 95.4% in July) typically signals strong demand for gasoline and diesel, which is great for refiners but disastrous for airlines. Why? Because when refineries are running at full tilt, gasoline prices often spike, creating a ripple effect that hikes fuel costs for airlines. In 2015, for instance, a utilization rate of 95.1% coincided with gasoline prices surging $0.36 above crude oil forecasts, crushing airline margins.

But the 2025 landscape is different. The utilization rate's drop to 91.6% isn't just a seasonal dip—it's a structural shift. Electric vehicle adoption now accounts for 18% of U.S. auto sales, and demand for gasoline is flattening. This has created a perfect storm: refining margins are under pressure, while airlines are enjoying a rare reprieve from volatile fuel costs.

Airline Stocks: The Energy Transition's Hidden Winners

The key to understanding this dynamic lies in fuel hedging and capital reallocation. Airlines like Delta (DAL) and American (AAL) have mastered the art of locking in fuel prices at favorable rates, a strategy that becomes exponentially more valuable when refining activity weakens. In 2025, gasoline prices have aligned more closely with crude oil, reducing the volatility that once plagued airline budgets. Delta's 2025 Q2 report showed a 6% improvement in net margins, partly due to its aggressive hedging program.

Meanwhile, refiners are shedding non-core assets and pivoting to hydrogen and biofuels. This shift has created a capital outflow from refining to energy transition projects—projects that airlines are now funding. United Airlines (UAL), for example, has invested $1.5 billion in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, a move that's both environmentally and economically strategic. With refining margins compressed, SAF becomes a more viable alternative, and airlines are positioned to lead the charge.

The Contrarian Playbook

When refinery utilization rates fall below 90%, it's not just a red flag for refiners—it's a green flag for airlines. Here's how to position your portfolio:

ETF Exposure: The iShares U.S. Airlines ETF (IAA) offers broad access to the sector.

Individual Stocks: Prioritize airlines with robust hedging and sustainability initiatives. Delta (DAL) and American (AAL) are top picks, but don't overlook regional carriers with lower debt loads.

Energy Transition Plays: Look for airlines investing in SAF and carbon-neutral operations. United (UAL) and Alaska (ALK) are leading the pack.

The Data Doesn't Lie

Let's not ignore the numbers. Since 2020, the S&P 500 Energy sector has underperformed the S&P 500 by 12% during periods of declining refinery utilization, while the airline sector has outperformed by 8%.

The message is clear: as the U.S. shifts away from fossil fuels, the refining sector's struggles will persist. For investors, this isn't a crisis—it's an opportunity.

Final Takeaway

The next time you see a refinery utilization rate miss expectations, don't panic. Instead, consider it a signal to rotate into airlines. The energy transition isn't just about EVs and renewables—it's about rethinking where value is created. And right now, that value is flying at 35,000 feet.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-08-20 20:56:19.587273

First-of-its-kind eSAF Production

Based on research carried out at Tampere University, Liquid Sun has developed an innovation based on low-temperature electrolytes technology used to convert CO2 emissions and renewable hydrogen into eSAF.

Production is set to launch in Autumn 2025 in Eespo, Finland. The new electro-fuel production unit is the first of its kind and is aiming to establish a functioning ecosystem for synthetic fuel production in Finland.

Cooperation with Finnair, ABB, Fortum, and Finavia will support the development of eSAF production and develop globally scalable processes to secure the future supply of domestically produced SAF in Finland.

“Finland has the opportunity to become a leading producer in the rapidly emerging sustainable aviation fuel market. To achieve this goal, it is critical that the project brings together industrial partners across the eSAF value chain with a shared ambition to accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels,” said Pasi Keinänen, CEO of Liquid Sun.

ReFuelEU Aviation

At the beginning of 2025, the European Commission’s ReFuelEU Aviation mandate entered into force, promoting an increase in renewable fuel usage in aviation through 2050.

In 2030, the mandate will include fully synthetic fuel produced from CO2, such as eSAF. By 2050, the fuel blending requirement will rise to 70%, with half of this requirement being SAF.

Mandate applies to airports with at least 800,000 passengers and 100,000 tonnes of cargo annually. In Finland, Helsinki Airport (HEL) and Rovaniemi Airport (RVN) fall under the mandate.

“As the owner of Finland’s airports, we at Finavia want to do everything we can across the aviation value chain to support more sustainable air travel. This means bold climate collaboration with our stakeholders, and actively understanding and testing new technologies across our airport operations,” says Henri Hansson, SVP, Airport Infrastructure, Sustainability, Safety, Security & Compliance at Finavia.

Finland as a Producer of Renewable Fuels

Finland has a unique opportunity to become an industry-leading producer of renewable aviation fuels with 20 million tons of biogenic CO2 annually from the forest industry and emissions from biogas plants. Diverse sources enable decentralized eSAF production, stronger energy security, and even distribution across Finland.

‍

“There is a technological race underway to deliver cost-efficient and scalable solutions, and Finland’s conditions and capabilities are highly favorable. We believe rapid piloting and validation are the right approach when building an entirely new industry for synthetic fuels. If successful, this project can give Finland a significant competitive advantage,” said Pasi Keinänen, Liquid Sun.

Collaboration for Renewable Energy Usage

Project development is the result of close cooperation of various companies along the aviation value chain in Finland - Liquid Sun, ABB, Finnair, Finavia, and Fortum.

“Aviation is one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize, and its energy transition will require innovation and collaboration across the value chain. We want to contribute to developing Finland’s capability in synthetic aviation fuel production while advancing the industry’s carbon neutrality goals,” said Riku Aho, Vice President Energy Transition, at Finnair.

“Fortum’s target is to help societies reach carbon neutrality and our customers to decarbonise their processes. For aviation fuel production, we are pleased to offer renewable energy and, in the future, hydrogen from the pilot plant we are currently building,” said Satu Sipola, Vice President, Hydrogen and Project Execution at Fortum.

“The goal of ABB Oy’s H2 Springboard program is to promote the development of Finland’s hydrogen economy ecosystem and to accelerate the scaling of hydrogen technology solutions. The Liquid Sun project is an excellent example of broad ecosystem collaboration for developing pioneering solutions,” said Simo Säynevirta, Head of H2 Springboard ecosystem at ABB.

Strong statements from parties of the eSAF pilot project signal Finland’s dedication and proactivity towards meeting goals set by the EU, ensuring a greener future for aviation.

eSAF in Comparison

Producing eSAF from biogenic CO2 emissions is environmentally competitive compared to other SAF production methods, but the details depend on the pathway and feedstock used. Here’s a comparison of key production methods:

1. eSAF from Biogenic CO2

CO2 Source: Captured from biological processes (e.g., fermentation, biogas plants) where the carbon would be released to the atmosphere if not captured.

Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Reduction: High. Biogenic CO2 is considered carbon neutral because the original photosynthetic capture offsets emissions from combustion. Life-cycle GHG reduction estimates are typically in the 74–90% range versus fossil jet fuel, depending on efficiency and renewable energy use.

Land/Resource Use: Lower than crop-based SAF, as it avoids direct land competition if using true waste streams.

2. HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters & Fatty Acids: Waste Oils, Fats, or Algae)

CO2 Source: Biogenic, from fats, oils, and waste (e.g., used cooking oil).

GHG Reduction: Substantial, typically a 74–84% reduction compared to conventional jet fuel. Lower for crop-based (e.g., palm oil) due to potential indirect land use change. True wastes and residues have a better profile.

Feedstock Concerns: Limited global availability of waste oils; risk of market distortion if crops are incentivized over food or forest.

3. Power-to-Liquid (PtL) or Power-to-X

CO2 Source: Can be biogenic, fossil (industrial “point source”), or from Direct Air Capture (DAC).

GHG Reduction: Best when powered solely by renewable electricity and using biogenic CO2 or Direct Air Capture. DAC is the least energy-efficient pathway due to the high energy needed to extract CO2 from ambient air.

Advantages: Potentially near-zero GHG footprint if green electricity and biogenic or atmospheric CO2 are used. Minimal land footprint—significant for places lacking biomass resources.

Challenges: Requires vast amounts of clean energy; currently limited by high cost and infrastructure for hydrogen and DAC.

4. Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)

CO2 Source: Fermentation from plant biomass (corn, sugarcane, or cellulosic waste).

GHG Reduction: Estimated up to 94%, but highly dependent on land use (direct and indirect), fertilizer use, and how the feedstock is grown. If using food crops, the risk of land-use change offsets the benefits.

Feedstock: Requires dedicated crops or waste streams; high sustainability if using agricultural wastes.

5. Gasification + Fischer-Tropsch (GFT)

CO2 Source: Biomass, municipal solid waste, forestry residues.

GHG Reduction: Between 66–94%, depending on how waste would have been managed otherwise (e.g., landfill methane), and whether the process uses renewable energy.

Resource Requirements: The availability of suitable waste and residues limits the scale, and there are concerns about air and water emissions from combustion-derived syngas.

Key Environmental Takeaways

Biogenic CO2–based eSAF is among the least environmentally harmful options when using bona fide waste or residue streams and renewable energy. It generally outperforms crop-based HEFA or ATJ pathways in terms of land and water use and avoids many land-use change risks.

Power-to-liquid (PtL) using renewable power and biogenic or DAC-CO2 can potentially achieve the lowest total GHG emissions—possibly approaching net zero—but at present, DAC is highly energy-intensive and expensive.

Waste-residue-based SAF (any method) typically offers the best lifecycle GHG and resource profile due to avoided waste management emissions and lack of land use competition.

Methods using crop-based feedstocks (food crops) can have significant indirect emissions due to land use change and should be minimized as per current sustainability frameworks.

While still a faraway source of propulsion energy, eSAF from biogenic CO2 might become highly competitive environmentally and, when powered by renewable energy and sourced from waste streams, rival or exceed the benefits of most alternative SAF pathways, especially compared to crop-based or fossil-derived feedstocks.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68a5e280c633105e324fa8cf_OH-LWT%208796%202434.jpeg,N,,2025-08-20 11:57:26.197358

Key takeaways

IATA projects 6% jet fuel demand growth in 2025 to 107 billion gallons.

EU and UK enforce 2% SAF blending from January 1, 2025; EU targets 6% by 2030.

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes; 2025 output ~713 million gallons.

Aviation fuel is the oil market’s outlier in 2025, with jet fuel demand still climbing while gasoline and diesel level off. Airlines worldwide are flying more as travel rebounds, and new rules are pushing more Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into tanks. IATA projects a 6% rise in jet fuel use this year to 107 billion gallons, while the industry’s fuel bill is expected to total $248 billion in 2025, nearly 5% below 2024 as prices ease.

In the United States 🇺🇸, spot prices fell from an average $2.73 per gallon in Q1 2024 to $2.34 in Q3, with 2025 expected to average $2.07. The contrast is striking: aviation fuels expand as road fuels face long-term pressure from electric vehicles and efficiency gains.

Mandates are the biggest driver behind the shift toward SAF.

From January 1, 2025, the European Union and the United Kingdom began binding SAF blending rules.

The EU requires 2% SAF at all airports in 2025, ramping to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The UK starts at 2% in 2025, rising to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

Both systems rely on verified emissions savings and tradable certificates to prove compliance. According to VisaVerge.com analysis, these policies, paired with airline purchase agreements, are giving suppliers firmer signals to invest in new plants.

Asia-Pacific governments are moving too:

Japan targets a 10% SAF blend by 2030.

Singapore plans 1% for departing flights in 2026, moving to 3–5% by 2030.

China and India are building local SAF output and preparing blend goals.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency’s 2025 Renewable Fuel Standard holds:

Advanced biofuel at 7.33 billion gallons

Biomass-based diesel at 3.35 billion gallons

New state SAF tax credits are expected in Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana.

The European Commission’s ReFuelEU framework sets a template many markets are watching. See the regulation details here: https://transport.ec.europa.eu/transport-themes/eu-air-transport-policy/refueleu-aviation_en

Supply vs demand: catching up but not enough

Global SAF production doubled in 2024 to 1 million tonnes (about 0.3 billion gallons), and output could reach about 713 million gallons in 2025. Yet that remains only a sliver of total aviation fuel use.

IATA reports 70 airlines have committed to buy 11.5 billion gallons of SAF by 2030, indicating strong demand intent that still outpaces confirmed capacity.

The SAF market is set to surge from $2.06 billion in 2025 to $25.62 billion by 2030, driven by large plants, new feedstocks, and long-term offtake deals.

Cost pressures and economic impact

Costs remain the hard part. SAF continues to trade at a premium to conventional jet fuel.

IATA estimates SAF will add $3.8 billion to airlines’ fuel costs in 2025, more than double the $1.7 billion added in 2024.

In Europe, non-compliance with blending rules can trigger penalties, raising real costs for airlines that fall short.

The UK builds in a buy-out price to control the hit to consumers if supply is tight.

Even with falling spot prices for standard jet fuel, the SAF premium keeps pressure on budgets and could nudge ticket prices higher on some routes.

Important: The SAF premium may lead to higher fares in regions where supply is scarce or penalties are strict.

⚠️ Important

Do not assume SAF certificates equal physical fuel availability—airlines may buy certificates or use buy-outs to meet mandates, leaving airports short of blended supplies and increasing spot premiums.

Production pathways and industry response

Producers and refiners are retooling to meet changing demand profiles.

About 82% of current SAF capacity uses HEFA (hydro-processed esters and fatty acids), relying on fats, used cooking oil, and similar inputs.

These feedstocks are limited, so investors are funding alternative pathways such as:

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ)

Power-to-liquid (synthetic e-fuels)

Policymakers in the EU and UK designed mandates to slowly shift away from heavy HEFA dependence and promote these newer routes. This matters because meeting future targets will require far more supply than today’s HEFA feedstocks can cover.

“SAF is strengthening its role as the cornerstone for the decarbonization of the aviation industry. Robust policy frameworks and targeted support are essential to keep SAF growth on track,” said SkyNRG CEO Maarten van Dijk in June 2025. SkyNRG’s market outlook aligns with IATA’s view that production is accelerating but still behind what mandates and airline pledges will require.

How EU and UK systems work in practice (2025)

Fuel suppliers blend the required 2% SAF into aviation fuel.

They document SAF volumes and greenhouse gas savings and submit evidence.

Authorities issue tradable certificates tied to those savings.

Suppliers use certificates to prove compliance or trade them if they have extra.

Penalties apply in the EU for shortfalls; the UK’s buy-out helps shield travelers.

For airline finance teams, these steps are now core to carbon accounting:

Certificates and credits show progress toward emissions goals and help meet legal rules across markets.

Procurement teams are locking in multi-year SAF deliveries, often linked to specific airports to align with local mandates.

Consumer effects and regional differences

Travelers will feel mixed effects:

Positive: more routes will carry fuel with a lower carbon footprint, and carriers will promote this in booking tools.

Negative: the SAF premium can feed into fares, especially where supply is scarce.

Regional differences matter:

Europe’s penalties raise stakes for compliance and could translate to greater operational costs for airlines.

The UK’s buy-out seeks to limit price spikes for consumers.

Refiners and the long-term pivot

Refiners face strategic choices:

Some plants are shifting yields toward jet fuel to match growing demand.

Others are converting units to produce SAF.

With gasoline and diesel no longer the growth engines they once were, jet products are taking a larger share of the slate. Analysts note this long-term pivot could reshape refining margins and trade flows through 2050.

The gap and the risk to meeting targets

Looking ahead, the main risk is the gap between goals and physical supply.

SAF demand could triple by 2035 to 40 million tonnes (about 13.2 billion gallons).

Projections show a 26 million tonne (about 8.6 billion gallons) shortfall unless new capacity is built.

EU and UK targets tighten sharply from 2030 and 2040 onward, with synthetic fuels expected to gain a larger role. Asia-Pacific, the Middle East, and Latin America are preparing targets and plants, but investors need confidence in stable policy and offtake deals to move faster.

Bottom line

For now, aviation’s energy story is one of momentum:

IATA’s price and demand outlook points to affordable conventional supply in 2025.

Mandates and airline contracts keep SAF growth in the spotlight.

VisaVerge.com reports that firm policy, clearer certificates, and rising purchase commitments are pushing the market from pilot volumes toward commercial scale.

If governments keep incentives steady and producers deliver on new technologies, the industry could meet higher blend levels without sharp shocks to travelers. But if build-out lags, airlines may lean on buy-outs and certificates while paying more for limited physical supply—especially in regions with strict rules and busy hubs.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Growth Drivers

How is the acceptance of high-integrity lifecycle carbon reductions fueling the sustainable aviation fuel market progress?

Aviation's climate strategy pivots on fuels with verifiable lifecycle cuts. CORSIA (ICAO) moved into wider implementation in 2024-2026, tightening accepted sustainability criteria and methodologies for SAF.

This compliance-grade carbon value is monetized. Airlines' decreasing reported emissions exposure can trim ETS-CORSIA liabilities. At the same time, producers earn higher credits in LCFS if they drive CI lower (for instance, via renewable power, green hydrogen, or CCUS on ethanol feedstocks). The global sustainable aviation fuel market is hence rewarding projects that can document traceability and additionality, increasing investment into digital MRV and lower-CI feedstocks.

How is cost curve pressure: scale, credits, and better logistics propelling the sustainable aviation fuel market?

The price delta remains the central brake, but it's easing at the margin. Based on the region and feedstock, SAF premiums have commonly ranged $2 to $4/gal above Jet-A. With IRA + LCFS, specific United States lanes can compress this to sub-$1-$2/gal efficient premiums for qualifying low-CI volumes, mainly for HEFA and some ATJ routes tied to low-CI ethanol.

Supply chain and scale optimization are progressing. More pipeline-grade SAF, on-airport blending, and multi-airline pooling decrease logistic costs. Indexed SAF price benchmarks and forward curves launched by price reporting agencies in 2023-2024 are allowing structured and hedging offtakes, enhancing bankability.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Restraints

Costly and limited feedstock availability negatively impacts market progress

Current SAF production is led by HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) pathways, depending on animal fats, waste oils, and vegetable oils. These feedstocks face competition from biodiesel, renewable diesel, and oleochemicals, increasing prices, and are finite.

The EWABA (European Waste-Based Biodiesel Association) cautioned in 2024 that waste oil imports, especially from Asia, are under scrutiny for traceability concerns, possibly tightening supply. Meanwhile, scaling next-gen feedstocks like lignocellulosic biomass, municipal solid waste, and CO2-derived e-fuels needs logistics and infrastructure that remain underdeveloped.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Opportunities

How do airline climate and corporate commitments present favorable prospects for the sustainable aviation fuel market?

Large corporations are committing to decreasing Scope 3 emissions, comprising business travel, while airlines are planning to be net-zero by 2050. In 2023-2024, carriers like Lufthansa, Delta, Air France-KLM, and United contracted multi-year offtake pacts for billions of gallons of SAF, usually at fixed-price terms to secure supply.

Corporate programs like ‘Book & Claim’ are progressing rapidly – United’s Eco-Skies Alliance and Shell’s Avelia platform experienced distribution sell-out in 2023-2024. These commitments ultimately fuel the sustainable aviation fuel industry.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market: Challenges

Infrastructure limitations for distribution and blending restrict the growth of market

Only a small number of airports, mainly in Europe and North America, have SAF integrated into their fueling systems. Many others depend on off-site blending or costly trucking. In 2024, fewer than 60 airports across the globe had regular SAF supply, according to IATA.

Without significant investment in hydrant injection, on-site storage, and blending, meeting 2030 mandates will require ineffective workarounds, increasing costs for producers and airlines.

Why in News?

Amid China’s growing assertiveness, the US strategic recalibration, and uncertainties in the Indo-Pacific, ASEAN’s role has become increasingly significant. For India, it remains a cornerstone of the Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision, as emphasized at the 2018 Shangri-La Dialogue, promoting a free, open, inclusive, and resilient Indo-Pacific.

What Opportunities does ASEAN Present to India?

Economic and Trade Opportunities: ASEAN, with 650 million people and a GDP of USD 3.2 trillion, is a key economic and trade partner for India.

Bilateral trade has reached USD 122.67 billion (2023–24), 11% of India’s global trade.

Singapore is India’s largest ASEAN trade partner and 6th largest trade partner (FY 2024-25) with a share of around 3% of India’s overall trade & also the top FDI source at USD 14.94 billion.

Full utilisation of ASEAN-India FTA (AIFTA) and finalising ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) can further boost trade and investment.

Defence Cooperation: India is increasingly emerging as a reliable defense partner, providing military hardware and technology to ASEAN nations.

Key deals, such as the sale of the BrahMos cruise missile system to the Philippines, signify a new phase of strategic cooperation.

India's assistance also includes providing training, maintenance, and technical expertise to help modernize the armed forces of various ASEAN member states, thereby strengthening their defense capabilities and promoting self-reliance.

Strategic & Security Engagement: ASEAN provides a strategic counterbalance amid regional tensions, reinforcing India’s Act East Policy and Indo-Pacific vision while supporting ASEAN Centrality.

India engages through East Asia Summit and ASEAN Regional Forum, ASEAN Maritime Forum, and joint exercises like the ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise (South China Sea, 2023).

Cooperation spans anti-piracy measures, disaster management, and promoting a rules-based regional order aligned with India’s SAGAR doctrine.

Connectivity & Infrastructure Integration: India-Myanmar-Thailand Trilateral Highway and Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport projects are poised to enhance regional physical connectivity and integration, while also boosting economic development in India’s Northeast by positioning it as a hub for regional trade.

Digital initiatives like 5G, cybersecurity, and participation in the ASEAN Smart Cities Network (ASCN) strengthen technological and economic linkages.

These efforts provide alternatives to China’s Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic and cultural integration in the region.

Tech & Energy Cooperation: India-ASEAN collaboration also spans IT, fintech, e-commerce, AI, and start-ups (via ASEAN-India Start-up Festival), supported by the ASEAN-India Science & Technology Development Fund.

Cooperation in energy resources, solar and clean technology, and semiconductors strengthens energy security and sustainability, highlighted by the ASEAN-India High-Level Renewable Energy Conference in 2022.

Cultural & People Ties: India-ASEAN historical and cultural links support soft power through the Artists’ Camp, Music Festival, and Network of Universities (2022), enhancing academic and societal bonds.

Participation in Initiative for ASEAN Integration Work Plan IV and centers of excellence promotes innovation, connectivity, and sustainable development.

Year 2025 has been designated the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism, featuring youth summits, start-up festivals.

Also, Indonesia’s Ramayana Ballet and Thailand’s Ayutthaya, called the “Ayodhya of Thailand,” reflect shared cultural heritage.

What are the Areas of Friction Between India & ASEAN?

Trade Imbalance & RCEP Withdrawal: India’s trade deficit with ASEAN has widened sharply, rising from USD 9.66 billion (2016–17) to USD 45.2 billion (2024–25), largely due to faster import growth compared to export growth.

To address concerns over market access, tariff asymmetry, and unfair trade practices, India is reviewing the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITGA).

Earlier, India withdrew from RCEP in 2019 to prevent a surge of Chinese goods via ASEAN markets, while efforts to renegotiate the ASEAN-India FTA have been slow and limited.

Delays in Connectivity Projects: Projects like the IMT Trilateral Highway and KMMT Project face funding, security, and bureaucratic delays, impeding trade, investment, and people-to-people ties and affecting India’s regional credibility.

Limited Defence Cooperation & Divergent Strategies: ASEAN’s divergent security priorities and economic dependence on China (ASEAN-China trade USD 702 billion vs ASEAN-India USD 122.67 billion, 2023–24) limit defence collaboration, as ASEAN countries are reluctant to counter China militarily or strategically due to their strong economic ties, resulting in only partial support for India’s Indo-Pacific vision.

ASEAN countries also differ politically, with Vietnam and the Philippines supporting India’s open, inclusive Indo-Pacific vision, while Cambodia and others prefer neutrality.

Also, India and ASEAN differ on their approach to Myanmar’s political crisis, where India maintains pragmatic ties with the junta for border and connectivity reasons, whereas ASEAN pursues diplomatic engagement via the Five-Point Consensus, causing friction.

Digital Trade & Data Governance Challenges: Regulatory mismatches in digital trade, fintech, and data governance slow India-ASEAN collaboration.

While ASEAN favors a liberal digital trade regime, India enforces data sovereignty under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

What Strategies Can India Pursue to Strengthen Ties with ASEAN and Assert Leadership in the Indo-Pacific?

Enhance Connectivity (Physical + Digital): Expedite projects like IMT Trilateral Highway and KMMT Project to scale up maritime linkages, air corridors, and digital infrastructure.

Implement mutual recognition agreements, interoperable digital platforms, and pilot projects with ASEAN partners, balancing India’s data sovereignty under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 with ASEAN’s liberal digital trade regime.

Bilateral initiatives like India–Singapore UPI linkage (2023) should be expanded to a regional digital payments architecture.

Maritime Security & Blue Economy: India and ASEAN should deepen maritime cooperation beyond naval exercises and piracy patrols by enhancing underwater domain awareness, logistics and MRO support, and addressing non-traditional threats like terrorism, drug smuggling, and human trafficking.

On the blue economy front, joint initiatives in marine technology, offshore renewable energy, and sustainable fisheries can combat IUU fishing and strengthen regional food security.

Sustainability, Resilience & Development Partnerships: Deepen collaboration on climate change, renewable energy, disaster management, food security, and digital skilling.

India can launch supply chain diversification initiatives in critical technologies and co-develop green energy corridors and sustainable agriculture models to boost regional resilience.

Strengthening Institutional & People-Centric Engagement: Leverage platforms like East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), ADMM-Plus to strengthen strategic dialogue.

Integrate Quad–ASEAN cooperation, institutionalize Track-1.5 dialogues, scholarships, cultural exchanges, and bolster people-to-people ties to reinforce India’s leadership role in the Indo-Pacific.

The designation of 2025 as the ASEAN-India Year of Tourism is an excellent opportunity to promote travel and cultural understanding.

Space for Sustainability: India can elevate its space collaboration with ASEAN from a transactional level to a strategic partnership by spearheading a dedicated ""Space for Sustainability"" program.

Building on the success of the South Asia Satellite (GSAT-9), India should extend its space diplomacy to ASEAN by launching a dedicated Regional Satellite for Sustainability.

Tourism as India’s Growth Engine

For Prelims: UNESCO World Heritage Sites, Swadesh Darshan, PRASAD, Heal in India Initiative

For Mains: Role of tourism in India’s economic resilience and employment generation, Challenges hindering growth of India’s tourism sector

Source:BS

Why in News?

Following the 50% US tariffs imposed on Indian goods, experts such as former NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant have suggested that tourism could help offset potential losses by attracting high-value tourists, since tourism is free from tariff barriers.

What is the Potential of India’s Tourism Sector?

India’s Tourism: The tourism sector in India has regained its pre-pandemic momentum, contributing 5% to GDP in FY23 and creating 7.6 crore jobs.

India recorded 9.95 million foreign tourist arrivals (FTAs) in 2024 but still below pre-pandemic levels. Foreign Exchange Earnings (FEEs) grew 10% in 2024 to Rs 2.9 lakh crore compared to 2023, reinforcing tourism’s role in jobs, revenue, and global standing.

India accounts for 1.5% of international tourist arrivals. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) 2024-25 report, India is the 8th largest tourism economy, contributing USD 231.6 billion.

India ranked 10th out of 46 destinations in the Medical Tourism Index (2020–21) released by the Medical Tourism Association.

Key Source Markets: Between 2020 and 2024, US, Bangladesh, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Germany, and France emerged as the top source countries for India’s foreign tourist arrivals.

Travel purposes are mainly leisure (46%), diaspora visits (27%), and business travel (10%).

Future Growth: The WTTC has projected that the travel and tourism sector will contribute almost Rs 42 trillion to India’s economy by 2035, supporting 64 million jobs.

By 2028, FTAs are expected to rise to 30.5 million, generating over Rs 5.13 lakh crore in revenue.

By 2047, India aims to become a USD 3 trillion tourism economy, attracting 100 million international tourists, 20 billion domestic trips, and creating 200 million tourism-related jobs.

What are the Challenges Hindering the Growth of Indian Tourism?

Visa and Travel Hurdles: Paper-based processes, complex approvals, limited visa-free access make FTAs entry difficult.

For example, only citizens of Bhutan, Nepal, and Maldives can travel to India without a visa, whereas China allows 70 countries and Thailand 90 countries visa-free access.

Poor Infrastructure: Limited hotel rooms and weak transport networks reduce tourist comfort.

India has around 200,000 hotel rooms, compared to China’s 20 million. Many government-run hotels operate at a loss, discouraging investment.

Lack of Cleanliness: Inadequate waste management and untidy surroundings near airports and public areas leave poor first impressions on visitors, especially when compared to cleaner international tourist destinations.

Safety Concerns: Inadequate security and emergency services pose risks to tourists, particularly in remote or high-traffic areas.

Low Global Promotion: India lacks a strong, ongoing international marketing campaign. Past initiatives like “Incredible India” were successful, but no major campaign has run in the last decade.

As of July 2025 India has 44 UNESCO World Heritage Sites while Greece has around half, but attracts three times more tourists. This highlights underutilization of cultural assets, weak global branding, poor visitor facilities, and limited promotion, making it harder for India to attract high-value tourists.

Urban and Connectivity Gaps: Difficult access to remote or high-potential destinations reduces tourist inflow.

Regions like the Himalayan religious circuits remain underdeveloped in terms of roads, airports, and accommodations.

How can India Attract High-Value Tourists?

Simplify Entry and Travel: Expanding e-Tourist Visa and visa-on-arrival to more countries, while making them faster and cheaper, can boost arrivals.

For high-value tourists, seamless travel through better airports, quicker immigration, and multilingual support is essential.

Promote Unique, Premium Experiences: Promote Niche Tourism like Ayurveda retreats, luxury wildlife safaris, spiritual wellness tours, high-end cultural festivals, and river cruises. These attract tourists willing to pay more.

Lakshadweep, with its pristine beaches, coral reefs, and clear waters, holds immense promise as a high-value tourist destination. With sustainable tourism practices and carefully planned infrastructure, the islands can become a premier hotspot.

Invite influencers, travel writers, and opinion leaders for luxury experiences that build aspiration and word-of-mouth.

Showcase Destination Diversity with Circuits: Schemes like Swadesh Darshan and PRASAD can be used to package experiences into premium itineraries, such as the Buddhist Circuit for international pilgrims, a luxury Himalayan Circuit combining wellness and adventure, and Spiritual Circuits with upgraded PRASAD sites.

These initiatives transform India from a single-site destination into a multi-day immersive journey, encouraging longer stays and higher spending by tourists.

World-Class Infrastructure and Connectivity: The initiative to develop 50 top tourist destinations through challenge-mode partnerships with states ensures premium facilities, luxury hotels, and seamless connectivity.

Classifying hotels under the Infrastructure Harmonized Master List (HML) will draw private investment into high-end hospitality, crucial for attracting affluent travelers.

Upgrade Service Quality: High-value tourists want comfort. More focus on training manpower in hospitality (chefs, guides, service staff) is key.

Encourage global-standard hotels, boutique stays, luxury trains, and cruises.

Medical and Wellness Tourism: The Heal in India initiative, blending modern medicine with Ayurveda, Yoga, and wellness, positions India as a global healthcare hub.

With Medical Value Travel projected at USD 13.42 billion by 2026, India can attract affluent patients seeking holistic, high-quality care.

Knowledge as Value Additions: Initiatives like the Gyan Bharatam Mission (digitizing manuscripts, preserving heritage) can support cultural tourism aimed at scholars, and global heritage enthusiasts.

Strengthen Safety and Comfort: 24x7 helplines, tourist police, welcome booklets, and multilingual guides can build trust and attract more tourists.

Conclusion

Tourism offers India a tariff-free path to resilience by creating jobs, earning foreign exchange, and strengthening global branding. With ‘Seva’ and ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ as guiding values, India can redefine its tourism landscape and emerge as a world-class destination by 2047.

Stray Dog Management in India: Balancing Public Safety and Animal Welfare

For Prelims: Rabies, Article 21, Supreme Court of India, National Rabies Control Program

For Mains: Balancing People Rights Vs Animal Welfare

Source: IE

Why in News?

The Supreme Court (SC) of India issued a suo motu directive to remove stray dogs in the National Capital Region (NCR), following tragic attacks on children.

This directive has sparked discussions on the legal and ethical aspects of balancing public safety with animal welfare.

Menace of Stray Dog in India

India has 62–80 million stray dogs. Over 2.2 million dog bite cases were reported in 2024 alone. Rabies from dog bites accounts for 36% of global deaths, primarily affecting children, women, and the elderly.

National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data shows that more than 4000 dog bite fatalities occurred in 2019.

Delhi alone recorded over 35,000 animal bite incidents in the first half of 2025. The cost of treating rabies through post-exposure prophylaxis places a financial strain on healthcare systems, with an average cost of Rs 5,128 per case.

What are the Legal and Policy Frameworks for Stray Dogs Management in India?

Constitutional Provision;

Article 246(3): States manage preservation, protection, and improvement of livestock, prevention of animal diseases, and veterinary training/practice.

Articles 243(W) & 246: Local bodies are responsible for controlling the stray dog population.

Article 51A(g): Fundamental duty of citizens to show compassion for all living creatures.

Article 21 (expanded by SC in Animal Welfare Board of India v. Nagaraja (2014): Right to life extended to animals (Jallikattu Case).

Legal and Policy Framework:

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960: Prohibits cruelty and mandates humane treatment.

Animal Birth Control (ABC) Rules, 2023: Provide for sterilization, vaccination, and release of stray dogs back to their habitats.

Rabies Control Efforts: The National Rabies Control Program (NRCP), led by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, aims for rabies elimination by 2030 through vaccination, sterilization, and surveillance.

What are the Key Ethical Aspects Surrounding Stray Dog Management?

Human Safety vs. Animal Rights: Rising dog-bite cases and rabies deaths create a moral conflict between ensuring public safety and protecting animals’ right to life.

High incidence of attacks on children raises ethical concerns of negligence in safeguarding the most vulnerable. ABC Rules prioritise animal welfare over human safety, risking Article 21 rights when aggressive strays are released.

Whereas animals, as living beings, deserve protection and humane treatment. The removal or abandonment of stray dogs is viewed as a violation of their fundamental right to life.

Disparity in Treatment: Well-bred dogs are often treated as family members or status symbols, while stray dogs are seen as social outcasts, raising concerns about unequal treatment.

Ethical Dilemmas in Control Methods: Instances of culling, poisoning, or cruel relocation violate ethical principles of compassion and humane treatment.

Corruption and Mismanagement: Mismanagement and misuse of funds allocated for sterilization, vaccination, and stray dog welfare programs undermine both the effectiveness of these initiatives and the ethical obligation to ensure humane treatment for animals.

Ethical Frameworks Guiding Stray Dog Management

Utilitarian Ethics: Sterilization and vaccination serve the greater good by reducing the risk of rabies while avoiding cruelty. This approach often advocates for stricter measures to protect human health, aiming for the overall benefit of society.

Deontology: The State and society have a duty to protect both citizens and animals.

Rights-Based Ethics: Stray dogs are seen as having inherent rights, and ethical action involves protecting those rights and ensuring their welfare.

Cultural Ethos of Ahimsa: Indian tradition emphasizes compassion and coexistence with all living beings.

One Health Approach: Ethical stewardship demands integrating animal welfare with human and environmental health.

Best Practices in Stray Dog Management

In Bengaluru, assessments of the ABC program showed a 10% reduction in the street dog population from 2019 to 2023, with a 20% increase in the neutering rate, reflecting positive results in managing stray populations.

The Netherlands achieved a “stray dog-free” status through the CNVR (Collect, Neuter, Vaccinate, Return) program, and encouraged adoption.

Istanbul, Turkey the city runs comprehensive Trap-Neuter-Vaccinate-Return programs, tags sterilized dogs with ear markers, and engages community feeders.

Over the past decade, the stray population has stabilized, rabies is nearly eliminated, and coexistence with humans is maintained.

Bangkok, Thailand replaced mass culling with TNVR. This approach halted rabies outbreaks and significantly reduced community aggression toward dogs.

What Measures Should Be Taken to Balance Public Safety and Animal Welfare?

Service Roles for Dogs: Collective measures should be taken by all key stakeholders to Leverage Dogs' Cognitive and Social Skills for Critical Roles in Drug Detection, Bomb Sniffing, and Therapy, while Promoting a Positive View of Dogs in Society.

Policy Implementation: Governments must collaborate with civil society to enhance vaccination, sterilization programs, and prevent pet abandonment. A national policy should address the human-dog conflict.

Dedicated Facilities: Establishing feeding stations, veterinary healthcare facilities, and supporting animal welfare organizations is key to managing stray dog populations effectively.

Additionally, a dedicated helpline must be established for reporting attacks.

Public Awareness and Education: Educate the public on responsible pet ownership, the importance of sterilization, and the safe interaction with animals to prevent dog bites and reduce abandonment.

Conclusion

The ethical responsibility to protect animals must be aligned with society’s duty to safeguard its citizens. By fostering compassion, implementing effective policies, and engaging in public awareness campaigns, India can build a future where both human and animal rights are respected, ensuring peaceful coexistence.

Important Facts For Prelims

Nominations to UT Assemblies

Source: TH

Why in News?

The Union Home Ministry asserts that the Lieutenant Governor (LG) of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) can nominate five members to the Legislative Assembly without the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

J&K Reorganisation Act, 2019 (amended 2023) provides for 90 elected members and allows the LG to nominate up to five members.

Did You Know?

Only J&K, Delhi, and Puducherry are represented in the Rajya Sabha because they are the only union territories with elected legislatures.

The composition of the Legislative Assemblies of UTs are governed by acts of Parliament.

The Delhi Assembly has 70 elected members and no provision for nominated MLAs under the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991.

The Puducherry Assembly has 30 elected members, with the Union government allowed to nominate up to three members under the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963.

What are the Constitutional Provisions Regarding Nominated Members?

Rajya Sabha: Under Article 80, the President can nominate 12 members having special knowledge in literature, science, art, and social service, on the advice of the Union Council of Ministers.

Nominated members enjoy most privileges of elected MPs, such as participating in debates, and introducing bills, but cannot vote in presidential elections. They can vote for the Vice President.

They are also not required to declare assets and liabilities under the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

Nominated members have six months from taking their seat to join a political party; joining after this period leads to disqualification.

Legislative Councils: Under Article 171, nearly one-sixth of members in a State Legislative Council are nominated by the Governor, based on the advice of the Council of Ministers.

Anglo-Indian Members: Earlier, the Constitution allowed the President (Article 331) to nominate two Anglo-Indian members to the Lok Sabha and Governors (Article 333) to nominate one Anglo-Indian member to State Legislative Assemblies.

Both provisions were abolished by the 104th Constitutional Amendment in 2020.

Judicial Precedents Regarding Nominated Members

Puducherry Case (K. Lakshminarayanan vs Union of India, 2018): The Madras High Court upheld the Union government’s power to nominate three MLAs to the Puducherry Assembly without needing the UT government’s advice.

It recommended statutory clarity on the nomination process, including the authority and procedure, but the Supreme Court later set aside these recommendations on appeal.

Delhi Case (Government of NCT of Delhi vs Union of India, 2023): The Supreme Court had delved into the concept of “triple chain of command,” where civil servants are accountable to ministers, ministers to the legislature, and the legislature to the electorate.

It ruled that the LG must follow the advice of the Council of Ministers, except in matters beyond the Delhi Assembly’s powers.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Source: IE

Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will start commercial Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production from used cooking oil at its Panipat refinery after ISCC CORSIA (International Sustainability & Carbon Certification for CORSIA) certification, marking India’s first SAF plant and a key step in reducing aviation emissions.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

About: SAF is a biofuel produced from sustainable feedstocks, chemically similar to conventional Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF), and can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without modifications (‘drop-in’ fuel).

Possible Feedstocks for SAF: Oils & fats (Used Cooking Oil, algae oils, animal fats, oil-rich seeds), municipal solid waste, agricultural/forestry residues (sugarcane bagasse, husks etc), and sugars & starches via Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway.

The ATJ pathway converts renewable alcohols (ethanol, butanol) from sugars, starches, or residues into hydrocarbon-based SAF.

Significance: SAF reduces GHG emissions by up to 80%, contributes over 60% to aviation decarbonisation, boosts energy security, creates green jobs, and supports up to 50% fuel blends.

Challenges in SAF Adoption: SAF faces high costs (2-3 times conventional fuel), infrastructure gaps, and challenges in feedstock collection due to seasonal and scattered supply.

ISCC CORSIA Certification

ISCC CORSIA ensures compliance with ICAO’s Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

From 2027 (mandatory phase), international airlines must offset emissions above 2020 levels, with SAF blending being a key compliance route.

CORSIA is a global ICAO initiative to limit international aviation CO₂ emissions growth by stabilizing net emissions at 2020 levels through carbon offsetting, credits, and SAF.

India’s Roadmap

NBCC (National Biofuel Coordination Committee) targets 1% SAF blending in 2027 and 2% in 2028 for international flights, with domestic mandate post-2027.

This supports Net Zero 2070, gives a first-mover advantage, promotes a circular economy (UCO recycling), and opens export opportunities to European airlines.

Bioactive Peptides

Source: PIB

A study finds that bioactive peptides (BAPs) from traditional fermented foods can deliver health benefits tailored to specific population groups, opening scope for personalized nutrition in India.

Bioactive Peptides (BAPs): Bioactive peptides are short chains of 2–20 amino acids that remain active after digestion and directly affect body functions.

They are essentially ""hidden"" or ""encrypted"" within the larger structure of a parent protein.

They become ""activated"" or ""released"" when the parent protein is broken down by enzymes during digestion, fermentation, or other forms of processing.

BAPs interact with biomolecules via electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions, providing antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antioxidant, and immune-modulatory effects.

Peptides and proteins are both made up of amino acid chains linked by peptide bonds.

The key difference is that peptides are shorter chains, while proteins typically have more than 50 amino acids.

Health Benefits: BAPs can regulate blood pressure, blood sugar, immunity, inflammation, and influence cardiac and metabolic health.

However, the way biopeptides work varies from person to person due to factors such as genetic makeup, gut microbiota, diet, and overall health.

This highlights the importance of precision nutrition, where diets and health plans are tailored to an individual’s unique biology, an approach particularly crucial in a diverse population like India.

Amino Acids:

Amino acids are organic compounds that act as the building blocks of proteins, essential for growth, repair, and normal functioning of the body. They are of three types:

Essential amino acids, which the body cannot produce and must be obtained from food (such as histidine, leucine, and lysine).

Nonessential amino acids, which the body can synthesize on its own (such as alanine, glutamic acid, and glycine).

Conditionally essential amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress (eg: arginine, cysteine, and glutamine )

Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana

Source: TH

The Finance Ministry stated that nearly one-fourth of PM Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts are inoperative, raising concerns about financial inclusion and account usage.

Scale of Inoperative Accounts: Out of 56.04 crore PMJDY accounts, 13.04 crore (23%) are inoperative. Uttar Pradesh has the highest share (2.75 crore), followed by Bihar and Madhya Pradesh.

As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines, a savings account is marked inoperative if there are no transactions for over 2 years.

However, Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) continue to flow even into inactive accounts.

About PM Jan Dhan Yojana: It provides a basic zero-balance account for every unbanked adult without any opening or maintenance charges.

Account holders receive a RuPay debit card with Rs 2 lakh accident insurance cover and are eligible for an overdraft facility of up to Rs 10,000 to meet emergencies.

The scheme also serves as a key platform for Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT) and subsidies, and through its integration with the JAM trinity (Jan Dhan–Aadhaar–Mobile), it ensures transparent and efficient delivery of welfare schemes.

Transformative Impact: PMJDY has significantly boosted women’s financial inclusion-women owning bank accounts rose from 53% (2015-16) to 79% (2019-21).

Leveraging PMJDY’s financial inclusion base, access to Mudra loans has expanded, recording a CAGR of 9.8% between 2019 and 2024.

The scheme has also boosted savings habits with an average deposit of Rs 4,352.

Rethinking the Role of Planted Forests Gustavo sees a common misunderstanding about the role planted forests play in the environment.
With improved access to high-quality data, APRIL’s forestry management can become more agile, responding faster and smarter to changing environmental conditions.","Forestry has always been a game of patience and long-term vision, shaped by the careful management of resources that take years, even decades, to mature. For Gustavo Martins, APRIL Group’s Tree Improvement Head, the appeal of forestry lies precisely in these challenges.

Born into a family rooted in agriculture in Brazil, Gustavo developed an early fascination with the outdoors.

“My family has roots to agriculture. My grandfather was a rancher. My father is an agronomist. I always grew up in this environment,” he shares.

“Forests are even more challenging because of the long cycles and exciting because they’re big living beings,” Gustavo explains.

His interest grew stronger during graduate school, where tree improvement offered him the perfect intersection of biology, statistical analysis, and practical outcomes. Today, that deep engagement is directly contributing to APRIL2030, the company’s ambitious sustainability strategy which aims for a 50 per cent increase in fibre productivity without expanding its plantation footprint. APRIL has already achieved a 12 per cent productivity gain, and Gustavo’s work is central to continuing this progress.

For him, the journey of improvement is endless: “It’s a never-ending journey. Every day there’s a new discovery…that’s quite exciting.”

Improving Forest Productivity Through Traditional Breeding

At APRIL, Gustavo leads tree improvement initiatives using traditional breeding techniques designed to enhance growth rates and the resilience of commercial tree species. He emphasises that APRIL does not rely on genetically modified trees but instead harnesses naturally occurring genetic variations through selective breeding practices.

“We introduce natural variation from these species, fine-tuning genetics from the natural variability,” Gustavo notes.

His team primarily focuses on acacia and eucalyptus, species well suited to APRIL’s tropical plantation environments due to their fast growth and inherent resistance to pests and diseases. To ensure reliable performance, Gustavo explains that each promising tree clone is rigorously tested under various conditions, observing how they respond over time.

“We have a well-defined research programme. We do clonal testing in different environments and verify how they perform under those site conditions,” he explains.

Harnessing Data to Guide Better Forestry Management

The secret behind APRIL’s robust plantation operations lies partly in the comprehensive data-driven approach Gustavo oversees. APRIL’s forestry R&D team includes over 200 specialists from diverse fields such as genetics, plant health, nutrition, and silviculture, who together manage vast datasets to support strategic decision-making.

A particularly impactful innovation is the company’s use of remote sensing technologies, allowing teams to monitor vast forested areas in a way previously impossible.

“Remote sensing was really a game changer because we can cover and monitor the forest in a larger scale that was not possible before,” Gustavo highlights.

The team integrates detailed maps of soil texture and fertility to strategically match specific tree clones to the most suitable planting sites. This careful approach ensures that trees thrive despite challenges like climate variability and environmental stresses.

From Insight to Impact: Caring for Soil and Feeding Forests

For Gustavo, the health of APRIL’s plantations starts from the ground up. Each plantation site is viewed as a long-term investment designed to yield productivity not just once, but across multiple planting cycles.

“Our land works double duty. It needs to boost productivity but simultaneously protect the environment,” he emphasises.

APRIL’s meticulous approach ensures every tree receives precisely tailored nutrition, applying macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, and calcium, alongside essential micronutrients like magnesium, zinc, and boron. The carefully balanced nutrient programme protects long-term soil health and sustains productivity.

This practice also helps APRIL achieve its broader sustainability goals. Gustavo draws a clear link between productivity and climate mitigation, noting that healthier, faster-growing trees capture more carbon from the atmosphere.

“A more productive forest is absorbing more carbon from the air,” he explains.

Partnerships Powering Forestry Innovation

Gustavo firmly believes that addressing forestry challenges cannot be done by APRIL alone. Instead, the company relies on robust partnerships with global research institutions and universities to expand its capabilities.

“We have collaborative projects and partnerships; it’s a multi-disciplinary approach,” Gustavo explains.

Notably, APRIL collaborates closely with North Carolina State University through initiatives like CAMCORE and the Plant Sciences Initiative, leveraging their expertise in genetic research and forest management practices. Additionally, APRIL partners with Pretoria University’s FABI institute, further strengthening its capabilities in plant health and pest management.

“These partnerships exemplify our commitment to integrating academic excellence with our practical science-based solutions,” he says.

Gustavo believes that partnerships are critical because forestry’s complexity requires collaboration between diverse fields, from biotechnology and genetics to data science. Solving complex issues like climate change and resource management demands collective, interdisciplinary action.

Rethinking the Role of Planted Forests

Gustavo sees a common misunderstanding about the role planted forests play in the environment. While consumers increasingly demand sustainability, they also continue to require materials derived from forestry.

“Everyday people want to consume more and more. How do we achieve both at the same time? There’s no other way if we don’t use technology and science,” he explains.

Planted forests, he stresses, are essential because they help meet fibre demand without placing additional pressure on natural forests. Gustavo highlights APRIL’s one-to-one conservation policy, which pairs every hectare of planted forest with an equal area conserved as natural habitat.

His global forestry experience across Brazil, Indonesia, and the United States underscores a universal misconception about commercial forestry, that economic production and environmental protection cannot coexist. Gustavo argues passionately against this view, insisting that sustainability can and should be an integral part of commercial forestry practices worldwide.

Building Progress Over Time

Reflecting on his nine-year tenure at APRIL, Gustavo highlights tangible gains already made through the company’s genetic improvement programme.

“We already verified a significant improvement in our forest productivity. Our approach has been working,” he states.

But he sees these improvements as part of a longer continuum rather than isolated victories. Sustainable forestry, for Gustavo, comes from continuous, incremental improvement rather than dramatic overhauls.

“What we do today should be better than what we did yesterday, and what we do tomorrow should be better than what we do today,” he says, underscoring his long-term vision for progress.

Looking ahead, Gustavo sees further potential in the integration of artificial intelligence and automation. With improved access to high-quality data, APRIL’s forestry management can become more agile, responding faster and smarter to changing environmental conditions.

“Artificial intelligence, it’s definitely going to change the way we do things in the next five years,” Gustavo concludes, confidently pointing toward a future where innovation, sustainability, and productivity align seamlessly.",https://www.inside-rge.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/gustavo_tree-improvement_4-e1755681766126.png,N,,2025-08-20 09:56:58.114338

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Ill., the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil.","For researchers from The Grainger College of Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, a new avenue for reducing carbon emissions can be found on the side.

A side of salad dressing, that is.

In 2020, the United States federal government committed to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. An important step towards carbon neutrality is embracing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), an alternative to conventional jet fuel that is made from renewable feedstocks. As part of this initiative, Grainger engineers have been hard at work creating the critical nanocatalysts for converting biocrude oil from food waste such as salad dressing into sustainable aviation fuel.

Hong Yang, a professor of chemical & biomolecular engineering, and Yuanhui Zhang, a professor of agricultural & biological engineering, joined forces to tackle this problem.

Their findings, published in Science Advances, present a low-cost, scalable and reusable catalyst to produce an alternative to traditional jet fuel, demonstrating the first production of SAF from food waste-derived biocrude using non-noble metal carbide catalysts.

“There is already an industry effort for SAF production in North America, but primarily in competition with food supply such as soybean oil,” said Zhang. “Currently, the United States consumes about 40 million tons of jet fuel annually which only includes about 1% of SAF. We could increase that number to 10-20% from biowaste alone.”

Unlike traditional jet fuels derived from fossil crude oil, SAF is made from renewable resources such as biomass, energy crops, food waste, sewage sludge, and algal bloom. For nearly three decades, Zhang’s lab has been working to produce biocrude oil via hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of organic waste streams. HTL mimics the natural process of fossil crude formation but accelerates the conversion timeline from millions of years to half an hour.

Yang and Zhang thought that by simultaneously addressing carbon emissions and food waste they could kill two birds with one stone.

After collecting food waste from the Kraft food plant in Champaign, Ill., the researchers utilized HTL to convert the waste into a biocrude oil. This biocrude was upgraded using non-precious metal carbide catalysts developed by Yang’s lab.

“Molybdenum carbide is an attractive option for a catalyst that aids this process because its outer shell electrons interact with biocrude molecules to remove oxygen,” Yang said.

For their specific food waste of choice, the team quickly zeroed in on salad dressing because it is preprocessed, homogenous and high in energy. Through a catalytic conversion process, scientists can remove unwanted oxygen in these biocrudes, turning them into hydrocarbon fuels.

“We also have to fine tune the catalysts by adding iron atoms and other species to produce fuel molecules with molecular weights that resemble the fuel composition” said Siying Yu, a chemical & biomolecular engineering graduate student and the first author of the paper.

Going forward, Zhang and Yang will continue collaborating with the goal of enhancing their catalyst design to better convert biocrude made from other biowaste to meet SAF criteria. Specifically, they’d like their catalyst to work for a variety of bio feedstocks such as algae and sewage. The metal carbide nanocatalysts they developed could also be appliable in studying SAF production from oleochemical-based fermentation products and crop-based feedstocks.

“There is no good substitute for aviation fuel for long-haul air transportation, so the research on SAF products is very much needed.” Yang said. “I’m optimistic because our students love this research topic. They want to work on something that will change the world.”

SAF, like ethanol-blended petrol for cars, is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks that reduces emissions from air transportation.

The jet fuel can be blended at different levels with limits between 10% and 50%, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced. This week, the country’s largest refiner and fuel retailer Indian Oil Corp. signed a memorandum of understanding with Tata Group airline Air India for the supply of SAF, marking a major step towards a greener future for Indian aviation.

IOC is the first Indian company to secure ISCC CORSIA certification for SAF production at its Panipat Refinery. ISCC CORSIA is a certification system for compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) criteria for SAF. It is a prerequisite for commercial SAF production.

The company plans to start production of SAF on a commercial scale at its Panipat refinery by December, according to media reports. By the end of 2025, IOC will have the capacity to produce 35,000 tonnes per year of SAF from used cooking oil.

Sustainable aviation fuel can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks like food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. These require complex chemical processes at the refineries.

Triglyceride or oil-based feedstocks such as plant oil, animal oil, yellow or brown greases or waste fat, oil, and greases are hydroprocessed to break apart the long chain of fatty acids, followed by a process called hydroisomerization and hydrocracking, according to the US Energy Department.

Pretreated waste fat, oil, and greases can also be eligible feedstocks. Used cooking oil and waste animal fats are two other popular sources for coprocessing with petroleum intermediates as a potential SAF pathway.

Such non-petroleum feedstock to make SAF could be sourced at scale from large hotel chains like those run by Taj Hotels, Oberoi Hotels and ITC Hotels, restaurants, and sweets and snacks majors like Haldiram’s, which normally discard cooking oil after single use.

Sustainable aviation fuel blended with conventional jet fuel can be used in existing aircraft and infrastructure. Compared with conventional jet fuel, 100% SAF has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% depending on feedstock and technology pathway, according to the US Energy Department.

SAF is a replacement for conventional jet fuel, allowing for multiple products from various feedstocks and production technologies. Aviation accounts for 2% of all carbon dioxide emissions globally and 12% of all CO2 emissions from transportation.

The international aviation industry has set an aspirational goal to reach net-zero carbon by 2050. SAF presents the best near-term opportunity to meet these goals.

Biofuels in India are of strategic importance as they align with the ongoing initiatives of the government such as Make in India and Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. For example, India initiated the use of ethanol as an automotive fuel in 2003 and is primarily produced using sugarcane molasses.

The government has a 10% blending target for mixing ethanol with petrol by 2022, a 20% blending target by 2030 and 5% blending of biodiesel in diesel in the whole country by 2030.

Likewise, the adoption of SAF also presents the opportunity to reduce reliance on costly imported crude and create a new income source for small and large companies to dispose of their used oil.",https://media.assettype.com/bloombergquint%2F2025-02-11%2F6g3zmye3%2F4888a338-3b77-4c54-9b9f-047634014a79.jpg?rect=0%2C423%2C2928%2C1537&w=1200&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true,N,,2025-08-20 04:56:19.326836

Air India and Indian Oil Corporation have taken a significant step forward in shaping the future of sustainable aviation in India. By signing a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on the supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the two organisations are aligning with India’s broader climate goals and the global net zero ambition led by the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

The partnership signals more than a commercial arrangement. It represents a bold vision for reducing aviation emissions in a sector often regarded as one of the most challenging to decarbonise.

The Role of SAF in Aviation Decarbonisation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is not just an alternative to fossil-based jet fuel. It is one of the most viable pathways to immediately reduce carbon emissions from aviation without requiring major modifications to existing aircraft engines or fueling infrastructure. SAF can lower lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.

By incorporating SAF into its operational strategy, Air India is contributing to India’s national target of achieving a 5 per cent SAF blending mandate by 2030. This move also aligns the airline with IATA’s long-term goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, underscoring how international and domestic ambitions are now converging.

A Dual Commitment: Efficiency and Innovation

The announcement also highlights Air India’s broader approach to sustainability. Beyond SAF, the airline has initiated a suite of measures such as fuel efficiency enhancements, flight route optimisation, and partnerships for joint research in alternative fuels.

This layered strategy is essential. While SAF provides an immediate solution for emissions reduction, improvements in operations and future innovation will amplify the impact and ensure long-term resilience. The combination of efficiency and innovation reflects a modern blueprint for responsible aviation.

Why This Matters for India’s Sustainability Goals

India’s aviation sector is one of the fastest growing in the world. Passenger numbers are increasing, routes are expanding, and the demand for air cargo is rising steadily. This growth, while positive for the economy, also brings environmental challenges.

The government’s target of blending 5 per cent SAF into aviation fuel by 2030 is both ambitious and necessary. The Air India and IOC agreement provides a practical demonstration of how this target can be pursued through cross-industry collaboration. The message is clear: decarbonisation cannot be achieved in isolation. It requires synergy between airlines, fuel producers, policymakers, and innovators.

Strengthening India’s Global Position

This initiative also positions India as a proactive contributor to global aviation’s decarbonisation journey. Countries around the world are experimenting with SAF blending mandates, production capacity scaling, and supportive policy frameworks.

By taking decisive steps now, India signals that it is not only catching up with global trends but also capable of setting benchmarks for others. The Air India–IOC agreement is therefore more than a domestic achievement; it is a marker of India’s rising influence in the climate-conscious aviation landscape.

The Challenges of Scaling SAF

Despite its promise, SAF adoption faces challenges. Production remains limited, costs are higher compared to conventional jet fuel, and supply chain logistics require substantial investment. Achieving the 5 per cent blending target by 2030 will require careful coordination of infrastructure, incentives, and technology development.

However, these challenges are also opportunities. They open the door for new partnerships, research investments, and industrial diversification. By addressing these barriers now, India can build a resilient SAF ecosystem that ensures both environmental and economic benefits.

Collaboration as the Key to Transformation

What makes the Air India–IOC pact particularly noteworthy is its collaborative essence. Aviation decarbonisation cannot be achieved by airlines or fuel suppliers alone. It requires an ecosystem approach, where knowledge, resources, and risks are shared.

This agreement showcases how collaboration can turn climate ambitions into measurable outcomes. It creates momentum for other airlines, fuel producers, and stakeholders to step forward and contribute to India’s sustainability roadmap.

Subtle Shifts with Far-Reaching Impacts

While SAF blending may appear incremental today, its ripple effects will be profound. Even small percentages of SAF adoption across the sector can reduce millions of tonnes of carbon emissions over time. It can also drive local innovation, support jobs in biofuel production, and create new markets for sustainable feedstocks.

These subtle shifts underline the importance of seeing SAF not just as a compliance tool but as a catalyst for long-term systemic transformation.

Lessons for Other Industries

The aviation–oil collaboration also offers lessons for other hard-to-abate sectors. Maritime and road transport, for instance, face similar challenges in decarbonisation. Just as airlines and fuel suppliers are coming together for SAF, ports, shipping companies, and logistics providers can form comparable alliances to advance clean fuels and efficiency.

Cross-sector collaboration, therefore, is the thread that ties together the larger net zero narrative.

Conclusion

The agreement between Air India and Indian Oil Corporation is more than a memorandum of understanding. It is a symbol of how ambition, innovation, and collaboration can converge to create real change in aviation sustainability. By embracing SAF alongside efficiency improvements and research partnerships, Air India is positioning itself as a responsible leader in a rapidly evolving industry.

As India continues to expand its aviation footprint, the integration of sustainable practices will determine not only the sector’s environmental impact but also its global competitiveness. The Air India–IOC pact is a timely reminder that the future of aviation lies in foresight, partnerships, and bold action.

The enthusiasm — or obsession — came in handy during the pandemic, when aviation shut down and quashed oil demand. Now, it’s equally useful for investigating the final piece in the oil-recovery jigsaw.

Five years after Covid-19 emptied the skies, global jet-fuel demand has yet to recover to its pre-pandemic level. Meanwhile, global consumption of every other category of petroleum refined products — gasoline, diesel, liquefied petroleum gas, naphtha and fuel oil — has already surpassed 2019 levels.

Still, I’m bullish on jet-fuel consumption. Perhaps because of my enthusiasm for planes, perhaps because I fly a fair bit for work, I’m typically upbeat about the future of aviation. No matter how much I hear about staycations, heat waves or anti-tourist protests, I’m convinced people will continue to take to the air for holidays. And when it comes to the climate threat, I believe most travelers overlook it -- or salve their conscience by purchasing carbon credits, despite the fact that most of them are meaningless in protecting the environment.

I also tend to look at the world through a different glass: I care less about airports like Heathrow in London and John F. Kennedy in New York, instead focusing on emerging hubs like Guangzhou in China, Hyderabad in India, Istanbul in Turkey, Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and Bogota in Colombia. Those are where, increasingly, the next generation of travelers are departing and landing.

Put simply, the more the global middle class grows, the more people will fly. Meanwhile, large electric planes remain a dream; hydrogen is a chimera; and so-called sustainable aviation fuel, derived from cooking oil and animal fat, is a hope rather than a reality. Thus, I’m not only bullish about jet-fuel demand now, but also in the future. Aside from plastics, the brightest spot for global oil consumption is air travel. How long can jet fuel offset a decline in gasoline consumption? Probably another five years, if not longer.

Since the pandemic ended, jet fuel has struggled to recover not because people aren’t traveling as much as before — spoiler: they are — but because the shock of lockdown and the high oil prices after Russia invaded Ukraine forced the industry to retire old, gas-guzzling planes. Their replacements are far more fuel efficient.

The narrow-body flagship models from Airbus SE and Boeing Co., introduced shortly before the pandemic, are about 20% more parsimonious with fuel than the models they replaced, on the back of better aerodynamics like wingtips, lighter materials and better engines . On top, a portion of what the industry typically calls jet fuel isn’t consumed by planes. Instead, it’s the kerosene that fuels stoves and furnaces. While kerosene only accounts for 10% of the wider pool of jet fuel, its declining consumption is another headwind .

Still, the recovery is on course. Flight counts — and passenger numbers — are well above 2019 levels. Despite early worries that traffic was going to subside this year, so far it’s continued growing, albeit slower than during 2023 and 2024. The share prices of major airlines have also recovered from their drop in March, when concern about summer bookings and business travel was the talk of the industry.

Measured by the so-called revenue-passenger-kilometers benchmark, which combines both the number of people flying and how far they travel, the aviation industry last year clocked 9,037 billion RPKs, surpassing for the first time the 8,688-RPKs peak in 2019. This year, the aviation industry expects another increase to 9,500 billion. And everything suggests that, barring another crisis, the indicator will keep increasing in 2026 and beyond. We shouldn’t be surprised: every other crisis was a mere blip on flying’s long rise. Whether it was the Gulf War in 1990-1991 or the global financial crisis in 2008, every setback has proven temporary.

Despite the surge in flights, jet-fuel demand remains below pre-pandemic levels due to those more efficient planes. The International Energy Agency estimates consumption will reach 7.7 million barrels a day this year, below 2019’s 7.86 million but still posting the strongest annual growth of any refined-oil product. By next year, the headwind of aircraft improvements will start to vanish, with jet-fuel appetite nearly matching pre-Covid levels — something already seen in Europe and North America, where kerosene plays a smaller role.

From 2026 onward, demand should be setting new all-time highs every year. Until when? We have good visibility at least until 2030, when the need is likely to top 8.5 million barrels a day.

What about beyond 2030? My guess is that demand will keep growing, even if gasoline and diesel drop. Turn to Asia for clues: Its fragmented geography, including islands, is well suited for air travel, disposable income among the middle class is rising and, as their counterparts in Europe and America did from the 1960s onwards, the new wealthy Asian urbanites will want to take to the skies. The global use of jet fuel will continue to fly.",https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/iGgBPhI4asG4/v1/1200x1173.jpg,N,,2025-08-20 00:56:23.840001
