David O'Brien, who also leads Lauda Europe, said Malta and other peripheral states like Ireland and Cyprus are being unfairly penalised by EU climate policies that fail to account for their geographic realities.

“We are sleepwalking into a protectionist trap. Current EU policies punish states on the periphery for their geography. Our options are limited. We can’t holiday by road. Aviation is our lifeline, and it's being priced out,” he said.

The CEO was speaking at a joint panel hosted by the Malta Business Network (MBN) and the Irish Business Network (IBN) - the first event jointly organised by the two

O’Brien called on national governments, including Malta, to push back against policies that unfairly burden smaller, island-based nations.

He also criticised the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate, saying airlines operating out of Malta are often being charged for SAF even when airports don’t supply it.

“We land in Munich—no SAF available—but we’re still charged. These costs are staggering. The reality is, margins in aviation are wafer-thin, and these new charges may push us over the edge,” he said.

O'Brien's concerns were echoed by other panellists and leading aviation sector figures who spoke at the event.

KM Malta Airlines Executive Chairman David Curmi agreed that Malta faced significant challenges for the future of its connectivity.

The main airlines operating to and from the country, he said, face serious pressure from rising operational costs—many of them policy-driven.

“Destinations like Tel Aviv and St. Petersburg were cut for strategic reasons, but we’re increasingly having to make decisions based on cost pressure, not opportunity. It’s becoming harder to justify routes when the cost of doing business keeps escalating,” Curmi said.

Beyond the EU, panellists also expressed frustration at the lack of strategic planning and foresight from Malta’s own government.

There was a shared sentiment that the country’s approach to long-term connectivity and sustainable growth remains reactive and politically cautious.

Stephen Xuereb, CEO of Valletta Cruise Port, pointed out the growing disconnect between regulatory ambition and practical implementation, especially in infrastructure.

“There’s a lot of talk about sustainability, but not enough investment to match it. We’re expected to meet green targets, but where’s the support to actually get there?” he asked, referencing the cruise industry's growing compliance demands and Malta’s limited infrastructure to support them.

The event was moderated by David Delicata, Partner and Transportation, Hospitality & Services Leader at Deloitte Malta.

“Peripheral economies must be part of the policy conversation—not just policy recipients. Malta needs to lead, not follow, if we want a tourism sector that’s future-ready,” Delicata said.

Conclusion This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built.","Brand reputation is more important than ever in today’s digital, interconnected age. The ability for information to spread online (accurate or not), is becoming unstoppable. Consequently, a company’s actions, whether they involve harmful, unethical, or unsustainable practices, or proactive measures such as taking bold steps to protect the planet, or unveiling innovations to enhance services, hold significant weight.

And often, the perception of these actions is even more important. The power and influence of both traditional media and social media have significantly amplified the impact of both positive and negative information, shaping public perception in real-time.

As airlines are responsible for the safe transportation of millions of passengers daily, trust and reliability are paramount. Therefore, for the airline industry, maintaining a solid and positive reputation couldn’t be more crucial.

While safety concerns underpin much of the consumer perceptions of airlines, reputation in this sector is a complex equation. And as the aviation industry continues to grow and evolve, several additional criteria are creeping into the equation. Notably, sustainability and accessibility are growing in importance.

In an era where environmental consciousness and inclusive travel are paramount, airlines are increasingly judged on their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint and ensure equitable access for all passengers. An airline’s products and services have the most influence on passengers.

Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) has partnered with Carma, a media analysis and intelligence service provider, to investigate how cabin design and passenger experience can impact an airline’s reputation.

Methodology

Carma employs a comprehensive approach to gauging reputation, analysing media coverage, social media activity, and audience perception through six pillars: products/services, sustainability, conduct, vision, performance, and culture.

A Reputation Score is calculated separately for traditional media, social media and audience research, and then combined. The score for each component is composed by weighting the presence of the six pillars with the tone and volume of coverage/respondents, which is then weighted by the importance of each pillar to the audience (based on audience research).

The research also provides insights into how reputation impacts purchasing decisions differently across various regions. For instance, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and United Arab Emirates (UAE), reputation is a strong driver of airline choice, while in Asia, purchase decisions are more complex. In the UK, reputation and purchasing decisions are often more separate considerations.

For the purpose of this report, stories and posts have been tracked regarding 12 airlines across 8 different countries, over the course of one year (2024). In total, the analysis considered 55,267 articles and 1,014,058 social media posts.

Full breakdown of sources:

Sources: Online, social media

Time period: 1st January 2024 – 31st December 2024

Areas tracked: Hong Kong, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States (USA), Malaysia

Airlines tracked: British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Emirates Airline, Etihad Airlines, KLM, Lufthansa, Malaysian Airlines, Qatar Airways, Saudia, Singapore Airlines, Turkish Airlines, Virgin Atlantic

Total articles in dataset: 55,267

Total social media posts in dataset: 1,014,058

Driving airline reputation

So what factors are truly driving reputation in the airline industry? Carma has created a unique methodology to track reputation, based on its six key pillars:

Products and Services: Anything related to the airline’s customer offering, such as quality, reliability and customer service.

Culture: Anything related to the airline’s organisational culture, such as employee treatment, health & safety, diversity & inclusion.

Sustainability: Anything related to the airline’s sustainability actions including community engagement, environmental impact, and charitable endeavours.

Conduct: Anything related to the airline’s behaviour and conduct, such as authenticity, transparency, compliance, and ethical behaviour.

Performance: Anything related to the airline’s business performance, such as consistency, investment potential, and financial results.

Vision: Anything related to the airline’s direction and vision of the future, such as innovation, value proposition, and expertise.

Analysis of the perceptions of 1,534 people based in the UK, UAE, KSA, Malaysia, Hong Kong and Singapore, found that Products and Services was the most influential factor in shaping people’s perception of an airline. Similarly, the study showed that Products and Services was also the biggest driver of coverage, accounting for 70% of traditional media and 65% of social media posts.

Carma also found that Products and Services was a more influential category than Conduct, Performance or Culture. This suggests that by continuing to offer new and innovative services onboard, airlines can maintain or even improve their reputation, helping to influence purchasing decisions.

Regional variations

Carma also found notable variations in how different regions value reputational factors. Notably, in the UK, airline reputation scores were not found to directly align with the volume of media coverage. For instance, Emirates received the best overall score in the region, despite a relatively low amount of traditional media coverage.

Whereas British Airways, despite having the lowest reputation score, was rated the highest in terms of likelihood of usage. This indicates the need for a greater and more positive exposure of BA’s products and services in the media to strengthen its brand reputation.

Meanwhile, in Asia, Singapore Airlines stood out from the pack as the most reputable airline. Notably, the airline scored highly in the Products and Services category, reinforcing the importance of this pillar. However, reputation again wasn’t found to be the most important factor in terms of likelihood of usage. Despite being rated as the most reputable airline, Singapore Airlines was only rated third for likelihood of usage.

Finally, in the UAE and KSA, Carma’s report found that the Middle East-based airlines received the most positivity from the media and audiences. Unsurprisingly, Emirates led the way with the highest reputation score, but was closely followed by Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways, and Saudia. Similarly to the other regions, the top airlines in terms of reputation also scored highly in Products and Services.

Given the importance of Products and Services on airline reputation score, investing in new and innovative onboard experiences will be essential for airlines moving forward. For airlines looking to bolster their interior products, services and onboard offering, Aircraft Interiors Expo (AIX) remains the event to attend.

As the world’s leading platform for airlines and cabin interiors professionals, AIX showcases products from all aspects of the cabin, from lighting, seating, galley equipment, and LEDs, to cabin management systems, IFEC hardware, and communications.

Aviation’s sustainability challenge: navigating expectations

Many consumers are aware of aviation’s impact on the environment, and look to fly with airlines that prioritise making sustainable choices and continually improvements. A recent survey from an international aerospace company found that 65% of respondents believe it is time for sustainable air travel. The survey found that 70% of all respondents from across the UK, US, France and Germany are concerned about the role of aviation in climate change.

But what does the media landscape look like when it comes to airline sustainability news? Over the course of 2024, Carma (which analysed over 55,000 articles in the mainstream media) identified six key spikes in activity.

The data showed that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) dominated much of the media coverage when it comes to sustainable aviation stories. However, in reality, the landscape for this is much larger. Though SAF is certainly part of the narrative, many airlines are taking significant steps to reduce their carbon emissions and minimise their impact on the environment through sustainable aircraft interiors.

The coverage suggests that there is a huge window of opportunity for airlines to gain a competitive advantage by promoting and generating wider awareness of other sustainability initiatives, whether that be the introduction of lightweight seating, or the use of more recycled materials on-board.

Key media moments in 2024:

09 April: Sustainability was listed as “one of the most pressing issues in aviation” ahead of the 2024 Future Aviation Forum.

03 June: The need to switch to sustainable aviation fuel was highlighted as a key cost to factor in for airlines as demand recovers from Covid-19.

25 June: There was a wave of coverage after Lufthansa, Europe’s biggest airline group, announced it would introduce a surcharge of up to €72 per flight in 2025 to cover the costs of switching to alternative fuels necessary to lower emissions.

07 August: Virgin Atlantic was the subject of significant (largely negative) media coverage after its fuel advert was banned by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which ruled it to be “misleading”.

18 September: Climate technology firm, Air Company, announced that it had secured backing from aviation fuel supplier, Avfuel, in its latest funding round as it looks to convert carbon dioxide into more climate-friendly products.

31 October: There was a spike in news coverage when China-based airline, Xiamen Airlines won the APEX World-Class Airline award, and the company cited ‘Caring for the Earth’ as one of its three core pillars.

Now let’s take a closer look at the news coverage. Excluding sustainable aviation fuel, if we break down the coverage, we can see that:

Collaborations were another significant driver of sustainability coverage, making up 32% of articles.

Events were the focus of 16% of all sustainability articles.

Greenwashing only accounted for 2% of all sustainability articles.

Additionally, if we examine the statistics for sentiment around sustainability news coverage overall, we can see that:

Positive coverage accounted for 53%

Neutral coverage accounted for 25%

Negative coverage accounted for 22%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data showed that (out of the areas analysed) the top five countries for sustainability coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 37%

US coverage accounted for 36%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 18%

Singapore coverage accounted for 6%

Malaysia coverage accounted for 4%

Looking at the news coverage in more detail, it is clear that partnerships were very effective at boosting sustainability messaging. Some of the most notable examples of stories in 2024 included:

24 January: Lufthansa Group chose Viasat to install the European Aviation Network (EAN) in-flight connectivity solution.

The articles specifically highlighted how the EAN allows Lufthansa Group to both save money and be more sustainable on its flights because of its ‘small, low weight, low-drag terminals’.

01 May: Turkish Airlines, Airbus and Rolls-Royce entered into a partnership for workforce and innovation.

01 October: Qatar Airways Group announced plans to acquire a minority 25% equity stake in Virgin Australia.

This is an interesting example as the focus isn’t solely on sustainability, but is linked to it largely by spokespeople quoted in the articles.

It is worth noting that in much of the partnership news, sustainability wasn’t the crux of the story. However, as explained above, the sustainability messaging was boosted through spokesperson quotes, indicating the importance of maximising these opportunities for airlines.

Greenwashing was a theme throughout the year, but it did not penetrate news coverage all that widely, appearing in only 2% of all sustainability coverage. Notably, the stories did translate into social media activity in a way other sustainability topics did not. A key example of this was an announcement from the EU it would be investigating 20 carriers for potential ‘greenwashing’. Data from Carma also indicated that the US is more engaged with the topic of greenwashing than any other country.

Exploring social media

When looking into social media activity throughout 2024, there appears to be very little crossover between the top news coverage and social media posts. The lack of continuity between the platforms suggests a potential window of opportunity for airlines to drive further traction in sharing their sustainability stories on social media. From a reputation perspective, there is more that could be done to drive these new stories and translate them into positive conversations on social media.

Spotlighting sustainable cabin interiors

Despite a complex media landscape, airlines across the globe are increasingly investing in a variety of products, strategies and initiatives which are helping to reduce their environmental impact. However, given the data at hand, it seems that many of the top stories are consistently neglecting to mention some of the most innovative strategies for reducing carbon emissions inside the cabin. Sustainable aircraft interiors are a particularly un-reported area in the media.

Some of the most common themes, products and strategies being employed in sustainable aircraft interiors include lightweighting. For airlines, this involves the process of reducing the overall weight of the aircraft, its components and materials, primarily through the use of lighter materials and optimised designs to improve fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. There are a number of different methods of lightweighting, which include lighter weight paint, aircraft seating, galleys, and flooring.

Despite the topic of sustainable aviation gaining significant traction in the media, it is clear that an important segment within sustainability – cabin interiors – is going underrepresented in the news. The aircraft interiors industry is tackling the challenge of sustainability in a variety of ways, which are not being reported on in any great detail in the mainstream national or business media. However, these solutions are being invested in, and they are helping to drive the future of aviation through the medium of sustainable interiors.

Accessibility in aviation: a growing imperative

For airlines, sustainability is not the only ethical concern that they must address. In recent years, discussions around inclusivity and accessibility in aviation have significantly intensified. This growing focus is driven by a greater awareness of the diverse needs of passengers and increasing pressure from a range of industry stakeholders, including affected passengers and their advocates.

Slowly but surely, this pressure is leading to change within the industry. This growing focus also aligns with the importance of the Conduct pillar in airline reputation – the second most important factor – as it underlines the significance of how airlines manage their relationships with passengers. Accessibility accounts for 1.2% of airline coverage, and 2% of social media posts.

Airlines are increasingly recognising that accessibility is a crucial factor, intrinsically linked to their conduct. There is a growing demand for airlines to adapt and innovate to meet the evolving expectations of all passengers, including those with physical disabilities, limited mobility, non-visible disabilities, and neurodiverse differences. This is driving investment in training, infrastructure and technology, to ensure a more equitable and comfortable travel experience, demonstrating a commitment to treating all passengers with fairness and respect.

But what does the media landscape look like around accessibility in aviation? Exploring the data for sentiment around accessibility news coverage, we can see that differs significantly from sustainability, with the vast majority of articles having a neutral sentiment:

Neutral coverage accounted for 61%

Positive coverage accounted for 30%

Negative coverage accounted for 9%

In terms of geographical distribution, Carma’s data found that (out of the countries analysed) the top five countries for accessibility coverage included:

UK coverage accounted for 43%

US coverage accounted for 37%

United Arab Emirates coverage accounted for 11%

French coverage accounted for 6%

Saudi Arabian coverage accounted for 3%

According to data from the Carma platform, the biggest spike in reporting was on the 26th September, as major airline, Virgin Atlantic, announced it would be stepping up its efforts to help deaf and hard-of-hearing travellers, with initiatives including special training for more of its crew.

The story was widely reported across UK publications – with 197 total articles on this in a single day. An important factor in the widespread coverage can likely be attributed to the airline partnering with deaf Gladiators star Jodie Ounsley, and deaf twins and content creators, Hermon and Heroda Berhane.

This collaboration not only put a human face to the airline’s accessibility initiatives, but also amplified the message through the reach and influence of these popular public figures, demonstrating the positive impact of working closely with disabled people, and ensuring greater visibility for the story.

While Virgin’s story gained the greatest traction in the media, there were a number of other stories less widely reported, which shared important updates on the state of accessibility in the airline industry. It is worth noting that the stories around airline accessibility for passengers with physical disabilities or limited mobility were generally more widely covered than the stories discussing accessible changes for neurodiverse passengers or those with invisible disabilities. Another point to observe is that these stories were picked up largely by the aviation and aircraft interiors trade media, as opposed to the national or business media.

Additional coverage on the topic of accessibility included:

The news that Delta Flight Products (DFP), in collaboration with AirForAll – a consortium of design and disability advocate organisations based in the UK – announced the launch of several new accessibility-focus products for the airline industry; including seating systems that allow users to remain in their own wheelchair for the entire journey, and an accessible toilet that accommodates an onboard wheelchair and up to two attendants.

United Airlines announced its collaboration with the United Spinal Association. The partnership was focused on improving the travel experience for customers with disabilities. The airline will be working together with United Spinal to explore future solutions and collaborate with its community of experts to harness their valuable feedback and help better meet the specific needs of customers who use wheelchairs.

In January 2025, Emirates announced it was set to be ‘the world’s first Autism Certified Airline’. Formally awarded by the International Board of Credentialing and Continuing Education Standards (IBCCES), in practice this means over 30,000 staff will be undergoing specialised autism and sensory awareness training. The airline will also be introducing ‘sensory guides’ and sensory products for neurodiverse passengers.

At the end of 2024, Alaska Airlines reported its improved practices for enhanced accessibility for travellers. The airline’s Disability Office teamed up with the Autism Society and port authorities to host a disability practice flight in Portland. The event gave guests with disabilities the chance to practice everything from navigating the airport, to going through security and even simulating a flight.

Reports of crews damaging passengers’ wheelchairs, and other similar issues, was another key theme in accessibility coverage. Again, it is worth noting that these stories were covered by UK national media, as opposed to trade titles. For instance:

20 February: Furious passenger blasts American Airlines and Delta after TWO wheelchairs were damaged and destroyed during separate trips in the same year.

01 May: ‘Degraded’ wheelchair user, 15, forced to shuffle up plane stairs and British Airways lost specialist chair.

29 September: Disabled traveller left ‘housebound’ for months after airline error.

04 December: Gatwick: Holiday ‘ruined’ after wheelchair broke on EasyJet plane.

Notably, Paralyzed Veterans of America’s response to a US Department of Transportation fine against American Airlines for its “unsafe and undignified treatment of passengers with disabilities who use mobility devices” accounted for 81% of the negative news coverage on this topic.

Other incidents also garnered significant coverage. In April, Southwest Airlines received substantial attention for poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs on flights. The issue stemmed from a lack of communication, leading to the wheelchairs being disassembled despite the passengers’ requests, and then being presented to them in pieces at the end of the flight.

Notably, the coverage around wheelchairs specifically, as opposed to general accessibility articles, was far more negative than the average data set. For social media articles mentioning airlines and wheelchairs, the sentiment was as follows:

Negative coverage accounted for 49%

Neutral coverage accounted for 27%

Positive coverage accounted for 24%

Meanwhile, the majority of the corresponding news coverage mentioning wheelchairs was neutral, due to comments from spokespeople balancing out the overall sentiment of the articles. For example, in the case of Southwest Airlines, when the airline was accused of poorly handling athletes’ wheelchairs, the company’s statement effectively denied the charge.

While social media coverage of the incident may have been negative, the inclusion of the airline’s response in news articles contributed to a more neutral sentiment overall. This demonstrates how airline communication can influence the tone of media reports, even when the initial incident generates negative public reaction.

But what does all this media coverage really tell us? While in comparison to other topics, accessibility isn’t proving to have cut through the ‘noise’ of the media in the same way, it seems that the impact of a negative story – particularly when discussed on social media – can attract significant attention and potentially be hugely impactful to airline reputation.

When faced with negative accessibility coverage, airlines need to do more than just react. The data indicates that a crucial element of effective reputation management is proactively ensuring the inclusion of company spokespeople in media reports. This allows airlines to actively participate in shaping the narrative.

Therefore, airlines should adopt a proactive communication strategy that prioritises the inclusion of their spokespeople in accessibility-related reporting. By providing spokespeople to offer context, address concerns, and articulate the airline’s position, they can exert greater control over the narrative and mitigate the potential damage of negative coverage.

Maksim Jurkov, head of design at aviation innovator, J&C Aero, explains that when it comes to accessibility, regulations play an important role. He highlights the ‘FAA DOT requirements (14 CFR 382.65)’, which demand “Non-discrimination on the basis of disability in air travel” and that “the industry needs to transport persons with reduced mobility (PRM) while maintaining a reasonable level of accessibility during the flight phase.”

He adds, “The key industry players are actively working on accessibility for both linefit and retrofit programmes. Accessibility for persons with limitations on an aeroplane is a must, not an option, as it ensures safety, dignity, and equal opportunity for all travellers – for example, having accessible restrooms and boarding assistance allows everyone to travel independently and comfortably. Without it, people are unfairly excluded and face unnecessary risks or barriers.”

While regulations are essential, accessibility in aircraft interiors is more than just a requirement. It is a commitment to all passengers and to creating a truly inclusive flying experience for everyone on board.

Conclusion

This review of airline reputation sets out a roadmap for airlines, identifying the six key pillars on which an airline reputation is built. By focusing on each pillar of the reputation methodology, and the strategic adjustments that can be made within each area, airlines can significantly improve their overall reputation.

It is clear that there will be opportunities to gain a competitive advantage over competitors by focusing on sustainability initiatives – particularly by implementing those in the cabin, as reputation is largely driven by the Products and Services pillar.

By investing in innovative solutions that transform the cabin, airlines will be able to further strengthen their reputation, not only through products and service offerings, but through the creation of a collective vision which positions the airlines as leaders in responsible air travel.

Though accessibility is not an individual element within the six pillars of the ‘Reputation by Carma’ report, it does play an important role in the conduct pillar. Not to mention, as more and more accessible aircraft interior solutions enter the market, it’s becoming a growing priority for airlines.

There’s also an increasing amount of media coverage and social media discussion around the topic. By using the media to their advantage, airlines can improve their reputation through the spotlighting of accessible interiors solutions.

The data highlighted in this report illustrates an ecosystem of conversations around sustainability and accessibility in the traditional media and on social media. While neither topic may be dominating the media in the same way that some other aviation topics are, it is clear that the impact of these stories can be significant in affecting consumer views and perceptions.

Moving forward, airlines must recognise that sustainability and accessibility are about more than just compliance and instead are fundamental aspects of building trust and maintaining a positive reputation in an increasingly conscious and connected world.",https://s44875.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/airline-reputation-media.png.webp,N,,2025-04-24 09:56:29.319183

Headquartered in Taiwan, EVA Air operates a fleet of more than 80 Boeing and Airbus across its global network of around 60 destinations. The carrier has been operating all its flights departing from Europe with a 2% SAF blend since the first quarter of this year in line with the European Union’s (EU) SAF supply policy. It’s new agreements with the three international fuel suppliers will see EVA regularly uplift SAF at key hubs in North America, Japan and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of the year.

Describing sustainability as a responsibility and not just a choice, EVA Air president, Clay Sun, said the bilateral collaborations with the fuel suppliers underpin the airline’s commitment to net-zero emissions. “By actively introducing SAF across our global network, we are reducing our operational carbon footprint and fostering transformation and growth throughout the aviation supply chain.”

CAA’s pilot to encourage SAF refuellings for domestic carriers

The three new agreements also follow EVA Air’s introduction of domestically produced SAF on 23 April as part of Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) pilot programme for SAF usage. Although no SAF mandate is in place yet, the CAA is encouraging airlines to use up to 5% SAF from 2030. The pilot saw three domestic carriers across the country refuel with a SAF blend. State-owned CPC Corporation imported 400 metric tonnes of SAF, and Formosa Petrochemical produced 5,500 tonnes of the renewable fuels so far this year for the operation. The SAF was supplied to Kaohsiung, Songshan and Taoyuan airports, with China Airlines and Starlux also refuelling with the SAF blend.

EVA Air has announced the signing of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement agreements with three major suppliers: Associated Energy Group, LLC (AEG FUELS) from the United States, COSMO Oil Marketing Co., Ltd. (COSMO) from Japan, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation from Taiwan.

Clay Sun, EVA Air resident said: “Today, sustainable development is not just a choice—it is a responsibility.

“Our bilateral collaborations with AEG FUELS, COSMO, and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation reflect our commitment to net-zero emissions.

“By actively introducing SAF across our global network, we are reducing our operational carbon footprint and fostering transformation and growth throughout the aviation supply chain.”

As the world moves toward the shared goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, SAF is regarded as one of the aviation industry’s most promising solutions for carbon reduction.

EVA Air is in compliance with the European Union’s (EU) SAF supply policy, and all flights departing from Europe have been operating with a 2% SAF blend since the first quarter of this year.

The new agreements mark the next phase of EVA Air’s sustainability journey, as it will independently and regularly begin SAF integration at key hubs in North America, Japan and Taiwan starting in the second quarter of 2025.

These actions aim to substantially lower flight emissions and lay the foundation for broader SAF adoption in the future.

EVA Air is partnering with three major suppliers. AEG FUELS is a globally recognised aviation fuel provider with an extensive and reliable international logistics network.

COSMO, one of Japan’s leading energy companies, will supply SAF in the Kansai area, where the Osaka-Kansai Japan Expo will be held until October 13, 2025.

Formosa Petrochemical Corporation is the first company in Taiwan to supply SAF produced in-house, reinforcing local supply chain resilience.

These collaborations are strengthening EVA Air’s fuel supply flexibility, expanding SAF adoption across the Asia-Pacific region, and accelerating the sustainable transition of aviation fuel in the region.

As a significant milestone in advancing SAF adoption, EVA Air successfully introduced domestically produced SAF on April 23, 2025, as part of the Civil Aviation Administration’s pilot programme for SAF usage.

It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity.","Having acquired AGS Airports, which operates Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton Airports in January, AviAlliance has confirmed a £350 million investment in the sustainable growth of the three UK airports.

AviAlliance, a wholly owned subsidiary of one of Canada’s largest pension investors – PSP Investments, completed the £1.53 billion acquisition of the airport group earlier this year and on Wednesday outlined plans of what will be the single largest capital investment programme in AGS since it was formed in 2014.

Airport transformation

Plans to accelerate the decarbonisation and future growth of the three regional airports include a comprehensive transformation of Glasgow Airport’s main terminal building to accommodate anticipated passenger growth and improve operational and retail facilities, as well as upgrades to airfield infrastructure and energy efficiency initiatives.

Meanwhile, Southampton Airport, which underwent a 164-m runway extension in 2023 will now also undergo redevelopment works within its terminal. Aberdeen Airport, which is also home to Europe’s largest heliport primarily for the offshore industry transporting passengers and cargo between the Scottish hub and oil rigs in the North Sea, will also benefit from improvements to its airfield infrastructure.

Boos for trade and tourism

Underlining the critical role that AGS plays in driving economic and social prosperity across Scotland and the UK, Kam Jandu AGS Airports CEO explained the investment will help facilitate the accelerated growth of AGS which supports more than 30,000 jobs and generates in excess of £2 billion in Gross Value Added (GVA) for the UK economy every year. Jandu, who was formerly CEO of Budapest Airport where he worked for 15 years, was named CEO of the airport group when AviAlliance completed its acquisition in January.

“We have ambitious plans for the long-term sustainable growth of our airports including the strengthening of our connectivity, which underpins the success of the regions we serve,” he said. “This significant investment will not only enhance the fabric of our airports, it will enhance the role they currently play in facilitating trade and tourism, and importantly in generating meaningful employment across the country.”

Jandu also welcomed Charles Hammond OBE as the new Chair of AGS. A qualified lawyer, Hammond was previously Chief Executive of Forth Ports, in which AviAlliance is also a majority stakeholder. Hammond revealed he is “relishing the opportunity of working with the AGS board, to ensure AGS can play an even greater role in supporting our regions to boost trade and tourism.”

Sustainable growth

Deputy First Minister of Scotland, Kate Forbes (pictured with Kam Jandu) reinforced that the investment will bring huge benefits to the wider economy through improved infrastructure. “Good international connectivity is key to economic growth in Scotland. It enables flow of trade, investment, labour and tourism, which will contribute to our prosperity. Additionally, the commitment to sustainability is welcome as we progress towards a net zero future.”

All three airports achieved carbon neutrality status on the Airport Carbon Accreditation initiative for the emissions under their direct control (Scopes 1 and 2) in 2020. The aim is to achieve net zero carbon for indirect emission by the mid-2030s through the decarbonisation of cars and public transport, the deployment of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and aircraft fuel efficiency programmes, as well as the decarbonisation of third part owned and operated operational vehicles and the deployment of fixed electric ground power and electric tugs to replace aircraft taxiing. The group’s sustainability strategy is based on three pillars: achieving net zero by the mid-2030s; supporting and enhancing the economic and social benefits of the communities each airport serves; and supporting its staff through providing good employment conditions, respecting diversity and equal opportunities for all staff.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kam-Jandu-and-Kate-Forbes-at-Glasgow-Airport-.jpg,N,,2025-04-24 07:56:44.204441

This announcement was made during a feasibility study workshop on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), held in Entebbe. The event was organized by UCAA in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), with support from the Government of the United Kingdom.

According to the United States Department of Energy, SAF is a renewable jet fuel that significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional jet fuel. Its adoption is aimed at enhancing environmental protection and mitigating aviation’s contribution to climate change.

SAF is produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oil, plant oils, agricultural residue, and captured carbon dioxide. It is typically blended with traditional fossil jet fuel, with the blending ratio influenced by availability and cost considerations—given the high production costs of SAF when used on its own.

The global aviation industry is pursuing the goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF seen as a cornerstone of that transition. ICAO reports that over 360,000 commercial flights have already utilized SAF at 46 airports globally, mainly in the United States and Europe.

While aviation currently accounts for approximately 2% of global CO₂ emissions—and 12% of emissions from the transport sector—SAF has the potential to cut carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional fuels.

In his opening address at the workshop, UCAA Director General Fred K. Bamwesigye reaffirmed Uganda’s commitment to the global net-zero emissions target by 2050. He emphasized the country’s proactive role in supporting ICAO’s environmental agenda, particularly through the promotion of SAF and cleaner energy alternatives.

The workshop brought together stakeholders from the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, airline operators, fuel suppliers, and academic institutions. Its objective was to assess Uganda’s capacity to produce and integrate SAF into its aviation framework.

“This initiative offers tremendous potential—not only to improve environmental sustainability but also to generate socio-economic benefits throughout the country,” Bamwesigye noted.

Speaking at the recent Uganda-UK Trade and Business Forum in Kampala, UK High Commissioner to Uganda Lisa Chesney stressed the importance of SAF compliance as Uganda Airlines expands into European airspace. She highlighted the European Union’s SAF mandate, known as ReFuelEU Aviation, which requires airlines to incorporate SAF into 2% of their fuel use by 2025, increasing to 70% by 2050.

This regulation is central to the EU’s broader climate goals of reducing aviation-related emissions.

Uganda Airlines CEO Jennifer Bamuturaki assured stakeholders that the airline is prepared to meet these sustainability requirements. She noted that the London route, in particular, will be served by one of the most modern aircraft with minimal emissions, in line with international airport standards.",https://govinfohub.go.ug/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2-1.png,N,,2025-04-24 05:56:12.914497
,,2025-04-24 07:00:59+00:00,www.farmprogress.com,Corn-based sustainable aviation fuel: New market for Illinois farmers - Farm Progress,Ava Splear,,,,,https://www.farmprogress.com/corn/corn-based-sustainable-aviation-fuel-emerges-as-promising-market-for-illinois-farmers,"New market: Sustainable aviation fuel According to IL Corn, about 30% of corn grown in Illinois, or 657 million bushels, is used for ethanol production annually.
As a pilot himself, Gould says farmers need to watch what’s coming down the pipeline for sustainable aviation fuel.
At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030.
“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.
As a potential replacement for the 30 billion-gallon-a-year U.S. jet fuel market, SAF “could be a large opportunity for our domestic feedstocks,” Stotler says.","What if you could grow corn, drive a truck powered by ethanol and fly a plane with corn-based fuel? For Maple Park, Ill., farmer and FedEx pilot Chris Gould, that could actually happen.

“It would be cool to be burning the product I’m growing,” says Gould, who also serves as an Illinois Corn Growers Association director.

The possibility is not far off, he says, pointing to several new developments in legislation, facilities, company pledges and sustainability goals that are driving change in corn’s future as a renewable energy source. Farming — and flying — from the heart of the Corn Belt, Gould has a front-row seat.

Changes to E15 legislation

Earlier this year, U.S. EPA announced that E15 will be available year-round for seven states — Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota and Wisconsin — starting April 28. Prior to this, EPA had to issue a waiver for pumps in those states to offer E15 from June through September.

Gould says year-round availability for E15 in seven states is helpful for an increase in corn demand, but nationwide access to E15 year-round would have a much larger impact.

“Any increased demand is good,” Gould says.

In Congress, a bill exists called the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025, which would allow year-round access to E15 nationwide. According to IL Corn, if passed, this bill would equate to an additional 133 million bushels of corn demand for U.S. farmers.

Legislation for year-round availability is ideal, and Gould is optimistic that the change can happen because E15 has bipartisan support.

E15 previously required a waiver to be sold during summer months because it doesn’t meet Reid Vapor Pressure requirements under the Clean Air Act. Ethanol emissions increase during the summer months due to higher temperatures. According to the Congressional Research Service, seven consecutive fuel waivers have been signed, meaning that E15 has been available year-round for the last seven years in those seven states.

This change in legislation is in stark contrast to the electric vehicle mandates prioritized under the Biden administration. According to EPA, one previous proposal projected that electric vehicles would make up 67% of newly manufactured light-duty vehicles and 46% of medium-duty vehicles by 2032.

New market: Sustainable aviation fuel

According to IL Corn, about 30% of corn grown in Illinois, or 657 million bushels, is used for ethanol production annually. Ethanol is an established market for corn, and new ways to use ethanol continue to develop. As a pilot himself, Gould says farmers need to watch what’s coming down the pipeline for sustainable aviation fuel.

“Sustainable aviation fuel has the potential to be a massive market for corn,” Gould says, explaining that SAF can’t compete in the short term with petroleum jet fuel because it’s more expensive and its production is inefficient. It takes about 1.6 gallons of ethanol to produce 1 gallon of SAF. However, with time and continued research to build the SAF industry, eventually it will become more competitive and beneficial to corn farmers.

Still, it is possible to use SAF as a jet fuel alternative now. In the European Union, there are already mandates in place for using SAF in small quantities.

The global airline industry burns 100 billion gallons of jet fuel each year, and the U.S. accounts for 30% of that, or nearly 30 billion gallons. According to IL Corn, SAF has the potential to be a 30 billion-gallon-per-year market in the U.S., if petroleum jet fuel is replaced with the sustainable fuel.

At the Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Beyond Conference in March, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines both pledged to replace 10% of their fuel usage with SAF by 2030. For American Airlines, this means it would need 400 million gallons of SAF to reach the pledged 10% in a single year.

And United Airlines? The company pledges to be net-zero by 2050, which means using all SAF. According to United, the SAF it uses “has up to 85% lower greenhouse gas emissions than regular jet fuel.”

Many airline companies have made ambitious pledges to take steps to meet sustainability goals by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Even with these pledges, it will take time to establish the infrastructure, legislation, supply chain and growing practices required to meet them.

Gould says more production plants will be required to meet the demand for these pledges.

“There are a couple technologies right now that are being developed to commercialize the production of sustainable aviation fuel,” says Brad Stotler, director of government affairs at IL Corn.

One of these technologies is refiners turning renewable diesel fuels made from vegetable oil into SAF. Another technology takes ethanol products made with low carbon-intensity practices and turns them into SAF, also known as Alcohol-to-Jet.

Although corn is one of the major sources of renewable feedstocks used for SAF, other sources include waste fats, greases and oils.

SAF finds home in Illinois

Stotler says Illinois is poised to be a leader in the SAF industry as it grows. According to Gould and Stotler, Illinois makes a good spot to house this new industry because of the large supply of corn and a strong transportation infrastructure, including nine international airports and all Class I railroads touching the state. In addition, a large amount of research is conducted at educational institutions across the state, and a tax credit in Illinois makes it more economically feasible.

“We have existing refiners and other companies looking to locate near our ethanol industry to produce sustainable aviation fuel product,” Stotler says.

Look no further than this list of companies that have announced plans to build SAF plants in Illinois:

Both Marquis Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Avina Clean Hydrogen project they’ll produce up to 120 million gallons of SAF at each of their facilities annually.

Although SAF likely will be a large market in the long term, many logistics still must be figured out, such as what practices will need to be implemented during corn production for it to qualify for use in SAF.

“The scope of the potential market is large,” Stotler says, noting that the Renewable Fuel Standard is 20-some billion gallons. When the RFS was passed in 2007, the demand for ethanol increased and corn prices boomed. As a potential replacement for the 30 billion-gallon-a-year U.S. jet fuel market, SAF “could be a large opportunity for our domestic feedstocks,” Stotler says.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltdd43779342bd9107/blt3c3e1109f78fc2f8/68091f8ae2bc460c8eb1d754/0421W1-3241a-1800x1012.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-04-24 03:56:17.213255

The occasion was the presentation of its future plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Under the title ""Flying Towards Net Zero,"" the company presented an ambitious roadmap based on five key pillars. The airline, which describes itself as a pioneer in European air transport, sees itself not only as a trailblazer but also as a warning voice.

The international aviation industry had already agreed years ago to become climate-neutral by 2050, as part of the goals of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). However, according to Wizz Air, there is currently little sign of this goal. On the contrary: progress in reducing emissions has stalled. According to the company, this is primarily due to the slow industrial development and availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is considered a key technology for a lower-emission future.

""Everyone talks about SAF as the most promising way to reduce emissions, but the truth is: there simply isn't enough of it. And what is available is far too expensive,"" explained Yvonne Moynihan, ESG and Corporate Responsibility Officer at Wizz Air. The industry's expectations were based on an overly optimistic assessment of production capacity.

The five pillars of the roadmap

Wizz Air bases its “Net Zero” plan on five concrete measures:

53 percent emission reduction through SAF

The greatest contribution is to be achieved through the use of sustainable aviation fuel. However, the company believes this will require a massive expansion of production infrastructure and targeted government support.

21 percent through technological innovations

According to the plan, advances in aircraft and engine development should also contribute to emissions reduction. A particular focus is on more efficient turbines and aerodynamically improved fuselage designs.

7 percent through fleet renewal

The continuous modernization of the company's own fleet, for example by replacing older models with the more fuel-efficient Airbus A321neo, is another component of the concept.

4 percent through air traffic management reforms

According to Wizz Air, more efficient flight routing and better coordination in European airspace could also save a significant amount of emissions.

2 percent through operational optimizations

These include measures such as reduced ground running times, optimized loading and maintenance improvements.

Investments and strategic partnerships

To enable the planned use of SAF, Wizz Air has already entered into long-term partnerships. These include an agreement with the British company Firefly Green Fuels, which intends to build a production facility in Essex. Wizz Air will source up to 15 tons of SAF from this facility over 525.000 years. A partnership also exists with the Finnish producer Neste, which is expected to supply 36.000 tons annually.

These contracts demonstrate that Wizz Air is willing to make advance payments. However, the tone of the event was that one airline alone cannot handle this transformation.

European regulation under fire

A central point of criticism for the company is directed at current European regulatory policy. It argues that this policy places a significant financial burden on airlines and prevents necessary innovations through excessive bureaucracy. Wizz Air is therefore calling on governments and regulators to fundamentally reform the framework.

""We no longer need fine-sounding declarations of intent. It's time to act. Politicians must understand that the future of aviation will be secured not through regulations, but through targeted support,"" Moynihan emphasized.

Fleet policy with vision

In 2023, Wizz Air put a total of 32 new Airbus A321neo aircraft into service – aircraft that are not only more modern but also more fuel-efficient. Thanks to these investments, the company was able to reduce average emissions per passenger kilometer to 51,5 grams, a decrease of almost seven percent compared to the previous year.

The Airbus A321neo is considered one of the most efficient aircraft in its class, offering significantly improved fuel efficiency while maintaining passenger capacity. Further progress is expected in conjunction with capacity optimization and digital planning tools.

Criticism from the industry

However, Wizz Air's ambitious plans are not universally welcomed. Some competitors accuse the company of making exaggerated promises to distract from current challenges. Industry insiders also warn that technological innovations alone will not be enough as long as air traffic continues to grow.

Nevertheless, Wizz Air's commitment is generally considered groundbreaking. The willingness to take responsibility and the attempt to initiate the debate with concrete measures are recognized.",https://i0.wp.com/aviation.direct/wp-content/uploads/12_WizzUK.jpg?fit=900%2C1200&ssl=1,N,,2025-04-24 09:57:36.007935

MARKET DRIVERS

Regulatory Support and Environmental Policies

Stringent environmental policies and regulatory frameworks are primary drivers of the renewable diesel market in North America. Governments across the region have implemented mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote cleaner energy alternatives. For instance, the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program, as per the EPA, mandates the blending of 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels into transportation fuels annually by 2025, with renewable diesel being a key contributor. Similarly, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) provides financial incentives for low-carbon fuels, driving demand for renewable diesel. These policies not only incentivize production but also encourage end-users, such as fleet operators and airlines, to adopt renewable diesel.

Growing Demand for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

Another significant driver is the increasing demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), a segment where renewable diesel plays a crucial role. As per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the aviation industry aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, with SAF accounting for 65% of the required emission reductions. Renewable diesel, often referred to as “drop-in” fuel, can be blended with conventional jet fuel without requiring modifications to existing infrastructure or aircraft engines.

MARKET RESTRAINTS

High Production Costs and Feedstock Availability

One of the primary restraints impeding the growth of the renewable diesel market is the high production costs associated with feedstock procurement and processing. According to a study by BloombergNEF, the cost of producing renewable diesel can be up to 30% higher than conventional diesel due to the reliance on premium feedstocks like vegetable oils and waste fats. The availability of these feedstocks is also a concern, as per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which reports that the supply of waste oils and animal fats is insufficient to meet the growing demand. Vegetable oils, while abundant, face competition from the food industry is leading to price volatility.

Infrastructure Limitations

Another significant restraint is the lack of adequate infrastructure to support widespread adoption of renewable diesel. Existing refineries and distribution networks are predominantly designed for conventional fossil fuels by necessitating substantial investments to accommodate renewable diesel. Additionally, the distribution network for renewable diesel remains underdeveloped in rural areas by limiting accessibility for end-users. As per a study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, less than 10% of fueling stations in the U.S. currently offer renewable diesel by creating logistical challenges for fleet operators and consumers.

MARKET OPPORTUNITIES

Expansion in Marine and Heavy-Duty Transportation

The marine and heavy-duty transportation sectors present significant opportunities for the renewable diesel market in North America. These industries are under increasing pressure to reduce carbon emissions by making renewable diesel an attractive alternative to conventional fuels. According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the shipping industry must reduce its carbon intensity by 40% by 2030 by driving demand for cleaner fuels. Renewable diesel, with its compatibility with existing engines and ability to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, is well-positioned to meet this demand. In 2022, Maersk announced a partnership with Neste to procure renewable diesel for its fleet, with the growing interest in sustainable maritime fuels. Similarly, heavy-duty trucking companies, such as Ryder System, are transitioning to renewable diesel to comply with state-level regulations like California’s LCFS.

Technological Advancements in Feedstock Diversification

Advancements in feedstock diversification represent another promising opportunity for the renewable diesel market. Researchers are exploring alternative feedstocks, such as algae and municipal solid waste, to address the limitations of traditional sources like vegetable oils and waste fats. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Energy, algae-based biofuels have the potential to replace up to 17% of U.S. imported oil by offering a sustainable and scalable solution. Additionally, startups like LanzaTech are developing technologies to convert industrial carbon emissions into renewable diesel by aligning with circular economy principles. A study by Lux Research estimates that advanced feedstocks could account for 30% of renewable diesel production by 2030 by reducing reliance on conventional feedstocks.

MARKET CHALLENGES

Competition from Electric Vehicles (EVs)

One of the foremost challenges facing the renewable diesel market is the growing competition from electric vehicles (EVs). The rapid adoption of EVs, driven by government incentives and advancements in battery technology, poses a threat to the long-term demand for renewable diesel. This shift is particularly evident in the passenger vehicle segment, where EVs are increasingly seen as a zero-emission alternative to internal combustion engines. The declining demand for liquid fuels in the passenger vehicle market could impact overall market growth.

Policy Uncertainty and Market Volatility

Another significant challenge is the uncertainty surrounding policy frameworks and market volatility. The changes in government priorities or shifts in political dominance could undermine these programs, while current regulations like the RFS and LCFS provide strong incentives for renewable diesel. According to the Congressional Budget Office, proposed amendments to the RFS program could reduce blending mandates by up to 20% by impacting demand for renewable diesel. Additionally, market volatility, driven by fluctuating feedstock prices and geopolitical tensions that creates financial risks for producers.

Wizz Air has unveiled a bold £12 billion net-zero roadmap aimed at drastically cutting carbon emissions across Europe by 2050. Central to this strategy is a 53% reduction in emissions through the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), alongside the deployment of one of the continent’s youngest and most fuel-efficient fleets, including the Airbus A321neo. This comprehensive initiative, titled Flying Towards Net-Zero, marks a major leap forward in sustainable air travel, reinforcing Wizz Air’s leadership in green aviation and its commitment to reshaping the future of European skies through innovation, investment, and environmental responsibility.

Wizz Air, recognised as EMEA’s most environmentally sustainable airline*, has launched its ambitious and detailed net-zero roadmap, titled Flying Towards Net-Zero, in a bold move to transform the European aviation sector. Backed by a £12 billion investment, the strategy focuses on three primary levers—Flights, Fuel, and Footprint—and offers a clear, data-driven path to decarbonisation. This comprehensive initiative responds to the urgent climate crisis and addresses the rising financial and regulatory pressures facing aviation. By investing in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), modern aircraft, and operational efficiency, Wizz Air not only reinforces its environmental commitment but also ensures long-term resilience and competitiveness across Europe’s skies.

Wizz Air Commits £12 Billion to Power the Future of Sustainable Aviation

The net-zero roadmap is a pillar of Wizz Air’s broader Customer First Compass initiative, representing one of the largest financial commitments made by a European low-cost airline toward sustainable aviation. With £12 billion allocated for fleet upgrades, SAF production, and digital optimisation tools, Wizz Air is positioning itself as a frontrunner in green innovation.

This comes at a time when climate ambitions across the aviation industry appear to be veering off course. With rising carbon regulations and stagnation in SAF availability and adoption, Wizz Air’s strategy realigns the sector’s trajectory toward realistic and immediate impact.

A Manifesto Built on Five Decarbonisation Pillars

At the core of Flying Towards Net-Zero are five strategic pillars that clearly outline how Wizz Air will reduce emissions in line with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)’s net-zero by 2050 goal:

53% emissions reduction through increased use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)

21% via aircraft and engine innovation

7% from fleet renewal

4% through air traffic reform

2% from operational efficiencies and AI-based optimisation

This approach contrasts with airlines that heavily depend on carbon offsetting or speculative technologies. Instead, Wizz Air doubles down on proven, scalable solutions that can deliver tangible results within the decade.

Flights: Advancing Aviation Innovation with the Airbus A321neo

Wizz Air boasts the youngest and most fuel-efficient fleet in Europe, with a strong focus on the advanced Airbus A321neo as the backbone of its operations. These next-generation aircraft offer significant environmental advantages, including a 20% reduction in fuel consumption and up to 50% quieter engine performance compared to previous-generation models, reinforcing the airline’s commitment to cleaner, quieter, and more efficient air travel.

As part of its roadmap, Wizz Air aims to cut per-passenger emissions by 25% by 2030—a goal it is on track to meet through continuous investment in next-gen aircraft. However, reaching deeper levels of decarbonisation requires regulatory support for SAF-ready technologies and aircraft that can accommodate blends beyond the current 50% SAF limit.

Wizz Air is urging the aviation industry to accelerate innovation timelines and calls upon European policymakers to approve and fund research that fast-tracks technological readiness.

Fuel: Scaling SAF Production with Urgent Government Support

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plays a central role in Wizz Air’s decarbonisation strategy, accounting for the majority share of its projected carbon emissions cuts. But current global SAF production covers less than 1% of total aviation fuel demand. For SAF to deliver climate benefits at scale, production must ramp up tenfold by the early 2030s.

Wizz Air has taken a proactive role by investing in emerging SAF technologies, entering equity partnerships, and securing future offtake agreements. Still, it warns that government intervention is essential to make SAF affordable for low-cost carriers.

The airline advocates for a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan and SAF incentive frameworks that include tax breaks, guaranteed purchase agreements, and infrastructure grants to close the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

Footprint: Fixing Europe’s Broken Airspace

Air traffic inefficiencies are responsible for millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions each year. The fragmented airspace over Europe forces aircraft to take indirect routes, waste fuel, and suffer from delays. Reform in this area has lagged for decades.

Wizz Air is pushing for urgent reform in European air traffic management (ATM) and full implementation of the Single European Sky initiative. This alone could yield a 10% reduction in emissions across the continent.

Already, Wizz Air is deploying AI-powered tools to optimise route planning, reduce holding patterns, and improve turnaround times. But the airline argues that without cross-border ATM cooperation and regulatory overhaul, the aviation industry will fall short of its climate goals.

A Strategic Necessity, Not Just an Environmental Ideal

Wizz Air’s path to net-zero is far more than an environmental initiative—it’s a calculated move to address pressing business challenges. As climate regulations become more stringent and weather-related disruptions intensify, airlines that delay action risk financial consequences, loss of investor confidence, and damage to brand reputation.

By contrast, Wizz Air’s early mover advantage in green aviation enhances its brand value, investor confidence, and customer loyalty—especially among Gen Z and Millennial travellers who prioritise sustainable brands.

This strategy also improves operational resilience by future-proofing the airline against volatility in fossil fuel markets and aligning with the broader European Green Deal objectives.

Customer First Compass: Sustainability Meets Experience

Wizz Air’s Customer First Compass is a larger framework that goes beyond environmental targets to deliver value, convenience, and ethics across the travel journey. Sustainability is embedded at every customer touchpoint—from booking to disembarkation.

Examples include:

Eco-conscious digital check-in processes

Fuel-efficient aircraft scheduling

Transparent carbon footprint calculators

Inspiring travelers to support eco-friendly initiatives by redeeming their loyalty points for sustainability-focused projects.

The net-zero roadmap sits at the heart of this initiative, reflecting a belief that responsible travel and profitability can go hand-in-hand.

Call to Action for Governments, Industry, and Travellers

Wizz Air has taken a strong first step, but the success of Flying Towards Net-Zero hinges on collective industry action and political will. The airline urges:

Governments to introduce clear SAF mandates, subsidies, and infrastructure development plans.

Airspace regulators to implement the Single European Sky reforms and adopt AI-driven ATM.

Passengers to support sustainable travel by choosing airlines with concrete climate plans.

With all stakeholders aligned, the European aviation sector can become a global beacon for green air travel.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate and ESG Officer, said: “Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net-zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.

“Achieving a net-zero roadmap is fraught with uncertainties. The most significant challenges extend beyond scientific issues and encompass policy decisions, investment strategies, market dynamics, and the timely implementation of essential measures. Scientific advancements also encounter obstacles related to cost, infrastructure, and regulatory approval.

“We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net-zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.

“Flights. Fuel. Footprint. This is our commitment. This is our journey. This is how we fly towards net zero”.

Wizz Air has launched a £12 billion net-zero roadmap across Europe, aiming for greener skies by 2050 through 53% SAF emissions cuts and a modern Airbus A321neo fleet.

Conclusion: Leading EMEA Into a Clean-Skies Future

With its Flying Towards Net-Zero roadmap, Wizz Air has set a new gold standard for airline sustainability in Europe and beyond. By focusing on Flights, Fuel, and Footprint, and putting £12 billion behind its vision, the airline is tackling the climate crisis head-on while securing its competitive edge.

This roadmap proves that environmental responsibility and financial sustainability are not mutually exclusive. They are, in fact, mutually reinforcing.

Imagine smart cities, virtual reality, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles becoming even more integral in our daily lives. But here’s the unexpected part: liquid fuels like diesel and jet fuel will still be in high demand.

This may seem surprising, but it’s not. It’s a reflection of a sharp decrease in global poverty and global population growth.

Prosperity brings change

How much has global poverty decreased? According to the World Bank Group, it fell from 26.8% in 2002 to 9% two decades later.

This rise in prosperity has led to increased demand for the products ExxonMobil has been making for more than 150 years.

Add to that a growing population–about 25% more people in the world by 2050, by our estimates–and global energy demand is expected to rise even further.

With more people in more countries seeking access to transportation, the energy needed for transportation is expected to increase by more than 20%.

Gasoline demand is projected to fall, but liquid fuels will remain essential for the commercial transportation sector—particularly in countries across Africa and Asia, where the middle class is expanding every day

According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), petroleum liquids like diesel and jet fuel will continue to meet most transportation energy demands through 2050.

During that same time, the EIA also projects jet fuel demand to increase at a faster rate than any other liquid transportation fuel.

And right now, there’s no suitable replacement for liquid fuels.

The future of energy

In 2050, more people will be driving electric vehicles. But when it comes to powering those big diesel rigs, cargo ships and air carriers that crisscross time zones and continents, the energy density of diesel and jet fuel is tough to beat.

That’s where we step in.

No other international oil company matches our scale when it comes to chemicals, lubricants and fuels. Over 80% of our facilities are integrated, meaning our refining and petrochemical units are interconnected.

This unique setup allows us to adjust and reconfigure our assets to meet customer demands, by optimizing infrastructure and adding capacity as needed.

While we’re pioneering technology that helps reduce GHG emissions—like fast-charging battery materials, renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel—we’re also ensuring that heavy transport—on the ground, at sea and in the air—has the energy it needs to get people and goods where they need to go.

(Minnesota Pollution Control Agency) Forever Green Initiative continuing study of camelina’s suitability to make jet fuel -- Camelina is what’s considered an ancient crop, one that Europeans cultivated thousands of years ago. It’s also considered an orphan crop, displaced by other more successful oilseeds like canola. With a $75,000 grant from the MPCA, however, the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative intends to make it a crop of the future that will help Minnesota develop a sustainable aviation fuel industry.

“Minnesota has the right reasons to lead on sustainable aviation fuel: a track record of environmental leadership, smart tax incentives, and a strong infrastructure,” said MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler, chair of the Governor’s Climate Change Subcabinet. “The MPCA is proud to invest in research that will help Minnesota grow a sustainable aviation fuel industry on our own soil from the ground up.”

Growing interest in growing camelina

One of over 15 crops the Forever Green Initiative is developing — and one of dozens of potential sources of sustainable aviation fuel — winter camelina has already generated a good deal of interest among Minnesota’s farmers for two big reasons, according to Mitch Hunter, the co-director of the initiative.

One, its tiny seeds produce a relatively high amount of an oil that can be crushed into cooking oil or further refined and blended to create jet fuel. This resulting sustainable aviation fuel can be used in planes flying now without modifications, making it one of the highest-impact near-term strategies to cut emissions from the aviation sector. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, sustainable aviation fuel can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%.

Two, because it’s planted in the fall and harvested in the spring, hardy winter camelina makes for an excellent cover crop, one that provides farmers another source of revenue to supplement their income while protecting soil health and water quality. According to Hunter, camelina can reduce soil erosion by up to 80% and nitrate leaching by up to 90%.

As if all that weren’t enough, camelina blooms early in the spring, Hunter said, making it a resource for pollinators just waking up from their winter naps.

Camelina is on the first leg of its commercialization journey in Minnesota and the wider region.

“Farmers are already getting bags of seed and selling crops,” Hunter said. On-farm pilots of camelina have grown rapidly since the first was planted in 2021 — up to about 5,000 acres this year — and the first commercial flight fueled in part by camelina grown in Minnesota flew from MSP to La Guardia last September.

There’s still work to do before camelina takes off as a “cash cover crop,” as Hunter put it. He said if farmers across the region grow at least 1 million acres of camelina by 2035, the crop should have a steady flight path. To reach that goal, though, the Forever Green Initiative will need to “pull out all the stops” in terms of continued research, education and outreach, figuring out risk management for the crop, determining supply chain needs and regulatory barriers, and building market demand.

The MPCA grant will help the initiative create what Hunter called a “road map” to get to that million-acre goal.

“We are grateful that the State of Minnesota sees the potential of winter camelina to simultaneously help our farmers, environment, economy, and climate,"" Hunter said. “Minnesota is lucky to have partnerships across governments, businesses, academic institutions, and nonprofits that are driving Minnesota forward as a leader on sustainable aviation fuel.”

Scaling up sustainable aviation fuel

Sustainable aviation fuel remains in its infancy not just in Minnesota but in general. Of the billions of gallons of jet fuel the industry uses every year, about 25 million gallons — less than 0.1% — is considered sustainable. Burning those billions of gallons of jet fuel in air travel has a big impact on the planet: According to the U.S. Department of Energy, aviation accounts for 2-3% of all carbon dioxide emissions worldwide.

That’s one reason why Minnesota has taken steps to build its sustainable aviation fuel industry. In 2023, the state partnered with Greater MSP, the regional economic development partnership for Minneapolis and Saint Paul, to launch the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Hub, focused on scaling the industry up to meet its demands for sustainable aviation fuel.

Also in 2023, the state passed a tax credit of $1.50 per gallon for producers and blenders of sustainable aviation fuel. Gov. Tim Walz’s 2025 budget builds on that with a comprehensive SAF funding and policy package with an ask of $20 million over the next 10 years for tax credits that will promote SAF production in Minnesota.

The state is also focusing on a strategy of “recruit, review, and regulate” to build that sustainable aviation fuel industry.

Recruit: The state will attract SAF producers by providing regulatory clarity, aligning incentives, and working with supply chain and development partners to support industry growth.

Review: State agencies will assess potential SAF production proposals to weigh their climate benefits and ensure impacts on water, air, and soil quality are fully understood.

Regulate: Minnesota will create a clear and effective permitting process that ensures environmental protections and business transparency.

This strategy will inform a roadmap for the development of the sustainable aviation fuel industry that will guide state agencies and businesses. The roadmap is expected to be completed in 2025. READ MORE

Winter camelina, an oilseed crop in the same family as canola, could be a climate change problem solver, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.

The agency has announced that it will fund a $75,000 grant for the University of Minnesota’s Forever Green Initiative for an independent study on how the state can scale up to 1 million acres of winter camelina, MPCA commissioner Katrina Kessler said Tuesday at the university’s crop research fields in Falcon Heights.

“I think this is a great opportunity to support rural Minnesota, rural communities, farmers who want to innovate – and decarbonize the airline industry to help us meet our goals around getting to carbon neutral in 2050 as a state,” Kessler said.

What is SAF and how do crops help?

Sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, is fuel made from non-petroleum sources blended with traditional jet fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It can reduce aviation emissions by up to 94%, according to the MPCA.

Winter camelina has a high oil content and a low carbon intensity score, which makes it beneficial for sustainable aviation fuel, according to the MPCA. The crop also helps to improve soil health and water quality. Additionally, it can be used to create animal feed, food and bioplastic, according to Forever Green Initiative co-director Dr. Mitch Hunter.

“Right now, we don’t have a pipeline, so to speak, built to take on farm production and turn it into fuel,” Hunter said. “The study that we’re launching will lay out the steps that we need to take to get there.”

Planning for 1 million acres

In September 2024, Delta Air Lines used SAF derived in part from winter camelina to fuel a flight from Minneapolis to New York. The demonstration flight was the first out of Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport to use SAF.

Every winter, about 17 million acres of cropland in Minnesota has nothing growing on it, according to Hunter. He said these cold months are a missed opportunity for farmers to grow crops like winter camelina, which is planted in the fall and harvested in the spring.

“If we can put productive, profitable crops on those acres that can protect the soil and give farmers something to harvest, we can make progress on improving farm economics, improving water quality and protecting the soil that we depend on for growing food today and for future generations,” Hunter said.

Close to 5000 acres of the crop were planted in the upper Midwest in the fall of 2024, according to Hunter, but the goal for Minnesota alone is to cover 1 million acres.

“We have an ambitious goal, which is to have 1 million acres of winter camelina in the upper Midwest by 2035,” Hunter said. “We will really have to pull out all the stops to get to that goal, but we have a big, committed coalition of supporters who are all behind us in that goal, and that gives me hope that we can get there.”

Farming the crop

The university and MPCA are encouraging farmers to consider growing winter camelina to help drive the demand for climate-smart crops.

Ben Penner, a farmer from Mankato, said that in 2024, Penner Farms planted close to 150 acres of winter camelina.

Penner said there hasn’t been a crop to hit the market to help with fuel emissions like winter camelina and its relatives, since soybeans, which grows in the summer months and can also be used for sustainable aviation fuel. The potential for a crop like winter camelina is there, he said, but it’s new and that means there’s still a lot to learn.

“The demand is there, and it is a fuel pathway that will grow,” Penner said. “What I tell farmers is, ‘Let’s learn everything we can now so that when that market comes fully online, then we’ll be able to partake in the market rather than watch someone else do it.’”

Along with soybeans and winter camelina, other crops that can be used as SAF feedstock include pennycress, woody biomass and corn, according to the MPCA.

“The journey that soybeans were on 80 years ago is the journey we’re on with winter camelina; taking a promising plant and turning it into a high-performing crop,” Hunter said.

Federal and state funding

According to the MPCA, Gov. Tim Walz’s 2025 budget includes $20 million over the next 10 years for tax credits to promote SAF production in Minnesota. In 2025, the state will also complete a roadmap for SAF industry development and regulation.

“This is part of our whole government approach around climate change,” Kessler said. “We need to be doing whatever we can across the state, across all of our economic sectors to reduce greenhouse gases.”

Kessler and Hunter acknowledged that many environmental organizations and efforts have experienced federal funding cuts under the Trump administration and are unsure whether this will impact their plans.

“We were selected for a $10 million grant from the Department of Energy, which would greatly further our research on camelina and pennycress, and we understand that that grant is currently under review by the new administration,” Hunter said.

Despite the uncertainty, Kessler and Hunter said the state remains committed to supporting this initiative.

“We remain hopeful that it will come through, and in the meantime, we are extra thankful for the support of all of these partners who can continue the work while we wait,” Hunter said.

The Forever Green Initiative is partnering with Greater MSP’s MBOLD coalition and SAF Hub, Friends of the Mississippi River, Minnesota Environmental Partnership, the McKnight Foundation, MPCA and the Minnesota Department of Agriculture to conduct the study and fund the total cost of the research, which is between $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency.",https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/STP-L-SAF-0423-01.jpg?w=1024&h=616,N,,2025-04-23 17:56:52.943659

The case centers on a 2022 decision by the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reinstate a waiver under the Clean Air Act, allowing California to enforce tougher emissions standards than those set by the federal government.

A subsidiary of Valero Energy (NYSE: VLO) and several fuel industry groups are appealing a lower court ruling that found they lacked legal standing to sue.

Both conservative and liberal justices questioned whether the challengers could plausibly argue that California’s regulations harm their businesses by reducing demand for liquid fuels.

Some justices appeared open to the idea that the challengers’ economic claims might be enough to establish standing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett noted that relying on “common sense” could meet the legal threshold for a case, according to Reuters.

The Clean Air Act generally bars states from setting their own emissions standards but allows the EPA to grant California exceptions. Since 1967, the state has received over 75 such waivers.

Relevant: Supreme Court: EPA Rules For Coal and Natural Gas Emissions Reduction Stand (For Now)

The 2022 waiver restored California’s authority to enforce strict tailpipe emissions limits and a zero-emission vehicle mandate through 2025, undoing a Trump-era reversal.

Critics, including former Trump administration lawyer Jeffrey Wall, argue that the EPA overstepped its authority and unfairly disrupted fuel markets.

However, government lawyers contend that the challengers have not shown direct harm and thus cannot sue.

The Supreme Court’s decision, expected by June, could impact how easily businesses can challenge environmental regulations.

In recent years, the court has limited the EPA’s authority in several major rulings, including restrictions on air and water pollution rules.

If the justices side with the fuel producers, it could open the door to more legal challenges against environmental regulations that affect industry profits.

According to Wizz, the new roadmap reflects the goals set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to achieve net zero carbon emissions from international aviation by 2050.

In a statement announcing its new roadmap, however, Wizz said that the industry’s ambition relies heavily on the industrialization of technology that has not yet occurred. The airline said that its own plan puts a greater emphasis on SAF and new aircraft technologies, rather than unproven technologies and offsetting, relative to other airlines’ plans.

Yvonne Moynihan, Wizz Air Corporate & ESGEnvironmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company’s operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments. More Officer, said:

“Wizz Air supports an ambitious vision for net zero, but the truth is that the current pace of change is not enough, and without radical intervention, aviation will fail to meet its commitments.”

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.

Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, however, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels, with SAF accounting for only around 0.5% of global commercial fuel use in 2024.

Wizz said that SAF is the “cornerstone” of its net zero plan, with the airline targeting 53% decarbonization from the increased use of SAF. The company noted a need for governments to take action to scale SAF production through long-term policy frameworks, and incentives to close the price gap between SAF and conventional jet fuel.

In addition to increasing SAF usage, Wizz’s plan outlines other key emissions reduction levers, with the company targeting 21% decarbonization through technological advancements in aircraft and engine technology, 7% through fleet renewal, 4% through air traffic reform and 2% through operational efficiencies.

Wizz’s own climate goals include reducing carbon emissions intensity by 25% by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.

Moynihan added:

“We need action, not just ambition. That’s why we’re calling on governments, regulators, and the fuel industry to wake up to the reality of aviation’s transition and start delivering the changes that will make net zero possible. Aviation needs a policy and investment revolution to shape the industry’s path.

The green light paves the way for VA’s return to long-haul international flying through a wet-lease arrangement, with 28 weekly flights to Doha set to commence in mid-2025.

A Strategic Gateway for Global Connections

In terms of the deal, VA will operate flights from Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, and eventually Melbourne to Doha using widebody aircraft leased from QR. This will be facilitated by Hamad International Airport's hub connectivity, enabling smooth onward travel to more than 100 destinations across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The new alliance enhances connectivity for Australian travelers heading to the region and expands loyalty program benefits for both Velocity and Privilege Club members.

With long-haul operations not part of VA’s network since its restructuring in 2020, the partnership allows the carrier to access international expertise, capacity, and infrastructure without shouldering the risks associated with acquiring new aircraft.

The venture is also expected to revive healthy competition on major international routes, particularly to Europe, which has long been the domain of a few carriers.

Economic, Employment Impact

The alliance is expected to provide an economic benefit of AUD$3 billion (around USD$1.96 billion) over five years. The agreement will also create jobs in Australia’s aviation and tourism sectors while boosting passenger growth. QR will deploy 20 VA pilots and 40 cabin crew members to cross-train and gain international experience.

Investment, Sustainability Synergies

This regulatory approval comes on top of February's sign-off from the Australian Government for QR's 25% equity stake in VA, which has already given the Gulf carrier a leg up in the market alongside majority owner Bain Capital. The deepened partnership is intended to facilitate enhanced operational and commercial integration between the two airlines.

Simultaneously, both carriers have pledged to work together on a sustainability roadmap formalized in a Memorandum of Understanding, signed in October 2024. This work will include key initiatives such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) development, waste and energy management, and sustainable procurement practices that align with the long-term environmental goals of both carriers.

All residual emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3 are being fully offset, a proactive move as the Club marches toward net zero.","Liverpool Football Club isn’t just chasing trophies—it’s chasing down emissions, too. In a significant update to its environmental progress, the Premier League giant announced that it has reduced its Scope 1 emissions directly from its own operations by a remarkable 89% since the 2019/20 season.

That’s not all. The Club has also achieved a 17% reduction in Scope 3 emissions, encompassing indirect sources such as travel, supply chain, and construction, which are typically the most challenging to address. These figures were shared in its latest annual sustainability report, aligning with ambitions in its strategy, The Red Way.

Liverpool’s long-term climate target? A 50% absolute emissions reduction across all scopes by 2030, compared to its 2019/20 baseline. So far, it has already chalked up a 15% overall reduction, with Scope 1 progress leading the way.

A series of strategic energy decisions is driving this dramatic decline in operational emissions: the Club has transitioned to a green gas tariff for natural gas and implemented a combination of new technologies and behavioral efficiency measures to reduce its energy use.

Scope 2 emissions? Essentially zero, for years now. In the 2023/24 season, 96% of the Club’s electricity came from renewable or low-carbon sources, including on-site solar arrays and green energy purchases.

All residual emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3 are being fully offset, a proactive move as the Club marches toward net zero.

Scope 3 is notoriously challenging for any business, and for Liverpool FC, it accounts for more than 80% of its total carbon footprint. But the Club isn’t shying away. Instead, it's taking bold, deliberate steps.

In the 2023/24 season, it introduced a new sustainable travel policy, developed in collaboration with teams across medical, travel, and impact departments. Domestic charter flights? They are replaced mainly by biofuel-powered buses and ground transportation. In cases where flying remains unavoidable, the Club is now using Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits through a ‘Book and Claim’ model, meaning the carbon-saving fuel enters the system, even if not burned directly by the team.

The result? Domestic team flights made up just 0.1% of total emissions last season.

While flights grab headlines, the bulk of Scope 3 emissions came from two surprising sources:

Anfield Road Stand redevelopment (a massive 22% of the footprint) and

Fan travel contributed nearly 20%.

Approximately 6,000 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) would be available for domestic and international airlines to use at airports across Taiwan this year, which would help curb about 15,000 tonnes of carbon emissions, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said yesterday.

The use of SAF is part of government efforts to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

The nation’s three largest airlines — China Airlines Ltd (中華航空), EVA Airways Corp (EVA, 長榮航空) and Starlux Airlines Co (星宇航空) — yesterday began using SAF in their aircraft, the first time domestic airlines used eco-friendly fuel in Taiwan.

CPC Corp, Taiwan (台灣中油) imported 400 tonnes of the SAF available for use this year, while Formosa Petrochemical Corp (台塑石化) produced 5,500 tonnes, the ministry said.

China Airlines and Starlux use the CPC-imported SAF, while EVA Airways uses the fuel produced by Formosa Petrochemical.

An inauguration ceremony, held the day after Earth Day, at Kaohsiung International Airport yesterday afternoon was attended by Minister of Transportation and Communications Chen Shih-kai (陳世凱), Democratic Progressive Party Legislator Hsu Chih-chieh (許智傑), Civil Aviation Administration Director-General Ho Shu-ping (何淑萍), China Airlines chairman Kao Shing-hwang (高星潢) and CPC chairman Fang Jeng-zen (方振仁).

At the event, SAF was pumped into a China Airlines aircraft and an EVA plane, while video showed SAF being used by EVA and Starlux aircraft at Taipei International Airport (Songshan airport) and Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport respectively.

The ceremony was held at the Kaohsiung airport because it obtained carbon footprint certification from Airport Council International in 2014, making it the nation’s first green airport, Ho said.

“Making SAF available at international airports is a global trend as international airlines seek to reduce carbon emissions in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization,” she said.

“Like other countries, we are encouraging, rather than mandating, that Taiwanese airlines use SAF. Hopefully, by 2030, at least 5 percent of the total aviation fuel would be SAF,” she added.

CPC and Formosa Petrochemical secured certifications from the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation in December last year and Feb. 2 respectively.

CPC “will begin producing SAF next year,” Fang said. “The main problem is importing waste cooking oil from other countries, which we would resolve by working with the Ministry of Environment.”

Kao said the supply of SAF remains insufficient, adding that China Airlines would begin using it on flights heading to EU nations, which have begun implementing fuel regulations.

Using SAF would increase the airline’s fuel costs, but they would gradually decrease with the increase in supply, he said.

Asked whether the rise in fuel costs would also lead to increases in airfares, Kao said that ticket prices were mainly determined by supply and demand in the commercial aviation market.",https://www.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/04/24/P01-250424-008.jpg,N,,2025-04-23 13:56:52.471534

Vestas, the Danish wind turbine manufacturer with a global footprint, is stepping up its sustainability game by scaling up the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in offshore wind operations. After piloting SAF-powered helicopter transport in the Baltic Sea, the company is now expanding the initiative to the North Sea—one of Europe’s busiest offshore wind regions.

Let’s face it, offshore wind construction isn’t exactly a walk in the park. Getting technicians to and from turbines out at sea involves complex logistics and a heavy carbon footprint, especially when helicopters are part of the equation. But with SAF, Vestas is trying to cut through the carbon fog.

Baltic Sea Pilot Project: A Promising Start

In early 2024, Vestas began testing SAF in real-world conditions. They deployed a SAF-fueled helicopter to shuttle technicians during the construction of 50 offshore turbines in the Baltic Sea. According to the company, the move slashed greenhouse gas emissions by 38% compared to standard Jet-A1 fuel. That’s not just a marginal improvement—it’s a significant dent in the emissions typically associated with offshore wind logistics.

The trial not only proved that SAF can be effective, but also demonstrated its compatibility with the demanding timelines and safety standards required in offshore environments.

Moving to the North Sea: Bigger Scope, Bolder Goals

Now, Vestas is scaling the project to the North Sea, backed by a multi-year agreement with a cluster of aviation and fuel industry players. The new initiative marks a milestone for Esbjerg Airport, which is now introducing SAF into its aviation fuel supply chain for the first time.

Partners in this initiative include NHV Group, Airbus Aircraft, DCC & Shell Aviation Denmark A/S, and Esbjerg Airport—a network that brings together helicopter operators, aircraft manufacturers, fuel suppliers, and infrastructure providers. That’s a serious coalition of logistics firepower.

The objective? Cut emissions from crew-change flights that connect technicians to offshore turbines in the North Sea. All flights departing from Esbjerg will now operate using at least a 40% SAF blend—one of the highest feasible levels currently allowed under aviation standards.

What’s in the Fuel?

This isn’t your average biofuel. The SAF used in these operations is produced from biowaste materials, primarily used cooking oil (UCO). Think about that: what once fried your french fries is now flying technicians over cold North Sea waters. Talk about full-circle sustainability.

Using a 40% SAF blend brings operations close to the technical and regulatory limits for blending SAF with conventional jet fuel. While that cap might sound restrictive, it’s actually pushing the envelope of what’s currently possible in commercial aviation.

A First for Airbus H175 in Offshore Wind

Another noteworthy development? The use of the Airbus H175 helicopter model exclusively for offshore wind installation flights. This marks the first time the H175 has been deployed for this kind of work in the North Sea. Known for its long-range capabilities and high payload capacity, the H175 is well-suited to offshore logistics—but it’s never flown quite like this before.

The combination of new technology, sustainable fuel, and high-capacity aircraft opens a new chapter in the offshore wind playbook. With more offshore wind farms in the pipeline and larger turbines further from shore, reducing the carbon impact of supporting logistics is becoming more than just a nice-to-have—it’s a must.

A Signal for the Future of Offshore Logistics?

Let’s not ignore the broader context here. Offshore wind is growing fast, and so are its emissions—especially those linked to operations and maintenance. If SAF can reliably reduce emissions by 30% or more, why isn’t everyone using it?

The answer is scale, cost, and supply. SAF is still relatively expensive and not yet widely available. But moves like this one from Vestas help build the case—and the demand—that could encourage wider production and adoption.",https://breakbulk.news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/cropped-BBN_Logo-800x800-1-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-04-23 14:57:08.473517

Earmarked for $10 million, the proposed SAF Incentive Program would offer up to $2.50 per gallon in credits to help reduce the gap compared with the price of regular jet fuel, since greener fuel can cost up to six times more than its conventional counterpart.

The bill, which passed the Assembly Committee on Growth and Infrastructure on April 11, would establish a special revenue fund in the state treasury. This means that airlines can claim incentives by submitting requests to the treasurer, who may also accept grants, gifts and donations to bolster the program.

SAF can reduce emissions from air transportation by as much as 80 percent. It is currently the only viable solution for decarbonizing the sector as it can be integrated into existing airline fleets without the need for costly infrastructure upgrades. Despite this environmental and operational promise, SAF is subject to a classic supply and demand problem, accounting for just .3 percent of total jet fuel worldwide in 2024. Low production yields and high demand lead to high costs per gallon.

States that already have policies to support in-state SAF production, such as California and Washington, have been encouraged by how the fuel fosters economic growth, development and energy security.

The federal government has supported SAF through the Inflation Reduction Act, Clean Fuel Production Credit and the Department of Energy’s SAF Grand Challenge. Though SAF production has increased, these incentives alone are not enough to help the fuel’s affordability.

The benefits of SAF are mutual for Nevada and the airline industry, with the state advancing its environmental and transportation goals, and airlines securing a sustainable fuel source that helps them meet mounting industry and regulatory pressure to decarbonize.

Nevada’s economy is largely sponsored by the tourism industry and relies on domestic and international flights. Harry Reid International Airport and Reno-Tahoe International Airport serve 58.4 and 4.8 million passengers, respectively, with the Las Vegas airport serving all major U.S. airlines and connecting passengers with 160 airports worldwide.

High passenger traffic comes with an environmental cost. Emissions from transportation are the largest among other sectors in Nevada, with aviation’s emissions growing rapidly. To tackle this, state agencies have developed two complementary strategies for decarbonization: the Transportation Strategy, led by the Department of Transportation, and the Priority Climate Action Plan, created by the Division of Environmental Protection, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and the Governor’s Office of Energy. Both strategies specifically note SAF as the ace in the hole.

In-state SAF production in Nevada is currently dependent on two fuel producers: Edgewood Renewables in Las Vegas and New Rise Renewables near Reno. Both are in early development and production stages. While having two producers is more than what other states may offer, the reason these companies are choosing Nevada may have more to do with our neighboring state.

California has long been a gold standard of sustainability. The incentivization of SAF began in 2019 when production and infrastructure development was integrated into the Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which rewards clean fuel producers. A recent partnership with Airlines for America has encouraged them to aim for 200 million gallons of SAF supplied by 2035. This attracts investment and shows momentum in the SAF sector.

The sale of SAF in California’s market, supported by cross-state regulatory benefits and proven logistics infrastructure, is a sure bet. As of March 2025, producers earned approximately $60 per metric ton of carbon dioxide reduced, based on market conditions and carbon intensity of the fuel. Meanwhile, Nevada offers no comparable incentives.

Confirmed in the bill’s testimony by Southwest Airlines’ State and Local Affairs Director Ruben Zaragoza, there is interest in producing SAF in Nevada, but without state-based programs and incentives “these gallons will be diverted to California and other markets.” This strips Nevada of a revenue possibility.

Nevada has the potential to develop a SAF-friendly environment that can create a sustainable aviation fuel ecosystem, attract industry leaders, boost local economies, create jobs and reduce emissions. Now, that’s a jackpot!

Nevada’s business incentives are already working with existing SAF producers through grants and tax abatement. In 2024, the state approved $11.7 million in tax abatements for Edgewood Renewables as part of these efforts. The Las Vegas Global Economic Alliance backed the project, noting it could create 60 jobs within two years and involve a $100 million capital investment.

These financial programs alone are not enough to spur an ecosystem of SAF production in Nevada. AB481 proposed a new mechanism that not only incentivizes in-state production but also encourages in-state use. Yet, two critical questions remain: Can Nevada outmatch the incentives offered across the border in California? And does the state have the fiscal capacity to sustain such a program long term?

To meet that bar, Nevada should first leverage its existing assets such as abundant renewable energy, municipal waste streams and its logistics-friendly geography. Second, it must offer enough confidence, infrastructure and support to make investment here worthwhile. This involves broader alignment with state priorities, such as clean energy goals, workforce development and long-term economic resilience.

SAF production isn't just an environmental bet; it’s a commitment to Nevada’s future competitiveness.

Even more significantly, we prevented over 80 million pounds of CO₂e emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 124,368 vehicles off the road.

Brands, among others, on their annual ESG publication to report on the used cooking oil we recycled together.
Restaurant Technologies helped save 29.6 million pounds of trash and reduced CO2e emissions by over 80 million pounds.","First, the bad news: As restaurant owners and managers know, waste cooking oil poses significant environmental challenges if not disposed of properly. In addition to clogging drains, it can pollute water and soil, according to a study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials.

The good news is, however, that used cooking oil also offers significant potential as a renewable energy source. “Imagine a world where the ingredients for the food you consume are converted into renewable fuel,” said Diana Geseking, chief legal officer of Restaurant Technologies. “It would simply be a cleaner and healthier planet to live in.”

Here, Geseking, who also serves as the chair of Restaurant Technologies’ ESG committee, discusses how the company’s Total Oil Management solution is helping restaurants bring that vision to life by converting 363.7 million pounds of used cooking oil into renewable diesel or biodiesel in 2024, and how the solution can meet a variety of ESG goals for foodservice operators.

How does the process of converting used cooking oil into renewable diesel or biodiesel help reduce environmental impact, and what role does innovation play in making this transformation more efficient and sustainable?

Bio-based fuels like these reduce our reliance on petroleum by replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable alternatives. And because we recycle oil that’s already been used, we avoid the environmental impacts of growing and processing virgin oil crops, conserving emissions, water and land. Our closed-loop model also eliminates the packaging waste associated with traditional jugs-in-boxes, cutting down significantly on plastic and cardboard sent to landfills.

In fact, by our customers switching to bulk oil delivery and collection, we kept nearly 30 million pounds of waste out of the trash and saved 8.9 million cubic feet of landfill space. Even more significantly, we prevented over 80 million pounds of CO₂e emissions, which is the equivalent of taking 124,368 vehicles off the road.

Innovation is at the heart of this impact. Our custom-designed equipment allows us to deliver oil in bulk and collect used cooking oil that is clean and free of debris, unlike conventional rendering tanks. As a result, nearly every drop of oil we collect can be converted into renewable fuel instead of going to waste. This high standard of quality control makes the entire recycling process more efficient, more reliable and better for the environment.

Our partnerships with convenience stores such as Sheetz and Chevron Renewable Energy Group are just one example of industry leaders coming together to form an innovative sustainability solution and process. Together, we have built a circular fuel economy where we deliver fresh cooking oil to Sheetz, it gets used in their fryers, Restaurant Technologies collects it, REG converts it and we deliver it back to Sheetz to be used in their fryers. The potential is nearly limitless.

Restaurant Technologies has significantly increased its sustainability efforts, recycling over 363 million pounds of used cooking oil in 2024. What strategies or innovations were key to achieving this record-breaking milestone?

Our customers and renewable energy partners play a pivotal role in helping us make it all happen. As mentioned earlier, 100% of the used cooking oil we collect is recycled so, as Restaurant Technologies grows and delivers more oil to more customers, we will also be able to recycle more oil. To put it simply, the bigger we are, the more that gets recycled but that doesn’t mean we’re content depending on this growth.

Also mentioned earlier was the circular fuel economy and the potential for expanding that into other convenience stores. We are also present in many universities and theme parks where buses and shuttle services run on fuel. There is potential there for converting used cooking oil from dining halls and food courts and using them for public transportation on campuses across the country. While we’ve been around for over 25 years now, it really feels like we’re just getting started when it comes to sustainability.

You have a diverse customer base that includes industries like restaurants, hotels and grocery stores. How does Restaurant Technologies collaborate with these customers to help them meet their ESG goals?

We are proud to play such a significant role in our customer’s ESG strategy. Every single customer can say that their business is more sustainable when they work with us. We work with various national franchises such as McDonald’s, Shake Shack and Yum! Brands, among others, on their annual ESG publication to report on the used cooking oil we recycled together.

It’s not a secret that sustainability is huge within the hotels/resorts industry. Many hotels, especially the ‘big’ ones, are required to report sustainability statistics monthly, quarterly and/or annually to corporate with the promise of incentives/rewards based on how sustainable that hotel/resort is. So our partnership with them is pivotal to help them achieve their own sustainability goals.

Restaurant Technologies helped save 29.6 million pounds of trash and reduced CO2e emissions by over 80 million pounds. Can you provide more details on how these outcomes directly impact the environment and the communities where your customers operate?

Our business, naturally, helps protect the environment. Before we even recycle and convert UCO, our closed loop automated systems are already protecting water sources from grease spills and runoff that could find its way into nature. Saving pounds of trash, reducing emissions and all the other aforementioned benefits inherently come with avoiding plastic and cardboard packaging from conventional JIBs, which are not recyclable due to the oil residue left behind. The additional emissions we prevent by displacing petroleum-based fuels leads to improved local air quality and contribute to global efforts to slow the most extreme effects of climate change. Together, these outcomes support cleaner, more sustainable communities.

Sustainability is clearly a core value at Restaurant Technologies. Looking ahead, what are some of the key goals or initiatives the company has for continuing to break sustainability records and pushing the envelope in the renewable energy space?

We really believe our potential is sky-high to make a difference. While nothing is definite, we are always thinking about what’s next – from expanding the circular fuel economy to other convenience stores and utilizing UCO for college dining halls/food courts, to sourcing cooking oil from regenerative farms to reduce impact at the start of the supply chain. We’re also looking at ways to expand the use of biofuel in our own fleet and support innovation in renewable energy, including emerging solutions like sustainable aviation fuel.

Renewable biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, play a vital role in decreasing America's dependence on foreign oil, boosting the nation's economy and supporting thousands of jobs in rural communities. May is Renewable Fuels Month in Nebraska celebrated by the Nebraska Corn Board (NCB), Nebraska Ethanol Board, Renewable Fuels Nebraska and Nebraska Soybean Board.

In Nebraska, ethanol is the third-largest agriculture commodity. According to recent data, Nebraska drivers saved approximately $375 million in 2024 by using ethanol blends of E10 and above. Ethanol blends reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% compared to regular gasoline, making them a more environmentally friendly choice.

Most vehicles (2001 and newer) can safely use blends of ethanol up to E15, enjoying significant additional savings per gallon. Flex fuel vehicle owners can use blends up to E85 and experience even greater savings.

As the second-largest producer of ethanol in the country, Nebraska is poised for further growth in the industry. Landmark legislation passed in 2024 provides a tax credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) produced in Nebraska, which can reduce emissions by more than 50% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Renewable Fuels Month highlights the importance of renewable biofuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, especially for Nebraskans. The month of May marks the beginning of the summer driving season, making it an ideal time to fuel up on clean and cost-saving biofuels. Ethanol, renewable diesel and biodiesel help to decrease America's dependence on foreign oil, boost our nation's economy, and support thousands of jobs in rural communities.

“Nebraskans are beginning to drive and take advantage of biofuel benefits more this month as the weather warms up for sports, vacations and holiday events,” said Brandon Hunnicutt, chairman of NCB. “By choosing a renewable fuel such as ethanol, drivers can support local agriculture, reduce their carbon footprint and save money on fuel costs.""

Uganda is committed to implementing of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Programme in order to support the global environment protection cause.

Fred K. Bamwesigye, the Director General at Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) made the revelation on Tuesday at the launch of the Kick-off Workshop for Feasibility Study for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Programme in Uganda.

“Uganda has always joined the rest of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Member States in supporting the ICAO standards, policies and strategies set to limit and mitigate the impact of aviation carbon emissions on the global climate. As an ICAO Member State, Uganda is prepared to take necessary action and advance initiatives on environmental protection including action on Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF),” said Bamwesigye, adding: “… in our efforts to support the global environment protection cause, Uganda made a choice to be part of the ICAO’s initiative on Capacity Building for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) programme.”

He added that the workshop will kick-off a feasibility study to outline a roadmap for the implementation of SAF programme in Uganda.

“This programme builds on the adoption by the 41st ICAO Assembly resolution of a long-term global aspirational goal (LTAG) of net-zero aviation carbon emissions by 2050,” he said, adding: “The initiative we are launching today is also framed in the ICAO Global Framework for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF), Lower Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) and other Aviation Cleaner Energies adopted in the third ICAO Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) in 2023. I also wish to inform you that ICAO and its Member States, including Uganda, established the Global collective aspiration to reduce aviation Carbon emissions by 5% in 2030 through the use of SAF and cleaner energies.”

He urged participants in the kick-off workshop to engage in this initiative so that it can provide not only environmental benefits, but also social opportunities to the people of Uganda.

He said the launched Feasibility Study calls for collective effort in assisting with information collection that should be provided to the ICAO experts in their endeavor to identify basic data that will inform Uganda’s potential in production and use of SAF.

“Please, engage with them and provide contact information where possible so they will be able to follow-up with all relevant national stakeholders who could contribute to data collection to identify and promote opportunities for Sustainable aviation fuel programme in Uganda,” he said.

Bamwesigye further said UCAA’s National Focal Point on aviation environment protection will also be available to ICAO experts and should be able to coordinate all interactions between the experts and the key stakeholders.

What is sustainable aviation fuel?

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a type of jet fuel produced from renewable feedstocks such as used cooking oils, plant oils, agricultural waste and municipal waste. Unlike conventional jet fuel derived from fossil sources, SAF is considered a more sustainable alternative as it significantly reduces carbon emissions produced during flights. Depending on the feedstock and production method, SAF can reduce carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional fossil fuels.

Chemically similar to conventional jet fuel, SAF can be used in existing aircraft engines without requiring modifications. It can be blended with traditional fuel up to 50%, and looking ahead, aircraft will be capable of using 100% SAF by 2030. The term ‘drop-in fuel’ refers to SAF’s compatibility with current airport fuelling systems, making its integration into the aviation industry relatively straightforward.

The environmental benefits of SAF are substantial, notably its reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Additionally, using waste materials like household rubbish for fuel production helps prevent these materials from ending up in landfills, reducing harmful methane emissions.

While SAF is currently more expensive than traditional jet fuel, its cost is expected to decrease as production technologies improve and economies of scale are achieved. SAF plays a crucial role in helping the aviation industry meet its carbon reduction targets of net zero by 2050, contributing to a more sustainable future for the aviation industry.

As Cherie Wilson, Delta’s Vice President of Government Affairs and Sustainability, stated: “SAF is the only solution available today that can yield immediate results and drastically cut airline lifecycle GHG emissions.”

What are the problems with sustainable aviation fuel?

Despite its potential, SAF faces numerous challenges that hinder its widespread adoption. One of the primary issues is the high production cost. Currently, SAF can cost between two to seven times more than traditional jet fuel due to the limited availability of sustainable feedstocks and the early stage of production technology. This price disparity makes it difficult for airlines to adopt SAF on a large scale, especially when economic pressures often prioritise lower operational costs.

Another challenge is the limited supply of SAF. The production of SAF is not yet at a scale large enough to meet global aviation demand, and there is a reliance on feedstocks such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, which are limited.

Additionally, the infrastructure for SAF distribution is still small scaled. While SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel, the infrastructure at airports and refineries needs significant investment to support its widespread use.

SAF production may also be impacted by global politics as the need for investment is imperative for upscaling. However, as seen in recent events in America under President Donald Trump, SAF’s impact could be reduced.

Finally, there are concerns about the environmental impact of some feedstocks. For instance, the large-scale cultivation of certain crops for SAF production could lead to land-use changes, potentially causing deforestation or competing with food production. This makes it crucial to ensure that SAF production meets sustainability criteria. However, new pathways are being uncovered. One company, Firefly Green Fuels, has announced a new novel pathway to SAF made from sewage sludge.

Is SAF better than jet fuel?

SAF is considered better than traditional jet fuel in terms of environmental impact. SAF can reduce CO2 emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle, compared to conventional jet fuel, thanks to its renewable feedstocks. This reduction is primarily because the CO2 absorbed by plants during their growth is roughly equal to the emissions produced when SAF is burned, making it near carbon-neutral.

However, SAF is not without its challenges. It is currently more expensive to produce than conventional jet fuel, and the supply is limited due to the finite availability of sustainable feedstocks. While SAF can be blended with traditional jet fuel up to 50%, the infrastructure to support its widespread use is still under development. Despite these challenges, SAF remains a key solution for reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint and moving towards greener air travel.

Why is SAF not widely used?

SAF is not widely used primarily due to its high production cost. The current cost of SAF is significantly higher than conventional jet fuel, largely because the production technology is still developing and the feedstocks, such as used cooking oils and agricultural waste, are limited and expensive. This price gap makes it difficult for airlines to adopt SAF on a large scale, especially in a competitive industry where cost-efficiency is crucial.

Additionally, SAF production is not yet at a sufficient scale to meet global aviation demand. The supply of sustainable feedstocks is finite, and increasing production will require substantial investment in infrastructure and technology.

SAF’s availability is also constrained by the current lack of widespread distribution infrastructure at airports and refineries. As a result, despite its environmental benefits, SAF’s adoption remains limited.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2510038881.png,N,,2025-04-23 02:56:27.009364

It’s now up to the House Transportation Committee to approve the changes.","Hold onto your wallets, Washington drivers—more changes are on the horizon, and they’re not exactly small ones.

The state House of Representatives is preparing to roll out a major overhaul to ESSB 5801, a transportation funding bill that’s about to get bulked up with a laundry list of tax hikes, fee increases, and infrastructure investments.

The bill, already hefty when it left the Senate, will undergo a turbocharged “striking amendment” in the House on Wednesday during a meeting of the House Transportation Committee.

While the Senate’s version had a public hearing in that committee on Tuesday, the discussion might end up being somewhat moot. Why? Because this striking amendment—essentially a full rewrite of the Senate bill—can only be proposed during an executive session, not in public hearings.

Here’s what’s being proposed in what is effectively the House’s new version of the bill:

Gas up, pay up

Starting July 1, 2025, the gas tax jumps 6 cents per gallon, bumping the rate from 49.4 cents to 55.4 cents. That part hasn’t changed from the original Senate bill.

Diesel drivers? You’re not off the hook. Diesel sees a 6-cent total hike—3 cents in 2025 and another 3 cents in 2027.

And that’s not the end of it. Beginning in 2026, most fuel taxes will automatically increase 2% per year due to inflation. Diesel gets its own inflation-based increases starting in 2028.

Where’s all that money going? Mostly into the Motor Vehicle Fund, with 2.5% going to cities and another 2.5% to counties—same as in the Senate version.

One notable change? The House version ditches the electric and hybrid vehicle fee increases proposed in the Senate. The Senate had called for boosting the annual fee from $100 to $150 and adding extra charges for new registrations. The House said “no thanks” to that.

Fee-nomenon

Almost every vehicle-related fee is going up. Starting in 2026, truck weight fees will be standardized to $30 per ton. Passenger car weight fees will also increase:

Up to 4,000 lbs.: Still $35

4,001–6,000 lbs.: Now $65

6,001–8,000 lbs.: $82.50

8,001 lbs. and up: $96

Other fee increases include:

Title changes: from $15 to $18

Registration renewals: from $8 to $11

And that abandoned RV fee? It’s going from $6 to $8.

Luxury rides and high-end toys targeted

Got a luxury car habit? Might want to downshift.

Starting January 2026, Washington will impose:

An 8% tax on vehicles priced over $100,000 (with the threshold increasing by 2% each year).

A 10% tax on non-commercial aircraft worth more than $500,000.

Trade-ins won’t help you dodge this tax.

Revenue from these luxury taxes will be funneled into the Multimodal Transportation Account, and for aircraft, the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Account, though some details still depend on other pending legislation.

Rental car sales tax jumps from 5.9% to 11.9% in 2026, then drops to 9.9% in 2027

The same applies to peer-to-peer car rentals like Turo—not just traditional companies

And don’t forget: a new $1-per-tire fee is coming on retail sales of new vehicle tires. Retailers can keep 10% to cover their costs for tire disposal. The rest goes to the Department of Revenue, which may allocate it to the Department of Ecology for cleaning up illegal tire piles.

Ferries, tolls, and big events—Oh my

Washington State Ferries are getting a financial boost. Starting this October, they would tack on a 50-cent capital vessel surcharge, with more increases (10 cents) in 2027 and 2029.

Also, a 3% surcharge will be added to all ferry credit card transactions.

Tolling changes? Say goodbye to the free ride on SR 520’s on- and off-ramps—they’re all going to be tolled.

Stadiums and event venues are getting pulled into this, too. Events at arenas with 17,000+ seats will face a $1-per-head transportation fee starting in 2026. The Senate had proposed a 20,000-seat threshold, which would have spared Climate Pledge Arena—but not anymore.

Cameras, permits, and carbon cuts

Speeding through a work zone? Starting July 2026, it’ll cost you $125, thanks to new automated camera enforcement.

Driver’s license and ID fees are rising, too. From October 1, 2026, an 8-year license goes from $72 to $80, with inflation-based increases each year after that.

In a twist, the House version repeals some climate-focused transportation accounts—but boosts programs like bicycle safety grants and Shared Street projects.

And creates the Sandy Williams Connecting Communities Account, which funds safer walking, biking, and rolling infrastructure in overburdened communities along highways.

And yes, there are even more fee increases sprinkled throughout the bill, not to mention changes to red light camera rules, pedestrian path expansions, and other non-financial transportation policies.

This bill is massive.

The bigger picture

Washington is trying to hold its crumbling transportation system together while pivoting toward a greener, more modern future. Lawmakers argue that these changes are crucial to meet the state’s infrastructure needs, climate goals, and evolving transportation demands.

Critics, though, are already warning that the bill will hit working-class residents the hardest, especially with gas prices and inflation already squeezing wallets.

It’s now up to the House Transportation Committee to approve the changes. If they do, the bill goes to a full House vote. and if approved, heads back to the Senate. If the Senate accepts all the rewrite done by the House, then it’s off to the Governor’s desk.

But the reality is—with this many moving parts, it’s unlikely the Senate will rubber-stamp the House rewrite without changes.

And remember—there are just five days left in the session. If lawmakers can’t finish in time, the Governor may need to call a special session to get it across the finish line.

Aviation has just twenty-five years to meet its ambitious 2050 net-zero emissions target. While this timeline might seem long, the road ahead is steep. Achieving carbon neutrality will demand coordinated efforts across policy, infrastructure, innovation, and public perception.

Rather than viewing the challenge as a looming crisis, it can become a transformative opportunity. The path forward lies in embracing complexity, encouraging cross-sector collaboration, and funding scalable solutions that yield both short-term impact and long-term transformation.

Embracing Demand Without Compromising Goals

The aviation sector is facing an exciting surge. Growing middle-class populations, particularly in developing economies, are taking to the skies in unprecedented numbers. This signals opportunity but also risk.

Relying on older, fuel-hungry aircraft to meet this demand could derail emissions goals. However, investing in newer, more efficient models and operational changes—even if initially costly—presents a chance to future-proof fleets and set a precedent for sustainable growth.

The Four Strategic Foundations for Future Investment

Sustainable aviation cannot rest on promises alone. It requires strategic alignment across four interconnected pillars:

1. Shaping a Culture That Welcomes Change

To ensure successful transition, the aviation industry must invest in educational campaigns that explain the stakes and communicate the tangible benefits of sustainability. People support what they understand. Widespread public and stakeholder buy-in is not a luxury—it is a necessity.

These efforts go beyond branding. They build trust, validate technological shifts, and prepare the market for policies and pricing structures that support long-term goals.

2. Making Sustainable Aviation Fuel More Accessible

SAF is one of the most immediate tools available. It does not require new engines or major infrastructure changes. But high production costs and limited supply remain critical barriers.

Governments and private entities must jointly support SAF development. Investment in feedstock innovation and production capacity is essential to reducing costs and improving availability. SAF alone will not deliver net zero—but it is an important step in the transition.

3. Supporting Incremental Technological Progress

Not all sustainability wins are flashy. Some are found in flight path optimization, lightweight materials, and smarter maintenance schedules. These incremental gains, though subtle, can dramatically improve fuel efficiency over time.

When combined with SAF, such improvements could cut emissions by as much as 70 percent by 2050, even with expected traffic increases. The challenge is less about the technology itself and more about deploying it rapidly and at scale.

4. Prioritizing Game-Changing Innovation

Hydrogen-powered aircraft. Battery-electric regional jets. Renewable energy generation at airports. These are not science fiction—they are part of a growing wave of aviation innovation.

However, transforming propulsion systems and redesigning aircraft requires significant research, time, and regulatory clarity. To unlock their potential, stakeholders must not only fund these innovations but also ensure there is a supportive infrastructure and an efficient certification process.

Regulation and Risk: Managing the Next Phase

Innovators need certainty. Investors need confidence. A clear, globally recognized pathway for certifying and deploying new technologies is essential. Without it, the cost and risk of sustainable innovation could deter even the most ambitious projects.

Governments and regulatory agencies must take the lead here—not as gatekeepers, but as partners in accelerating meaningful change. Their role is to create a transparent, agile framework that rewards progress without compromising safety.

Time to Lead, Not Linger

The 2050 target may now feel distant, but time is short. Every year without decisive investment and bold policy action pushes sustainability further out of reach. Some industry experts believe a new target date may eventually be needed.

Regardless of timelines, one truth remains: action today will define aviation’s legacy tomorrow. Those who lead this charge will not only shape the future of flight but also secure their relevance in a low-carbon world.

Conclusion: Progress Begins With Purpose

Decarbonising aviation is not just a technical challenge—it is a social, economic, and cultural transformation. It requires courage to invest in innovation, willingness to challenge the status quo, and persistence to build a new ecosystem from the ground up.

By focusing on the four foundational pillars—public engagement, SAF adoption, incremental efficiency, and radical innovation—industry leaders can chart a practical yet visionary course.

California Air Resources Board on April 4 released a third set of proposed changes to the state’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. More than 80 public comments were filed ahead of an April 21 deadline, including those filed by representatives of the ethanol, biobased diesel and biogas industries.

CARB on Nov. 8, 2024, approved updates to its LCSF that aim to reduce the carbon intensity of the state’s transportation fuel by 30% by 2030 and by 90% by 2045. The updates also include a variety of technical changes to the LCFS program, including those requiring fuel producers to track crop-based and forestry-based feedstocks to their point of origin; requiring independent feedstock certification to ensure biomass-based diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstocks are not undermining natural carbon stocks; changes prohibiting palm-derived fuels from receiving credits; a cap on the use of soybean oil, canola oil and sunflower oil in the production of LCFS-compliant biodiesel diesel fuels; and updates that phase out avoided methane crediting associated with the use of biomethane as a combustion fuel but extend the use of biomethane for renewable hydrogen.

CARB submitted its final regulatory package on the approved LCFS amendments to the California Office of Administrative Law on Jan. 3. OAL on Feb. 18 notified CARB of its intention to disapprove the LCFS amendments citing “clarity” issues, effectively pausing implementation of the changes.

CARB on Feb. 25 received a Decision of Disapproval of Regulatory Action from OAL, which details the reasons for the disapproval. That document indicates that OAL has identified 26 proposed regulatory provisions where additional modifications may be necessary to ensure the regulatory provisions can be “easily understood by those persons directly affected by them.”

Under California state law, CARB has 120 days to rewrite and resubmit the amendments, which any substantive modifications subject to a new public comment period.

CARB on April 4 announced the availability of modified text and opened a 15-day public comment period. According to information posted to CARB’s website, 81 public comments were filed, including comments filed by the Renewable Fuels Association, Growth Energy, Clean Fuels Alliance America, the RNG Coalition and the American Biogas Council.

The RFA is criticizing CARB’s decision to maintain “unnecessary and unworkable” feedstock sustainability criteria. “With its latest proposed modifications to the LCFS program, CARB had an opportunity to substantially revise or remove its needless sustainability requirements for U.S.-origin ethanol feedstocks,” RFA said in a statement. “Instead, CARB made only a few slight tweaks to other provisions and the agency appears poised to move ahead with its costly and burdensome sustainability criteria.”

According to the RFA, CARB alleges that its proposed feedstock sustainability requirements for grain-based ethanol are need to provide “guard rails” against “rapid expansion of biofuel production and biofuel feedstock demand…that could result in adverse and use changes.” In its comments, RFA stresses that empirical data clearly undermine this rationale, proving that the number of corn acres needed to meet California ethanol demand has actually fallen by 700,000 acres, or 20%, since the LCFS program began in 2011.

Growth Energy said CARB’s proposal continues to undermine the role of crop-based fuels in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. “Biofuels like ethanol have long been the backbone of the California LCFS and have contributed to the success of the program,” said Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy. “Despite OAL’s rejection of the proposed amendments for their lack of clarity, CARB’s revisions fall short by failing to add any meaningful details to the amendments’ sustainability provisions. CARB’s proposal still undermines the important role that crop-based renewable fuels must play in decarbonizing the transportation sector in California. Not only do these amendments run counter to the state’s own environmental agenda, they undercut California’s leadership in spurring renewable energy production across the U.S. and giving consumers access to more affordable fueling options. We urge CARB to embrace renewable fuels, rather than keeping them on the sidelines to the detriment of both American farmers and California consumers.”

Clean Fuels Alliance America also criticized CARB’s treatment of crop-based biofuels, specifically the feedstock cap that is to be implemented for soybean, canola and sunflower oils. In addition, Clean Fuels is speaking out against a newly proposed change to the proposed regulations that would eliminate the possibility of new fuel pathways for biomass-based diesel from being approved after Jan. 1, 2031, if a certain number of zero emission vehicles (ZEVs) or near zero emissions vehicles (NZEVs) are on the road.

The RNG Coalition addressed the market impact of regulatory delays in its comments. “Given the LCFS credit surpluses, a significant stepdown in the Annual Carbon Intensity (CI) Benchmarks cannot be delayed any further,” the group wrote. “At this stage, the top priority should be the expeditious finalization and 2025 Q1 implementation of the target step down.”

“All parties received adequate notice throughout this extended rulemaking process and are prepared for implementation of the new rule, effective at the start of the 2025,” the RNG Coalition continued in its comments. “Few, if any, parties could have anticipated changes requested by the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). Clean fuel credit generators—such as RNG producers—should not be punished with any further administrative delays to the rule. Obligated parties (deficit generators) are all well informed about the rule changes and further delays are not necessary.”

The American Biogas Council also addressed the negative impacts of regulatory delays in its comments. “The recent administrative disapproval of the program’s amendments from the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) has unfortunately delayed the implementation of these vital amendments,” the ABC said in its comments. “The ABC would like to underscore the importance of concluding this rulemaking as soon as possible. Any further delay to the rulemaking diminishes the necessary signal the market needs to facilitate and encourage the continued investments in clean fuels. Without a strong policy signal, the state risks missing opportunities to further reduce GHG emissions from transportation fuels. Thus, the ABC strongly encourages CARB to swiftly address the concerns laid out in the disapproval, resubmit the package to OAL, and begin implementation of the new amendments promptly.”

Minnesota Pollution Control Agency officials gathered next to a field of bright-green pennycress at the University’s St. Paul campus to announce $75,000 in state funding for the U of M’s research into sustainable aviation fuel — and celebrate Earth Day.

MPCA Commissioner Katrina Kessler said sustainable aviation fuel is a way to cut down on emissions from transportation — Minnesota’s biggest source of pollution.

“Aviation is a sector that is really hard to decarbonize, but today we have a clear opportunity to lead,” Kessler said.

The funding is part of the state’s push to scale up sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. Instead of fossil fuels, it’s made from crops like soybeans, corn, camelina and pennycress. It’s blended with typical fuel, and can run in commercial planes without any modifications.

Researchers say SAF emits less greenhouse gases — up to 70 percent less than standard jet fuel. It’s caught the attention of the aviation industry, as airlines aim to cut emissions without cutting service. Delta is part of a Minnesota partnership with a goal of getting 100 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport by 2030.

To get there, researchers say they’ll need to plant a lot more crops.

The new funding from MPCA will support a study aimed at planting one million acres of camelina across the region.

Mitch Hunter is the co-director of the U’s Forever Green Initiative, which is leading the effort to step up production of winter-hardy crops, like camelina and pennycress. Hunter said at this point in the spring, there are 17 million acres of cropland in Minnesota with nothing growing on them. Winter crops could fill that space, keep soil healthy and prevent erosion, and they have ready buyers in the airline industry.

But he said it’s a challenge to quickly get seeds to farmers, grow the crops and produce SAF — all steps that still need to be built in the budding industry.

“We, in some sense, need to solve all of those at the same time so that we can lift the whole supply chain at once,” Hunter said.

Hunter said this project will build a “road map” for getting more crops in the ground.

The $75,000 from the MPCA is topping off other funding, including $10 million from the U.S. Department of Energy. But Hunter said the federal government is reassessing that award as it makes sweeping cuts.

Kessler said that federal uncertainty makes the state funding all the more important.

“We can't control what's happening in DC and at the federal level, but I know that we are all doing as much as we can to make sure that we underscore the needs here, and that we can take care of the economy and the environment within Minnesota,” Kessler said.",https://img.apmcdn.org/f92223b8f02d896fe211afc358aaedd589d9aabe/widescreen/9b1d75-20250422-renewable-aviation-research01-2000.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 16:57:16.075887

With just a quarter-century remaining to achieve the internationally recognized goal of net-zero emissions in aviation by 2050, industry stakeholders and governments must acknowledge that the target is in serious doubt. To achieve the overall goal at the earliest possible date, they must also recognize its complexity. It involves several key interconnected factors: effectively managing the anticipated surge in passenger numbers, establishing incentives to drive tangible short-term progress and forging a transparent and efficient process for certifying groundbreaking innovations crucial for long-term industry transformation.

Crucially, some of those tasks will require substantial financial investment and unwavering governmental support. The time for aspirational declarations has passed. What the industry needs today is concrete action and resource allocation.

Addressing Escalating Air Travel From a Rapidly Growing Middle Class

Middle-class populations are growing rapidly worldwide, especially in developing countries. As a result, air travel is an option for the first time for significant numbers of people, and flight service providers are anticipating significant growth.

However, to meet this need effectively, airlines will likely be tempted to simply expand their existing fleets using current, readily available aircraft. Needless to say, bringing more traditional aircraft and technologies online will increase the challenge of achieving carbon neutrality.

That approach will require significant upfront investment from air carriers, potentially leading to a short-term increase in ticket prices and probably impacting current growth models. The long-term benefits of a sustainable aviation industry will outweigh these immediate issues, of course, but clearing the near-term hurdles will be challenging.

Investing in a Sustainable Future: Four Key Pillars

To reduce its carbon footprint, the aviation industry must make good on its commitments to substantial investments in cutting-edge technology and supporting infrastructure. It must also ramp up its educational efforts to ensure everyone understands what is at stake, the benefits of carbon-neutral aviation and the hurdles ahead. Sustainability initiatives must be built on these four pillars:

1. Cultivating acceptance of change

Given the critical need for widespread understanding and support, the aviation sector must continue to invest in comprehensive education initiatives targeting all stakeholders and the public regarding the value of sustainable aviation. Proactive and consistent communication will help promote acceptance of necessary changes and build confidence in the industry’s commitment to a greener future. By clearly articulating the critical need for decarbonization, the tangible benefits of innovative technologies and the long-term vision for a truly sustainable air transport network, the industry can create a more supportive environment. More than a public relations exercise, these efforts are necessary to ensure the long-term viability and acceptance of a transformed aviation industry.

2. Steady movement toward sustainable aviation fuel

Another important aspect of this initiative is the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). While SAF offers the significant advantage of requiring minimal to no modifications to existing aircraft or airport infrastructure, its widespread impact hinges on substantial commitment and investment from both private and public sectors. Unfortunately, fears that the commitment won’t be forthcoming have cast doubt on achieving the 2050 net-zero goal.

Currently, SAF production is carbon-intensive, and its cost is approximately double that of conventional jet fuel. In addition, the necessary investments in feedstock development and infrastructure to support its growth could further increase its relative cost. The report also suggests that even if the entire global fleet operated solely on SAF, emissions would only be reduced by approximately 23%, so it is also vital to view SAF as just part of the near-term solution.

3. Incremental yet meaningful technological advancements

The third critical area involves continuous technological innovation aimed at reducing fuel consumption. This includes optimizing ground and flight operational profiles for greater efficiency and developing more fuel-efficient aircraft designs and engines.

While these changes might be gradual and subtle, their cumulative effect will have a substantial impact on overall emissions. Optimizing flight paths and deploying cleaner engines in more aerodynamic aircraft will eventually yield significant reductions, justifying the considerable effort these advancements will require. It has been estimated that a combination of widespread SAF adoption alongside these incremental technological improvements could enable the industry to reduce CO₂ emissions by up to 70% by 2050, even with a projected annual air traffic growth rate of 3%. Still, the willingness of stakeholders to invest at the speed and pace necessary to achieve net zero by 2050 remains in question.

4. Radical innovation in aviation systems and resources

The fourth and most transformative area requires long-term investment in entirely new propulsion systems and alternative fuels, such as hydrogen and other clean energy sources, to replace existing jet fuel-powered fleets. While these developments hold immense potential for substantial carbon emission reductions, the pathway to realizing battery-powered propulsion for short-haul flights and hydrogen or other sustainable fuels for longer-range travel will be complex and require significant advancements.

This longer-term phase of innovation will likely require a complete rethinking of fundamental aircraft designs and the development of entirely new propulsion technologies, alongside the establishment of the necessary supporting infrastructure. This includes airport facilities but also crucial downstream aspects, such as producing hydrogen in ways that are, themselves, carbon neutral. Battery technology must also evolve and improve rapidly to make power sources more energy-dense, safer and easier to produce at scale.

Navigating Regulations and Managing Risk

A clear and efficient path to certification must be established for all types of innovation. This will provide a crucial sign and encouragement to those willing to invest in sustainable aviation. Investors will only realize returns on their investments when their innovative technologies can be implemented widely across various sectors, supported by forward-thinking regulatory authorities.

And, of course, innovation involves risk. The aviation and aerospace industry has a history of costly and, at times, dangerous failures. For innovative companies (and the industry generally) to succeed, they will need help managing risk effectively.

Stakeholders must also be aware that potential shifts in the global economic landscape could introduce instability, potentially deterring the long-term investments necessary to achieve carbon neutrality. Similarly, regulatory bodies that fail to provide a clear and timely process for certification will also hinder progress. Therefore, strong public-private synergy is essential to cultivate an environment conducive to success.

The Imperative of Immediate Action

The commercial aviation sector’s transition to net-zero emissions will be long and intricate. Significant changes are inevitable as technologies mature, and despite the most dedicated efforts, achieving complete decarbonization by 2050 remains a formidable challenge. In fact, many believe it is already unattainable and that setting a new, more sensible date for reaching net-zero is advisable.

Either way, the time for decisive action is now. Those entities that enthusiastically embrace this challenge, drive innovation and set the standard for the next century of aviation stand to gain significantly from the ever-increasing global population of air travelers and the goodwill of people rooting for sustainable aviation to become a reality.

BURLINGTON, Vt. / April 22, 2025 / Aviation News – Heritage Aviation, along with Avfuel Corporation—a leading independent supplier of aviation fuel and services—is proud to announce the introduction of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport (KBTV).

In celebration of the new offering, Heritage Aviation—the 100% employee owned fixed-base operation (FBO) and FAA-certified 145 repair station responsible for servicing the airport’s general aviation aircraft—hosted the Honorable Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Emma Mulvaney-Stanak, and Airport Director Nic Longo at its state-of-the-art, LEED Gold Standard facility on March 21.

This visit underscored the vital role Heritage Aviation plays in supporting Vermont’s aviation industry and the Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport, while recognizing the FBO for being at the forefront of sustainable aviation operations. Indeed, when Heritage Aviation welcomed its first load of SAF in February, it became Avfuel’s first customer in the Northeast U.S. to provide the new sustainable alternative to jet fuel and commit to its consistent availability.

“We were honored to welcome Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak to our facility, showcasing the dedication and expertise of our employee-owners, and our commitment to sustainability and the next generation of fuel,” said Matthew Collins, chief executive officer of Heritage Aviation. “We are thrilled to partner with Avfuel and to be its first branded FBO location in the Northeast to offer SAF, bringing the next generation of fuel to Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport.”

During the visit, Mayor Mulvaney-Stanak and Longo met with Heritage Aviation’s employee-owners to learn more about SAF, the company’s commitment to providing exceptional aviation services, fostering a culture of employee ownership, and embracing sustainable business practices. As an employee-owned business, Heritage Aviation exemplifies a model of shared success and long-term investment in the region’s economic development.

Heritage Aviation’s SAF from Avfuel—produced by Diamond Green Diesel LLC, a joint venture between a Valero affiliate and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients Inc. (NYSE: DAR)—is made using the HEFA SPK process, meaning it uses lipids, like used cooking oil, to produce the fuel, and can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% when compared to conventional jet fuel if used in its fully concentrated form. All SAF is required to be blended with jet fuel prior to delivery. With target blend percentages of 30% neat SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel, the SAF Avfuel delivers can lower lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 24% when compared to conventional jet fuel alone.

“We are proud to partner with Heritage Aviation—Avfuel’s premier branded FBO partner in Burlington, Vermont (KBTV)—to bring SAF to the Northeast,” said C.R. Sincock, II, Avfuel’s executive vice president. “It’s a testament to the FBO’s pioneering spirit, and commitment to its community and sustainability efforts.”

The company is reinforcing its commitment to long-term competitiveness and sustainability by investing in decarbonization initiatives and streamlining its operations.

The Antwerp site, known for its integrated refining and petrochemical operations, plays a crucial role in TotalEnergies’ European operations. “By adapting and investing regularly in our Antwerp site, we’re securing its long-term future and ensuring that this integrated refining and petrochemicals platform remains TotalEnergies’ most efficient in Europe,” said Ann Veraverbeke, managing director of TotalEnergies Antwerp. “Whether the aim is to meet market challenges or contribute to decarbonization and the energy transition, the platform can be reconfigured to remain competitive and continue to provide jobs well into the future.”

One of the site’s major advancements includes a green hydrogen project in collaboration with Air Liquide. As part of a 200-megawatt electrolyzer project, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 megawatts to produce 15,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. This initiative will be supported by green electricity from TotalEnergies’ OranjeWind offshore wind farm and is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions at the site by up to 150,000 tons per year starting in late 2027.

The platform will also contribute to the aviation sector’s decarbonization through the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). A project to produce 50,000 tons of SAF annually through coprocessing will launch in 2025, using a method that treats hydrocarbons and biomass simultaneously in a traditional refining unit.

In addition, TotalEnergies is advancing industrial electrification and energy storage. A 25-megawatt battery storage facility with a 75-megawatt-hour capacity, the largest operated by TotalEnergies in Europe, was commissioned last year. It supports renewable energy integration by addressing intermittency and bolstering the resilience of the Belgian and European power grids.

However, in response to petrochemical overcapacity, TotalEnergies plans to shut down its oldest steam cracker at Antwerp by the end of 2027. The decision follows the non-renewal of a major ethylene supply contract. The unit, which is not integrated into TotalEnergies' downstream operations, will be phased out while the newer cracker—fully aligned with internal production needs—remains operational.

TotalEnergies has committed to a no-layoff policy for the 253 employees affected by the shutdown. Each will be offered personalized options, including retirement or reassignment within the Antwerp site.

Government mandates, incentives, and blending requirements are also driving adoption, as continued innovation in feedstocks such as used cooking oil, algae, and synthetic e-fuels is driving scalability. As airlines and fuel producers increase activity to lower their fossil fuel dependence, the SAF market will see rapid growth over the next few years.

The global sustainable aviation fuel market size is calculated at USD 2.46 billion in 2025 and is expected to surge around USD 40.87 billion by 2034, exhibiting at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.88% over the forecast period 2025 to 2034.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Latest Investments

In April 2025, Colombia's state-run energy company, Ecopetrol, announced plans to invest between $500 million and $700 million to construct a SAF production facility at its Barrancabermeja refinery. The development phase is set to commence between 2025 and 2026, with operations expected to begin by 2030, targeting a production capacity of approximately 6,000 barrels of SAF per day.

In July 2024, Airbus, in collaboration with industry partners, launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Financing Alliance (SAFFA) with a commitment of $200 million. This fund is dedicated to accelerating SAF production and supporting projects that meet RefuelEU Aviation or Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) certification standards.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Important Factors

Increasing Airline Commitments

Airlines globally are increasingly adopting sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to achieve net-zero by 2050. United Airlines, for instance, is aiming for 100% green flights by 2050 through the use of SAF, which lowers lifecycle emissions by as much as 85% and can be added to existing planes without changing them. United Airlines was also the first to use SAF in normal flying operations and offers customers a way to pay for the production of SAF through its sustainable flight account. Despite its present limitations and cost, the airline sees SAF as the most scalable solution and emphasizes lower-carbon flying options. United collaborates with multiple SAF producers and energy firms, investing in the production of the future to propel the sustainability of flight.

Technological Advancements in the Fuel Production

Technological innovations in SAF production are making it more efficient and less expensive, thus more commercially feasible. LanzaJet's Georgia-based Freedom Pines Fuels, the world's first ethanol-to-jet SAF refinery, will produce 0.009 billion gallons of SAF annually. Supported by the DOE since 2016, the plant will generate USD 0.07 billion in economic activity, USD 0.005 billion in salaries, and 80 new jobs. This achievement drives the DOE's Synthetic Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge and accelerates SAF adoption via LanzaJet's proprietary ATJ technology, introducing sustainable fuels to airlines and advancing aviation decarbonization.

Slow Development of Infrastructure

One of the largest barriers to SAF adoption is insufficient infrastructure for large-scale production, storage, and distribution. Airports have a key role to play in upscaling SAF to serve 2050 net-zero aspirations since it can substantially lower Scope 3 emissions. Adoptions are however limited by factors like policy risk, cost, technology availability, and feedstock supply. Airports can shape the evolution of SAF by encouraging incentives, policy support, and industry collaboration to establish supply chains. Nevertheless, retrofitting current fuel infrastructure to accommodate higher SAF blends remains challenging without costly modifications.

Adoption in Emerging Markets

SAF demand is growing outside North America and Europe, and Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and the Middle East are becoming serious players. India has set energy independence by 2047 and net-zero by 2070, with the inaugural commercial SAF-flown flight from Pune to Delhi as a milestone. The government aims for 1% blending of SAF by 2025, which will demand 14 crore litres per year, and is gearing up for 5%. SAF production utilizing sugarcane molasses as feedstock will give an impetus to the rural economy and generate green jobs, and India can emerge as a global SAF hub potential.

The presence of burgeoning economies as well as mounting airline fleets is sure to cement Asia-Pacific as a high-growth market for SAF.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Overview Segmental Insights

By fuel, the biofuel segment led the market

The most widely applied variant, Biofuel-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), consists of renewable biomass feedstocks like used cooking oil, animal fat, crop residue, and algae. HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids - Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene) process is the leader due to scalability and efficiency. Large manufacturers like Neste, World Energy, and TotalEnergies are quickly scaling up biofuel-based SAF production. Straw demand aside, feedstock constraint and land use issues render widespread adoption unfeasible.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Revenue Share, By Fuel Type, 2024 (%)

Fuel Type Revenue Share, 2024 (%) Biofuel 79% Hydrogen Fuel 10% Power to Liquid 7% Gas to Liquid 4%

By technology, the HEFA-SPK (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids - Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosine) segment led the market

HEFA-SPK is the most commercially established and most prevalent SAF production technology, which uses vegetable oils, animal fats, and waste cooking oils to generate jet fuel. Over 75% of current SAF production employs this technology, with pioneers in its expansion being Neste, World Energy, and BP. The key advantages are high efficiency, refinery compatibility, and top-notch regulator support, although feedstock availability is a limiting factor.

By aircraft, the fixed-wing aircraft segment dominate the market

Fixed-wing aircraft, such as commercial airliners, cargo aircraft, and military aircraft, are the largest consumer segment of SAF. Airlines are increasingly using SAF to lower carbon emissions, with United, Delta, and Lufthansa making long-term commitments to SAF use. The sector benefits from established supply chains for fuels, but the expense of SAF prevents widespread take-up.

By biofuel blending capacity, the over 50% SAF blending segment led the market

Above 50% blending of SAF is yet in the experiment stage since existing aviation regulations restrict SAF blending to 50%. Still, successful flights operated on 100% SAF (such as Virgin Atlantic's transatlantic flight in 2023) suggest that higher blends of SAF will become the new normal once regulations improve.

By platform, the commercial aviation segment led the market

Commercial aviation accounts for the greatest use of SAF, and major airlines such as British Airways, American Airlines, and Qantas have pledged to achieve net-zero by 2050. Governments around the globe are encouraging the use of SAF by making blending mandates and subsidies available, and commercial aviation is the fastest-growing driver of the SAF market.

The first tranche of revenue certainty mechanism contracts will be given to UK projects that produce SAF using non-HEFA technology and feedstocks only. This means SAF which is not derived from refining vegetable oils, waste oils or fats. With the SAF mandate commencing since 1 January 2025, and a ratcheting requirement of SAF within the aviation fuel supply mix to catalyse demand, implementation of a bankable, robust and deliverable mechanism to attract investment in UK SAF plant construction will be critical to meet the SAF mandate but also to improve energy security by reducing reliance on imports. As of 2024, 60% of imported SAF arrived from China.

The government is clear that it wants to see the UK capture its share of the global SAF market by playing a leading role in development, production and use. Producers, especially those in a nascent industry such as SAF without proven technological readiness, struggle to obtain the significant debt and equity investment required to construct these first-of-a-kind projects. The difficulty is exacerbated by the unpredictable nature of the offtake market, even with a SAF mandate and the regulatory uncertainty within the asset class. This increases the risk premium for equity and makes it almost impossible to attract project financing.

DfT aims to remove the revenue uncertainty component by implementing the GSP mechanism, along the lines of the contract for difference used in the wholesale electricity market for renewable electricity generation. The CfD regime successfully provided revenue stability to attract investment across solar, offshore wind, onshore wind and soon floating offshore wind. The GSP mechanism will involve a private law contract between UK SAF producers and a government agency counterparty setting a strike price that a producer will receive for eligible SAF. Where the reference price exceeds the strike price, the producer pays the difference to the counterparty. Where the reference price is below the strike price, the producer receives a payment for the difference from the counterparty.

The Government's stated position that the GSP mechanism must be funded by the aviation industry, following the 'polluter pays' principle. A levy will be charged on aviation fuel suppliers, who will pass on the costs to its offtaker airlines, who will apply costs to flight ticket prices. The user of civil aviation therefore ultimately pays. This is akin to the levy on renewable electricity CfDs which apply to electricity suppliers, who indirectly pass on the costs to electricity consumers.

DfT considers that the revenue certainty mechanism is likely to lower the cost of capital of SAF production plants, meaning producers could sell SAF at a lower market price than in the absence of the revenue certainty mechanism. However, producers and fuel suppliers will incur payments back to the counterparty or by levy payments, depending on the difference between the market price and the strike price of SAF.

DfT's current estimates of the potential impact on airline ticket prices of the revenue certainty mechanism show that the cost per passenger is likely to be limited and in line with the usual market variation of ticket prices.

Next steps

The consultation period on the funding of the GSP ended on 31 March, and we await the results from DfT. The Government's expectation is that all required legislation to implement the GSP will be in place by the end of 2026. Further engagement will be expected before final legislation is passed. Beyond the question of how the GSP will be funded (which is the subject of the current consultation), other key questions that will need to be answered include:",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white/aviation-teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 13:58:40.695518

It is co-published here with permission.

Less than a year after announcing plans to establish a hydrogen-based aviation fuel hub at Pittsburgh International Airport, Pennsylvania-based natural gas producer CNX has quietly taken down the website on which it advertised the hub.

The move comes as the fate of the much-vaunted hydrogen industry — seen by the Biden administration as a way to power America while reducing climate-altering emissions — is in upheaval.

While a Biden-era rule dealt a blow to those in the gas and oil industry hoping to invest in hydrogen technology and offered greater financial incentives to the renewable energy sector, President Donald Trump is showing preference for fossil fuel-powered hydrogen. Meanwhile, the fate of those Biden-era tax credits — whether for renewable energy or fossil fuel — is up in the air as congress wades through the budget reconciliation process.

Under Trump’s guidance, the Department of Energy has indicated it plans to kill Biden-era funding for four renewable-powered hydrogen hubs in primarily Democratic regions while retaining funds for fossil fuel-powered hubs in mostly red states, such as South Dakota, Ohio and Kentucky.

California, along with Oregon, Washington and other regions, are on the Department of Energy’s “cut” list, according to Politico, which said it obtained a spreadsheet of the projects.

More from Capital & Main

If the recommendations are ultimately adopted by the Trump administration, Pennsylvania would very much become a state divided. While a proposed hub in the Appalachian region that would run on fossil fuels is marked for approval, a hub mostly reliant on renewable energy near Philadelphia is marked for denial.

The seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs were a main plank of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, a $7 billion effort to establish a national network of hydrogen producers to slow the use of the fossil fuels largely blamed for global warming.

But with four of the hubs eliminated, the envisioned national hydrogen grid would become a patchwork, seemingly drawn along political lines and primarily powered by polluting sources of energy.

“The hydrogen hubs program was intended to spur innovations and demonstrations on how best to advance hydrogen as a tool in the clean energy economy,” said Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate & Energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Blatantly co-opting these funds for use as handouts to political supporters and favored polluters would be shameful, and fully undermine the program’s ability to achieve those aims.”

While the Pennsylvania hub fueled by natural gas would use methane to provide energy for the production of so-called blue hydrogen, the other hub would use renewable energy such as wind and solar to produce what’s known as green hydrogen. By itself, the burning of hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide emissions.

CNX was originally involved in the former hub, known as ARCH2, but told the Pittsburgh Business Times in March that it had paused involvement in the project because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding. CNX’s name was also deleted from the ARCH2 website.

CNX did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the hydrogen hub and the sustainable aviation fuel site in Pittsburgh. A spokesperson for the airport said it “is continuing to move forward with its plans to become one of the first airports to have sustainable fuel production on-site.”

CNX was initially one of 15 companies enlisted in the hub, with plans to contribute “low carbon” natural gas to power hydrogen production, which entails using steam to draw off the hydrogen atoms from methane molecules, an expensive and energy intensive process.

But the company’s evolving relationship with the hydrogen industry appears to have soured when the Biden administration finalized a long-awaited federal rule on a tax credit for hydrogen production called 45V.

That final rule, CNX argued, was “overly restrictive,” and failed “to create sufficient economic incentives” for the company to expand its production of methane released from abandoned coal mines, which it said was key to the growing hydrogen economy. CNX pitched its involvement in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel project in Pittsburgh as being dependent upon the outcome of the 45V rule.

“We saw the fossil fuel industry view 45V as a lucrative chance for profit,” McNamara said. “Not by truly reducing emissions, but by introducing loopholes that made it easier to qualify.”

CNX had previously lobbied for the intricacies of 45V to work out in its favor. A little more than a year ago, a CNX lobbyist pushed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office to lobby the federal government to ensure the Treasury Department’s hydrogen rule was lucrative for coal mine methane — a request to which the Shapiro administration agreed, Capital & Main reported at the time.

The value the rule gave to coal mine-derived natural gas came down to a series of arcane specifics in a formula that measures life-cycle emissions from beginning to end of the creation of a single kilogram of hydrogen.

“The wheels are coming off,” O’Leary said. “Even after subsidies are taken into account, the economics still aren’t there to make many of these projects work.”

CNX urged the Treasury Department to treat coal mine methane as carbon-negative with the assumption that it would otherwise leak into the atmosphere from inactive coal mines, releasing a more potent greenhouse gas than if it were captured and burned, which would release carbon dioxide. (Both are greenhouse gases, but methane is well understood to be around 80 times more potent in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe.) By ascribing to this captured methane a negative value, a tiny portion of it could be blended into a natural gas hydrogen feedstock and qualify for the highest tier of the 45V tax incentive, the same level as hydrogen produced with renewable energy.

But the final rule went against the pleas of CNX and companies like it, including the ARCH2 hub itself, which urged the Treasury Department to pass a methane-friendly rule in 2024, arguing it could “lead to a loss of $6 billion in private investments” otherwise and have “far-reaching consequences” for the hydrogen industry.

“It’s like the Treasury Department went out of its way to say, ‘We hear what you’re saying. And the answer is no,’” said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute.

The ruling was seen as a win for environmentalists, who urged the Treasury Department to ensure that any projects receiving subsidies under the guise of being “clean” were in fact clean. They feared CNX’s proposal, and that of other fossil fuel producers, would’ve given natural-gas based hydrogen a tax boost equal to that for renewable, emissions-free sources of hydrogen.

How and whether the rule will be upheld by the Trump administration — which has shown strong support for fossil fuels and a general disdain for renewable energy — remains an open question, and one of concern to environmentalists. According to Bloomberg, the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade group, has lobbied the White House to ensure fossil fuels can qualify for the highest tier of the hydrogen tax credit.

O’Leary sees CNX’s apparent exit from ARCH2 as a sign of the hub’s strained economics. In October, O’Leary authored a paper in which he noted that the hub had lost four of its development partners, while a handful of others were showing signs of financial stress. “This is not a resume that inspires confidence among prospective investors,” O’Leary wrote. CNX’s reluctance to move forward signals a broader trend within the industry, O’Leary said in an interview with Capital & Main.

“The wheels are coming off,” O’Leary said. “Even after subsidies are taken into account, the economics still aren’t there to make many of these projects work.”

Another project development partner for ARCH2, KeyState Energy, is also showing signs of uncertainty. In February, a primary customer for its blue hydrogen, Nikola Corporation, a transportation company that had planned to use the hydrogen for a zero-emission truck fleet, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company plans to sell its assets.

KeyState CEO Perry Babb told Capital & Main the company had pivoted from its energy production project with Nikola to a new ammonia fertilizer project that has a committed customer, and will still rely on hydrogen and receive funds from ARCH2. The first payment from the hubs program has been doled out and KeyState will invoice for reimbursement soon, he said.

Babb said he still meets regularly with the remaining ARCH2 project partners, who are “all positive in expressing a way forward.” But he noted that, for years, he’s weathered regulatory uncertainty; the final 45V rule was the nail in the coffin for Keystate’s original plans to produce blue hydrogen under ARCH2. He said the company has also put its participation in the Pittsburgh Sustainable Aviation Fuel hub “on pause.”

“Last May, I began to notice dozens of hydrogen projects being canceled,” he said. “I had thought that it was essentially because the business case wasn’t sound.

“With the continued uncertainty around tax credits through the end of the Biden administration… we said, ‘That’s it. We’re done. We’re going to go where there’s a market that’s predictable.’”

While failing to find a partner in the Biden-era Treasury Department, CNX could soon turn to the state, where Gov. Shapiro is reupping a $49 million tax credit for hydrogen production as part of his “Lightning Plan,” a six-pronged portfolio of legislation designed to speed up the commonwealth’s clean energy economy.

Though supported by some state environmental groups, the plan caught the ire of others, like Karen Feridun, co-founder of the grassroots Better Path Coalition, who said in a statement that the Lightning Plan would “continue and even expand fossil fuel production.” On March 11, a group of Democratic senators and representatives introduced 12 cosponsorship memos, six in each chamber, carrying out Shapiro’s plan.

“He’s going to do whatever he needs to do to try to keep [hydrogen] going,” Feridun said of Shapiro in an interview with Capital & Main. “It’s a nice way to kind of provide cover for having a continued fossil fuel plan,” one that “sounds really good to voters.”

Should ARCH2 unravel, Feridun fears grassroots environmentalists would be tasked with tracking individual projects, without the cohesion of a hub offering guidance. Even so, she said there never was “a clear map that defined what the footprint of all of this was,” which left frontline communities in the dark.

Like O’Leary, Danny Cullenward, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said he now sees the hydrogen “hype” bubble beginning to burst. Though he believes hydrogen has an important, if niche, place in the clean energy transition, its economics don’t make sense in all uses unless heavily subsidized.

“We basically set up a structure that said, at the end of this rainbow is a giant pot of gold. And everybody said, ‘We’d all like to do that. That all sounds great to us,’” he said. “I think now the cold, hard reality of, ‘Does hydrogen make sense? And in what applications would it make sense?’ is becoming a little bit more real.”

The whiplash of all this impacts Pennsylvania communities, many that are former oil, gas and coal towns learning that major projects they’d once planned for are no longer.

“It’s immensely damaging,” O’Leary said. “State or even county and municipal level governments, they’re making economic development choices based on these expectations.”

“The distraction impact of what’s going on is just staggering.”",https://prospect.org/downloads/22787/download/hydrogen%2020240421.jpg?cb=e5cdf0c40838beec97cc198db61f7495&w=1000,N,,2025-04-22 11:57:11.740155

“For someone in the business of deploying energy solutions, it’s proof that Minnesota isn’t dabbling in clean energy anymore – it’s committing.","Here’s good news about clean energy progress in Minnesota.

A new report shows the state made significant strides in cutting emissions, maintaining a majority-zero-carbon power mix, and reducing reliance on imported electricity.

The newly released 2025 Minnesota Energy Factsheet was developed by nonpartisan, non-profit Clean Energy Economy Minnesota and the Business Council for Sustainable Energy. The research came from BloombergNEF and data from the Minnesota Department of Commerce.

Oftentimes accomplishments that are made in the clean energy effort are overlooked. Bemoosting awareness can be a slow, tedious process and getting the public excited about the progress can be difficult. That’s the point of this editorial.

This is the fifth consecutive year that zero-carbon sources – renewables and nuclear – have provided the majority of Minnesota’s electricity, reaching 53% in 2024, well ahead of the national average of 42%.

Highlights from the 2025 Minnesota Energy Factsheet include:

Record-low power sector emissions: Minnesota cut power sector carbon emissions by 4% from 2023 to 2024, reaching a level 52% below 2005, far ahead of the national average reduction of 38%.

Reduced electricity imports: Imported electricity fell to just 11% of total use in 2024, down from 13% the previous year, demonstrating stronger in-state energy production and reliability.

Consistent renewable generation: Renewable energy made up one-third of all electricity generated in 2024. In the past decade, coal’s share has dropped from 43% to 20%, while renewables and zero-carbon sources have steadily risen.

Energy efficiency leadership: Minnesota was once again ranked No. 1 in the Midwest and No. 10 nationally by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE) for overall energy efficiency.

Rising productivity: Since 2001, Minnesota’s energy productivity has grown by 37%, including a 9% gain in the past five years — meaning the state is using energy more efficiently to generate economic value.

Consumer savings: Businesses and households saved more than $307 million in energy costs from the Energy Conservation Optimization (ECO) Act during 2021 and 2022.

EV growth and market shifts: Minnesota had 65,679 electric vehicles on the road as of November 2024. While total EV registrations grew, new registrations fell 44% from a record-high In 2023 amid a national slowdown in EV sales growth.

Solar surges ahead: Preliminary data shows Minnesota added 388 megawatts of new solar capacity in 2024, a 35% increase over the prior year. Renewables made up 99% of new capacity added in the last five years.

Innovation on the rise: Minnesota is positioning itself as a hub for next-generation energy technologies, including the production of clean hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

In a news release, Gregg Mast, executive director of Clean Energy Economy MN, noted that this year’s factsheet underscores how Minnesota’s consistent, long-term commitment to clean energy is delivering real results.

“From driving emissions to a new record low, to generating the majority of our power in-state and carbon-free, Minnesota continues to prove that smart policy and business innovation can go hand-in-hand to build an affordable, reliable, and resilient energy future.”

Minnesota Commerce Deputy Commissioner of Energy Resources Pete Wyckoff said the 2025 Factsheet is a clear picture of Minnesota's clean energy economy on the rise. “Minnesota is making the transition to more homegrown energy that is more affordable, cleaner, and reliable. We are saving energy and saving money for all Minnesotans. And we are creating jobs for a clean energy future.”

Corey Orehek, Ziegler Energy Solutions’ senior business developer, said that what stood out to him was that 99% of new capacity added over the last five years came from renewables. “That’s not just momentum – it’s market transformation,” he said. “For someone in the business of deploying energy solutions, it’s proof that Minnesota isn’t dabbling in clean energy anymore – it’s committing. That level of clarity helps us invest, hire, and build with confidence.”",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/591ddee/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1500+0+0/resize/1706x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffcc-cue-exports-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdlonline%2Fbinary%2FOpinion_binary_4602648.png,N,,2025-04-22 08:56:45.584969

We won’t scale these technologies without demand; you can’t sell a product that no one wants to buy.","We sat down with Rory Brown, CEO of Airhive, a company making bold moves in the direct air capture (DAC) space.

Airhive is developing an innovative, low-energy approach to carbon removal, with an ambitious goal of capturing 1 million tons of CO2. Rory shares insights on how strategic partnerships — including collaborations with Coca-Cola, Deep Sky, and others — are helping Airhive accelerate its technology and scale its impact.

We also dig into why strong market demand is critical for carbon removal to reach meaningful scale, and what it will take for DAC to move from niche innovation to a core pillar of climate action.

“We’ll see an influx of corporate demand for CDR,” | RSS.com

How did the idea for Airhive come about?

After working in a number of low income and conflict-affected countries in Africa and Asia in the 2010s, it was clear and obvious that climate change was a tangible fact of life in these countries and was contributing to a myriad of challenges they face – poverty, political violence, weak governance etc.

I moved back to the UK just before the lockdowns with an intent to formally study climate change, and in 2020 did a climate and energy-focused degree at University College London while working in what was my final job in my old career. It was a brilliant degree, and one key takeaway was how much the climate models that chart pathways to limiting temperature increases to Paris Agreement levels rely on technologies that remove carbon from the atmosphere; the numbers for what we need this century are pretty sobering, and almost certainly understated because the models also assume a pace of decarbonisation that has not been demonstrated in practice.

But this was at a time when these removal technologies were few and barely out of the lab. So I thought maybe I could build something better. I am not, however, an engineer, which you pretty much do need to be to create a new technology. So in 2022 I went hunting for co-founders, and was lucky enough to meet Jasper, who was finishing his PhD in industrial decarbonisation. We spoke about direct air capture, which I was convinced was the most scalable of the removal technologies, and it triggered some ideas in his mind; remarkably, the core technology concept has not really changed from those first ideas, although they have gone from a few equations to some pretty large pilots in less than three years.

Since starting in the summer of 2022, we’ve gone from garage prototype to installing our first demonstration system in Alberta, Canada at present, which will be one of the largest DAC systems in the world and one whose unit economics and resource uses (energy, water, capture materials) we think stack up really well against what else is out there. We’ve also built strategic partnerships to decarbonise products, including a partnership with Coca-Cola Europacific Partners to provide air captured carbon dioxide for fizzy drinks through a large commercial pilot at one of their bottling plants in Europe.

What makes Airhive unique?

Our technology USP comes through the use of something called a fluidised bed. This is a type of process technology commonly used in industry for applications such as mineral processing and drying foods and medication, and is particularly good at contacting gases and solids efficiently.

We’re using them in a very unusual way to process large amounts of air with limited energy inputs in a very small box, squeezing down both CAPEX and OPEX. And by using a well-understood and widely used technology with mature supply chains, we’ve been able to move pretty fast on both deployments and in pushing the technology down the cost curve.

Tell us about the food-grade CO2 you produce. How is this process different from your regular DAC process?

We expect our technology to produce very pure carbon dioxide right out of the regeneration system—typically above 98%—thanks to two key factors: we don’t burn any fuels during capture, and we use non-toxic, non-hazardous sorbent materials.

This means the remaining impurities are mostly benign substances, such as nitrogen and water vapour, rather than harmful contaminants like SOx or NOx that can be found in other processes. This clean profile makes it significantly easier to purify our CO₂ to meet food-grade standards of 99.99% purity. We achieve this through a straightforward post-processing step that primarily focuses on removing residual water vapour.

Overall cost matters too, because food-grade CO2 is already a commercially available industrial gas. So a lower price point for a company using the CO2 in their production process is also obviously important.

I think both of these elements contribute to our technology being attractive to businesses like Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, who invested in us in 2023. By installing our DAC systems at food and beverage production facilities, companies can directly capture atmospheric CO₂. If we can get that to a price point that is lower than the CO2 they already procure, then we are providing them cleaner CO2, at a lower price, and with greater supply certainty.

Are you currently providing carbon for sustainable aviation fuel and/or green methanol? What is the demand for these products like at the moment and where do you see it headed in the future?

Not yet. I think e-fuels are an exciting area of innovation in aviation and shipping. The sector is still early, but because of policies like the UK and EU 2030 SAF mandates, there is a sense of a rapidly growing demand – although as with so much of the innovation landscape it will probably take much longer than people think to bring online the many many projects that’d be needed to meet such medium-term targets.

There are a couple of key advantages that air captured CO2 has as a feedstock into the production of those e-fuels. One is that if you are producing green hydrogen onsite, that presupposes that there is green power that could also be used to produce the CO2, which is a much smaller overall input in the production process. And because CO2 is a small relative input, even if DAC is more expensive than other sources of CO2, the overall price of the fuel doesn’t move around a lot at different CO2 price points. So as a technology that can be sited at the fuel production plant, DAC would give you scalability, synergy with the rest of the process, and security of supply.

What are some of the key partnerships or collaborations that have been vital to Airhive’s success so far?

We’re very proud to be working closely with both AP Ventures and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (CCEP), who both came onboard to support Airhive during our pre-seed funding round in 2023. We also have a key project partnership with Deep Sky, which develops and operates large-scale carbon removal projects using various technologies, as well as additional project partners we cannot yet name but are excited to announce if and when we greenlight those projects. We’ve also been very grateful for the support of one of our first customers Frontier, and the recognition as a Top 20 finalist for the XPRIZE Carbon Removal, which pushed us to bring our 1,000 tonne per annum demonstration plant on faster than we had planned.

Airhive has set out to remove 1 million tons of CO2 annually by 2030. How do you plan on achieving that scale?

Let’s say 1 million tons in 2030 is a stretch target. But if we’re talking practically speaking about large scale as soon as we can, there are a few key steps. The first is developing our standardised module and proving that works in first commercial projects; while we expect to innovate and iterate designs across projects, that first standardisation is crucial for bringing down technology risk.

Next is building out our project execution capability, which wraps in site development, technology, supply chain, construction, commercial and financing. Startups typically start as technology companies but we ultimately have to deliver projects, and that is a very different, and equally difficult, practice; even mature organisations can routinely deliver projects badly.

Beyond having those capabilities, the key limiting factors to reaching that kind of scale will be demand for the removal credits, and financing – and those two are closely connected, as without bankable offtake contracts from buyers it will be impossible to get the debt financing that major capital projects like these need to be developed.

The UK government’s carbon capture approach has recently come under fire. How do you see this affecting carbon capture and removal in the country?

There has been a debate for decades whether governments should support carbon capture, and the rationale for it has shifted in that time; initially the concept was more focused on capturing emissions from power plants, and more recently this has shifted to decarbonising heavy industry as clean energy has made such progress on the energy generation side.

There aren’t yet good alternatives to existing ways of producing things like cement and steel at large scales, so retrofitting existing industrial facilities with point source capture remains an important part of the UK’s and other countries’ decarbonisation path.

In the last decade, the emergence of removal technologies like DAC and BECCS means there is an additional rationale for the development of the CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure needed for point source carbon capture. I think the UK and other governments get this, and will proceed even as robust debate over how much we invest in carbon capture or any other transition technology continues.

What is your view on the development of carbon markets and their importance for CDR?

We won’t scale these technologies without demand; you can’t sell a product that no one wants to buy. There has been some great progress from companies and coalitions of companies like Frontier in creating early demand that has allowed the market to go from non-existence to existence in the past decade.

But at some point it will be necessary for government-regulated markets to be created that contribute to properly pricing carbon emissions. A few countries are looking at compliance markets, notably Japan and the UK, and I think there will be a few by the early 2030s. Design is tricky though; combining them with emissions allowances in an emissions trading system seems complex and challenging to me, and you have to be careful not to just be a dead weight on important industrial sectors that are critical for supporting jobs, consumption and economic growth. From the experience of the EU’s ETS, it could well take a couple of iterations and some significant setbacks and tweaks to figure out a viable market arrangement.",https://carbonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rory_Brown_1736780827146001Zuqh_2025011303091140.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 08:56:56.794226

The MoU signing saw CCESB founder and managing director Tham Weng Kong and Oasis Xtract executive chairman Abdul Rahim Ghouse exchanging documents in the presence of Science, Technology and Innovation Minister Chang Lih Kang at Pulse Grande Hotel Putrajaya.

The partnership will see the integration of CCESB modular cultivation methods and Oasis Xtract’s patented technology to develop a fully-integrated, commercial-scale green fuel production system.

For the uninitiated, microalgae are microscopic, single-celled photosynthetic organisms typically found in freshwater and marine systems.

They are a vital part of the ecosystem, producing a significant amount of the world’s oxygen, while being a source of various compounds with potential application in food, medicine and biofuel production.

According to Tham, the technology is one of its kind for a commercial-scale microalgae cultivation using a closed tank system.

“Hence, we only require a small land space, compared to other systems,” said Tham, adding that the technology is fully Malaysian-owned.

Tham said the algae harvest can be translated into products with high market value.

“The applications include biomass for electricity generation and animal feed. This is suitable to be further processed to become biofuel, biodiesel, sustainable aviation fuel, bioplastics or even oil for cosmetics and pharmaceutical purposes,” he added.

He noted the company will also commence construction of five-acre commercial-scale cultivation facilities using a closed tank system in June.

Chang lauded the partnership, and the MoU would strengthen the nation’s innovation ecosystem, advance green technology and ensure long-term resilience through sustainable economic drivers.

“I had the opportunity to visit CCE’s facility in Semenyih last year, and I must say, I was genuinely impressed. Their pilot algae cultivation system is designed, developed, and managed entirely in-house. It is a testament to what local innovation and persistence can achieve.

“What is even more impressive is that their algae cultivation does not need sunlight, so it can run smoothly without being affected by the weather. This kind of heterotrophic cultivation, the closed-tank method, helps ensure consistent and high-quality results and is a big step forward in green biotechnology,” he added.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/mmail.com.my/5086d8b95eef3a12005f682417357ea0,N,,2025-04-22 08:57:01.097177

Can you share your journey into the industry?

I was an investment banker for more than 16 years, mostly for Jefferies and with a focus on the aerospace, defense and government services industry. After that, I spent a couple years in private equity at Macquarie, where I led the acquisition of Sentient Flight Group. My operating experience was gained as president of Universal Weather and Aviation, at the time a global business aviation services company involved in international trip support services, global contract fuel and FBO services in over 20 countries around the world. After I left Universal Weather & Aviation, I remained as a board member for a couple years and in 2015, I represented the company in the sale of its only USA-based FBOs in Hawaii. It was the combination of all these experiences that gave me the knowledge and confidence to ultimately start Modern Aviation. Emmanuel Yapo, my co-founder, and I began discussing our plans for starting a FBO business in 2016.

Can you tell me about Modern Aviation?

We founded Modern Aviation in February 2018 with our first acquisition in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Our goal was to challenge the status quo in the FBO industry by providing world-class customer service with a strong focus on safety. Our corporate team is largely virtual so we could attract top talent without making them move to wherever we chose to headquarter the company. Our corporate team’s jobs are to help support our team members at our FBO locations and to make them even more successful, so we meet at our locations, which is where we need to be. As a result, I believe we’ve attracted better talent. Our network currently includes 18 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico, and we are continuing to grow. Our locations range from Seattle to San Juan and Westhampton to Fort Worth.

How has your leadership approach evolved throughout your career?

My leadership approach has changed significantly over my career and even in the past seven years since we started Modern Aviation. During the first few years of Modern’s history, I was mostly focused on identifying and closing acquisitions to get the business started. As a result, I was executing acquisitions, relying primarily on my investment banking and private equity skills and experience. However, once we closed our first few acquisitions, we were an operating business, and I had to also focus on operations and developing a culture that would differentiate Modern in the industry and attract the best and brightest to the company.

We had to establish processes so that we could provide world-class customer service and operate safely. I also had to begin building a top tier management team to execute our strategy. My leadership approach can be defined as a human-centric leadership model. Since our people provide our services and interact with our customers every day, we need to create and sustain a culture that guides team members’ behaviors and empowers them to act. We believe we have a great culture at Modern that attracts the right employees and enables us to differentiate what we do and how we do it.

What are the key responsibilities of your role at Modern Aviation?

As the CEO it is my responsibility to set the company’s strategy and make sure we have the team in place to execute. I consider myself our chief culture officer and am very focused on ensuring that we maintain our culture, which has created much of our success, as we continue to grow. Our front-line team members are providing services to our customers 24/7/365 and my job is to make sure they have the tools, training, resources, information and the values to operate safely and wow our customers. And to have fun, most of the time, while they are doing it.

What are some of the biggest challenges currently facing the private aviation sector?

The industry is working to address the environmental challenges it faces through electrification of ground service equipment and sustainable aviation fuel. Extreme weather events have created more uncertainty and increased property insurance costs for the FBO industry. Another challenge facing operators is that there aren’t enough pilots and experienced maintenance personnel, so it is difficult to hire in these areas.

What has been your most significant achievement during your time at Modern Aviation?

I think the fact that we’ve grown the company to 18 locations with over 500 employees from a business plan seven years ago is a big achievement. But the most important accomplishment is creating a company that is known for being a great place to work due to its strong team

member-oriented culture. We try to have fun, and we get to work with great people who we chose to work with.

Finally, we’ve seen individuals at Modern grow their careers being smart, working hard, caring about their colleagues and communities, our customers and the company, and always trying to do the right thing when making decisions. When you work for a high growth company, there’s always more to do than there are people to do it.

I’ve been impressed that so many of our people just raised their hands to do more and they have learned more, contributed more and been promoted. Personal growth and career growth are big parts of our culture. This is what makes me most proud.

How does Modern Aviation stand out in the competitive landscape of private aviation?

Modern Aviation is more than just an aggregator of FBO locations. We have worked to build a brand and a culture that are unique among fast growing FBO portfolios. We are more than an FBO offering fuel services and hangar space. We invest in safety by registering all our locations with the International Standard for Business Aircraft Handling (IS-BAH) for its independent safety certification. We believe in creating a culture that fosters a positive working environment for our team members which empowers them to deliver on our mission: to provide our customers with the best experience, every visit.

What emerging trends in the aviation industry do you think will have the most impact?

I think eVTOLs represent an exciting opportunity for the aviation industry to grow its customer base. Semi-private charter companies could be another avenue for growth if they are able to grow their networks and appeal to more customers. Technology could help charter companies and other operators increase efficiencies by reducing dead legs and other costs, which could bring charter costs and pricing down to appeal to a broader customer group. Sustainability is another factor that will impact the industry.

How do you anticipate business aviation changing in the next decade?

Aircraft are getting larger and several new models have been developed and in production or certification. There is demand for larger cabin aircraft with longer ranges. We are already seeing this today, which means there will be increased demand for hangar space. We will see a heavy focus on sustainability in the aviation industry and the electrification of everything from ground service equipment to aircraft.

This will create the need to get more electricity to the airports for charging stations and electricity storage. We will see a focus on the use of advance technology like AI to create efficiencies in flight management and operations, as well as to improve safety.

How is Modern Aviation addressing the growing demand for sustainability in the aviation sector?

We are electrifying our fleet of ground service equipment and taking other actions to reduce our carbon footprint. We are installing LED lighting throughout our campuses to reduce our use of electricity and have put into service the second electric fuel truck in our industry at our Seattle FBO. Sustainable aviation fuel is available in limited supplies in certain markets where there is refining capacity, but it is still at a significantly higher cost than Jet A fuel. In time, with additional supply, the cost will come down and it will be available more broadly. Modern also uses sustainable materials and methods in its construction projects to limit the environmental impact.

What has been the most valuable lesson you’ve learned throughout your career in aviation?

While the business aviation industry is very large, from a people perspective it’s very small. It is a relationship oriented sector and there are just a few degrees of separation between people. As a result, there is nowhere to hide in our industry, so we need to take a long-term view on how we run the business and how we treat team members, customers, vendors and airports. I believe in transparency with all constituents. We say what we will do and do what we said. We set expectations and meet or exceed them. And we always look for win-win relationships.

Modern Aviation has expanded significantly in recent years. Where do you see the company in the next five years?

We intend to continue to grow the business through acquisitions, building more hangars at our existing locations and responding to airport RFPs (request for proposals). We will focus on adding new FBOs we believe are strategically important and add value to our network, enabling us to better serve our customers.

What advice would you give to someone interested in starting a career in business aviation?

I’d suggest they be open and flexible to new opportunities as the industry is growing and always changing. Most important is to get a foothold in the industry and then network and build relationships.",https://s44876.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Carmen_Mark_0E1A0216xxx-_EV-skyline_headshot-scaled-e1745318115967.jpg,N,,2025-04-22 08:57:09.643659

Simultaneously, the company is advancing green hydrogen, battery storage, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives to reinforce its leadership in decarbonization and industrial resilience.

Strategic Pivot to Strengthen Efficiency and Cut Emissions

The Antwerp site, in operation for over 75 years, remains TotalEnergies’ most efficient integrated refining and petrochemical platform in Europe. Under pressure from petrochemical overcapacity and an evolving energy landscape, the company plans to shut down its older steam cracker, which has lost a major third-party ethylene off-take agreement. The cracker’s output was not integrated with TotalEnergies' downstream operations, unlike its more modern counterpart that serves facilities in both Antwerp and Feluy.

Crucially, the shutdown is not expected to lead to job losses. All 253 affected employees will be offered internal transfers or retirement packages, with consultations beginning in late April in compliance with Belgian labor laws.

Green Hydrogen and SAF Projects Position Site for Long-Term Relevance

As part of its energy transition strategy, TotalEnergies is investing heavily in low-carbon technologies at the Antwerp site. The company will utilize 130 MW of capacity from Air Liquide’s planned 200 MW electrolyzer to generate 15,000 tons of green hydrogen annually. This hydrogen, produced using electricity from the OranjeWind offshore wind farm, is expected to cut CO? emissions at the site by up to 150,000 tons per year by 2027. This aligns with European Union RED III targets for renewable transport energy.

In addition, the platform will begin producing 50,000 tons of SAF annually via coprocessing starting in 2025, helping aviation clients reduce their emissions in line with global net-zero goals.

Grid Support and Electrification: A Model for Industrial Decarbonization

To support Belgium’s energy transition and grid stability, TotalEnergies commissioned a 25 MW/75 MWh battery storage system in Antwerp—the largest in its European portfolio. This project helps offset renewable intermittency and represents a growing role for battery technology in industrial settings.

ANTWERP, Belgium--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- TotalEnergies’ (Paris:TTE) (LSE:TTE) (NYSE:TTE) Antwerp platform provides an update on its investments for the future and announces plan to reconfigure its petrochemicals operations to strengthen competitiveness. A key industrial site for TotalEnergies for more than 75 years, the Antwerp platform is based on an integrated business model, which guarantees the resilience of its operations.

“By adapting and investing regularly in our Antwerp site, we’re securing its long-term future and ensuring that this integrated refining and petrochemicals platform remains TotalEnergies’ most efficient in Europe. Whether the aim is to meet market challenges or contribute to decarbonization and the energy transition, the platform can be reconfigured so that it remains competitive and continues to provide jobs well into the future,” said Ann Veraverbeke, Managing Director of TotalEnergies Antwerp.

Adapting to accelerate decarbonization of the platform and the transportation industry

Thanks to green hydrogen, the Antwerp platform is speeding up its own decarbonization. As part of a 200 MW Air Liquide electrolyzer project, TotalEnergies has signed a tolling agreement for 130 MW dedicated to the annual production of 15,000 tons of green hydrogen for its Antwerp platform. Upstream of the electrolyzer, TotalEnergies will supply green electricity thanks to its OranjeWind offshore wind project. Scheduled for the end of 2027, the project will reduce CO2 emissions at the Antwerp site by up to 150,000 tons per year and contribute to the European targets (RED III) for renewable energy in transport.

Thanks to the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), Antwerp will contribute to its aviation customers’ energy transition, helping them meet the challenge of reducing their carbon footprint. An initial project to produce 50,000 tons a year of SAF via coprocessing will be implemented at the Antwerp platform in 2025. Coprocessing is a SAF production method that enables the simultaneous treatment of hydrocarbons and biomass in a conventional refining unit.

Thanks to process electrification and battery-based energy storage, the platform is contributing respectively to the decarbonization of its industrial operations and to the growing need to balance Belgian and European high-voltage transmission grids. With a power rating of 25 MW and capacity of 75 MWh, Antwerp’s battery storage system is TotalEnergies’ biggest in Europe. Commissioned last year, it helps offset the intermittency of renewable energies to encourage their development.

Adapting to meet changing market needs and address overcapacity in petrochemicals

Alongside these future-focused developments, the Antwerp platform is also facing considerable overcapacity in the petrochemicals market. In the light of the significant surplus of ethylene expected in Europe, TotalEnergies thus intends to cease operating its oldest steam cracker in Antwerp by end-2027.

Indeed, the latter was historically dependent on a major contract with a third-party user of the ethylene produced, which recently decided not to renew it by end 2027. As a result, the steam cracker, which is not integrated to TotalEnergies' downstream polymer production, will no longer have any outlets for its ethylene production.

The unit shutdown will allow the site to focus on its more recent steam cracker, whose ethylene production is entirely consumed by TotalEnergies' industrial units in Antwerp and Feluy. The reconfiguration will be conducted without any layoffs.

The 253 employees concerned will each be offered a solution aligned with their personal situation: retirement or an internal transfer to another position based at the Antwerp site. This project is subject to the legally required employee consultation and notification process, which TotalEnergies will initiate with representatives of Antwerp platform employees in late April.

Competitive Landscape:

Market Players to Focus On Launch of Innovative Fuels to Cater to Wider Audience

Some of the top companies driving the global sustainable aviation fuel market growth are focusing on developing and launching a wide range of eco-friendly fuels for different industries. They are increasing their investments in research & development programs to find out about the latest technologies and use them to manufacture SAF.

Notable Industry Development:

September 2024- TotalEnergies signed an agreement with Air France-KLM to help the former deliver around 1.5 million tons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) over a period of 10 years until 2035. This deal was one of the biggest SAF purchase agreements for Air France-KLM to date. It strengthened the airline’s dominance in the use of SAF, accounting for 17% and 16% of the global SAF production in 2022 and 2023, respectively.

Even as the market environment for climate action appears to be more challenging, I am optimistic – there is lots of momentum across the business travel industry.","Mounting pressure around sustainability disclosures have led travel managers to add emissions management to their (already long) list of priorities. But now that dynamics are changing on both sides of the Atlantic, will this remain top of mind?

I believe the answer is ‘yes’, because beyond the regulatory or moral imperative, sustainable business is good business. Finding ways to travel more sustainably – in a way that’s efficient, safe and affordable – is critical to our industry’s long-term competitiveness.

Responsible travel helps to future-proof organisations, making them more resilient. However, we have seen the environment both in the US and Europe change over the last few months when it comes to climate action.

Changing dynamics in Europe and the US

Europe has historically relied on a stringent regulatory approach to decarbonise its economy, but recent months have seen a rollback of ambitious policy frameworks. Similarly, where the US leveraged economic incentives to channel investments towards clean tech, this is not expected to continue in the medium-term.

Since the new administrations took office in Europe early December, and in the US at the end of January, they’ve been clear about their intention to focus on boosting their respective competitive position on a global scale, as well as their energy independence. This directly challenged climate legislations passed under previous mandates.

In the EU, well-intentioned ESG requirements resulted in concerns around Europe’s ability to compete in a world where regional approaches diverge. Most recently, these concerns led to significant roll backs of regulations such as the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). While the decision to delay its rollout and exempt smaller companies was criticised by some organisations, many also welcome the simplification efforts, that will allow companies to shift their efforts from reporting to action.

Meanwhile, in the US, despite a radical U-turn on the country’s climate commitments, including the Paris Agreement, there is some cautious optimism that some of the tax incentives and funding granted through the Inflation Reduction Act may not disappear totally – as long as they lead to the creation of new domestic jobs. That’s the case for the tax credits granted for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production. Some state regulations like the Climate Accountability Package in California are also staying in place. Past efforts to build similar mandates at Federal level are however indefinitely stalled.

If the fragmentation in mandates and standards across regions was always an issue, the level of uncertainty is now adding additional complexity for organisations operating globally.

Corporates embedding sustainability

Despite these setbacks, evidence shows that companies that have embedded sustainability in their operating models will continue to push forward.

Our research found that almost half of global supplier and TMC respondents surveyed at the start of this year (48 per cent) expect their company will increase their support of sustainability efforts in 2025, while only 4 per cent expect to see a decrease. On the buyer side, a third of the travel managers surveyed (33 per cent) say that investment in sustainability will increase.

However, we continue to see drastic differences between the EU and the US in the way companies integrate sustainable practices in their programmes. For instance, while 50 per cent of European travel buyers expect to implement a sustainable practice element within their programmes this year, that figure is only 21 per cent for North American travel buyers.

We see a similar gap when we asked buyers if they were planning on implementing a new sustainability technology or service. While 34 per cent of European travel buyers said it is something they will pursue in 2025, that figure is only 15 per cent for North American travel buyers. Interestingly, that figure was 56 per cent for buyers in Asia Pacific, showing the region could outpace Europe as a leader in sustainability investments for corporate travel programmes.

Despite differing regional approaches, one thing is clear. Momentum around corporate climate action and carbon reduction strategies can only be achieved if it is fully embedded across an organisation, and it is recognised that a sustainable and responsible approach makes good commercial sense.

As an industry, we can demonstrate that business travel that is more productive, more personal and more responsible makes for good business. As an industry, we need to strengthen metrics and KPIs around more responsible travel. This way we can ensure it becomes embedded in organisational processes in a more systemic way.

Cross-industry partnerships can deliver value. The GBTA Sustainability Acceleration Global Benchmark provided in-depth analysis for the first time last year, highlighting exactly where the industry stands on its progress with sustainability.

The Benchmark figure was a wake-up call, revealing there is a long way to go and more urgent action is needed. The industry average score of corporates was 1.3, with ‘0’ being 'no action' and ‘5’ representing 'leading practice' on action to mitigate business travel emissions. However, action is happening.

Even as the market environment for climate action appears to be more challenging, I am optimistic – there is lots of momentum across the business travel industry.",https://ik.imgkit.net/3vlqs5axxjf/BTNE/uploadedImages/4_Learn/Delphine%20Millot%20300x300.jpeg?tr=w-1200%2Cfo-auto,N,,2025-04-22 05:56:49.945651

Supplier ABO Energy Clean Tech Oulu (Oulu GH2) European Union Gasgrid Finland Ltd. University of Oulu Share","The German ABO Energy group has been granted a planning reservation to build a hydrogen production plant in Oulu in northern Finland. In the preliminary plan, the new hydrogen plant would have an electrolyser with a maximum capacity of 600 MW. Implementation would take place in 2–3 phases.

In addition to hydrogen production, the company is exploring the possibility of producing methanol and sustainable aviation fuel (E‑SAF) in Oulu. The feasibility of synthetic fuel production depends on the availability of biogenic carbon dioxide. ABO Energy would offer the waste heat generated for use as district heating in the Oulu region.

The first phase is planned to be operational around 2034–2036. For the new green transition industrial area of Pyyryväinen, the plant would be implemented by ABO Energy Suomi Oy, whose parent company is ABO Energy KGaA of Germany.

“Finland is an incredibly attractive destination for investment, thanks to our abundant, affordable green electricity and exceptional capacity to scale up production. Our unique strength as a company lies in our ability to supply renewable energy to hydrogen projects directly through our wind energy portfolio,” says Amanda Cardwell of ABO Energy Suomi Oy.

Electricity in Finland is among the cheapest in Europe. The Oulu region is the largest producer of renewable electricity in Finland.

Several other hydrogen production and H2 derivative projects have already been initiated in the Oulu region. Gasgrid Finland plans to establish a hydrogen transport infrastructure to connect Oulu’s hydrogen production with the rest of Finland and other European countries, including Germany. Other hydrogen production companies have also decided to invest in Oulu, attracted by the international port of Oulu, biogenic carbon dioxide sources and the European TEN‑T transport network. The University of Oulu is also a centre of hydrogen research, providing the city with both high-quality hydrogen expertise and a large pool of hydrogen specialists to meet companies’ workforce needs.

This land reservation is only a preliminary decision; a final investment decision will be made later.

About Oulu GH2

This small seaplane operator links the Red Sea International to the different island resorts with a fleet of four amphibious Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft.
In fact, having its own airline allows Red Sea Global to be active in the aviation sustainability challenge in a more hands-on fashion.
But besides this explicit requirement, Red Sea Global aims to lead by example.","Red Sea Global stands as a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Vision 2030 strategy.

Backed by the Public Investment Fund (PIF), the Kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, this gigantic tourism development project is one of the flagships of Saudi Arabia’s newfound embrace of tourism as a means to rid its economy of its dependence on oil.

A Belgium-sized area along Saudi Arabia’s western coastline, along with several dozen adjacent islands, have been designated for development as one of the world’s top seaside leisure destinations.

It is expected that, by 2030, up to 50 high-end resorts will have opened their doors across 22 islands – of which nine are already being developed – plus six mainland sites located within the territory managed by the development company.

And, as is often the case in Saudi Arabia’s ambitious development projects, aviation plays a key role in this story.

While calling it a ‘greenfield’ site may be a bit of stretch on account of its sandy desert location, Red Sea Global is being built from scratch at a location far from any major population center, so it was necessary to build a dedicated airport too.

Designed by renowned British architecture studio Foster & Partners and managed by Irish airport operator daa, Red Sea International Airport (RSI) is therefore the international gateway which connects the newly developed area to the rest of the world.

Although construction work was still ongoing as of April 2025, Red Sea International Airport has been operational since September 2023 and has already been welcoming guests headed for the few resorts which are already open for business.

What makes this project particularly interesting for industry observers is the fact that, being aware of the growing concern about the environmental impact of aviation, its promoters have designed it with sustainability as its core guiding principle.

Could Red Sea International Airport become a blueprint for other airports?

AeroTime spoke with Michael White, its Chief Commercial Officer (CCO), and Abdulaziz Alabdan, Executive Director for Airport Operations at Red Sea Global, in order to learn more about the airport and its approach to sustainability.

Both executives highlighted the fact that the airport cannot be understood in isolation from the surrounding tourism development project. As such, it is designed to act as a sort of ‘reception desk’ for the neighboring resorts.

“Passengers are guests from the very moment they land,” explained Alabdan.

The airport’s premium traffic profile and limited number of passengers (even if all resorts operated at capacity, airport traffic would not be expected to exceed one million passengers per year in each direction) makes it easier to provide the sort of “private terminal” experience that its developers seek.

However, Red Sea International Airport has incorporated a number of new ideas that White and Alabdan hope will also set new standards in passenger experience for other airports – in Saudi Arabia, which is investing heavily in this type of infrastructure, and beyond.

For example, at a time when many new airports have chosen to centralize functions in one single large terminal, Red Sea International has opted for a decentralized five-node structure. Each of these nodes acts as a self-contained independent terminal, doing away with some bottlenecks and shortening walking distances.

Another singularity – though this one may be rather more difficult to replicate in more mainstream settings – is that the baggage reclaim area has been pared down to the minimum, with luggage being forwarded directly to the hotel.

But if there is one area in which both executives take pride, it is the sustainability focus of the project. This is a central theme in all Red Sea Global marketing materials, as the Saudi company aims to demonstrate that world-class luxury and economic growth is compatible with environmental stewardship.

But wouldn’t it be more sustainable to just leave the area undeveloped?

This is a question that executives at Red Sea Global are often asked, Alabdan said. He referred to the fact that Saudi Arabia is pivoting its economy away from its dependence on oil and extractive industries and how tourism can provide an alternative. This move not only provides economic opportunities for the country and its people, but also does so in a way that is, as a whole, less impactful on the environment than the current economic model.

“If you wish to keep having economic growth, it is better to do so in a way that follows the best possible environmental practices,” he explained.

In fact, Red Sea Global takes the concept of sustainable development even further and discusses ‘regenerative development’. This, Abdalan explained, means proactively looking for ways to leave an area better off than it would have been had development not taken place.

For example, he pointed out that only 1% of the area designated for the Red Sea Global project is actually going to be developed (there are over 90 islands in total in the vicinity). A number of environmental programs, from mangrove restoration to marine wildlife protection, are going to be rolled out in the other 99%.

Setting sustainability standards

As for the airport, Red Sea Global has opted for an integral approach, while acknowledging the current technological limitations when it comes to the main source of emissions: actual aircraft movements.

In this regard, the company is opting to invest in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In February 2025, Red Sea Global became the first Saudi airport to make SAF available at its facilities.

This first fuel shipment was produced by Neste, one of the world’s leading SAF producers, through the HEFA process using cooking oil as feedstock. Red Sea Global then imported it into Saudi Arabia by way of the Arabian Petroleum Supply company (APSCO), which acted as a distributor.

White and Alabdan reflected on the fact that one of the world’s top oil producers is importing SAF. In fact, while there’s currently no domestic production of SAF in Saudi Arabia, Alabdan mentioned that, in order to cover its non-SAF fuel supply needs, Red Sea Global is sourcing some of the so-called ‘low carbon aviation fuel’. This is conventional fossil fuel which has been produced following relatively lower carbon intensive processes.

Alabdan reiterated the developer’s commitment to continue investing in SAF, however.

“SAF is more expensive than conventional fuel, but someone has to start. What we are doing here is create a market signal, driving demand, and paving the way for wider SAF adoption.” he stated, not without adding “Let’s take as much SAF as we can take! Why do we have to wait?”

Despite the limited amounts of SAF available globally, the still relatively small number of flights at the airport, with only three airlines offering scheduled services (Saudia, flynas and flydubai) makes it possible for Red Sea Global to supply SAF in a relatively high blend of 35%.

Red Sea Global’s own local airline, Fly Red Sea, is another consumer of SAF at the airport. This small seaplane operator links the Red Sea International to the different island resorts with a fleet of four amphibious Cessna Caravan 208 aircraft.

In fact, having its own airline allows Red Sea Global to be active in the aviation sustainability challenge in a more hands-on fashion. For example, the developer has been working with a number of advanced air mobility startups, including hydrogen-propulsion developer ZeroAvia, as well as several eVTOL developers, such as Joby, EHang and Archer, to support hydrogen and electric air mobility.

The relatively short distances involved in transferring passengers between the airport and the adjacent island resorts represent a potentially interesting use case of these technologies.

And while Red Sea Global may have little direct influence in the ultimate development of these game-changing technologies, there are areas in which it can roll out much more impactful policies, such as the construction of its own physical infrastructure and the daily operations of the airport.

The airport terminal, for example, has been designed with the goal of obtaining Platinum LEED certification, the highest possible level in the green building certification system developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).

Likewise, Red Sead Global is investing in renewable energy generation to guarantee that the majority – potentially between 80-100% – of the energy used on site at the airport and across the different developments comes from green sources.

We are currently part of groundbreaking work led by Virgin Australia and Viva Energy to reduce greenhouse emissions and carbon emissions.","FLYING might just become sustainable.

As a prime tourism centre of the world, the Whitsundays enjoys almost a million visitors per year.

Around half of our domestic and international guests arrive on flights, and this has continued to be a challenging mode of transport to consider sustainable.

We are absolutely delighted to learn of Whitsunday Coast Airport’s opportunity to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Virgin Australia has partnered with Viva Energy to trial SAF in departing flights from the Whitsunday Coast Airport.

From March to July, 2025, all Virgin flights will use a blend of A1 jet fuel and 30-40 per cent synthetic SAF, made from waste and residue feedstocks.

What is it?

SAF is an alternative fuel made from non-petroleum feedstocks.

By blending 10 per cent to 50 per cent feedstock with conventional jet fuel, emissions are reduced significantly.

Feedstocks can include a variety of renewables, primarily woody biomass including municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, forest waste, wood and energy crops.

Where is it made?

Currently this is made overseas, however, the federal and state governments are partnering to support a homegrown Sustainable Aviation Fuel project that will convert ethanol – made from agricultural waste – into jet fuel.

The development of a Townsville production facility will be capable of producing approximately 110 million litres of low carbon liquid fuels (LCLFs) such as SAF and renewable diesel, annually.

Made from Australian bioethanol, this infrastructure is set to benefit North Queensland greatly, with a substantial economic impact, including 100 regional jobs.

The Townsville plant would reduce domestic aviation carbon emissions by 70 per cent, per litre, removing up to 225,000 tonnes of CO2 per annum.

What benefits are there?

With a goal of net zero by 2050, the international aviation industry has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94 per cent by using 100 per cent SAF.

According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation ICAO, over 360,000 commercial flights, at 46 different airports, have safely used SAF, predominantly in the US and Europe.

What does this mean for the Whitsundays?

We are currently part of groundbreaking work led by Virgin Australia and Viva Energy to reduce greenhouse emissions and carbon emissions.

This trial could lead to a turning point in the entire domestic fleet using sustainable aviation fuel, leading to a drastic drop in Australia’s carbon footprint.

Technip Energies has been awarded the FEED contract, bringing the country closer to scaling sustainable aviation fuel production.

Technip Energies has been awarded a front-end engineering design (FEED) contract by Jet Zero Australia Pty Ltd (Jet Zero) for Project Ulysses, a bioethanol to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project located in Townsville, Australia.

The FEED covers an extensive package of engineering activities, documentation, and planning to refine the project’s cost estimate and develop detailed timelines.

The project aims to produce 102 million liters of SAF and 11 million liters of renewable diesel annually by 2028 using Australian bioethanol and technologies from Technip Energies and LanzaJet. Technip Energies’ Hummingbird® technology converts the bioethanol to sustainable ethylene, and LanzaJet’s alcohol-to-jet technology transforms the ethylene to SAF.

Sylvain Cabalery, SVP Sustainable Fuels, Chemicals & Circularity at Technip Energies, stated, “We are very pleased to see Project Ulysses moving forward to provide the first alcohol-to-jet SAF plant in Australia. With the global aviation industry looking for ways to secure their supply and lower emissions further, Technip Energies and LanzaJet’s integrated technology is a smart solution, bringing energy security while at the same time eliminating up to 70% of greenhouse gas emissions.”

Total D5 RIN generation for the first quarter of 2025 reached 72.4 million. That volume includes 36.42 million generated for naphtha by domestic producers, 28.26 million generated for nonester renewable diesel by domestic producers, 6.74 million generated for ethanol by domestic producers, 789,947 generated for renewable heating oil by domestic producers, 83,683 generated for compressed RNG by domestic producers, 65,823 generated for LPG by domestic producers, and 48,528 generated for RNG by domestic producers.

More than 1.21 billion D6 renewable fuel RINs were generated in March, nearly all for ethanol by domestic producers. An additional 988,011 D6 RINs were generated for ethanol by importers.

Total D6 RIN generation for the first three months of the year reached 3.58 billion, nearly all for ethanol by domestic producers, with 3.3 million generated for ethanol by importers and 153,911 generated for biodiesel by domestic producers.

According to the EPA, 54,155 D7 cellulosic diesel RINs were generated in March by importers for cellulosic heating oil. Total D7 RIN generation for the first quarter of 2025 reached 82,937, all of which were generated for cellulosic heating oil by importers.

The Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) is an Airports Council International (ACI) green initiative for its members, and it runs independent assessments of airports around the world and its efforts to manage and reduce emissions.

Airports were encouraged to showcase innovative initiatives in energy management, including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), renewable energy source like solar and green diesel, electric vehicles, green and zero-energy buildings, and various energy optimisation measures.

Fiji Airports earned the level of transformation in recognition of its work in aligning its carbon management with global climate goals – to reach absolute emission reductions as part of the global airports industry’s response to the challenge of climate change.

Fiji Airports CEO Mesake Nawari acknowledged the support, commitment, and understanding of their management team and staff in driving sustainability across its airport operations.

“This accomplishment underscores our role in the global effort to combat climate change,” Mr Nawari said.

“Recognising that our infrastructure is vulnerable to climate change events, we are mobilising resources to do out part in addressing this critical issue.

“We are punching above our weight and to be recognised alongside bigger international airports signifies our commitment to reducing our carbon emissions and the active steps undertaken to minimise its environmental impact.”

Fiji Airports had achieved Level 3 Optimisation in Airport Carbon Accreditation in 2020.

According to Fiji Airports, Nadi International Airport is rated Level 4 Transformation alongside Japan’s Narita International Airport, Dubai International Airport, King Khalid International Airport in Saudi Arabia, and Taoyuan International Airport in Taiwan.

With the end of 747 production in 2023, the age of the factory-new 747 private jet has officially closed.","Owning a Boeing 747 as a private jet is a statement of maximum luxury, capability, and prestige, but it also comes with a staggering price tag that a few people can afford. Depending on the specific model, configuration, and customization level, acquisition costs range from $200 million to over $500 million.

Secondhand Boeing 747-400 aircraft can be purchased for under $25 million. However, transforming them into opulent private jets often requires over $100 million solely for interior customization. That is why there are only a handful of private users of the private Jumbo.

Beyond the initial purchase, operating a Boeing 747 private jet entails substantial ongoing expenses, including fuel, maintenance, crew salaries, hangar storage, and regulatory compliance, making it a viable option primarily for royalty, heads of state, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals.

In this article, we break down not just the economics but also which 747 models are best suited for private conversion, who uses them, and why the Queen of the skies , as it is affectionately known among aviation fans, still reigns in the world of private aviation.

Cost Overview: From Acquisition to Operation

According to corporatejetinvestor.com, the purchase price of a new Boeing 747-8 VIP typically starts at $367 million, excluding interior work.

Although the purchase price of a private Boeing 747 is staggering, it's only a fraction of the total cost of ownership. Retrofitting a used 747 for private use involves an exhaustive teardown and rebuild, often handled by elite firms like Lufthansa Technik or Greenpoint Technologies, who specialize in ultra-VIP aviation interiors.

Decommissioned 747-400s can cost under $25 million, but the resale value of a pre-owned aircraft is primarily influenced by its maintenance history, total flight hours, and upcoming maintenance requirements.

That's not a big problem if you're a tycoon like Richard Branson , who started his adventure with Virgin Atlantic right from this aircraft type, as he stated in Men's Journal magazine in 2006:

In the ’80’s my gut feeling was that airlines were crap. I hated spending time on planes. I thought we could create the kind of airline I’d like. So we got a secondhand 747 and gave it a go.

However, an older aircraft that has recently undergone major maintenance can be more valuable than a newer model due to significant work. Buyers often consider the cost of impending maintenance when evaluating an aircraft's price, sometimes preferring older models with completed overhauls to newer ones requiring extensive servicing.​

Customization adds at least another $25 -$50 million to the acquisition cost. That can skyrocket quickly, depending on the complexity, materials, and in-flight tech required.

For instance, full VIP conversion often surpasses $120 million, including avionics upgrades and cabin refurbishment and, depending on the scope: from opulent master suites and boardrooms to full medical suites and secure communications networks.

In addition, operational costs are far higher than for smaller private jets. Considerations include:

Crew: A minimum of 12 staff, including pilots, flight engineers (if needed), cabin crew, and ground support.

Fuel: 2600+ gallons (10,000+ liters) burned per hour.

Hangar space: Typically, Category F facilities are needed.

Permissions: Overflight fees vary globally, especially in restricted airspace.

Together, these make the 747 a flying sovereign facility, not just a simple aircraft, often serving as mobile command centers or diplomatic platforms.

Which Boeing 747 Models Are Used as Private Jets?

The original Boeing 747 was developed for mass commercial use, but several variants have been adapted for private and VIP configurations. The transformation of the Boeing 747 from a groundbreaking commercial airliner to an ultra-exclusive Boeing 747 BBJ (Boeing Business Jet) reflects both technological ambition and global prestige for some.

Originally, the Jumbo jet was developed in the late 1960s to meet the growing demand for long-haul mass air travel, and the aircraft also quickly caught the attention of governments and billionaires alike.

As Boeing recognized a niche market, its Business Jet division began offering official conversions of the 747-400 and later the 747-8 Intercontinental.

These VVIP versions featured reinforced floors, custom wiring for secure communications, and vast cabin spaces outfitted with lounges, boardrooms, and private suites. Over time, only a handful of these jets were produced, making the 747 VIP one of the rarest and most iconic symbols of airborne luxury.

Different Boeing 747 Variants

Probably the world’s most iconic private Boeing 747 is the VC-25A, a heavily modified Boeing 747-200B used as Air Force One by the US President. Delivered in the early 1990s, it features advanced communication systems, missile defense technology, and a flying command center layout.

Only two VC-25As exist, operated by the US Air Force. A replacement, based on the 747-8, is expected to enter service later this decade.

The 747SP (Special Performance) was a shortened, long-range version of the 747 developed in the 1970s. Despite its small fleet size, it became popular with VIP buyers due to its ability to fly ultra-long distances. Among its operators are Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal of Saudi Arabia and Qatar Amiri Flight, a previous operator. Its lower weight and extended range make it ideal for long-haul, low-capacity VIP missions.

Royal families or state operators acquired many 747-300s and 747-400s after retirement from commercial fleets. These jets offered significant cabin volume and were often available at a discount. 747-400s remain popular in the secondhand VIP market due to their availability and relative ease of conversion: among their users, we can find the Saudi Royal Fleet, the Brunei Royal Family, and the United Arab Emirates.

The 747-8I VIP, part of Boeing’s Business Jet (BBJ) family, is the pinnacle of private widebody aviation. Only nine of these jets were ever built for private use, making them rare and incredibly valuable. Current or previous operators include Qatar Amiri Flight, Lufthansa Technik (completed several VVIP conversions) and undisclosed heads of state and billionaires.

These specifications enable the aircraft to connect virtually any two global cities nonstop. Routes like New York to Hong Kong, London to Sydney, or Riyadh to Washington are well within reach, with minimal payload restrictions in VIP configuration.

Boeing 747 Private Jet: Engineering Excellence and Performance Insights

The 747’s design is rooted in engineering excellence. Its iconic hump-backed double-deck fuselage offers unmatched floor area, while the swept wings and four high-bypass General Electric GEnx engines provide power, redundancy, and range.

The aircraft can operate optimally at cruise altitudes of 35,000–41,000 feet, where thinner air reduces drag and improves fuel economy. In private use, payloads are lighter than in commercial service, which further extends range.

However, the aircraft’s strengths come with trade-offs. These include:

Runway requirements: Needs 10,000+ feet for takeoff at MTOW.

Gate compatibility: Category F gates only (few airports support this).

Maintenance complexity: Quad-engine upkeep and parts availability challenges.

Still, its capability to fly long distances with luxurious interiors makes it the ultimate private aircraft in terms of prestige and presence.

How It Compares To Competing Aircraft

In the exclusive world of VIP wide-body aircraft, the Boeing 747 faces stiff competition from both Airbus and its own Boeing stablemates:

Airbus A340-600 : Four engines, long range, but less cabin volume than the 747-8.

Boeing 777-300ER VIP : More efficient twinjet option, with nearly equivalent interior volume at 25–30% lower operating costs.

Airbus ACJ350 XWB: Airbus’ modern long-range VIP flagship with ultra-low fuel burn, carbon fiber fuselage, and whisper-quiet cabin.

Yet none match the iconic stature or interior space of the 747-8 VIP. For certain high-profile users, size and symbolism outweigh cost and efficiency.

The only aircraft that might offer similar, if not exceeding, capabilities is the Airbus A380 , but so far, not a single A380 has been converted into a Business Jet version nor are there official plans by the Airbus Corporation to do so.

Operational Use & Strategic Value

The Boeing 747 offers what no other aircraft can: expansive cabin space, global range, and unrivaled prestige. VIP owners often install private bedrooms, meeting rooms, spa areas, cinemas, and even prayer rooms.

The sheer scale of the aircraft allows for creative, personalized layouts tailored to national leaders, corporate executives, and especially royal families. Symbolism also plays a key role. The 747, also known as the “ Jumbo Jet ” embodies power, authority, and global presence, making it the preferred choice for those who wish to demonstrate influence and affluence.

These aircraft often fly flagship missions like Washington–Tokyo, Doha–Geneva, or London–Abu Dhabi.

Ground time is spent in dedicated hangars with full-time engineering teams, ensuring every flight is mission-ready.

Most 747s in private hands are not in daily use; they fly only a few times per month. When they do, it’s for highly strategic missions: international diplomacy, long-haul VIP transfers, or emergency evacuations.

A nice exception was the two Boeing 747s used by the Iron Maiden heavy metal band: known as ' Ed Force One ', a Boeing 747-200 was used for their Somewhere Back in Time World Tour and The Final Frontier World Tour, while a Boeing 747-400 was used for The Book of Souls World Tour.

What Comes Next For Jumbo Jet Luxury?

With the end of 747 production in 2023, the age of the factory-new 747 private jet has officially closed. From now on, any future 747 VIP projects will rely on used airframes, primarily 747-400s or surplus 747-8s from cargo or airline fleets.

Looking further ahead, innovations in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid propulsion, and modular cabin layouts may redefine how VIP aviation is conducted, but it will be hard to match the sheer presence of a 747.

Properly maintained, these jets can fly for 30+ years, making them a long-term, high-profile investment for the world’s wealthiest few.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-7-8.png,N,,2025-04-21 18:56:34.658565

The move comes as the fate of the much-vaunted hydrogen industry — seen by the Biden administration as a way to power America while reducing climate-altering emissions — is in upheaval.

While a Biden-era rule dealt a blow to those in the gas and oil industry hoping to invest in hydrogen technology and offered greater financial incentives to the renewable energy sector, President Donald Trump is showing preference for fossil fuel-powered hydrogen. Meanwhile, the fate of those Biden-era tax credits — whether for renewable energy or fossil fuel — is up in the air as congress wades through the budget reconciliation process.

Under Trump’s guidance, the Department of Energy has indicated it plans to kill Biden-era funding for four renewable-powered hydrogen hubs in primarily Democratic regions while retaining funds for fossil fuel-powered hubs in mostly red states, such as South Dakota, Ohio and Kentucky.

California, along with Oregon, Washington and other regions, are on the Department of Energy’s “cut” list, according to Politico, which said it obtained a spreadsheet of the projects.

If the recommendations are ultimately adopted by the Trump administration, Pennsylvania would very much become a state divided. While a proposed hub in the Appalachian region that would run on fossil fuels is marked for approval, a hub mostly reliant on renewable energy near Philadelphia is marked for denial.

The seven Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs were a main plank of former President Joe Biden’s climate agenda, a $7 billion effort to establish a national network of hydrogen producers to slow the use of the fossil fuels largely blamed for global warming.

But with four of the hubs eliminated, the envisioned national hydrogen grid would become a patchwork, seemingly drawn along political lines and primarily powered by polluting sources of energy.

“The hydrogen hubs program was intended to spur innovations and demonstrations on how best to advance hydrogen as a tool in the clean energy economy,” said Julie McNamara, associate policy director for the Climate & Energy program at the nonprofit Union of Concerned Scientists.

“Blatantly co-opting these funds for use as handouts to political supporters and favored polluters would be shameful, and fully undermine the program’s ability to achieve those aims.”

While the Pennsylvania hub fueled by natural gas would use methane to provide energy for the production of so-called blue hydrogen, the other hub would use renewable energy such as wind and solar to produce what’s known as green hydrogen. By itself, the burning of hydrogen does not produce carbon dioxide emissions.

CNX was originally involved in the former hub, known as ARCH2, but told the Pittsburgh Business Times in March that it had paused involvement in the project because of the uncertainty surrounding federal funding. CNX’s name was also deleted from the ARCH2 website.

CNX did not respond to requests for comment on the status of the hydrogen hub and the sustainable aviation fuel site in Pittsburgh. A spokesperson for the airport said it “is continuing to move forward with its plans to become one of the first airports to have sustainable fuel production on-site.”

CNX was initially one of 15 companies enlisted in the hub, with plans to contribute “low carbon” natural gas to power hydrogen production, which entails using steam to draw off the hydrogen atoms from methane molecules, an expensive and energy intensive process.

But the company’s evolving relationship with the hydrogen industry appears to have soured when the Biden administration finalized a long-awaited federal rule on a tax credit for hydrogen production called 45V.

That final rule, CNX argued, was “overly restrictive,” and failed “to create sufficient economic incentives” for the company to expand its production of methane released from abandoned coal mines, which it said was key to the growing hydrogen economy. CNX pitched its involvement in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel project in Pittsburgh as being dependent upon the outcome of the 45V rule.

“We saw the fossil fuel industry view 45V as a lucrative chance for profit,” McNamara said. “Not by truly reducing emissions, but by introducing loopholes that made it easier to qualify.”

CNX had previously lobbied for the intricacies of 45V to work out in its favor. A little more than a year ago, a CNX lobbyist pushed Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s office to lobby the federal government to ensure the Treasury Department’s hydrogen rule was lucrative for coal mine methane — a request to which the Shapiro administration agreed, Capital & Main reported at the time.

The value the rule gave to coal mine-derived natural gas came down to a series of arcane specifics in a formula that measures life-cycle emissions from beginning to end of the creation of a single kilogram of hydrogen.

CNX urged the Treasury Department to treat coal mine methane as carbon-negative with the assumption that it would otherwise leak into the atmosphere from inactive coal mines, releasing a more potent greenhouse gas than if it were captured and burned, which would release carbon dioxide. (Both are greenhouse gases, but methane is well understood to be around 80 times more potent in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 20-year timeframe.) By ascribing to this captured methane a negative value, a tiny portion of it could be blended into a natural gas hydrogen feedstock and qualify for the highest tier of the 45V tax incentive, the same level as hydrogen produced with renewable energy.

But the final rule went against the pleas of CNX and companies like it, including the ARCH2 hub itself, which urged the Treasury Department to pass a methane-friendly rule in 2024, arguing it could “lead to a loss of $6 billion in private investments” otherwise and have “far-reaching consequences” for the hydrogen industry.

“It’s like the Treasury Department went out of its way to say, ‘We hear what you’re saying. And the answer is no,’” said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher at the nonprofit think tank Ohio River Valley Institute.

The ruling was seen as a win for environmentalists, who urged the Treasury Department to ensure that any projects receiving subsidies under the guise of being “clean” were in fact clean. They feared CNX’s proposal, and that of other fossil fuel producers, would’ve given natural-gas based hydrogen a tax boost equal to that for renewable, emissions-free sources of hydrogen.

How and whether the rule will be upheld by the Trump administration — which has shown strong support for fossil fuels and a general disdain for renewable energy — remains an open question, and one of concern to environmentalists. According to Bloomberg, the American Petroleum Institute, a national oil and gas trade group, has lobbied the White House to ensure fossil fuels can qualify for the highest tier of the hydrogen tax credit.

O’Leary sees CNX’s apparent exit from ARCH2 as a sign of the hub’s strained economics. In October, O’Leary authored a paper in which he noted that the hub had lost four of its development partners, while a handful of others were showing signs of financial stress. “This is not a resume that inspires confidence among prospective investors,” O’Leary wrote. CNX’s reluctance to move forward signals a broader trend within the industry, O’Leary said in an interview with Capital & Main.

“The wheels are coming off,” O’Leary said. “Even after subsidies are taken into account, the economics still aren’t there to make many of these projects work.”

Another project development partner for ARCH2, KeyState Energy, is also showing signs of uncertainty. In February, a primary customer for its blue hydrogen, Nikola Corporation, a transportation company that had planned to use the hydrogen for a zero-emission truck fleet, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company plans to sell its assets.

KeyState CEO Perry Babb told Capital & Main the company had pivoted from its energy production project with Nikola to a new ammonia fertilizer project that has a committed customer, and will still rely on hydrogen and receive funds from ARCH2. The first payment from the hubs program has been doled out and KeyState will invoice for reimbursement soon, he said.

Babb said he still meets regularly with the remaining ARCH2 project partners, who are “all positive in expressing a way forward.” But he noted that, for years, he’s weathered regulatory uncertainty; the final 45V rule was the nail in the coffin for Keystate’s original plans to produce blue hydrogen under ARCH2. He said the company has also put its participation in the Pittsburgh Sustainable Aviation Fuel hub “on pause.”

“Last May, I began to notice dozens of hydrogen projects being canceled,” he said. “I had thought that it was essentially because the business case wasn’t sound.

“With the continued uncertainty around tax credits through the end of the Biden administration… we said, ‘That’s it. We’re done. We’re going to go where there’s a market that’s predictable.’”

While failing to find a partner in the Biden-era Treasury Department, CNX could soon turn to the state, where Gov. Shapiro is reupping a $49 million tax credit for hydrogen production as part of his “Lightning Plan,” a six-pronged portfolio of legislation designed to speed up the commonwealth’s clean energy economy.

Though supported by some state environmental groups, the plan caught the ire of others, like Karen Feridun, co-founder of the grassroots Better Path Coalition, who said in a statement that the Lightning Plan would “continue and even expand fossil fuel production.” On March 11, a group of Democratic senators and representatives introduced 12 cosponsorship memos, six in each chamber, carrying out Shapiro’s plan.

“He’s going to do whatever he needs to do to try to keep [hydrogen] going,” Feridun said of Shapiro in an interview with Capital & Main. “It’s a nice way to kind of provide cover for having a continued fossil fuel plan,” one that “sounds really good to voters.”

Should ARCH2 unravel, Feridun fears grassroots environmentalists would be tasked with tracking individual projects, without the cohesion of a hub offering guidance. Even so, she said there never was “a clear map that defined what the footprint of all of this was,” which left frontline communities in the dark.

Like O’Leary, Danny Cullenward, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said he now sees the hydrogen “hype” bubble beginning to burst. Though he believes hydrogen has an important, if niche, place in the clean energy transition, its economics don’t make sense in all uses unless heavily subsidized.

“We basically set up a structure that said, at the end of this rainbow is a giant pot of gold. And everybody said, ‘We’d all like to do that. That all sounds great to us,’” he said. “I think now the cold, hard reality of, ‘Does hydrogen make sense? And in what applications would it make sense?’ is becoming a little bit more real.”

The whiplash of all this impacts Pennsylvania communities, many that are former oil, gas and coal towns learning that major projects they’d once planned for are no longer.

“It’s immensely damaging,” O’Leary said. “State or even county and municipal level governments, they’re making economic development choices based on these expectations.”

“The distraction impact of what’s going on is just staggering.”

Fences provide security, and the tents are anchored to the concrete platform below.","Attempting to get a firm direction relating to the growing homeless community, the City of Huntsville is taking a progressive approach to reopening the campsite on Derrick Street near downtown.

Scott Erwin, director of the city’s community development arm, led reporters on a tour of the soon-to-be-open, restructured site that was shut down by a damaging fire in 2024. The South Derrick Street Camp has undergone improvements to improve safety and security for the camp’s occupants.

The improvements address concerns raised by unsheltered individuals during listening sessions held by the City’s Community Development Department and Continuum of Care (CoC) providers.

“If you’ll remember back to last fall and the fire, the conditions of the camp as a result of the fire were extremely hazardous and unsanitary,’’ Erwin said. “So the city stepped in to figure out exactly what we can do.

“Over the past few months, the city has worked diligently to complete improvements to the safety and security for the camp’s occupants. And I wanna sincerely thank the Public Works Department for the City of Huntsville, Landscape Management, Parks and Recreation and HPD. It took a lot of different hands in my departments within the city to bring us to where we are today.’’

The new site has a privacy fence for increased security and a 12×12 outlined grid system that will represent 84 individual spaces to provide structured living areas. Each space is equipped with a 10×10 tent, which will be anchored to a platform to keep tenants’ belongings off the ground and provide the anchor for the tents. A new entryway was created for emergency vehicle access.

“Safety and security have consistently been the top two concerns that we identified by those living in the camp,’’ Erwin said.

Possible tenants must register in order to obtain housing in the camp. Community Development notified former occupants of the steps required to register for participation, which include the new community standards that must be signed by each individual. The new standards will help maintain order and ensure the camp remains a safe, secure, and sanitary and respectful place for everyone to temporarily live here.’’

Representatives from organizations that aid in getting unhoused citizens permanent living quarters joined Erwin at the press event. Among those speaking were representatives from First Stop, CoC, Family Services Center and Catholic Charities.

“Outreach is a core tenet of First Stop and our mission to support our unhoused neighbors, and with the support of the city and the progressive steps they have made to mitigate the environmental safety and health issues that existed at the camp we hope that our case managers will be able to be more involved and help our friends in need get out of homelessness and approach sustainable long-term housing with the support of the city.’’

Each tent will house either individuals or those with a significant other. Fences provide security, and the tents are anchored to the concrete platform below. An old tin building next to the camp will be repurposed so residents can access potable water while Shower Up, a mobile unit, will provide bathing and laundry services.

As for sanitation, portable potties are too mobile and a standing restroom facility might invite predatory or unseemly behavior. The city is still weighing options for the camp’s refuse.

“We’ll have an agency close by having a portable bathroom facility on site and we’ll see how that works,’’ Erwin said. “The water access will be very soon.’’

As Erwin stressed, the goal of the camp is to be a temporary solution.

“Our goal for everyone in the camp is this to be a pathway to allow them to get permanently housed,’’ Erwin said. “Today, we have some of our organizations that can lead to that, help them get permanent housing to have a stable way of life.’’",https://huntsvillebusinessjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Untitled-2025-04-19T111756.045.png,N,,2025-04-21 15:57:31.756141

Moreover, based on these cationic antimicrobial agents, a pH-responsive controlled release microsphere was designed and fabricated using SA and T403 as critical constituents.
The composition, morphology, controllable release properties, and in vitro antimicrobial properties of the microspheres were systematically investigated.
Additionally, the cumulative release rate in the first 10 h was 62% at pH 7.4 (simulated intestinal fluid), which was twice as high as at pH 1.2 (simulated gastric fluid), indicating the microspheres’ pH-responsive behavior.
Therefore, the SA/T403-L-Trp-Z12 microspheres prepared in this study have promising applications in the field of drug carriers and antimicrobials for targeted drug delivery to the colon, providing valuable insights into the design of pH-responsive microspheres.","In weakly alkaline environments (such as the human intestinal tract), the effectiveness of conventional antimicrobials may be limited; therefore, a series of cationic tryptophan fatty alcohol esterifications were designed and synthesized, and these compounds were found to possess excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties and good biosafety. Among the agents, tryptophan dodecyl ester (L-Trp-Z12) exhibited the highest antimicrobial efficacy, achieving minimal inhibitory concentrations of merely 0.30 μg/mL against Staphylococcus aureus and 0.60 μg/mL against Escherichia coli, and it caused 50% hemolysis at a concentration of 167 μg/mL. Moreover, based on these cationic antimicrobial agents, a pH-responsive controlled release microsphere was designed and fabricated using SA and T403 as critical constituents. The composition, morphology, controllable release properties, and in vitro antimicrobial properties of the microspheres were systematically investigated. Microsphere SA/T403-2, which features a distinct surface topology with grooves and folds, achieved an encapsulation efficiency of 91.38% and a drug loading capacity of 4.02%. Additionally, the cumulative release rate in the first 10 h was 62% at pH 7.4 (simulated intestinal fluid), which was twice as high as at pH 1.2 (simulated gastric fluid), indicating the microspheres’ pH-responsive behavior. The SA/T403-L-Trp-Z12 microspheres demonstrated excellent antibacterial effects against S. aureus. Therefore, the SA/T403-L-Trp-Z12 microspheres prepared in this study have promising applications in the field of drug carriers and antimicrobials for targeted drug delivery to the colon, providing valuable insights into the design of pH-responsive microspheres.",https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsapm.4c04050/asset/images/acsapm.4c04050.social.jpeg_v03,N,,2025-04-21 17:56:56.475715
