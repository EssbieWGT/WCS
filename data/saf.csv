Hexagon has sponsored this post.

As global markets trend towards sustainable, net-zero economies, aviation finds itself at a crossroads. For decades, airplane geometries have converged. They all contain a large, pressurized tube; massive, petrol-filled wings and a half-dozen-or-so jet — maybe propeller — engines. Interiors have new creature comforts, space saving methodologies and lighter materials, but for generations development has stagnated. Aziz Tahiri, vice president of Global Industries Aerospace & Defense at Hexagon, argues that for the industry to align with sustainability trends, everything must change.

“You have to review everything in an aircraft to be sustainable,” says Tahiri. “Almost everything was designed 40 years ago. You need to reconsider all these systems. This is hard because of the economics and financial systems attached to it. You need to almost reinvent everything, and new product introduction costs a lot of money.”

The obvious first step is to change aircraft power systems. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), hybrid and electric systems, green hydrogen fuel cell systems are leading candidates, but which should be selected and how will this selection affect aircraft geometry? Designing, testing and manufacturing the prototypes to answer these questions — while maintaining best practices — will get expensive and time consuming.

“We need to rethink the aircraft without spending ten years to design a new aircraft,” explains Tahiri. “To spend $12 billion to design an aircraft; you need to produce thousands over ten years to break even. We need to reduce the design cycle time to test new materials, fuel and designs to get a new aircraft in six years and maybe $6 billion.”

So, what technologies will make the aircraft industry sustainable: new fuels, batteries, fuel cells? One, or a combination, will inevitably come out on top. But it will be new technologies for high fidelity 3D simulation, traceability and advanced manufacturing that get us there.

How high fidelity 3Dsimulation can make flying green

Simulation technology is by no means new to the aerospace industry. For decades it has been used to validate the structural integrity of components, aerodynamics strategies, test new materials and assess propulsion strategies. What has changed is its accuracy and time to results; this should change how it’s used.

“Yesterday you could not avoid prototyping several times — even up to 3-6 prototypes — and the engineering teams were using simulation to test and validate them more extensively. Today with efficient large model processing, it’s much easier to iterate with an accurate 3D or system model in the virtual world. So maybe you only need to prototype once to find out if what you make works as designed,” says Tahiri. “That is what we do at Hexagon. We have simulations so close to reality and physical testing we can avoid multiple physical tests and iterations.”

The idea is to reduce design cycle times by replacing the use of physical prototypes with digital alternatives and using them extensively earlier in the design phase. This saves a lot of money and time, as building prototypes as large and complex as an aircraft isn’t easy.

Tahiri explains that this iterative process is becoming even faster thanks to the use of artificial intelligence (AI). The use of AI can significantly reduce the computational time needed to get results. Additionally, AI can be used to suggest iterations to a design, helping engineers zero-in on optimal geometries faster than before.

Using modern simulation and AI, Tahiri suggests engineers start testing:

Aircraft architectures like delta wings, blended wing bodies and adjustable wingtips.

Biomimicry to see how bird and insect flight might influence and optimize aerodynamics.

The performance of materials like composites, and components made via additive manufacturing.

Propulsion and storage strategies for hydrogen, batteries and fuel cells.

How 3D model traceability tools bring sustainability to aviation

Like simulation, traceability is not new to the aviation industry. Since aviation’s inception, documentation has helped design, certify and justify aircraft designs. What has changed is that traceability is no longer a manual endeavor — almost everything can be digitalized efficiently and accurately.

“You once had an army of inspectors to check everything is signed off and manufactured right,” said Tahiri. “Now we are using automated inspection capabilities with laser scanners that digitally send measurements to certification systems. These scanners can ensure traceability all along the product lifecycle. Instead of having a huge amount of paper for inspection reports, you now have a digital report that correlates to a 3D measurement cloud that can be meshed into a CAD model.”

The detailed 3D measurements add a critical “source of truth” to the digital twin and ensures all stakeholders collaborate on the same data throughout the product lifecycle. For instance, simulation experts can take the measurements from the manufacturing team to ensure a plane, as built, meets sustainability requirements. These geometries can also be used to help process development teams make the manufacturing processes more sustainable — by reducing scrap, for example.

How manufacturing must change to make aerospace sustainable

Since development teams can iterate on a design to reduce scrap, it stands to reason they can iterate on designs to ensure manufacturability — or better still, optimise it virtually before any CAPEX is committed. “Before you certify a new design, you need to make sure it is manufacturable,” Tahiri confirms. “This usually happens after the design of the aircraft. However, we can now simulate the manufacturing processes before a design is signed off and certified.”

This means that — well before any assembling, drilling or fastening — development teams can assess if a design can be manufactured ­and if said manufacturing process meets sustainability goals. “If you engineer something but you can’t manufacture it, or it takes re-engineering every time you do, the ROI is ten years instead of five and the engineering fails,” says Tahiri. “Well-engineered products can be manufactured, and the processes are optimized for quality, cost, sustainability and time to market.”",https://www.engineering.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/AdobeStock_484970881-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-03-27 14:56:24.596823

UK GHG emissions fell by 4pc in 2024

London, 27 March (Argus) — The UK's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions fell by 4pc year-on-year in 2024, provisional data released by the government today show, driven principally by lower gas and coal use in the power and industry sectors. GHG emissions in the UK totalled 371mn t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) last year, the data show, representing a fall of 54pc compared with 1990 levels. The UK has legally-binding targets to cut its GHG emissions by 68pc by 2030 and 81pc by 2035 against 1990 levels, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The electricity sector posted the largest proportional year-on-year fall of 15pc, standing 82pc below 1990 levels at 37.5mn t CO2e. The decline was largely a result of record-high net imports and a 7pc increase in renewable output reducing the call on coal and gas-fired generation, as well as the closure of the country's last coal power plant in September , which together outweighed a marginal rise in overall electricity demand, the government said. Industry posted the next largest emissions decline of 9pc, falling to 48.3mn t CO2e, or 69pc below 1990 levels, as a result of lower coal use across sectors and the closure of iron and steel blast furnaces. Fuel supply emissions fell by 6pc to 28.4mn t CO2e, 63pc below where they stood in 1990. And emissions in the UK's highest-emitting sector, domestic transport, fell by 2pc to 110.1mn t CO2e, 15pc below 1990 levels, as road vehicle diesel use declined. Emissions in the remaining sectors, including agriculture, waste and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF), edged down collectively by 1pc to 67.2mn t CO2e, some 50pc below 1990 levels. Only emissions from buildings and product uses increased on the year, rising by 2pc as gas use increased, but still standing 27pc below 1990 levels at 79.8mn t CO2e. UK-based international aviation emissions, which are not included in the overall UK GHG figures, rose by 9pc last year to reach pre-Covid 19 pandemic levels of 26.1mn t CO2e, the data show.

Trump unveils new tariffs on auto imports: Update

Adds details throughout Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump said today he would impose a 25pc tariff on foreign-made cars and trucks imported into the US, but said there will be no tariffs on automobiles assembled in the US. Trump said the new tariffs on imported automobiles marked the ""beginning of Liberation Day"", the term Trump has used to reference his plan to unveil sweeping tariffs on major foreign trade partners on 2 April. The White House estimates the tariff on imported cars and trucks will generate $100bn/yr in new tariff revenue. Trump said the auto tariff will go into effect on 2 April, providing a financial incentive for automakers to relocate manufacturing to the US. ""We'll effectively be charging a 25pc tariff, but if you build your car in the United States, there's no tariff,"" Trump said in remarks at the White House. ""And what that means is a lot of foreign car companies, a lot of companies, are going to be in great shape."" The auto tariffs will likely add thousands of dollars to the price of many imported cars and trucks. But the tariffs — the details of which have yet to be released — appears more targeted than Trump's initial plan to impose a 25pc tariff on nearly all imports from Canada and Mexico, because the tariffs would not apply to cars and trucks parts, so long as the vehicles are assembled in the US. ""Anybody that has plants in the United States it's going to be good for, in my opinion,"" Trump said. Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that Trump's plan to impose a nearly across-the-board import tariff could have caused auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Trump eventually delayed those tariffs until 2 April. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs. Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Even as a lack of details about the upcoming tariffs has fueled uncertainty for businesses and sharp declines on US stock markets, Trump has continued to announce additional tariffs. On Tuesday, Trump said any country taking delivery of Venezuelan oil or gas would be ""forced"" to pay an incremental 25pc tariff on any goods imported in the US. US oil executives appear to be growing tired of Trump's chaotic trade policy, particularly his imposition of a 25pc tariff on imported steel that is used in drill pipes, executives said in a survey the US Federal Reserve of Dallas released Wednesday. The uncertainty over tariffs and trade policy is causing ""chaos"", they said in the survey, and increasing their cost of capital. ""Tariff policy is impossible for us to predict and doesn't have a clear goal,"" an unnamed oil executive said in the survey. ""We want more stability.""

Trump to impose new tariffs on auto imports

Washington, 26 March (Argus) — President Donald Trump will announce new tariffs on the automobile industry later today, the White House said, at a time of significant uncertainty about his trade policies. Trump plans to offer further details on the automobile tariffs this afternoon, less than a week before he plans to announce tariffs against major foreign trade partners on 2 April, which Trump has dubbed ""Liberation Day"". Trump has already imposed a 25pc tariff on steel and aluminum, and earlier this week said he would announce tariffs on imported lumber, semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals. Trump last month threatened to impose 25pc tariffs on most imports from Canada and Mexico, starting on 4 March — including imported automobiles and vehicle parts — but he eventually offered a one-month reprieve for US automakers before delaying those tariffs entirely until 2 April. The scope and timing of the upcoming automobile tariffs remains unclear, and the White House has yet to provide further details. But Ontario premier Doug Ford previously warned that steep tariffs on Canada could cause auto manufacturing in the US and Canada to grind to a halt within as few as 10 days. Earlier this week, Trump said that South Korean automaker Hyundai's recent decision to invest $5.8bn to build a steel mill in Louisiana offered a blueprint for how companies could avoid tariffs.

UK eyes 80pc maritime emissions cuts by 2040

London, 26 March (Argus) — The UK is aiming to reduce fuel lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its domestic shipping by 30pc by 2030 and 80pc by 2040 compared with 2008 levels, reaching zero by 2050. The goals are ""intentionally ambitious"", the UK government said, and will be supported by both domestic and international policy measures as set out in its new maritime decarbonisation strategy. The first phase of the strategy ""will rely on existing IMO regulation"" to improve vessel efficiency this decade, the government said. The second phase will centre on larger vessels. One key policy in the strategy is pricing maritime emissions, which the government expects to do through a combination of pushing for the IMO to introduce a global shipping GHG levy from 2027, and the government's existing plan to extend the UK emissions trading scheme (ETS) to domestic maritime emissions from next year. The government will ""work to understand how these schemes interact, and to avoid any double charging of emissions"", it said. It is still to consider the feedback to its recent consultation on technical elements of the sector's inclusion in the UK ETS, it added. The government also intends to regulate maritime fuel use, both by pushing for IMO-level standards this year on the GHG intensity of fuels, and implementing domestic UK fuel regulations on which it plans to consult in 2026. Calls for evidence were also published alongside the strategy on both potential requirements for zero or near-zero at-berth emissions, with a formal consultation on this planned next year, and on measures to support the decarbonisation of small vessels and targeted maritime sub-sectors. For the latter, the government expects to focus on vessels ""with a clear route to decarbonisation"". ""Measures for harder-to-decarbonise vessels may not be required until the mid-to-late 2030s,"" it said. Maritime emissions accounted for 8pc of the UK's transport emissions in 2022, despite having declined by 30pc compared with 1990 levels, government data show.

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.
The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.
“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said.
“With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability.","Vibra, the largest fuel distributor and one of the largest energy companies in Brazil, announced March 25 that it is taking another important step towards decarbonizing the aviation sector, announcing the availability of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in the country.

The imported biofuel is now available at the base located at Tom Jobim airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro, which recently received certification from the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System GmbH, which guarantees the sustainability tracking of the entire product supply chain—from raw material through production in the biorefinery, to distribution via the base at Tom Jobim airport (Galeão Base), through BR Aviation, Vibra’s business unit for aircraft-refueling services.

With this initiative, Vibra said it not only consolidates itself as the first company in Brazil to import SAF on a commercial scale but also as a pioneer in making the product available for sale in the domestic market.

Through BR Aviation, Vibra has advanced talks with different commercial- and executive-aviation companies for supply, reinforcing its commitments to the energy transition and meeting the growing demand for more sustainable solutions in the aviation sector.

“Being the first company to bring SAF to Brazil on a commercial scale and make this product available to our customers in the domestic market fills us with pride and reinforces our commitment to decarbonization,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s executive vice president of operations. “We will continue to make efforts to make the Brazilian energy matrix increasingly stronger and more competitive, serving our customers with the fuel they need.”

SAF is produced from renewable sources and reduces greenhouse-gas emissions by approximately 80 percent compared to conventional aviation fuel, contributing to the construction of a cleaner and more sustainable future.

The product made available by Vibra was produced from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the raw materials with the lowest carbon intensity, since it is a residue.

The entire process, from the search for a supplier, import, certifications, to the blending of SAF with fossil-based aviation fuel at Vibra’s base in Galeão took 10 months of planning and execution, starting right after the first book and claim in Latin America was operationalized, also made possible by Vibra in partnership with Gol in June 2024.

This January, 23 isotanks (tank containers) with approximately 550,000 liters (145,295 gallons) of SAF departed from the port of Antwerp, Belgium, bound for Rio de Janeiro, marking what Vibra said is the beginning of a new era for the sustainable fuels market in Brazil.

The blending of SAF with conventional aviation fuel will initially be in the proportion of 10 percent SAF and 90 percent fossil fuel, contributing to the reduction of carbon emissions on flights fueled by Vibra with this fuel.

Vibra said its pioneering work breaks down important barriers and demonstrates the feasibility of adopting SAF in Brazilian aviation, also providing the development of Vibra’s expertise with the blend and later allowing higher percentages to be added to conventional aviation fuel, up to the limit of 50 percent, as currently permitted by international standards.

Vibra said it is prepared to serve all customers interested in purchasing the product, which is already available for sale, and support the decarbonization of their operations.

“Vibra has established itself as a pioneer by bringing SAF to Brazil, a product that represents the future of aviation fuel and is aligned with the need for decarbonization in the aviation sector,” Bragança said. “With a 60 percent market share in the aviation market, we are leaders not only in the sale of fuels but also in the provision of solutions, innovation and sustainability. As leaders, we are prepared to expand the supply of SAF in the Brazilian market, using our infrastructure in more than 90 airports and our expertise to deliver safe and competitive solutions.”

The sustainability of the operation, from raw materials to aircraft refueling at Galeão, was also possible thanks to obtaining ISCC certification for Vibra’s bases in Cubatão and Galeão.

This certification ensures the traceability and sustainability of the biofuels sold by Vibra, opening doors for the company to operate in new markets, both in import and export, based on very strict environmental standards.

Vibra said it has invested significantly in renewable energy, directing more than USD$1.2 billion to this segment.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_525,h_311,al_c,lg_1,q_80/80995f_4107fbc4e11b41d7a9115916201189b4~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-03-27 16:57:12.676762

Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also commented: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry when its released.

CADO is a not-for-profit organisation based out of Montreal. As its founding member, IATA’s role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

To be eligible for CADO membership, organisations must meet one of the following three requirements.

They must be, either: organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain or represent associations or groups of participants within the chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the SAF Registry’s operations and benefits; or related interest groups indirectly benefiting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president of sustainability and chief economist, said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA is developing the SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

It will ensure the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked throughout the SAF value chain and allow airlines and other corporations to use the benefit claims to meet regulatory obligations and voluntary commitments.

SAF supply is scarce, only available in a few places worldwide, so the goal of the SAF registry is to help solve the shortage problem by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers regardless of geographic location.

It will also provide airlines’ corporate customers with access to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalise on financial clients’ capacities to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.

SAF Registry participation will be free until April 2027, after which the price will be determined on a cost-recovery basis.

Willie Walsh, director general of IATA, also commented: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor.”

Walsh added: “Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonisation forward.”",https://www.aviationbusinessnews.com/resources/uploads/2025/03/ABN-Images-2025-03-27T092332.704.webp,N,,2025-03-27 16:57:17.052793

During a visit(opens in a new tab) to Penn England Farms in Blair County, the Governor highlighted how a methane digester is converting farm waste into clean energy, cutting electricity costs, and reducing pollution. Under the Lightning Plan, more farmers will have access to shared digesters, further reducing costs and generating new revenue by selling excess energy back to the grid.

Backed by labor and industry leaders, environmental advocates, and consumer groups, the Lightning Plan fast-tracks energy projects, streamlines permitting, and delivers real savings for Pennsylvanians. Pennsylvania has long been at the forefront of energy innovation – from Ben Franklin’s experiments to today’s cutting-edge clean technologies– and the Lightning Plan builds on this legacy, ensuring the Commonwealth remains a national leader in energy production and economic growth for decades to come.

Earlier this month, Governor Shapiro launched(opens in a new tab) his legislative push for the Lightning Plan at Voith Hydro in York, one of the world’s largest dedicated hydropower manufacturing facilities. In January, the Governor unveiled(opens in a new tab) his plan during a visit to Pittsburgh International Airport, highlighting a $1.5 billion hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel project which is creating 3,000 construction jobs and positioning Pennsylvania as a hub for next-generation energy solutions. Additionally, he announced(opens in a new tab) a new agreement with PJM Interconnection, securing $21 billion in consumer savings over the next two years to lower household energy costs and protect Pennsylvania ratepayers.

Read what bipartisan legislators from the General Assembly; labor, industry, environmental, and consumer leaders; and Pennsylvanians from all across the Commonwealth are saying about Governor Shapiro’s Lightning Plan:

Yvette Longenecker, Owner of Penn England Farms: “Our family has spent generations producing high-quality milk while being responsible stewards of the land — that’s why we installed a digester. A digester allows us to turn something we already have — manure — into something valuable: renewable energy. It helps power our farm, reduces odors, improves water quality, and provides an additional revenue stream to keep our operation sustainable.”

Mark Heeter, President of the Blair County Farm Bureau: ""As a farmer and president of the Blair County Farm Bureau, I know the challenges our industry faces — from rising costs to the need for more efficient practices. That’s why today’s announcement is so important. The community energy proposal gives farmers the opportunity to invest in methane digesters, reduce energy costs, and improve farm operations to stay competitive. The Agricultural Innovation Program has already been a valuable resource, and increasing investment in this initiative is critical to ensuring farmers can access the technology needed to keep their businesses strong. On behalf of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau and farmers across the state, I thank the administration for recognizing the importance of agriculture and supporting innovation. We look forward to working together to strengthen our industry.""

Steven McKnight, President and CEO of the Altoona Blair County Development Corporation (ABCD): “It’s an honor to share the podium with Governor Shapiro and Secretary Redding. I had the privilege of serving as President of the Pennsylvania Economic Development Association when the Governor took office, and we were eager to engage with the new administration’s vision. Governor Shapiro quickly recognized that Pennsylvania’s last formal economic development plan was from 2003 — outdated for today’s modern economy. Since then, his administration has worked hard to create bold initiatives like the Site Development Fund, housing programs, Main Street revitalization, and the Lightning Plan, which we’re here to highlight today. Programs like these are fueling growth across the Commonwealth, allowing rural and agricultural communities — like Williamsburg — to embrace innovative energy solutions, reduce costs, and stay competitive. Governor Shapiro, we appreciate your vision, planning, and ongoing partnership in strengthening Pennsylvania’s economy.""

Senator Judy Schwank: “Community Energy will make clean, renewable energy more affordable and accessible for farmers, helping them lower utility costs and boost profitability. I'm proud to partner with Governor Shapiro to introduce Community Energy legislation, which is just one exciting piece of the Lightning Plan. This is a pivotal opportunity to come together and embrace comprehensive energy policies that will power Pennsylvania's bright future.""

Representative Peter Schweyer: “The demand for energy in Pennsylvania continues to grow and as demand rises so does the strain on the utility grid. Community energy will help reduce the strain on the electricity grid and help lower utility costs by allowing people that cannot currently utilize solar panels or other renewable energy sources to get access. Folks can save money and reap the grid benefits. I am pleased to work with Gov. Shapiro on community energy and look forward to getting this bill across the finish line and to his desk.”

Stanley Kocon, President & CEO of Voith Hydro North America: “Demand for electricity in the US is growing, and hydro power stands out as one of the most reliable and sustainable renewable energy sources available, not only for generating electricity, but also for storing energy – an often overlooked but essential resource to maintain a stable energy grid. We wholeheartedly support the Governor’s plan to lower electricity costs and to build and upgrade more power plants to ensure clean, reliable and affordable energy for Pennsylvania's future.”

Jim Enders, President of the Central Pennsylvania Building & Construction Trades Council: “We’re long overdue to unite behind a strategy that encourages energy production, lowers costs for energy consumers, creates good paying union jobs that offer family sustaining wages, and at the same time is mindful of the planet that we will leave behind for our kids and our grandkids. These are common sense goals that we should all be able to agree on. Organized labor is encouraged by the Governor’s leadership on an energy plan that creates thousands of good paying union jobs and puts Pennsylvania energy at the forefront.”

Kevin Schreiber, President & CEO, York County Economic Alliance: “The Lightning Plan’s impact on communities like York – where manufacturing is not just an industry but a way of life – will be transformative. The plan will attract new investments and stimulate job creation by prioritizing sustainable energy production and modernizing tax and other incentives, ensuring that advanced manufacturing remains a cornerstone of local economies. It will also empower manufacturers, such as Voith Hydro, to continue to expand operations and lead global energy innovation.”

Patrick McDonnell, President & CEO of PennFuture: “It's not just enough for us as a Commonwealth to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure. It's important for us to boost the amount of renewable energy here in the state. It's important for us to realize the benefits to air quality, to water quality, to build those things. The lightning plan is a real, concrete way for us to reduce energy costs for consumers and to make sure we're putting the people of Pennsylvania to work.”

Senator Carolyn Comitta: “As a major energy-producing state, Pennsylvania is in a unique position to lead on sustainable energy sources that can reduce electric costs for families, bring new jobs to our communities, and help secure our right to clean air and pure water. PACER and the Governor’s “Lightning Plan” are the way forward to cleaner air, better economic opportunities, and consumer savings on electricity bills,” said Comitta, who serves as Minority Chair of the Senate Environmental Resources and Energy Committee. “I thank Governor Shapiro, Rep. Abney, and our legislative partners and co-sponsors for coming together to prioritize Pennsylvania’s future.”

Representative Aerion Abney: “PACER is a win-win for the environment and Pennsylvanians. The program is a tremendous boost to economies across the state by creating many new jobs in the energy sector and reinvests crucial funds in the protection of our planet’s health for generations to come.”

Representative Steve Samuelson: “The current qualifications for a business to claim the Semiconductor tax credits are unattainable. Not only do they leave out worthy businesses making great strides in manufacturing a key component of our electronic devices, but the credits have gone unused for the past two years. My bill would make the credits more attainable, ultimately achieving the goal of spurring economic development.”

Senator Steve Santarsiero: “I have long said that it’s a false premise to say we must choose between creating jobs OR saving our planet. I applaud Governor Shapiro for leading the way and bringing together the interests of consumers, labor and the environment to find a solution that works for all of us. To that end, I am proud to introduce legislation to create the Pennsylvania Reliable Energy Sustainability Standard, the next generation of alternative energy portfolio standards for the Commonwealth. PRESS will turbocharge energy build-out in Pennsylvania and create a more diverse mix of energy resources focusing on clean, reliable, and affordable energy.”

Representative Danielle Otten: “Pennsylvania is at a critical juncture. With energy demand skyrocketing, the PJM capacity markets facing unprecedented price spikes, and our state sorely lagging in clean energy investments, it’s imperative that we act now. PRESS, as part of Governor Shapiro's Lightning Plan, will help to diversify our energy sources, reduce emissions, build resiliency into our grid, improve reliability, and lower electricity costs for ratepayers, while creating workforce opportunities and securing Pennsylvania's position as a leader in clean, reliable, and affordable energy for the next 20 years.""

Senator John I. Kane: ""Pennsylvania has always been a leader in energy innovation, but red tape has held us back from building the next generation of reliable energy projects. I'm thrilled to see Governor Shapiro taking bold action with the Lightning Plan, and I'm proud to be the prime sponsor of the RESET Board, which will be a key part of that vision. This one-stop shop for energy development will get steel in the ground faster, create good jobs, lower costs for consumers, and ensure Pennsylvania remains an energy powerhouse for decades to come.""

Representative Mandy Steele: “If we are serious, really and truly serious, about supercharging energy development in the state to bring costs down for Pennsylvanians and set us up as a dominant energy leader, we must streamline the process. Creating a Reliable Energy Siting and Electric Transition Board will speed up the entire process, from permitting to reducing red tape, and supporting new energy projects in a big way. I am happy to be able to work with the governor on getting this proposal through the legislative process and become law.”

Senator Lisa Boscola: ""Pennsylvania’s energy future requires a balanced approach, one that prioritizes both supply and demand. Act 129 is a needed but outdated initiative. When first introduced, the program helped make households more efficient by changing out inefficient appliances. As demand continues to outpace supply, we need to reimagine the tools used to create efficiencies in our homes and businesses. Reforming this program will give homeowners and businesses the incentives they need to reduce their energy bills by making investments in items that will drive down their energy consumption. By driving down demand, the program helps ensure we have the power we need to keep Pennsylvania running. Act 129 reforms are just one component of a strategic energy policy that includes smart investments in energy efficiency, resiliency, and generation.""

Representative Kyle Donahue: “I believe that Gov. Shapiro’s lighting plan is a fruitful step forward for the energy industry in Pennsylvania. This plan will create jobs, lower costs for consumers, protect Pennsylvania from global instability by building next generation power, and position the commonwealth to continue to be a national energy leader for decades to come. I look forward to working with Gov. Shapiro and my colleagues in the state House and Senate to support legislation that will enact this plan.”

Senator Jay Costa: “As a lifelong resident of Allegheny County, I know how important it is to deliver good, honest union jobs to our working families, regardless of whether they have a college degree. I also know the importance of keeping costs down wherever possible, so folks can put their hard-earned money where they want it to go, like their kids’ college funds or family vacation. I am proud to be supporting Governor Shapiro on his plans to do both things at once through his Lightning Energy Plan. By unleashing Pennsylvania’s energy potential, Governor Shapiro will create energy jobs, lower energy costs, protect PA’s energy independence, and position our commonwealth as a leader in the nation.”

Senator Nick Pisciottano: “I commend Governor Shapiro for this bold, responsible, forward-looking energy plan, and I am happy to be a prime sponsor in the Senate of the EDGE tax credit programs, designed to attract new investments from businesses in critical manufacturing sectors. I share the Governor’s commitment to affordable, clean, and reliable energy for every family, business, and community in Pennsylvania. This plan will lower electricity costs, which is a top priority for our residents who are facing rising utility bills. We are excited to introduce a plan that strikes a vital balance between meeting the growing energy demands of our state, while also making sure we are protecting our environment for future generations. By focusing on both innovation and practical solutions, we are setting the stage for Pennsylvania to thrive in the energy sector and compete in the global economy.”

Representative John Inglis: “Pennsylvania energy powered the industrial revolution and Pennsylvania energy will power the technological revolutions of the future – if we make the right investments to support the projects that create jobs today and help create jobs for years to come. I’m proud to be the sponsor of the EDGE tax credits in the Lightning package to help fund energy generation and infrastructure upgrades and a brighter future.”

Representative Rob Matzie: “Pennsylvania is the crossroads of America for roads, rails, and skies. Investing in sustainable aviation fuel production with the Lightning plan helps cut emissions, create good-paying jobs, and support innovation in agriculture.”

Representative Tom Mehaffie: “Pennsylvania has lost out because the PA EDGE tax credit program was not utilized as envisioned. We are overdue to re-energize the tax credits and ensure the Commonwealth – and nation – have sources of PA-produced, reliable power for years to come.”

The credit amount is 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel.
Significantly, a company is not required to own the facility to claim a Section 45Z credit, as production is attributed to the producer.
For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.
Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel.","In brief

What happened?

Starting in 2025, the Section 45Z clean fuel production credit replaces the Sections 40A and 40B tax credits. Earlier this year, Treasury and the IRS released guidance on the Section 45Z credit, which applies to clean transportation fuel (1) produced at a qualified facility in the United States and (2) sold between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2027, with specific criteria for emissions rates and facility qualifications.

Why is it relevant?

Enacted as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), Section 45Z provides a tax credit of 20 cents per gallon of clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility by a taxpayer and sold to an unrelated person after 2024. The credit amount is 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel. These amounts are multiplied by five if the taxpayer meets prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions in constructing, repairing, or altering the facility. Notice 2025-10 provides rules that Treasury and the IRS intend to propose in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z, while Notice 2025-11 offers general information on determining fuel emissions rates and includes the initial emissions rate table.

Action to consider

To claim the Section 45Z credit, a taxpayer must (1) register under Section 4101 as a producer of clean fuel and (2) provide certification from an unrelated party of compliance with certain requirements for sustainable aviation fuel. Taxpayers that may be affected by the forthcoming proposed regulations should consider submitting comments by the April 10 due date.

In detail

Section 45Z provides a tax credit for clean transportation fuel produced at a qualified facility in the United States and sold to an unrelated person for various uses. To qualify, the fuel must meet specific lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions criteria published by Treasury in an annual table of emissions rates for different fuel types. Nonaviation fuels are subject to the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model, while sustainable aviation fuels are subject to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) or similar methodologies. The Section 45Z credit amount is determined by the fuel's emissions factor and applicable rates, and companies that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements are eligible to increase the credit amount by a multiple of five.

Observation: Section 45Z’s reliance on GREET and CORSIA to determine whether fuels meet emissions and production standards is consistent with other technology-neutral credits enacted as part of the IRA.

Notice 2025-10 details proposed rules under Section 45Z for qualified facilities, ownership, and production. The notice provides that (1) a qualified facility includes all components that function interdependently to produce transportation fuel and (2) carbon capture equipment can be used to contribute to the lifecycle GHG emissions rate. Significantly, a company is not required to own the facility to claim a Section 45Z credit, as production is attributed to the producer. Notice 2025-10 clarifies that a company must engage in substantial processing activities, which excludes minimal processing activities like blending, to qualify as a producer. Additionally, the fuels must be suitable for use in highway vehicles or aircraft. The notice also provides methodologies for determining emissions rates for different fuel types.

Observation: Notice 2025-10 provides rules that may be included in forthcoming proposed regulations on Section 45Z. It provides preliminary guidance that is not binding on taxpayers. For additional information about these proposed rules, please see PwC Insight IRS notices provide initial guidance on the Section 45Z clean fuel credit.

Taxpayers may obtain a provisional emissions rate for novel fuels or those using un-established pathways under Notice 2025-10 by first obtaining an emissions value from the Department of Energy. Detailed records must substantiate the production and emissions rates for the credit, and certification is required for sustainable aviation fuel. Registration under Section 4101 is necessary to qualify for the credit, with specific requirements for re-registration and notification of ownership changes.

Notice 2025-11 provides background on the CORSIA program and the 45ZCF-GREET model for determining emissions rates. Taxpayers are required to use the most recent determinations from the emissions rate table for nonaviation fuels and choose between CORSIA or 45ZCF-GREET for sustainable aviation fuels.

Observation: The GREET life cycle analysis was developed by the Department of Energy to assess the environmental impacts associated with technologies, fuels, products, and energy systems across various stages of the supply chain. Other IRA credits that rely on the GREET model include Section 40B for sustainable aviation fuel and Section 45V for clean hydrogen. See our PwC Insights for more information:

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two per cent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six per cent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 per cent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 per cent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six per cent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three per cent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

Minister of Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad said that, in addition, it also helps address environmental pollution.

“Previously, used cooking oil was usually just disposed of, causing pollution to waterways and rivers. However, these days, used cooking oil is being used as the base material for the production of SAF.

“In years to come, sustainable aviation fuel is expected to become a mandatory requirement internationally. As such, the collection and recycling of used cooking oil not only helps prevent environmental pollution but also contributes to reducing carbon emissions in the aviation sector, which is one of the sectors with the highest carbon emission rates,” he said.

He said this when met at the programme to collect used cooking oil at the Taman Setapak Jaya Ramadan Bazaar organised by FatHopes Energy Sdn Bhd, in collaboration with Eko Setiawangsa here yesterday. It was also attended by FatHopes Energy chief executive officer Vinesh Sinha.

Meanwhile, Vinesh Sinha said the aviation sector is the most difficult to decarbonise due to the lack of viable alternatives.

“Whereas in road transport, multiple options such as electrification and hydrogen are available. As a Malaysian company, we believe it is our responsibility to help solve the world’s biggest challenges,“ he said.

He added that the Malaysian government has provided strong support for this initiative and hopes that new policies will be introduced to regulate the country’s entire ecosystem.

He also shared that FatHopes Energy has been collecting used cooking oil at Ramadan bazaars nationwide daily.

“During Ramadan, we can collect around 2,000 to 3,000 kilogrammes of used cooking oil per day from each bazaar. This initiative is being carried out nationwide, with the most visible presence in Kuala Lumpur. However, we are also actively operating nationwide, including in Sabah and Sarawak.

The European Commission and Member States must take responsibility - and act now.

Airline company Delta is partnering with aviation startup JetZero to develop a sleek and sustainable aircraft that ""looks and feels like nothing flying today's commercial skies,"" per Delta News Hub.

Delta's Sustainable Skies Lab, which launched in 2023, will help bring JetZero's blended-wing-body aircraft to life. The plane is ""expected to be up to 50% more fuel-efficient than aircraft in operation today, with flight range and seat capacity comparable to today's mid-range international aircraft — all with existing engine technology,"" Delta News Hub reported.

The goal is not only to help Delta reach their net-zero emissions goal by 2050, but to develop and implement new technology that could change the aviation industry completely. JetZero insists their design will fly within this decade. Early last year, their scaled-down Pathfinder model received an airworthiness certificate from the Federal Aviation Administration, allowing JetZero to do official test flights.

Energy-efficient, sustainable aircraft development like JetZero's could pave the way for net-zero aviation pollution. Globally, the aviation industry is responsible for 2.5% of carbon dioxide emissions, and has ""grown faster between 2000 and 2019 than rail, road or shipping,"" per the International Energy Agency.

Delta has already made good progress on their path to sustainability. A sustainable aviation fuel blending facility is under construction in Minnesota, and will help Delta replace planet-polluting jet fuel.

Tom O'Leary, the cofounder and CEO of JetZero, told Delta News Hub that ""JetZero is working to change the world by bringing to market an aircraft that aims to fly this decade and make immediate and marked progress toward reducing airline energy costs, and the associated emissions.""

""The ability to realize such significant efficiency gains in the near future meaningfully impacts the industry's commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and will serve as the foundation on which other technologies and efficiencies can be realized,"" O'Leary said.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/JetZeroimage-recwb7TqdjW5h8sOC.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 13:56:48.464600

Airbus Says Innovation Can Offset Air Travel But the Record Isn't Good,Darin Graham,,,,,https://skift.com/2025/03/27/airbus-aviation-emissions-stablized-climate-change/,"Kitcher added that rather than limiting air travel, the focus should be on decarbonization strategies such as alternative fuels and more efficient aircraft.
“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said.
The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.
The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.
“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.","At the Airbus Summit in France on Tuesday, Chief Sustainability Officer Julie Kitcher claimed that aviation emissions have remained “relatively stable” and that innovation could help offset the industry’s continued growth.

While steady as a share of total emissions, the record shows a rise in aviation emissions in the past three decades and there are several challenges to implementing new tools that make air travel more efficient.

Kitcher made her case on a panel discussing limiting the amount of flights to slow down emissions: “We’ve seen that over the decades, although air travel has doubled, actually the greenhouse gas emissions from aviation have remained relatively stable. So it shows that the technology and the measures that we’re implementing are offsetting the growth from aviation,” Kitcher said at the conference.

Kitcher added that rather than limiting air travel, the focus should be on decarbonization strategies such as alternative fuels and more efficient aircraft.

“At the end of the day, you see that the growth is there for air travel,” she said. “So it’s really about being able to offset and reduce emissions with the right tools to be able to get us to net zero in 2050.”

When asked about Kitcher's remarks, an Airbus spokesperson pointed Skift to a 2024 Airbus report that showed that aviation's share of global carbon dioxide emissions had remained at around 2%.

Aviation Emissions: What the Research Shows

Over the years, aircraft have become more fuel-efficient, helping to slow the growth of emissions in the aviation sector, which contributes around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide emissions annually.

Between 1990 and 2019, air travel for both passenger and freight quadrupled, according to Hannah Ritchie, Deputy Editor of Our World in Data at the University of Oxford’s Oxford Martin School.

At the same time, aircraft became twice as energy efficient.

The net result: Research published in Nature shows that aviation emissions have more than doubled since 1990.

A study in Science Direct, which analyzed aviation emissions data from sources including historical flight records, the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization, reached similar conclusions.

The European Union also reported that aviation emissions in Europe have doubled since 1990.

The industry itself has admitted that progress has been slow.

The sector hadn’t “made as much progress” as it wanted, “or is needed, on decarbonizing the aviation sector,” said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director Willie Walsh in December.

Greener Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) Falling Behind

Future emissions will depend on whether aviation can maintain the efficiency gains and transition to low-carbon fuels, Ritchie said.

“So far, the sector has made almost no progress on the latter,” Ritchie wrote in a report on aviation emissions.

Many airlines have committed to using SAF to help reduce emissions. But concerns remain over its limited supply.

Kitcher acknowledged this during her presentation. “We need to find a way to stimulate the capital,” she said. “It will all come down to the business case. We've got to get an attractive business case for our airline customers, for suppliers, for banks to be able to really make a difference.”

Meanwhile, air travel demand continues to rise. IATA reported record high global demand in 2024. And Airbus projects that air traffic will more than double in the next 20 years.

Much of the growth is expected to come from regions like India and China.

Some experts worry that slower adoption of climate policies in these regions could delay decarbonization efforts. Kitcher said she remains optimistic about progress in these markets.

“We shouldn’t underestimate what is happening in China and India when it comes to renewable fuel,” she said. “Connectivity, economic growth, reducing emissions - there’s a lot happening.”

During the summit, the company provided an update on its plans for a hydrogen powered aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030’s.

Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are required by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, starting with a 2 percent quota in 2025 and aiming for 70 percent SAF in all EU airports by 2050.

Led by France-headed Elyse Energy, a pioneering industrial SME specializing in the production of sustainable fuels and low-carbon raw materials, the BioTJet project is based on the E-BioTfueL concept, which combines biomass eligible to produce advanced biofuels per EU RED definition and green or low-carbon hydrogen eligible to produce renewable fuel of non-biological origin (RFNBO) or electro-fuels (eFuels).

The technology brings proven process building blocks that have been developed and tested in a semi-industrial plant from 2010 to 2021 by the Bionext consortium, comprising Avril, Axens, CEA, IFP Energies Nouvelles, TotalEnergies, and thyssenkrupp Uhde.

After thoroughly examining the available and bankable technologies, we are now more convinced than ever that we have made the right choice for our project with the E-BioTfueL concept and the technology partners involved to provide cost-competitive SAF and naphtha to the market by 2030 and contribute to address climate change, said Pascal Penicaud, President of Elyse Energy.

Detailed engineering phase

Axens signed a license agreement for BioTfueL technology in 2024, which includes a “PRENFLO” gasification technology from thyssenkrupp Uhde, a “GASEL” Fischer-Tropsch and syngas upgrading technology from Axens with a basic engineering completed in November 2024 and currently being within the detail engineering phase.

Axens, along with our parent company IFP Energies Nouvelles, has invested significant capital in demonstrating technologies at a semi-commercial scale and advancing the energy transition, particularly in SAF processes. We are thrilled to be part of the BioTJet project, which is strategic for Axens and our longtime partner thyssenkrupp Uhde. The BioTJet project leverages a breakthrough technology, BioTfueL, underscoring our commitment to innovative solutions in the energy sector, said Quentin Debuisschert, CEO of Axens.

Robust and proven gasification technology

With its origins in the Koppers-Totzek process, the PRENFLO gasification technology has been continuously refined to meet evolving industry needs. It is known for its robustness and flexibility and can handle a wide range of feedstocks.

With over 100 gasifiers successfully realized, thyssenKrupp Uhde is both a pioneer and world leader in gasification technology.

PRENFLO is a pressurized, entrained-flow gasification technology developed and first demonstrated by thyssenkrupp Uhde in the late 1980s.

It has been implemented in various large-scale projects, including the world’s largest single-train, solid feedstock-based integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plant, owned and operated by ELCOGAS, located in Puertollano, Spain, and continuously developed further to the application of 100 percent biomass.

The technology uses second-generation biogenic feedstocks such as waste wood, woodchips, straw, forest residues, and agricultural waste.

Part of thyssenKrupp Uhde’s Decarbon Technologies portfolio, PRENFLO will contribute to the sustainable production of biomass-based synthetic products, including methanol, hydrogen, and SAF, with the BioTJet project underscoring the company’s commitment to advancing clean energy technologies and supporting the global transition to sustainable sources.

Brussels: Major European airlines on Thursday urged the European Union to reconsider green targets for the sector unless production of renewable fuels picks up and costs can be brought down.

Under ambitious plans to tackle climate change, the EU will require airlines to gradually increase the amount of so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) they use to power planes.

But airlines complain SAF is not widely available and too expensive, hampering competitiveness.

""We don't have enough SAF, and the SAF that we have is very expensive,"" Luis Gallego, CEO of the IAG airline group bringing together Iberia, British Airways and other carriers, told a press conference.

Advt

Gallego was speaking on behalf of Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry group representing 17 airlines including Lufthansa and Air France-KLM, at an event it held in Brussels.

EU rules require carriers to include two percent of SAF in their fuel mix starting this year, rising to six percent in 2030 and then soaring to 70 percent from 2050.

But a study published by A4E estimates SAF production would be 30 percent below levels necessary to achieve the goal in 2030, according to Gallego.

""It is now clear that SAF supply will not be sufficient to meet the six percent target by 2030,"" said Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary.

""Unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030"" target, added Gallego.

Contributing to almost three percent of carbon dioxide emissions globally, the aviation sector is among the toughest to decarbonise.

SAF -- a biofuel that produces lower carbon emissions than traditional jet fuel, made from plant and animal materials like cooking oil and fat -- is seen as a crucial ingredient to hitting emissions targets.

It is expected to provide 65 percent of aviation's ""net zero"" mitigation by 2050.

The chief executives of Ryanair, Aer Lingus and British Airways ower IAG, Lufthansa and Air France-KLM AIRF.PA told an annual industry conference in Brussels that the requirements for sustainable aviation fuel were adding to regulatory burdens that risked European aviation falling behind global competitors.

""We urgently need an EU aviation strategy in order to have SAF at competitive prices unless action is taken now, the only realistic solution is to move the 2030 SAF mandate to the right,"" said Luis Gallego, the CEO of IAG.

The head of industry group Airlines for Europe said regulatory costs had tripled between 2014 and 2024.

SAF costs three to five times more than traditional jet fuel and makes up only 0.3% of global jet fuel supply. European airlines are this year expected to use 2% of SAF in their jet fuel mix, with the mandate rising to 6% in 2030.

A Boston Consulting Group report published today found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF.

US President Donald Trump's call for more fossil fuel investment is adding to pressure on the fledgling green fuel market.

Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary said the oil majors - the biggest likely producers - were already cutting back their SAF programmes.

The airlines said the European Union's sustainability rules created an unfair cost burden on them, giving an advantage to international carriers that do not have to meet sustainability mandates and can fly longer routes.

""Our market shares are going down not only to government-owned carriers in the East but also private competitors and some partners in the US. European aviation is falling behind,"" Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said.

As with the car sector, aviation could benefit from an easing of sustainability requirements, executives said.

""We all know we started with a Green Deal that now has been moved into a clean deal. And I think we also need a lean deal"", said Spohr.

The European Commission proposed last month in its ""Simplification Omnibus"" to cut the burden of climate-related reporting but the focus was to relieve the pressure on small and medium companies.

Meanwhile, the CEO of IAG also said today that Heathrow was not meeting expectations, given the high costs of operating out of the British airport.

Stephen Forshaw, chief representative of Airbus in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific, says that aviation has a pressing need to decarbonise, as only this will give it the “licence” to continue operating in the decades ahead, especially as consumers become more conscious about their carbon emissions.

He also observes that 80% of Australia’s jet fuel was imported in 2024, compared with just 50% a decade ago. This creates an energy security issue.

On how to resolve these issues, Forshaw says that Australia is extremely well placed to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) given the ready availability of feedstocks.

In addition to providing energy security, a robust Australian SAF capability will also provide jobs and, most important, reduce the emissions associated with flying.

Boeing used the show to make a presentation about Cascade 2.0, a publicly available climate impact model that lets users adjust a range of variables to help map out the industry’s decarbonisation journey.

Demonstrating Cascade to reporters at Boeing’s stand, the company’s vice-president of environmental sustainability Ryan Faucett manipulated factors such as air traffic growth, fuel type, aircraft type, and operational efficiencies to help assess their long-term impact on reducing emissions.

By way of demonstration, he laid out one hypothetical whereby sustainable aviation fuel, offsets, new aircraft types, and operations combined to vastly reduce emissions by 2050.

Faucett says the tool can help policy makers and other industry participants gauge the impact of the various factors involved in the industry’s reduction of emissions.

“It paints a picture of exactly what it would take on all sets of removals to get all the way to net zero,” says Faucett.

The Brazilian delegation announced Wednesday the purchase by Japanese carrier All Nippon Aiways (ANA) of 20 E-190 aircraft. The company also intends to buy another five aircraft, it was explained.

Brazil's Minister of Ports and Airports Silvio Costa Filho said that the partnership with the Japanese will serve as a kind of seal for new sales to other countries, further expanding Embraer's business horizon.

“And with the sale of aircraft to international markets, we will need to prepare Brazilian labor, structuring our great plan to prepare our young people for this new job market that is emerging in Brazil, which is aviation,” he added. To this end, Brazil is already developing qualification and training programs for this job market, he further noted.

“This will generate jobs and income. It will stimulate the economy,” the minister also said, adding that all the Japanese companies he had spoken to had assured him that they would make Embraer a priority for their business.

Negotiations have also progressed with a view to the Japanese aviation sector adopting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), an alternative to fossil-based aviation fuel. According to the Brazilian government, this fuel can be obtained from various sources. Among them, ethanol produced from sugar cane.

“SAF is a fuel that consists of ethanol. It is, therefore, significant for the Brazilian agribusiness industry. In addition, we are working alongside all the ministers in Japan, including the Prime Minister, to ensure that 10% of the fuel here in Japan is made from ethanol,” the Brazilian official also mentioned.

This fuel can also be obtained from agricultural waste, used cooking oil, fats, and corn, among others, pure or mixed, according to technical safety specifications. According to the Planalto, Brazil has “extensive expertise on the subject.”

“As well as boosting aviation fuel here in Japan, we will stimulate Brazil's sugar-energy industry, which is in dialogue with sustainability, through this fuel of the future that Brazil has presented to the world,” added the minister.

Also part of the Brazilian delegation, Embraer President Francisco Gomes Neto said that the Japanese were also interested in developing the electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL), a 100% electric vehicle known as a “flying car.”

“Our plan is for it to be in operation by the end of 2027. It's the vehicle of the future, a disruptive innovation, ideal for countries [and cities] with heavy traffic, such as Japan, São Paulo, Los Angeles or New York,” said Gomes Neto, explaining that the electric motors will be produced through a joint venture between Embraer and a Japanese company.

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.
In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.
The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism.
Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, says, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.","Airbus is taking a significant step toward scaling the adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by testing a new “Book and Claim” approach. This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of such integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, says, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them. This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”",https://memuknews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/unnamed-4-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 11:57:23.642782

Background and significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Current status and initiatives of the aviation and chemical industries:

Overview of the pre-feasibility study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products.

Problems in Solutions CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.
He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations.
Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.
California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions.","CalPERS has hit back at criticism from a coalition of environmental advocates and public sector unions, California Common Good, that its flagship $53 billion sustainable portfolio which it hopes to double to $100 billion by the end of the decade includes a $3.5 billion allocation to many of the world’s biggest polluters.

The organisation used public records, including filing a California Public Records Act request, to highlight that CalPERS’ climate adaptation, transition, and mitigation investments include holdings in 52 of the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. The report aims most of its criticism at CalPERS’ inclusion of seven oil and gas companies in the portfolio.

“Unfortunately, the report raises unfounded concerns that CalPERS isn’t serious about addressing climate change. Even worse, it could be construed as suggesting that CalPERS is intentionally misleading its 2.2 million members and the public about the intent of our climate investing program,” said CEO Marcie Frost in a statement.

Problems in Solutions

CalPERS does indeed classify a small proportion of its investments in oil and gas companies as providing climate solutions, confirmed Peter Cashion, managing investment director for sustainable investments, speaking during the investor’s mid-March board meeting.

Specific business lines at these companies amount to $67 million worth of investments in activities that qualify as climate solutions like developing green biodiesel, carbon capture technology and sustainable aviation fuel.

CalPERS measures portfolio companies’ green business activity using a taxonomy that tracks climate solution investments across three categories – mitigation, adaptation and transition. Under the transition umbrella, Cashion said it is possible for high emitting companies in hard to abate sectors to qualify as providing a climate solution if they have transition strategies that support pro-climate activities.

Using this approach, CalPERS values 1 per cent of its $234 million Saudi Aramco holding as a climate solution, for example. Elsewhere the investor classes its $12.6 million investment in Indian coal giant Adani Group’s Green Energy subsidiary as a climate solution.

CalPERS uses a variety of globally recognised data providers to measure companies’ green activity including Financial Times Stock Exchange, HSBC and MSCI and Blomberg. The CalPERS team have sought out best practices supported by the Institutional Investor Group on Climate Change (IIGCC), the EU Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA).

Cashion said the allocation reflects CalPERS belief that “a green asset is a green asset regardless of corporate ownership” whereby even if a green asset sits on the balance sheet of an oil producer, it is still viewed as green.

He also reiterated the importance CalPERS places on engaging with oil and gas companies to promote sustainability at these corporations. Witness how CalPERS $5 billion allocation to a Climate Transition Index underweights oil and gas companies with no transition plan.

Frost said that CalPERS’ approach to assessing climate solutions has been iterative in a reflection of the emergence of best practices and additional data. “We wish things were easier. CalPERS has long supported clarity and consistency in climate investing definitions. We reject any suggestion that our methodology wasn’t well researched or independently authenticated,” she stated.

She also reiterated why CalPERS does not support climate divestment, something she called a “a symbolic act that not only ignores the value of climate transformations and investor engagement, but a possible breach of our fiduciary duty as required under the California Constitution.”

Her response underscores the challenges investors face balancing financial returns with their climate commitments. CalPERS believes that its influence can push polluting companies toward greener practices and support funding clean energy technologies. Yet transition progress is slow – and remaining invested is an essential return stream for CalPERS 2 million beneficiaries.

California Common Good also called for more details on the private equity, private debt, infrastructure and real estate holdings CalPERS classifies as climate solutions. The lobby group said this was particularly important given CalPERS has announced plans to increase private holdings to 40 per cent of its portfolio.",https://media.top1000funds.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/MF_B7164.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:07.452987

However, many airlines have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, reported Reuters.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of their revenue or budget allocation to SAF, indicating that high production costs and fuel prices remain major challenges to adoption.

“We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada told Reuters, talking about his executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel and we see that trend very clearly, there is slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” added Losada.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

“Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders.

“In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO.

“This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonisation of the principles on which all SAF registries operate,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice-president sustainability and chief economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent and liquid global market for SAF.

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour.

A Roadmap for Collaboration Achieving 2030 SAF targets will require overcoming key adoption challenges through ecosystem-wide collaboration.","Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) have massive potential to decarbonize the commercial aviation industry, but most players can do more to capture that opportunity. Despite rapid growth in SAF production over the past few years, the industry is projected to fall short of its 2030 sustainability targets.

To identify the challenges and opportunities related to SAF adoption, we recently surveyed more than 500 executives at approximately 200 companies across the global aviation ecosystem. Our sample included aircraft and engine OEMs, system and component manufacturers, airlines, lessors, and SAF project developers—the majority from North America and Western Europe but covering other regions as well. Among the key findings:

Roughly two-thirds of companies across the value chain are taking a measured approach to SAF, and most anticipate being an observer, rather than a market leader, by 2030, signaling a need for greater ambition.

Aircraft OEMs and project developers are investing a higher share of revenue to develop the SAF market, with airlines and lessors investing less.

Eighty percent of companies say they are confident they can achieve their 2030 targets, but only 14% feel well-prepared to overcome challenges along the way.

The lack of a clear business case for expanding use of SAF is the biggest barrier to investment.

Critically, the results also point to specific recommendations for stakeholders across the aviation value chain to make faster progress on SAF adoption. A common thread is the need to create a virtuous cycle in which SAF supply increases demand and vice versa. Decarbonizing commercial aviation is a massive challenge; the industry is tightly integrated and currently oriented around fossil fuels, and no individual segment wants to take the lead on SAFs without knowing that others will join them. Success will require coordination among many moving parts in the aviation ecosystem. By working together, all participants can create a stronger business case for future investment in SAFs, and ultimately for cleaner skies.

Strong Growth in SAF Production—But More Is Needed

In relative terms, SAF production is growing fast. Over the past three years, supply has increased 1,150% worldwide. (See Exhibit 1.) This remarkable surge has been driven by supportive policy frameworks, expanding corporate commitments, and early investments among early adopters, signaling a strong push to decarbonize aviation.

In absolute terms, however, the picture looks different. The dramatic increase in supply occurred against a very small base. SAF represented just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), and new production capacity is slowing. Project announcements for new SAF facilities declined 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023, due primarily to economic uncertainty and higher energy and operating costs that squeezed company margins. (See Exhibit 2.)

While there is some renewed momentum in 2024 and 2025, commercial aviation faces a real risk that it will fall short of decarbonization goals.The industry had set a 2030 SAF production target as part of the sector’s broader effort to limit global warming to 2°C above preindustrial levels, and currently it will fall short of that target for the two main types of sustainable aviation fuels.

Bio-SAF (produced from natural oils or biomass) has emerged as the preferred technology for many market players due to its relative maturity, lower costs, and quicker deployment timelines. However, supplies of bio-SAF are projected to fall 30% short of 2030 targets.

e-SAF (produced from a thermochemical process involving carbon and hydrogen) is potentially more transformative, but also more complex and costly to produce, with technologies at earlier stages of maturity. Supplies of e-SAF are projected to fall 45% short of 2030 targets.

This shortfall is compounded by the sluggish pace of project approvals, with fewer than 30% of SAF initiatives reaching a final investment decision (FID). Given that facilities typically take three to five years after being funded to start producing at-scale, the risk of failing to meet 2030 targets is mounting.

Global economic uncertainty has further compounded these challenges, pushing companies to prioritize cost management and supply chain resilience over long-term investments in sustainability. Legislative delays have also hindered progress. In the European Union, for example, final SAF eligibility criteria under the ReFuelEU Aviation initiative and clarifying implementation timelines were delayed, slowing new project announcements. These setbacks have raised concerns about the reliability of regulatory-driven demand.

Key Survey Results

The results of our survey indicate substantial levels of uncertainty and hesitancy among industry leaders, presenting challenges to reaching 2030 targets. Respondents also see carbon pricing playing a role in the transition to SAF.

Investment levels have been uneven, with no clear market orchestrator.

Overall, about half of commercial aviation players now allocate more than 4% of their revenue or budget allocations to SAF investments. But some segments are ahead of others. Project developers and aircraft and engine manufacturers have led the charge, channeling significant resources to develop the market. (See “Aircraft OEMs Are at the Forefront of SAF Adoption.”) In contrast, airlines and airports, constrained by tighter financial margins, have invested just 1% to 3%, often prioritizing aircraft fleet renewal over riskier SAF projects. (See Exhibit 3.)

Most of the industry is in “wait and see” mode.

Among respondents, about two-thirds say they are interested in SAFs but waiting for the market to take off. (See Exhibit 4.) More alarming, a similar share anticipates being an observer in the SAF ecosystem in 2030. Only a small subset of players has shown active leadership, and this trend is unlikely to shift without significant incentives or mandates. The lack of bold, coordinated action risks exacerbating the current shortfall, leaving the industry reliant on reactive responses to regulatory changes.

Individual organizations may not realize the scope of the challenge ahead.

Our results also show a stark gap between confidence levels about sustainability and preparedness to meet those goals. Among respondents, 80% of companies are confident that they can achieve their 2030 SAF objectives. Yet only 14% feel well-prepared to overcome challenges along the way. Airports and lessors are particularly lagging, with just 6% and 0% readiness, respectively. (See Exhibit 5.) This lack of preparedness among key stakeholders threatens to undermine the industry’s ability to close the SAF supply gap and meet decarbonization goals.

The lack of a clear business case is a major obstacle to greater investment.

Production costs and fuel prices remain the top obstacles, cited by 52% of SAF producers1 1 SAF producers include SAF project developers, energy companies, and banks and financing companies. and 49% of off-takers.2 2 SAF off-takers include manufacturers (OEMs, system and component suppliers, military), passenger airlines, air-freight players, airports, and lessors. The result is a vicious cycle: Limited supply keeps prices high, which in turn dampens voluntary demand and willingness-to-pay, undermines the business case for SAF, restricts supply development, and delays the critical learning needed to reduce costs.

A related challenge is that developers face difficulties securing financing for SAF projects due to the reliance on non-binding memoranda of understanding (MoUs) rather than binding, long-term off-take agreements. Current technology cost curves suggest that the cost premium for SAF over conventional A1 jet fuel may persist well beyond 2030, perpetuating the cycle of limited adoption, constrained investment, and delayed scaling of SAF technologies.

Industry players say that carbon pricing could spur adoption.

Outside of regulatory mandates, the industry sees carbon-pricing as a potential solution. By placing a financial cost on the externalities of fossil fuels, carbon pricing schemes could reset the economics of SAF versus conventional jet fuel, making SAF investments far more attractive. Considering other industries that are already under carbon pricing schemes and the potential industry-wide development of this mechanism for airlines, carbon pricing could stimulate voluntary demand for SAF by aligning economic incentives with sustainability goals, creating a more robust foundation for long-term investment.

SAF Is Ready to Take Off

Despite the challenges highlighted in our survey, the long-term momentum for structural change in the aviation industry remains strong. European regulators set the first tranche of SAF mandates at the beginning of 2025. As interest rates stabilize and inflation normalizes, product costs will decrease. Additionally, substantial policy momentum is building, with key legislative frameworks finalized in 2024 across Europe, North America, and South Asia.

In the European Union, the Renewable Energy Directive has clarified criteria for certain types of renewable fuels, while the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive requires companies to establish robust climate transition plans.

In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Act, passed in May 2024, introduces enhanced funding and policy measures to support SAF infrastructure and research.

These developments can accelerate the aviation industry’s decarbonization journey by improving market liquidity and boosting investor confidence. But industry stakeholders must also take action to capitalize on improving market conditions.

A Roadmap for Collaboration

Achieving 2030 SAF targets will require overcoming key adoption challenges through ecosystem-wide collaboration. Unlike other industries like steel, where fierce competition often hinders collaboration, the commercial aviation sector’s integrated structure offers a unique opportunity to drive transformational change through collective action.

Specifically, greater SAF adoption requires creating a virtuous circle between supply and demand. Stronger and more predictable demand for SAF will improve the business case for project developers and financiers to invest in new facilities, thus increasing supply and advancing production technologies. As supply goes up, pricing comes down, which will further stimulate demand.

To create this dynamic, stakeholders in commercial aviation should focus on four catalytic, collective actions—two focused on demand and two addressing supply. Together, these actions can have an impact far exceeding what any individual player could achieve on its own.

Demand side: Aggregate demand.

Long-term, firm demand is essential to de-risk projects, attract investment, and increase production capacity. Mandates will help. The industry needs a full-fledged marketplace that can consolidate demand across a wide range of players to send strong demand signals to improve investor confidence and accelerate project timelines. Unlike supply-side factors, aggregating demand is less capital-intensive but plays a crucial role in creating the virtuous circle. Notable examples include:

Airbus's “book and claim” initiative gives aircraft and helicopter operators with limited SAF access the ability to buy SAF certificates through a centralized registry.

United Airlines’ Eco-Skies Alliance, which pools demand from over 30 global corporations (primarily corporate travel customers), enables the airline to secure more favorable SAF offtake terms and improve supply reliability.

While these programs are noteworthy, they are also relatively small-scale—serving primarily as a proof of concept and a foundation for more ambitious measures that can help the industry achieve critical mass.

Demand side: Set industry-wide standards for SAF markets.

The nascent stage of the SAF market entails fragmented, peer-to-peer transactions. Standardized frameworks can set consistent standards for SAF—including eligibility, contracting, and trading—leading to a transparent, liquid, scalable market.

Standards should also set clear criteria for SAF pathways, feedstocks, and decarbonization potential.

The adoption of common contracting schemes, trading practices, and indexes will simplify deal-making and enhance market liquidity, creating a more attractive environment for investors.

Supply side: Scale SAF projects.

To scale SAF production effectively, industry players must collaborate through consortiums that optimize capex and leverage economies of scale through mega-production facilities. In bio-SAF, numerous jumbo projects have already been announced, notably by Cepsa, Chevron, bp, DG Fuels, and truAlt alongside consortium partners—each targeting an output of several hundred (or even a million) kilotons of production. At the same time, bio-SAF is also more technologically mature, meaning that the cost-reduction potential through scale is lower.

In e-SAF, lower technology maturity and higher risk mean that most announcements have been for smaller projects, each producing a few tens of kilotons per year. Ramping up to bigger projects will require large consortiums bound by joint risk-sharing initiatives that can develop projects on time, achieve economies of scale, advance along the cost curve, and spur greater demand. Executing this kind of project will require a lineup of highly motivated and skilled partners to mitigate risks at every step, along with providing the capital needed.

The need for a bold vision in terms of e-SAF is growing, given that European mandates will require e-SAF as part of the overall jet fuel mix by 2030. Boeing is a good example. The company recently signed a strategic partnership with European provider Norsk e-Fuel to develop one of the continent’s first industrial-scale facilities to produce e-SAF.

Supply side: Collaborate on SAF innovation beyond 2030.

As the market continues to grow beyond 2030, the commercial aviation sector must secure access to breakthrough technologies to sustain momentum, reduce costs, and meet escalating demand. Advancing underfunded areas, particularly e-SAF, will be crucial to scaling non-biomass-constrained, high-performing fuels that align with stricter decarbonization mandates. For example, breakthrough innovations such as advanced carbon capture technologies or methanol-to-jet pathways to produce e-SAF hold the potential to push the cost of SAF closer to that of fossil fuels.

Across all four catalytic actions, success requires that some entity take a leading role in orchestration. Although this could fall to multiple segments in the commercial aviation value chain, we believe that aircraft and engine OEMs are potentially the most likely candidates, as they have the size, financial strength, and credibility that some airlines may not currently have. In addition, they have strong relationships across the value chain (for example, dealing directly with airlines in ways that project developers do not).",https://web-assets.bcg.com/dims4/default/39b2500/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2880x1512+0+54/resize/1200x630!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fboston-consulting-group-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F1a%2F08%2F27ca4fc44e76915f2793f77d1d6b%2Fsustainable-aviation-fuel-needs-faster-takeoff-rectangle.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:33.962705

Airbus is taking an important step toward promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by testing a “book and claim” approach. This initiative aims to increase both supply and demand for SAF worldwide and offers a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

SAF: Introduction to the Book and Claim Model

Airbus has introduced a process that allows buyers to “book” a specific amount of SAF and “claim” the corresponding emission reductions, even if the fuel is used for other purposes. This innovative model is intended to increase the accessibility of SAF, particularly for customers with limited quantities and distant delivery points.

Collaboration and support from the industry

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by other companies such as AerCap and Comlux. These partners have expressed interest in collaborating, underscoring the broad industrial ambition to increase the adoption of SAF. Airbus acts as a facilitator by acquiring SAF certificates and managing the associated sustainability attributes.

Objectives of the pilot program

The pilot program, which runs until 2025, is intended to provide crucial insights into the capacity and reliability of this mechanism. Airbus expects these tests to explore and foster market demand for third-party support of integrated SAF solutions. The company plans to use the results to further advance the adoption of this model in voluntary and regulated markets.

Access to SAF: Benefits for smaller operators and the markets

Many smaller operators face challenges accessing SAF, depending on the quantity required. Through this initiative, Airbus aims to simplify the process for operators and mitigate risk for SAF suppliers by securing financing for the certificates upfront. This allows for greater flexibility and supports short-term demand for SAF.",https://www.luftfahrtmagazin.de/lfm/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/airbus_saf_1.jpg,N,,2025-03-27 05:56:49.403206

(Reuters) – The sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) industry is falling short of its 2030 targets with production not ramping up quickly enough, Boston Consulting Group (BCG) found in a report published on Thursday.

European airlines are this year expected to meet a mandate of 2% SAF use in their jet fuel, with that set to rise to 6% by 2030. But many have lamented the high cost of the fuel, which is typically three to five times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.

The report found that airlines and airports are investing only 1% to 3% of revenue or budget allocation to SAF, with high production costs and fuel prices remaining the major challenges to adoption.

“We are going in the positive direction, but clearly not at the speed we need,” BCG Managing Director and Partner Pelayo Losada said of his findings in the co-authored report that surveyed more than 500 executives at about 200 aviation-related companies.

“Despite continuing to scale the availability of sustainable aviation fuel, and we see that trend very clearly, there is a slowdown in the development of projects and even bigger gaps to some of the commitments that some of the companies have made,” Losada said.

Reuters reported last month that low consumption and a lack of policy guidance have led to delays of some SAF projects in China.

While the global aviation industry is aiming to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and some countries have SAF mandates in place, the fuel accounted for only about 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024.

BCG’s report highlights that while SAF supply increased 1,150% worldwide over the last three years, announcements for new production facilities fell by 50% to 70% from 2022 to 2023.

BCG says this was largely due to economic uncertainty and higher energy and operating costs.

It now projects supply to fall 30% to 45% short of commercial aviation’s 2030 targets.

The project aims to establish a fully-integrated Ethanol to Jet (EtJ) facility that converts bioethanol derived from sugarcane grown onsite into 100% SAF, using proprietary PureSAFSM technology supplied from KBR, while also generating all of the project’s energy requirements from renewable sources. This unique vertically integrated and energy self-sufficient approach sets it apart from other SAF and EtJ projects globally.

The facility is expected to produce up to 96 million litres of SAF annually which will be supplied to nearby airports. Early modelling indicates a potential lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction of 70 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.[1]

For the airlines, this project aligns with the broader Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways in October 2024. The MoU cemented their intent to collaborate on sustainability initiatives that aim to reduce carbon emissions in air travel, and advance the use of SAF and Low Carbon Aviation Fuels (LCAF) in Australia.

In further encouraging support from the broader aviation ecosystem, The Boeing Company (TBC) has endorsed the project through a positive letter of support to RDA and in which TBC outlines its commitment to collaborate in a number of areas, including policy advocacy and the contribution of technical expertise, where relevant.[2]

The project, currently in pre-final investment decision stage, aims to deliver SAF from early 2029.

Commentary from Renewable Developments Australia

Renewable Developments Australia’s Managing Director, Tony D’Alessandro, said the partnership with Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways marks a significant milestone in the development of a sustainable aviation fuel industry in Australia.

“We are proud to be working with two globally recognised airlines that share our vision of creating a domestic supply of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. This project is designed to deliver real, long-term emission reductions while building a new industry in regional Queensland.

“Our Ethanol to Jet SAF facility in the Charters Towers Region will be a fully integrated production site, generating sustainable fuel from bioethanol derived from locally grown sugarcane. Additionally, by repurposing by-products of the SAF production process to generate renewable power onsite, we are setting a new benchmark for sustainability in aviation fuel manufacturing.

“This initiative is more than just a step towards decarbonising air travel; it represents a major investment in Australia’s energy security and regional economic development.”

Commentary from Virgin Australia

Virgin Australia Chief Corporate Affairs and Sustainability Officer, Christian Bennett said the project had close alignment with the priorities in the Virgin Australia and Qatar Airways MoU.

“The commercial aviation sector in Australia – indeed globally – faces an enormous task ahead in working towards a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2050, which we cannot do alone,” he said.

“Working together with industry partners and government to establish a domestic SAF industry in Australia will be essential – not only to achieve these shared emissions goals, but to strengthen Australia’s liquid fuel security by reducing reliance on global supply chains and creating new, secure, jobs for those living in regional Australia.

“We are delighted to be working with our strategic partner, Qatar Airways, and the team at RDA to try and bring this project to life. It is a task strongly aligned with a key priority of our MoU with Qatar Airways, which at its core focuses on advancing SAF and LCAF certification, production, and commercial uptake through strategic collaborations, with a focus on investing in Australia.”

To receive the funds, however, applicants will be required to remove “harmful DEIA and “far-left climate features” from project proposals.

According to the USDA, funding recipients will have 30 days to review and voluntarily revise their project plans to align with President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order issued on Jan. 20, 2025. The agency said the the revision process will give applicants “the opportunity to refocus their projects on expanding American energy production while eliminating Biden-era [diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA)] and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals.” USDA Rural Development will individually inform awardees about the revision requirement. Respondents will also be asked to answer several questions and provide a short narrative description of any proposed changes.

The USDA said the “updated guidance reflects a broader shift away from the Green New Deal and the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and toward practical energy investments that prioritize the needs of rural communities.”

The Unleashing American Energy Executive Order directed all federal agencies terminate the “Green New Deal” by immediately pausing the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and review whether those disbursements are in line policy guidelines outlined by the Trump administration. Within 90 days, the heads of each federal agency were to submit a report to the National Economic Council and the White House Office of Management and Budget detailing the findings of their reviews. The impacted IRA funds would be eligible for disbursement only after the OMB director and assistant to the president for economic policy determined that such disbursements are consistent with the administration’s goals.

This electric Tri-Converter demonstration has a capacity that is more than 50 times larger than the previously demonstrated pilot plant. The results represent a breakthrough for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The electric Tri-Converter converts waste carbon feedstocks into the syngas that supplies the downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit in the Aether Aurora process. The purpose of the demo was to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at an increasingly larger scale using a mix of real-world feedstocks, including biogenic CO2, renewable natural gas (RNG), and green hydrogen. The program is part of Aether’s program to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant (the “Demo Plant”) producing more than one barrel per day of sustainable fuels. Aether plans to complete the construction of the Demo Plant later this year.

The demonstrator is a joint project between Aether and GTI Energy. Aether Aurora integrates technology elements first developed by GTI Energy in a gas-to-liquids program, which is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Aether has licensed the relevant technologies from GTI Energy and leverages the laboratory and demonstration spaces at its Chicago-area campus. Aether has subsequently taken over responsibility for future Aether Aurora development and commercialization, including expanding its R&D team.

The results of the demonstrator validate that the electric Tri-Converter is ready for

integration into the Demo Plant. More critically, they demonstrate the solution’s capability

to use a wide range of abundant feedstocks to create sustainable fuels—a breakthrough

that can potentially shatter a key barrier to scaling production.

This milestone was celebrated yesterday at the Aether and GTI Energy demonstrator site

where Aether investors and feedstock executives joined federal, state and local officials to

view the technology, meet the team, tour Aether’s R&D center and GTI Energy lab spaces,

and learn how the innovations will accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels. State

Senator Laura Murphy (IL-28th) was on hand to deliver opening remarks.

The Syngas Generation Engine for Next-Gen Sustainable Fuels

Aether Aurora optimizes the well-established FT process to create drop-in liquid hydrocarbons leveraging its novel electric Tri-Converter and Upgrading technologies. As the solution’s “syngas generation engine”, the electric Tri-Converter improves and streamlines the process where feedstocks and the internally recycled downstream byproducts are converted into syngas. This is achieved via novel catalysts and a reactor that uses electricity instead of combustion to generate the reaction heat. Where typical syngas production requires multiple reactors to convert the same mix of inputs, Aether Aurora employs just one. The streamlined equipment configuration reduces CAPEX while the electrification innovations generate higher energy efficiency and yields than a conventional combustion reactor.

Aether’s demonstrator is supported by suppliers that include bp for RNG, Invenergy for clean hydrogen production, and Certarus Ltd for low carbon energy supply and logistics.

State Senator Murphy remarked, “The road to the future is paved in sustainable practices, and GTI Energy and Aether Fuels are at the forefront of this future. They are leading the way in developing energy solutions that will transform how we power industries, transportation and everyday life. Their innovation not only drives us forward, it drives economic growth that supports every hardworking Illinoisan.”

Aether CEO, Conor Madigan, said, “This is an exciting milestone for Aether and a tribute to our R&D experts and our partners at GTI Energy. The aviation and ocean shipping industries need affordable sustainable fuels at scale and the electric Tri-Converter technology is a transformative step forward. It drives critical process simplification and enables cost-efficient feedstock flexibility. When integrated into our Aether Aurora solution we’re making SAF production more scalable and cost effective.”

GTI Energy’s VP of Carbon Management and Conversion, Don Stevenson, said, “GTI Energy has a long history of pioneering advanced energy solutions, and we’re proud to see technologies incubated in our labs being integrated into solutions for scaling low-emission fuels. Through collaboration with DOE and companies like Aether Fuels, GTI Energy helps unlock the potential of waste carbon streams while creating economically viable fuels solutions for industries.”

Elie Fayad, Aether’s senior director of R&D, noted, ""Today’s milestone represents nearly a decade of dedicated innovation and significant R&D investment by GTI Energy and Aether Fuels. The electric Tri-Converter is one of the breakthroughs in our Aether Aurora solution that drastically improves SAF economics and brings large-scale deployment within reach.”

This partnership aligns with the Airbus Foundation's mission to collaborate with key stakeholders to innovate environmental solutions utilizing the unique capabilities of Airbus technologies.","1. Adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF):

Airbus is taking a significant step toward the large-scale adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) by piloting a new ""Book and Claim"" approach. This initiative seeks to boost both supply and demand for SAF worldwide, offering a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate its adoption.

The first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intent to increase SAF adoption.

In simple terms, the book and claim system allows the buyer to ""reserve"" a certain amount of SAF and ""claim"" the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot program running through 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, especially those with limited volumes and those far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) registry, a recognized sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and

helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot program is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in third-party facilitation of these integrated SAF solutions.

2. Hydrogen aircraft technologies:

During the Airbus Summit 2025, Airbus presented an updated roadmap for leading the future of commercial aviation in the coming decades, outlining plans for a next-generation single-aisle aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030s, as well as revising its

Project ZEROe plan to mature technologies associated with hydrogen-powered flight.

At the event, Airbus reiterated its commitment to bringing a commercially viable hydrogen aircraft to market and presented some of the key technological elements that will enable the arrival of a fully electric, fuel-cell-powered commercial aircraft, a path that is emerging as the most promising after years of research into hydrogen aviation.

Bruno Fichefeux, Head of Future Programs at Airbus, said: “Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonizing aviation. While we have adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we have seen in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the long-term potential to revolutionize air travel for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

These technologies were presented as part of a new theoretical hydrogen aircraft concept powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion motors, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel cell systems will be fueled by two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined in the coming years as additional testing helps mature the technologies associated with hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as the propulsion systems.

3. Advances in the next generation of single-aisle aircraft:

Airbus also presented an updated roadmap for leading the future of commercial aviation in the coming decades. The company presented potential technological building blocks for preparing a next-generation single-aisle aircraft that could enter service in the second half of the 2030s, as well as its updated roadmap for maturing technologies associated with hydrogen-powered flight.

Airbus today previewed details of the key technological components that could enable the entry into service of a next-generation single-aisle aircraft, with an expected 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared to the current generation, as well as the ability to fly on up to 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus also unveiled new design concepts for the different configurations being studied for this future aircraft, highlighting the various potential solutions being explored to achieve this significant leap forward in aircraft efficiency and support the aviation sector's roadmap towards net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Technologies include more efficient engines, with innovative open-fan designs; long, folding wings that enable significant aerodynamic improvements; next-generation batteries to enable hybrid architectures in which electricity is increasingly used to support both propulsion and non-propulsion functions onboard the aircraft; and lightweight materials and integrated systems for a connected aircraft.

4. Alliance between the Airbus Foundation and the Solar Impulse Foundation:

The Airbus Foundation and the Solar Impulse Foundation announced a three-year partnership aimed at promoting global progress in sustainability by fostering innovation and collaboration. The partnership is dedicated to identifying and accelerating the adoption of scalable nature-based projects* that address pressing

global challenges.

Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock.
The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.
Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision.
Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point.","Conor Madigan, founder and CEO of Chicago climate-tech company Aether Fuels, thinks the United States could — and should — be a leader in sustainable aviation fuel manufacturing, but first it has to get the policy right.

""We can make it a great manufacturing opportunity for the U.S., where we build plants [and] create jobs, not only at the factories but also to source all the feedstocks — something which disproportionately benefits rural communities,"" he told Chicago Inno at a media event this week. ""It's a great opportunity. The key to it, though, is that you have to have the best manufacturing technology because it's a commodity product. It's not like 'My SAF is better than your SAF.'""

Becoming an industry leader is going to be all about which companies — and the countries they operate out of — have the best technology to develop the cheapest and most efficient manufacturing plants, he added.

And right now, supporting local technological innovation in certain industries such as climate tech does not appear to be as big of a national priority for the current administration. Threats to national scientific funding sources have left some researchers and tech startups in the sector facing funding uncertainty.

Established in 2022 as a spinout of Xora Innovation, a Singapore-based early-stage deep-tech venture firm, Aether Fuels is working on technology that is considered a potential breakthrough for SAF production by converting waste into fuel. Last year, Aether Fuels announced a partnership with Illinois-based GTI Energy to work together to commercialize, scale and produce sustainable fuels from low-value waste streams like feedstock. The climate-tech startup announced a $34 million Series A raise in 2024.

Aether Fuels celebrated an important milestone on Tuesday, unveiling a new research-and-development center near Chicago O'Hare International Airport where it will look to scale-up SAF production. At the event, Madigan demonstrated for investors and other company stakeholders the company's electric tri-converter technology, which Madgian thinks has the potential to transform the sustainable fuels industry by accelerating large-scale deployment.

Aether Fuels plans to complete the construction of a demo plant later this year. After that, the company will look to continue to scale up in 2025.

What's next for Aether Fuels and why national policy will play a role

Madigan anticipates that by the end of the year, Aether Fuels will be announcing the location of its first commercial plant that will have the capacity produce more than 50 barrels per day.

The company's current pilot plant at GTI Energy's corporate campus in Des Plaines can produce 1.5 gallons per day — a fraction of a barrel, which in the U.S. oil industry is defined as 42 gallons. The demo plant at the same campus, which is slated to be operational this year, will push that to more than a barrel per day.

The location of Aether Fuels' next scaled-up manufacturing plant is still under consideration.

""Right now we're identifying candidate sites, talking to feedstock suppliers, off-takers [buyers] and strategic partners to assemble our top two, three [or] four options,"" he told Chicago Inno. ""By the end of the year, we will have selected and announced where that first commercial plant will be that we want to be in commercial operation by 2028.""

While Madigan is keeping his cards close to his chest right now on where the company might be looking, he did say Aether Fuels is considering sites both in the U.S. and internationally. Aether Fuels has offices in Chicago and Singapore.

""Our strategy definitely has a big focus here in the U.S., but we also have quite a focus in Southeast Asia,"" he said.

Incentives and other support offered, or a lack there of, will likely play a role in Aether Fuels' ultimate decision. Government support has helped Aether Fuels get to this point. The company's joint project with GTI Energy has been aided by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy, including funding through the Bioenergy Technologies Office.

""It definitely accelerated that project by two years for us to be able to get it to that scale so right off the bat we were way ahead of the game than a peer company that may not have had access to that kind of funding,"" Madigan said.

Still, Madigan knows government grant funding is always ""inherently unpredictable,"" and the company is prepared to push forward with or without new grant opportunities. However, he worries that if grant programs designed to incentivize commercial-scale facilities freeze, it could create a disincentive for a period of time to build commercial plants in the U.S., because companies like Aether Fuels may be able to get more support elsewhere.

Other countries like the U.K. and Japan have stricter SAF milestone objectives moving forward, with Japan aiming for 10% SAF use by 2030 and the U.K. requiring 2% of jet fuel to be SAF in 2025, increasing to 22% in 2040.

""This is a product where the majority of the demand is actually outside of the U.S. right now,"" Madigan explained. ""So while we're not the major consumer, what we can be is the biggest producer. This is a high-value product that people are desperate to get their hands on.""",https://media.bizj.us/view/img/12949004/dsc04476*1200xx6000-3381-0-46.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 17:56:26.283452

Christchurch, NZ and Brisbane, Australia, 26 March 2025 – Stralis Aircraft, Fabrum and Ara Ake are collaborating to advance hydrogen-powered aviation by designing, developing and testing liquid-hydrogen storage tanks and a fuel system for Stralis aircraft. The partnership aims to enable Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight – and support the transition toward zero-emission aviation.

Australian company Stralis Aircraft, which develops high-performance, low-operating-cost hydrogen-electric propulsion systems, will integrate Fabrum’s tanks and fuel system into its aircraft. New Zealand company Fabrum, which specialises in zero-emission transition technology, will provide lightweight composite tanks and dispensing systems, essential enablers for hydrogen-powered aircraft. The project is supported by Ara Ake, New Zealand’s future energy centre, and aligns with Fabrum’s recently announced hydrogen testing facility at Christchurch International Airport.

Christopher Boyle, Managing Director of Fabrum, said:

Our hydrogen liquefier provides readily available liquid hydrogen onsite, allowing the capability to access the critical fuel source to prove and test the tanks and fuel system we are developing for Stralis and their fixed-wing fuel-cell electric aircraft,

“With Ara Ake support, we are excited to be delivering our light-weight composite tanks and fuel system for Stralis to advance the future of hydrogen-powered flight.”

The collaboration also aims to strengthen industry ties between New Zealand and Australia. The project will build expertise in liquid-hydrogen storage refuelling, and aircraft integration, contributing to New Zealand’s growing role in hydrogen aviation.

Cristiano Marantes, CEO of Ara Ake, said:

This project is a strong example of Ara Ake’s role in connecting leading organisations across countries to advance real-world clean energy solutions,

“By enabling this initiative, we’re supporting the first hydrogen-electric demonstration with liquid hydrogen and positioning New Zealand as a global testbed for sustainable aviation innovation.”

Stralis’ fuel-cell technology is significantly lighter than existing alternatives, potentially enabling aircraft to fly ten times further than battery-electric solutions at a lower cost than fossil-fuel-powered planes. The company is already testing its hydrogen-electric propulsion systems with a team that has deep expertise in electric-aircraft development.

Stuart Johnstone, co-founder and CTO of Stralis Aircraft, said:

This project is a significant step forward for Stralis as we test and refine our hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and build our liquid hydrogen capability,

“We look forward to advancing hydrogen-electric aviation and fostering new partnerships in New Zealand.”

Green hydrogen is produced through electrolysis of water using renewable electricity. With an energy density three times higher than sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and over 100 times greater than batteries, hydrogen can offer a credible alternative for aviation[1].

The support from Ara Ake has enabled Stralis and Fabrum to accelerate the development of this technology, with the goal of achieving Australasia’s first liquid-hydrogen-powered flight. This collaboration represents not just a technical milestone, but a pivotal step toward making zero-emission aviation a commercial reality in Australasia and beyond.

“Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market,” said Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removals.
As with other ‘Book and Claim’ initiatives, Airbus’ model allows operators to book a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emissions reduction, no matter where the fuel is uplifted.
Challenges with Book and Claim While the Book and Claim approach offers a promising way to accelerate SAF adoption, it still comes with several challenges, one of which is regulatory uncertainty.
Educating stakeholders about how Book and Claim supports real emissions reduction will be key to the success of Airbus’ approach.","While sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) isn’t currently widely available at most airports, Airbus hopes its Book and Claim approach will help broaden the adoption of SAF.

The airframe manufacturer’s initiative aims to increase both supply and demand for SAF globally by providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate its wider adoption across the industry. “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market,” said Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of SAF and Carbon Dioxide Removals.

Facilitating SAF purchases

Airbus’ programme, which will see the OEM purchasing SAF certificates upfront and managing them through the Roundtable on Sustainable Biofuels (RSB) registry, has already gained industry support with SMBC Aviation Capital signing the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup. While Airbus will acquire SAF certificates directly many other Book and Claim models rely on third-party brokers or carbon offset marketplaces to handle transactions.

As with other ‘Book and Claim’ initiatives, Airbus’ model allows operators to book a certain amount of SAF and claim the corresponding emissions reduction, no matter where the fuel is uplifted. The objective is to improve SAF accessibility for customers who are located far away from supply points or who require limited volumes. The challenge here is that the success of Book and Claim still depends on having enough SAF production in the first place.

Airbus is piloting its model throughout 2025 to help evaluate the viability of its Book and Claim system and assess market interest in third-party facilitation of SAF transactions. Airbus’ model is also designed to support smaller operators, including business aviation customers and helicopter operators as well as larger airlines.

“For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed. Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and derisk the process for operators and SAF suppliers, by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them,” explained Manhes.

Challenges with Book and Claim

While the Book and Claim approach offers a promising way to accelerate SAF adoption, it still comes with several challenges, one of which is regulatory uncertainty. Some governments and industry regulators do not yet recognise Book and Claim as a valid carbon reduction mechanism. In addition, SAF incentives and regulations vary across regions, creating inconsistencies in how Book and Claim is treated in carbon accounting and compliance methods. Customer perception is another hurdle with some airlines and customers still preferring to refuel with a physical supply of SAF over indirect credits, while others may be skeptical about using SAF certificates.

The new body will function as a centralised platform to foster collaboration across governments, airlines, manufacturers, fuel providers, and other key stakeholders.

Tackling one of aviation’s biggest challenges

CADO aims to scale sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, advance zero-emission technologies, and establish global policy alignment to support the industry’s climate goals.

IATA’s Director General Willie Walsh said, “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF.”

“The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigour,”

The organisation’s mandate includes creating frameworks for financing green aviation projects, accelerating the certification of SAF and hydrogen technologies, and facilitating public-private partnerships to close the gap between ambition and action.

Why it matters now

The launch of CADO comes at a pivotal time for the aviation industry.

While passenger numbers are recovering post-pandemic, pressure is mounting from regulators, environmental groups, and travellers demanding more sustainable air travel.

Yet infrastructure gaps, supply limitations, and policy inconsistencies continue to slow momentum.

IATA hopes CADO will streamline international cooperation and drive policy incentives to accelerate decarbonisation efforts—particularly in developing economies and high-growth markets.

A regional opportunity for the Middle East

For the Middle East—a region home to some of the world’s fastest-growing airlines and aviation hubs—CADO presents a chance to shape the global conversation on green aviation.

With carriers like Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Saudia investing in next-generation fleets and exploring SAF partnerships, the region is poised to play a leading role in the transition.

This innovative approach seeks to bridge the gap between SAF production and consumption, offering a flexible and scalable solution to overcome logistical and economic barriers hindering widespread SAF usage.

Airbus, acting as a facilitator, will purchase SAF certificates and manage the sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a globally recognized certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, including aircraft and helicopter operators, fostering a robust demand for SAF in the short term.

The “Book and Claim” system allows aviation stakeholders to purchase SAF certificates, effectively claiming the associated emission reduction benefits, even if the physical SAF is utilized at a different location. This decoupling of physical fuel flow from emissions reduction claims is crucial for enabling smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points to participate in decarbonization efforts.

The company has already garnered significant industry support, with SMBC Aviation Capital signing the first Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Subsequently, AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup have also expressed their commitment to joining this collaborative initiative, signaling a strong industry-wide desire to accelerate SAF adoption.

The pilot program, scheduled throughout 2025, aims to provide vital insights into the functionality and scalability of the “Book and Claim” mechanism. It will assess the market's appetite for third-party facilitated SAF solutions and evaluate the robustness of the system in managing sustainability attributes.

Julien Manhes, Airbus head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, emphasized the significance of this initiative, stating, “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market. For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to SAF can be challenging depending on the amount of SAF needed.

Higher blend percentages, up to the internationally permitted limit of 50%, may be introduced in the future.
The fuel is a key component of the aviation sector’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.","Fuel distributor Vibra announced on Tuesday (25) that it has begun offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in Brazil. The imported biofuel is now available at its facility at the Tom Jobim International Airport (GIG) in Rio de Janeiro.

With this move, Vibra becomes the first company to supply sustainable aviation fuel in the country.

SAF is a central component of the aviation sector’s strategy to reduce CO₂ emissions. Brazil is seen as a potential global player in SAF production given its expertise in ethanol. However, the country has yet to produce the fuel domestically.

The Galeão terminal facility recently obtained International Sustainability & Carbon Certification (ISCC), ensuring sustainability tracking across the entire supply chain—from raw materials to bio-refinery production and final distribution at the airport via BR Aviation, Vibra’s aircraft fueling business unit.

Produced from renewable sources, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

First shipment from Belgium

In January, 23 iso-tank containers carrying approximately 550,000 liters of SAF departed from the Port of Antwerp in Belgium bound for Rio de Janeiro.

The SAF supplied by Vibra is derived from used cooking oil (UCO), one of the lowest-carbon-intensity feedstocks since it is a waste product.

Initially, the fuel will be blended at a 10% SAF to 90% conventional jet fuel ratio. Higher blend percentages, up to the internationally permitted limit of 50%, may be introduced in the future.

“We are ready to expand SAF availability in the Brazilian market, leveraging our infrastructure in over 90 airports and our expertise in delivering safe and competitive solutions,” said Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s chief operating officer, in a statement.

Industry targets net-zero by 2050

According to projections from the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production reached approximately 1.9 billion liters in 2024—three times the volume produced in 2023.

The fuel is a key component of the aviation sector’s goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. However, in 2024, SAF accounted for just 0.53% of the industry’s total fuel demand, highlighting the sector’s challenge in attracting investment and public policies to boost production.

Beyond limited availability, SAF remains significantly more expensive than conventional jet fuel. Depending on the region, its price can be more than five times higher. Vibra has not disclosed details about SAF pricing in Brazil.

Fuel costs currently represent about 30% of an airline’s operating expenses worldwide, rising to 40% in Brazil.

As America races toward a greener future, the demand for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has never been higher. Minnesota is seizing the opportunity to break into this emerging industry before the competition, leveraging its agricultural strength to kickstart a hub that could establish the state as a pioneer in SAF production.

The Minnesota SAF Hub, a coalition comprising the Greater MSP Partnership, Bank of America, Delta Air Lines, Ecolab, Xcel Energy and other stakeholders, is on a journey to develop a fully integrated SAF supply chain in Minnesota.

A “Demand Consortium” including Bank of America, Deloitte, Delta and Ecolab will purchase the first several million gallons of SAF each year, starting during the second half of 2025. Each participating company is providing funding to scale production, drive down costs, increase continued demand and reduce carbon emissions associated with their employee business travel.

“While Delta has committed to purchasing millions of gallons of SAF, there isn’t enough being produced today to fuel the world’s commercial airlines for a single week,” said Peter Carter, Delta’s executive vice president of external affairs, in September. “That’s why this blending facility is so important — it’s like hanging an ‘Open for Business’ sign to SAF producers to consider doing business in Minnesota, where we see SAF as a great opportunity for all players across the value chain.”

Plant-Powered Progress

Minnesota SAF Hub partners at the University of Minnesota Forever Green Initiative are also developing a novel crop called winter camelina seed, which can be used for various purposes, including producing oil for conversion into SAF. It has one of the lowest carbon intensity scores among the many feedstocks used for producing SAF today. Corn, soybeans, canola, continuous living cover crops, agricultural biomass, woody biomass, hydrogen, waste oils and fats are also used to produce SAF, all of which are available in Minnesota.

Cargill, an American multinational food corporation based in Minnetonka, is collaborating with the university on this project, expanding its active role in growing the Midwest’s supply of this versatile crop.

In 2023, Cargill worked with Minnesotan and North Dakotan farmers to plant 2,000 acres of winter camelina. In September 2024, the first 7,000-gallon shipment of blended SAF made from these crops arrived at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport fueling facility.

“This initial SAF delivery is another example of how we are making SAF real in Minnesota and showing the world how to do it right,” said Peter Frosch, president and CEO of the GREATER MSP Partnership. “We are highlighting the first SAF flight from MSP International as another major milestone in our push to build a SAF economy anchored in Minnesota. This ambitious effort is moving fast and gaining momentum due to the bold leadership of Minnesota SAF Hub partner organizations. The Minnesota SAF Hub is on track to create thousands of good jobs for Minnesotans by delivering a climate solution the nation and world urgently need.”

In January, through its Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) awarded the University of Minnesota $10 million for the Oilseed Crops to Sustain the Environment and Meet Energy Demand (OILSEED) project led by Mitchell Hunter, PhD, co-director of the university’s Forever Green Initiative. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture, U of M, Cargill and North Dakota State University are providing a combined $2.5 million in additional funds.

“Winter oilseed crops like camelina and pennycress have the potential to be adopted on millions of acres in our region in the coming years and decades,” Hunter said, citing a recent report that found widespread adoption of camelina, pennycress and other crops that provide over-winter cover could reduce nitrogen loss from farmland by 23% and soil erosion by 35%. “The winter oilseeds can preserve topsoil, protect water quality, feed pollinators and, by producing low-carbon fuel, help fight climate change, all while giving farmers a new source of income.”

Sustainable Growth

While building a strong network from within is essential, the true test of a hub’s potential comes when a newcomer decides to join the club. Through initiatives such as the SAF Tax Credit, the coalition is actively working to bring producers of all sizes and varying feedstocks to the state. DG Fuels’ decision to locate a manufacturing facility in Moorhead, expected to generate $50 billion in economic impact, marked a major milestone for the Minnesota SAF Hub, cementing the state’s reputation as a rising leader in the industry.

Attracting a project of this magnitude will make significant headway in addressing the demand for SAF at MSP International Airport, which currently outstrips supply. DG Fuels expects this new facility to produce 193 million gallons of low CO2 lifecycle emission SAF each year, representing nearly half of the fuel used at the airport.

As of November, the Minnesota SAF Hub was working with DG Fuels and the City of Moorhead on the next set of requirements to advance this project, including aggregating feedstocks. DG Fuels’ manufacturing process uses cellulosic biomass in the form of lower-value agricultural by-products such as corn stover and timber waste as its feedstock. It also incorporates various forms of clean hydrogen feedstock to produce near-zero carbon fuel.

Accessible labor and logistics helped the company choose Moorhead, DF Fuels Chairman and CEO Michael Darcy told Site Selection’s Ron Starner in January. “We can rail aviation fuel to refineries in Minnesota to feed our customers at the airport. That is a barrier in the rest of the country. Minnesota helped us with the logistics.” The state also helped with attitude: “Having a proactive state is always a good thing for a project,” Darcy said. “Minnesota on its own worked out a deal to have SAF refined there. We wish more states did that.”

Located within the Red River Valley, Moorhead and its neighboring communities in Clay County are surrounded by some of the nation’s most fertile land, bolstering a thriving agricultural sector that provides a strong foundation for SAF production. In addition to this wealth of natural resources, Moorhead boasts Minnesota’s largest shovel-ready industrial park, the MCCARA Industrial Park, adding to the area’s attractiveness and growing business climate.

On Tuesday (March 25), we were excited to deliver the first of 99 F404-IN20 engines to our valued customer Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) for the Tejas Light Combat Aircraft Mk 1A fight jet. It is an important milestone in our 40-year relationship with HAL and in our efforts to ensure a strong future for India’s military by developing next-generation fighters while enhancing the country’s defense manufacturing capabilities.

GE Aerospace has a strong history of military jet propulsion collaboration in India. After collaborating with the Aeronautical Development Agency in the 1980s, GE Aerospace’s F404-IN20 engine was selected for the single-engine Tejas in 2004. This was an important breakthrough for both India and GE Aerospace.

Our F404 engine family, one of the most successful in military aviation history, powers thousands of combat aircraft worldwide. The F404-IN20 engine is a tailored design for India’s single-engine fighter with the highest thrust within F404 family and a higher-flow fan, unique single-crystal turbine blades, and numerous special components. GE Aerospace and Tejas teams collaborated closely for several years to customize it for the needs of Indian Air Force. The F404 demonstrated it was an excellent fit for the Tejas LCA. On its first test flight in 2008, the aircraft climbed to numerous mission altitudes and achieved Mach 1.1 speed.

By 2016, GE Aerospace fulfilled its commitment to HAL and delivered 65 F404-IN20 engines for the Tejas LCA. With no additional engine orders on the horizon, the production line for F404-IN20 was shut down. However, when HAL ordered an additional 99 engines in 2021 for the Tejas Mk1A LCA, our team began the complex task of restarting the F404-IN20 production line, which had been dormant for five years, and re-engaging the engine’s global supply chain.

Restarting a jet engine production line is a challenging process. Restarting the F404-IN20 engine line during the COVID pandemic was even more challenging. With a high focus on safety and quality, and a remarkable commitment from our supply chain teams and our suppliers and partners, we have managed to restart the line. Our proprietary lean operating model, FLIGHT DECK, helped us alleviate bottlenecks and identify solutions to improve manufacturing processes and turnaround time. Today, we are working closely with our suppliers to ramp up production on parts and materials for the F404-IN20.

We will continue to work together with our suppliers to keep the production line efficient, maintain the highest standards of safety and quality, and deliver to our customer. This week’s first engine delivery is a testament to what we have accomplished with HAL over the past 40 years, and a symbol of our combined potential to ensure a strong future for India’s military.",https://www.geaerospace.com/sites/default/files/aerospace-1200x650-1.jpeg,N,,2025-03-26 12:57:23.323411

This electric Tri-Converter demonstration has a capacity that is more than 50 times larger than the previously demonstrated pilot plant. The results represent a breakthrough for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

The electric Tri-Converter converts waste carbon feedstocks into the syngas that supplies the downstream Fischer-Tropsch (FT) unit in the Aether Aurora process. The purpose of the demo was to prove that the electric Tri-Converter can continuously produce syngas at an increasingly larger scale using a mix of real-world feedstocks, including biogenic CO2, renewable natural gas (RNG), and clean hydrogen. The program is part of Aether’s program to build and operate a fully integrated demonstration plant (the “Demo Plant”) producing more than one barrel per day of sustainable fuels. Aether plans to complete the construction of the Demo Plant later this year.

The demonstrator is a joint project between Aether and GTI Energy. Aether Aurora integrates technology elements first developed by GTI Energy in a gas-to-liquids program, which is supported by grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). Aether has licensed the relevant technologies from GTI Energy and leverages the laboratory and demonstration spaces at its Chicago-area campus. Aether has subsequently taken over responsibility for future Aether Aurora development and commercialization, including expanding its R&D team.

The results of the demonstrator validate that the electric Tri-Converter is ready for integration into the Demo Plant. More critically, they demonstrate the solution’s capability to use a wide range of abundant feedstocks to create sustainable fuels—a breakthrough that can potentially shatter a key barrier to scaling production.

This milestone was celebrated yesterday at the Aether and GTI Energy demonstrator site where Aether investors and feedstock executives joined federal, state and local officials to view the technology, meet the team, tour Aether’s R&D center and GTI Energy lab spaces, and learn how the innovations will accelerate the transition to sustainable fuels. State Senator Laura Murphy (IL-28th) was on hand to deliver opening remarks.

The Syngas Generation Engine for Next-Gen Sustainable Fuels

Aether Aurora optimizes the well-established FT process to create drop-in liquid hydrocarbons leveraging its novel electric Tri-Converter and Upgrading technologies. As the solution’s “syngas generation engine”, the electric Tri-Converter improves and streamlines the process where feedstocks and the internally recycled downstream byproducts are converted into syngas. This is achieved via novel catalysts and a reactor that uses electricity instead of combustion to generate the reaction heat. Where typical syngas production requires multiple reactors to convert the same mix of inputs, Aether Aurora employs just one. The streamlined equipment configuration reduces CAPEX while the electrification innovations generate higher energy efficiency and yields than a conventional combustion reactor.

Aether’s demonstrator is supported by suppliers that include bp for RNG, Invenergy for clean hydrogen production, and Certarus Ltd for low carbon energy supply and logistics.

State Senator Murphy remarked: “The road to the future is paved in sustainable practices, and GTI Energy and Aether Fuels are at the forefront of this future. They are leading the way in developing energy solutions that will transform how we power industries, transportation and everyday life. Their innovation not only drives us forward, it drives economic growth that supports every hardworking Illinoisan.”

Aether CEO, Conor Madigan, said: “This is an exciting milestone for Aether and a tribute to our R&D experts and our partners at GTI Energy. The aviation and ocean shipping industries need affordable sustainable fuels at scale and the electric Tri-Converter technology is a transformative step forward. It drives critical process simplification and enables cost-efficient feedstock flexibility. When integrated into our Aether Aurora solution we’re making SAF production more scalable and cost effective.”

GTI Energy’s VP of Carbon Management and Conversion, Don Stevenson, said: “GTI Energy has a long history of pioneering advanced energy solutions, and we’re proud to see technologies incubated in our labs being integrated into solutions for scaling low-emission fuels. Through collaboration with DOE and companies like Aether Fuels, GTI Energy helps unlock the potential of waste carbon streams while creating economically viable fuels solutions for industries.”

Elie Fayad, Aether’s Senior Director of R&D, noted: ""Today’s milestone represents nearly a decade of dedicated innovation and significant R&D investment by GTI Energy and Aether Fuels. The electric Tri-Converter is one of the breakthroughs in our Aether Aurora solution that drastically improves SAF economics and brings large-scale deployment within reach.”

Aether Aurora is trademarked by Aether Fuels.

,,2025-03-26 15:35:24+00:00,Deloitte,Sustainability Briefing: sustainable aviation fuels | Deloitte Germany,"Prof. Dr. Bernhard Lorentz, Ines Österle",,,,,https://www.deloitte.com/de/de/our-thinking/sustainability-briefings/sustainability-briefing-sustainable-aviation-fuels.html,"Aviation biofuels are projected to scale rapidly.
Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040.
But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake.
Building a competitive and sustainable aviation industry in the EU The mandatory fuel quota in place since January 1, 2025, has the EU aviation industry embarking on an ambitious journey towards a climate-neutral yet competitive future.
Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.","A net-zero aviation future requires large quantities of SAF

Global aviation accounts for around 2.5% of CO2 emissions.4 Strong growth in aviation demand is outpacing aircraft fuel efficiency, causing emissions to rise relentlessly.5

To reduce aviation-related emissions, SAFs offer a practical solution. Chemically similar to fossil kerosene,6 these drop-in fuels can be used in high proportions in existing aircraft, can be produced globally, and transported to demand centers using existing infrastructure. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), the leading global industry body representing all actors across the aviation value chain, estimates that SAFs could drive 65% of the emission reduction needed to achieve the body’s net-zero emission goal by mid-century.7 The remaining emission reductions will be met by new aircraft technologies, continued improvement in air-traffic management and aircraft operations, and carbon capture and offsetting.8

Creating a net-zero aviation industry thus requires large-scale production and use of SAFs. Deloitte estimates that in a net-zero scenario, total production volumes of SAFs will need to reach 37 million tons by 2030 and 297 million tons by 2050. In the long-term, these volumes will consist of nearly equal shares of biofuel and synthetic fuel, the two main SAF categories (Figure 1).

Aviation biofuels are projected to scale rapidly. They are primarily produced from oils and fats using the so called HEFA (Hydrotreated Esters and Fatty Acids) production pathway, which has long been in use, particularly for biodiesel production. Biofuels can also be produced from other renewable feedstocks, but various sectors compete for their deployment and feedstock is limited, throwing up a barrier to scale production.

Synthetic aviation fuels (also known as e-kerosene) are not yet available on the market but production is projected to ramp up rapidly by 2040. These fuels are produced from clean hydrogen and sustainably sourced carbon dioxide (CO2) (see box 1), and offer greater scalability than biofuels, since CO2 is more abundant than biogenic feedstocks.2

The EU sets ambitious quotas to enable scaling of the SAF market

SAFs represent a crucial decarbonization solution for the EU aviation industry to reach the Union’s goal of a 90% reduction of transport-related emissions by mid-century. But its high production costs mean SAFs are not cost competitive with fossil kerosene, hindering its market uptake. To move SAFs beyond their nascent market stage, the EU is stepping in with ambitious fuel quotas under the ReFuelEU aviation regulation (Figure 2). Starting January 1, 2025, aircraft fuel suppliers must comply with these quotas.

With fuel quotas set to reach 70% by 2050, the EU is taking the global lead in regulatory measures for establishing the SAF market. At the global level, key stakeholders recognize the importance of SAFs in reaching climate targets, and SAF mandates are already being planned and implemented in several countries, including Japan, Malaysia, Canada, Türkiye, and Indonesia.12 However, only the United Kingdom has introduced a fuel mandate that approaches the level of ambition of ReFuelEU aviation. On January 1, 2025, it implemented a mandatory SAF share that will rise to 16% by 2035, but only to 24% by 2050.13

A major barrier to market introduction is the high production cost of SAFs

The SAF mandate aims to accelerate the adoption of alternative fuels by ensuring a steady demand path within the EU, but high production costs remain a challenge for their uptake. In 2023, the average market price of HEFA SAF in the EU was EUR 2,768 per ton – 340% higher than the price of fossil kerosene.2 Based on these prices, the quota now in place is estimated to lead to a 5% increase in fuel cost.

While HEFA SAF will play a key role in meeting the quota in the coming years, synthetic fuels must be in use by 2030. A review of cost estimates in the literature shows that production costs are expected to decrease over time as production scales and technologies further mature. However, the cost of SAFs produced with CO2 from direct air capture (DAC) will still be 30% to 280% higher by 2050 compared with the price of conventional jet fuel in 2023 (Figure 3).14 SAFs produced with DAC are more expensive than those produced with CO2 from point sources such as industrial facilities. However, as decarbonization progresses, this CO2 source will become increasingly scarce.2

The main cost drivers of synthetic fuels are stringent energy requirements that lead to significant operating costs, followed by high capital expenditure. Financing costs further contribute to overall expense. Deloitte estimates that the cost of capital for solar power projects, such as those providing the renewable electricity needed to produce synthetic fuels, varies from 7% in Western Europe to about 18% in Sub-Saharan Africa.15 A key strategy for reducing the cost of the debt and equity and improving SAF bankability is to mitigate risk, including political, regulatory, technical, market, and financial risks.

Building a competitive and sustainable aviation industry in the EU

The mandatory fuel quota in place since January 1, 2025, has the EU aviation industry embarking on an ambitious journey towards a climate-neutral yet competitive future. Major challenges include reducing the price gap and scaling SAF production in the EU and globally.

Several instruments can help reduce costs and improve the bankability of SAF projects, one of which is offtake contracts. These are long-term purchase agreements (typically up to 20 years) with SAF producers that ensure stable revenue streams. Such contracts help mitigate price fluctuation and demand uncertainty, making it easier for producers to secure funding and scale production. For instance, the largest contract in 2024, measured in SAF volume,16 secures IAG’s European airlines a long-term supply of e-kerosene produced by Twelve in the US.17

Meanwhile, none of the planned European production of e-kerosene has yet passed final investment decision.18 The EU’s Clean Industrial Deal promises a window of opportunity, and the European Commission has announced a Sustainable Transport Investment Plan prioritizing short- and medium-term support for sustainable aviation fuels.3 Specific instruments to reduce the price gap for domestically produced synthetic fuels have been announced for the longer term.19

The journey to widespread SAF adoption is challenging, and strategic policy measures, innovative financing solutions, and long-term investment will play a crucial role in preparing sustainable aviation for take-off.

Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus Head of Future Programmes, said:

“Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonise aviation. While we’ve adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionise air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

The aviation industry accounts for approximately 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with that figure potentially rising dramatically over the coming decades if no action is taken. Several initiatives are being pursued in order to address the climate impact of the industry, typically involving efforts to improve aircraft efficiency, develop sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), or create aircraft utilizing low or zero carbon propulsion systems such as electric or hydrogen-based.

While many initiatives are currently targeting areas allowing for more rapid sector decarbonization, such as electrified propulsion or SAF, hydrogen is viewed by some in the industry as a more promising long-term solution, given its potential to be produced through carbon-free methods, and its energy attributes, containing significantly more energy per weight than jet fuel.

Airbus had previously announced a goal to develop the world’s first zero-emission commercial aircraft by 2035, stating that it had identified hydrogen as one of the most promising zero-emissions solutions, as it emits no carbon dioxide when generated from renewable energy, with water being its most significant by-products.

The company launched its ZEROe program in 2020, exploring the feasibility of hydrogen propulsion technologies, based on either hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. While not ruling out future investments into hydrogen combustion, Airbus said that it has selected hydrogen fuel cell technology as the propulsion method for its future aircraft, following the results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, which supported the viability of the technology.

The new aircraft will feature an electric propeller propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells that convert hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy through a chemical reaction, producing only water as a byproduct. The aircraft will be powered by four, 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system, and supplied by liquid hydrogen tanks.

Glenn Llewellyn, Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project, said:

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”",https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airbus-Hydrogen.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 10:56:29.949875

This initiative aims to boost both supply and demand for sustainable aviation fuel worldwide, providing a flexible and scalable solution to accelerate SAF adoption.

The first MoU was signed by SMBC Aviation Capital, followed by AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment and SAF Aerogroup, who confirmed their interest in joining this collaborative initiative, reinforcing the industry-wide intention to increase the adoption of alternative fuels.

Book and Claim approaches for adopting SAF use

In simple terms, the Book and Claim approach allows a buyer to “book” a certain amount of sustainable aviation fuel and “claim” the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and who are far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body.

These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, therefore stimulating the short-term demand for SAF.

Scaling up the market for alternative fuels

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative Book and Claim mechanism. It will also assess market interest in the third-party facilitation of these integrated SAF solutions.

Julien Manhes, Airbus Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals, said: “Supporting the SAF Book and Claim mechanism is an immediate solution contributing to the emergence and scale-up of the global SAF market.

“For a lot of smaller operators, getting access to sustainable aviation fuel can be challenging, depending on the amount needed.

“Through this initiative, Airbus can simplify and de-risk the process for operators and SAF suppliers by financially securing SAF certificates upfront and sharing them when customers need them.

“This is also a great opportunity to demonstrate that Book and Claim is reliable and that its usage should be extended in voluntary and regulatory markets.”

Further Airbus initiatives to achieve net zero

Airbus aligns with global and binding decarbonisation programmes, in addition to other market-based measures, to help cap the aviation industry’s CO2 emissions.

This supports and contributes to the industry-wide ambition to implement global market-based measures for the aviation industry.

The aviation industry, including Airbus, has committed to an industry-wide decarbonisation movement that includes the following key targets:",https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/shutterstock_2563538061-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 09:56:09.046433

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) to study the aviation sector's non-CO2 emissions with a focus on contrails.

Recent studies suggest that the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAFs.

The project will test a range of fuels under controlled conditions, with consistency in combustion parameters and hardware. Lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center will extend to full-aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse in France.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions.

It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

In related news, Airbus is seeking to scale up SAF adoption with a new 'Book and Claim' approach. This allows a buyer to 'book' a certain amount of SAF and 'claim' the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere.

The fantasy that the renowned author Jules Verne envisioned in his novel, The Mysterious Island, is close to becoming reality thanks to low-emission hydrogen, and particularly green hydrogen. This fuel created through the electrolysis of water (decomposition of the H2O molecule into hydrogen and oxygen) using renewable energy sources could hold the key to the decarbonization of some sectors in which direct electrification is still very complicated, such as heavy transport or certain industrial processes.

Some of the biggest benefits of green hydrogen include its versatility, its low level of harmful emissions, and minimal waste. “Green hydrogen is a replacement for gray hydrogen (produced using natural gas and other polluting hydrocarbons) and greatly diminishes emissions compared to other options. Its use is crucial to the decarbonization of the steel sector, and other sectors that use natural gas or coal, such as the aluminum or cement industries. It also holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors through the production of green methanol, or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF),” explained the engineer Gotzon Gómez Sarasola, Head of Spain and Portugal for the Stegra Project. This Swedish startup is dedicated to the decarbonization of the economy, and has become one of the leading companies in the production of green hydrogen in Europe.

According to estimates in the European Union report Hydrogen Roadmap Europe: A sustainable pathway for the European Energy Transition, clean hydrogen could prevent 560 million tons of CO2 annually in Europe by 2050. The EU believes that it has the potential to generate around 2,250 TWh of hydrogen across all sectors, or one-fourth of Europe’s total energy demand. This energy could power approximately 42 million large cars, 1.7 million trucks, or more than 5,500 trains. It would also heat the equivalent of 52 million homes and cover up to 10% of energy demand for buildings. Furthermore, combining captured carbon or biomass with 120 TWh of hydrogen could produce synthetic feedstock for 40 million tons of chemical products by 2050.

This is one of the reasons that Brussels is one of the biggest defenders of this technology. The EU set a goal of producing 10 million tons by the end of this decade.

Challenges remain

However, several challenges must be overcome before it can be established as a real alternative to fossil fuels. At the moment, the high cost of this gas compared to the fuels it seeks to replace is one of the biggest obstacles. Gómez Sarasola stresses that financing for projects of this kind is conditioned by the high value of the so-called ‘green premium’, or the higher price consumers are willing to pay for a sustainable, but more expensive alternative compared to a cheaper, more polluting one. “Many green hydrogen production projects do not get off the ground due to a lack of buyers willing to assume this ‘green premium’ over gray hydrogen,” he warned.

Gómez Sarasola (Stegra): “Green hydrogen holds the key to the decarbonization of the shipping and steel sectors”

Rafael Cossent, a researcher at the Institute of Technological Research (IIT) of the ICAI School of Engineering at Comillas Pontifical University, is one of Spain’s leading experts in hydrogen. He currently co-directs the Chair of Hydrogen Studies at ICAI-ICADE, a prestigious educational institution linked to the University. The expert explains that the investments related to green hydrogen are high because they often entail also making adjustments to the equipment so they can use this fuel. “New engines, furnaces, and burners for industry are needed… It means developing supply structures and creating new facilities.”

Reducing investment costs is a priority, but the same applies to operating costs, this expert noted. “Cheaper electricity is needed, as well as reducing consumption per kilogram generated, improving the efficiency of electrolysis and enhancing plant design to optimize processes.”

Another issue that must be addressed is how to get this fuel to consumers. “Transportation in trucks is already a reality for small volumes and short distances, but establishing a large-scale open hydrogen network has to deal with uncertainty surrounding the development of sufficient demand”, Cossent argued.

Franz Bechtold (Lhyfe): “The massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements”

Franz Bechtold of Lhyfe, a pioneering business group that opened the world’s first green hydrogen production plant directly connected to a wind farm in 2021, pointed to other factors that are hindering the change. “The lack of infrastructure is blocking many projects and raising the final production cost of others.” The same goes for the absence of “clear administrative guidelines regarding what will occur in the future in terms of both emission taxes and other medium-term aid,” he warned.

Momentum in Europe

Despite these obstacles, the potential of this technology to decarbonize heavy industry means that green hydrogen projects are on the rise. Lhyfe, which is present in 11 European countries, is also developing projects in the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Vallmoll plant (Tarragona), and intends to weave a renewable hydrogen network throughout the country. Besides, Gómez Sarasola from Stegra confirms the potential of the Iberian Peninsula for the deployment of this technology: “Spain and Portugal are the only countries, apart from northern Scandinavia, that have the capacity to produce renewable electricity in large volumes and at a competitive price. The electricity grids of the two countries are expected to have 80-85% renewable energy by 2030,” he argues.

The European Hydrogen Bank —an initiative created by the European Union with the aim of promoting the renewable hydrogen market through subsidies for companies to cover the cost difference between renewable hydrogen and fossil fuels— recently completed a pilot auction for €720 million, benefiting seven projects: three in Spain, two in Portugal and the remaining two in Norway and France.

For Betchtold, “the massive adoption of renewable energy and government aid will both be key elements in order to make hydrogen one of the most viable solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Another factor that could accelerate this time frame, Gómez Sarasola added, is “reinforcing grid interconnections between generation plants and consumption projects.”",https://www.bbva.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bbva-sostenibilidad-ethic-hidrogeno-verde-1024x575.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 11:56:28.414819

Along with a consortium of 10 European partners, PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) aims to bridge the gap in understanding aviation's non-CO2 emissions by testing a range of fuels under controlled conditions.

The project is expected to ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions.

Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques.

Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

Airbus said the project ‘will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.’

In a statement, Airbus CTO Sabine Klauke said: ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency.

“The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions.

As Executive Vice President of HR, Hannele Jakosuo-Jansson knew she would have a critical role to play in aligning the company’s policies, leadership development, and talent strategy with its new direction.
Key enablers of transformation: culture and people When a company undergoes a major transformation or shift in its strategy, it is crucial to bring organizational culture and key people-related issues into close alignment with the evolving strategy.
As Jakosuo-Jansson puts it: “Culture and people are the key enablers of transformation.” The board of directors plays a critical role in this process.
I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity.","Back in 2006, Neste made a big decision. After 75 years in oil and gas, the company opted to make the transition to renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel, a move that would position it globally as a future leader in the renewable fuel sector.

The shift to renewables wasn’t simply about Neste adopting new technologies or entering new markets. This was a comprehensive strategic shift that required the organization to fundamentally rethink its structure, its culture, and its talent pipeline.

Big questions arose, among them: what capabilities were they going to need to make this transition successfully? How would culture and talent management have to evolve? And did they have the right people in situ to successfully execute the new strategy?

As Executive Vice President of HR, Hannele Jakosuo-Jansson knew she would have a critical role to play in aligning the company’s policies, leadership development, and talent strategy with its new direction.

From the outset, hers was an approach grounded in open communication and unwavering integrity, together with the ability to accurately assess leadership quality and capabilities, while simultaneously managing sensitive interactions and discussions.

Key enablers of transformation: culture and people

When a company undergoes a major transformation or shift in its strategy, it is crucial to bring organizational culture and key people-related issues into close alignment with the evolving strategy. As Jakosuo-Jansson puts it: “Culture and people are the key enablers of transformation.”

The board of directors plays a critical role in this process.

While boards must avoid getting into management’s operational responsibility, they instead have a very important role in promoting a strong and resilient culture, and in facilitating leadership development that maps to the organization’s strategic needs, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Boards must define a set of clearly articulated profiles in terms of future leadership, effectively translating the organization’s broader strategy into its new leadership requirements. And this involves regularly reviewing and updating succession plans to reflect evolving business priorities.”

Boards must also oversee talent across the entirety of the organization – and with a broader scope and longer time horizon than management. And this means engaging in detailed discussions around workforce planning, recruitment, and leadership development.

“While boards do not manage talent directly, they must nonetheless ensure that the right systems and processes are put in place to develop and retain the organization’s future leaders,” she adds, “And they must make sure that sufficient time and energy are given to these efforts.”

CEO succession planning and the importance of cultural fit

CEO succession planning is critical, and it must be an integral element of risk management. Jakosuo-Jansson’s advice? Start as early as possible.

“Planning should begin as soon as a new CEO takes office. It should be part of regular board discussions and not treated as a sensitive topic to be discussed behind closed doors. Open dialogue with the current CEO fosters trust and ensures alignment on leadership needs.”

In times of transformation, leadership pipelines need to have great flexibility.

A dramatic change may require external insights or leadership with new capabilities, prompting boards to look beyond internal succession plans. Sometimes, hiring an external candidate with fresh perspectives is essential for success in a new direction. But it’s critical not to underestimate cultural fit here, says Jakosuo-Jansson.

“Even if the ideal CEO candidate exists, you must also look at their character. I have witnessed executives coming from completely different industries who haven’t focused enough on the company culture and business complexity. That’s why we should not underestimate the importance of cultural fit.”

Ultimately, success lies in being able to identify leaders who have both strategic vision and execution capabilities, but who are also capable of developing a strong performance and organizational culture.",https://www.imd.org/ibyimd/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/People-Culture-and-Strategy-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 07:56:39.330891

Electric propulsion

The company showcased a notional concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. Two liquid hydrogen tanks would support the system. Further testing will refine the concept, focusing on hydrogen storage, distribution, and propulsion systems.

“Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts before selecting this fully electric concept,” said Glenn Llewellyn, head of the ZEROe project. “We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2-megawatt hydrogen propulsion system, followed by end-to-end testing in 2024 of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters, and heat exchangers.

The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year.
Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation.
A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved.
This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.","To support the goals of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production and enhance feedstock availability, Universal Fuel Technologies (Unifuel) has successfully completed a five-month pilot project. The initiative showcased the effectiveness of the company’s Flexiforming technology, demonstrating its ability to produce SAF chemically similar to conventional jet fuel from a variety of renewable feedstocks. The project was carried out at RPD Technologies’ facilities in Crosby, Texas, from August to December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, indicating that the technology is ready for scaling. The project specifically focused on converting methanol and ethanol into SAF, as well as ethanol mixed with paraffinic renewable naphtha produced through Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) into SAF. The SAF samples produced by Unifuel’s Flexiforming technology have undergone extensive testing and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening, the first step in the SAF certification process.

Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab at Washington State University, emphasized the importance of advancing SAF technologies: “As an industry, we must continue to explore new technologies that enhance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel. The ability to produce aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single platform not only streamlines SAF production but also lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible to producers and airlines.”

The pilot resulted in two distinct types of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential component for blending paraffinic SAF with fossil kerosene, and a fully synthetic, 100% drop-in SAF with the necessary aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International. This aromatic component, derived from HEFA and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) naphtha, can be combined with the primary paraffinic SAF stream, creating an opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units. This simplifies logistics, reduces costs, and aids in broader industry adoption.

Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies, highlighted the broader implications of the pilot: “This project’s impact goes far beyond technical validation. A key advantage of Flexiforming is that it enables SAF to be fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM certification is achieved. Because of its aromatic properties, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT processes and sold directly to airlines, without the need for additional blending. As the aviation sector faces growing pressure to reduce its environmental footprint and manage costs, innovations like Flexiforming could play a crucial role in scaling up SAF production to meet demand.”

Flexiforming offers flexibility in SAF production, with the pilot validating several production routes, including ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ). The technology’s lower energy and hydrogen requirements mean that Unifuel estimates Flexiforming costs to be about half of current ETJ processes. Additionally, it enables renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch processes into high-value aromatic SAF, which can be blended into fully synthetic, drop-in-ready jet fuel.

Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor at the Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab, noted, “The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise for full certification as aviation turbine fuel.”

After more than a decade of research and testing, Unifuel is now preparing samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the pilot project for submission to ASTM for certification. This process is critical for verifying the fuel’s safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its suitability for commercial aviation.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SAF-8.png,N,,2025-03-26 04:56:16.913363

It is planning to launch a flight-test programme using the open-fan design on an A380 test article before decade’s end.","Airbus is teasing technologies that could enable its next-generation single-aisle jet, including innovative engine and wing designs aimed at boosting efficiency.

The Toulouse-based airframer provided an update during the 2025 Airbus Summit on a new narrowbody product that it envisions delivering sometime in the second half of the 2030s.

Airbus has previously stated that it would launch such a programme before the end of this decade.

But it did not get specific on when it plans to finalise the design of its next-generation narrowbody. Airbus is seemingly in no rush to market as Boeing attempts to gain momentum with its 737 Max programme – allowing more time for engine and wing concepts to mature.

Reuters reports that Airbus chief Guillaume Faury said during the event that its next narrowbody platform would be “evolutionary rather than revolutionary”, with renderings suggesting the aircraft could take a familiar-looking form.

Boeing is still attempting to achieve Federal Aviation Administration certification of the Max 7 and Max 10 – the smallest and largest variants of the Max family, respectively.

Already badly delayed, those programmes are being further hindered by issues related to the stall management yaw damper system on both the Max 7 and Max 10.

Airbus, meanwhile, started delivering its long-range variant of the A321neo to airline customers in October.

”We have the most advanced aircraft portfolio in the market and the A321XLR is at the very forefront of today’s single-aisle aircraft technology,” says Bruno Fichefeux, Airbus’ head of future programmes.

”Now we are taking the best of what we’ve done and preparing another jump to make our single-aisle aircraft even better and pioneer the future of flight, when the time is right.”

Airbus has also experienced recent setbacks on the innovation front. Last month, it pushed back the service-entry target for a hydrogen-powered aircraft developed under its ZEROe project by up to 10 years.

With its next narrowbody jet, Airbus is targeting a 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with A320neo-family aircraft.

Airbus is exploring various airframe configurations, including “long foldable wings allowing for significant aerodynamic gains”, a concept it is studying through its Wing of Tomorrow technology research programme.

Such a design would provide the aircraft ”a longer wingspan in flight, increasing lift and reducing drag, while still making it compatible with airport gates,” Airbus says.

”Imagine a new Airbus single-aisle aircraft with wings designed with advanced aerodynamics and biomimicry in mind to generate significantly more lift, reducing fuel consumption and increasing efficiency.”

It is also seeking to gain ground on engine efficiency, pointing to ”disruptive open-fan designs”, such as CFM International’s advanced open fan concept RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines).

”An open-fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades that generate thrust are larger and not contained by a nacelle, the cowling that contains the fan in current-generation engines,” Airbus says. ”This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.”

Airbus is partnering with CFM on the RISE open-fan engine demonstrator, which could reduce aircraft emissions by 20% compared with today’s most efficient single-aisle jets. It is planning to launch a flight-test programme using the open-fan design on an A380 test article before decade’s end.

The company is also exploring hybrid technology that could supplement burning conventional or sustainable aviation fuel with batteries or fuel cells. Such an approach could potentially reduce carbon emissions by up to 5%, Airbus says, by ”using otherwise wasted energy to power non-propulsive functions”.

”These batteries could be used to power the aircraft while taxiing on the ground, as well as during flight for onboard functions like the air conditioning system or lighting,” it says.",https://d3lcr32v2pp4l1.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/8/7/9/108879_airbusnextgensingleaisle_62003.jpg,N,,2025-03-26 02:56:36.060749

The tourism industry contributes nearly 8% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions according to Sustainable Travel International, with aviation alone accounting for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, as noted by the World Economic Forum.

With summer around the corner, March is an ideal time to start planning a vacation. According to McKinsey, demand for leisure travel is increasing as their research indicated that the leisure industry was expected to make a full recovery at the end of 2024, following its 75% decline in value during the 2020 pandemic. This upward trend makes early booking crucial for securing better prices and availability while ensuring more sustainable choices. A 2024 Vacasa report found that booking summer trips by early April secures the best deals, as search volume rises soon after. With March nearly over, there's still time to plan strategically. This article will show you how to reduce your environmental footprint while enhancing your travel experience.

1. Choose Low-Carbon Vacation Transportation

Air travel remains one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions. According to the International Air Transport Association, sustainable aviation fuel could reduce aviation emissions by up to 80%, yet the December 2024 IATA report indicated that it currently accounts for less than 0.3% of global jet fuel production. As a result, even if you want to fly using SAF, it would be limited, so to offset your impact, consider the following where possible:

Choose non-stop flights whenever possible, as they consume less fuel and produce fewer emissions than connecting flights. This is because the most fuel-intensive phases of a flight are takeoff and landing. When planning a sustainable trip, prioritize flights with fewer connections to reduce your carbon footprint.

Where feasible, consider rail travel which is significantly more greenhouse gas efficient than road transport and aviation. According to the European Environment Agency, rail travel emits just 35g of CO₂ per kilometer, compared to 246g per kilometer for a domestic flight and 154g per kilometer for a short-haul flight, as reported by Our World in Data.

2. Stay in an Eco-Certified Vacation Hotel

Just like your home, hotels and vacation rentals generate emissions from energy use, with heating, air conditioning, water heating, and electricity consumption being major contributors. Larger resorts and hotels typically have higher emissions due to their extensive amenities, whereas smaller lodgings, such as homestays and guesthouses, tend to have a lower environmental impact. By conducting energy audits, these accommodations can assess their energy demand and implement efficiency measures, leading to both environmental and financial benefits. Accommodation accounts for nearly 2-5% of global CO2 emitted by the tourism sector according to UN Tourism. Here’s how you can select sustainable accommodations or be sustainable if the accommodation is not:

Look for certifications like LEED, EarthCheck, or Green Key, which ensure sustainability standards.

Choose accommodations that use renewable energy, waste reduction programs, and water conservation initiatives.

Opt for locally owned eco-lodges and resorts instead of large international chains that contribute to over-tourism.

Choose temperature settings that are comfortable and avoid over cooling and overheating the rooms.

Turn off heaters, or air conditioners when not in the rooms.

3. Eat Sustainably on Vacation

Food accounts for a significant portion of a vacation’s carbon footprint. A 2024 United Nations Climate Change article estimates that food waste accounts for nearly 8-10% of global emissions and costs UDS 1 trillion annually. Here is how you can eat sustainably while on vacation.

Support farm-to-table restaurants that source local, organic ingredients.

Choose plant-based meals where possible, as they tend to have a lower carbon footprint than meat-based dishes.

Reduce waste by ordering only what you can eat, especially when staying in all inclusive resorts.

4. Engage in Responsible Vacation Activities

Mass tourism often damages local ecosystems and cultures. Over tourism happens when a destination receives more visitors than it can handle sustainably, resulting in issues like overcrowding, environmental harm, infrastructure strain, and a lower quality of life for locals. Essentially, it is what happens when a place becomes a victim of its own popularity. Here are tips to engage in responsible vacation activities:

Choose ethical wildlife experiences (e.g., sanctuaries over zoos or animal rides).

Support local businesses and vetted local tour guides to boost the tourism industry’s contribution to local economies.

Avoid activities that contribute to over-tourism in fragile ecosystems like coral reefs.

5. Pack and Travel Responsibly for Your Vacation

Sustainable packing and mindful habits during vacations play a crucial role in reducing environmental impact. According to the EPA, plastic pollution accounts for 60-80% of marine debris, posing a severe threat to marine ecosystems. Making eco-conscious choices helps travelers significantly minimize waste.

To reduce waste while traveling, consider packing reusable essentials. Bring a durable, refillable water bottle and fabric shopping bags to minimize single-use plastics.

Opting for reef-safe sunscreens is another important step. Traditional sunscreens contain chemicals like oxybenzone and octinoxate, which harm coral reefs. Choosing mineral-based sunscreens with non-nano zinc oxide helps protect marine life.

Using solid toiletries can also make a difference. Replacing mini plastic bottles of liquid shampoos, conditioners, and body washes with solid bars reduces plastic waste and makes packing more convenient.

6. Shop Sustainably for Vacation Clothes

Instead of buying new clothes for your vacation, check your closet first to see if you already own suitable outfits. This helps reduce textile waste and overconsumption. If you need new pieces, consider shopping sustainably by thrifting or choosing ethically made clothing. The fashion industry contributes approximately 10% of global carbon emissions, so opting for second-hand or sustainably produced items helps lower your environmental impact.

Sustainable travel revolves around making mindful decisions that lessen your environmental impact while enhancing the travel experience. Opt for eco-friendly transportation, stay in energy-efficient accommodations, choose sustainable dining options, participate in responsible tourism, pack consciously, and shop for clothes and gear sustainably. Every small action adds up as demand for travel rises, helping secure a greener future. Planning ahead and adopting these sustainable habits ensures a fulfilling vacation without compromising the planet’s well-being.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/67e196162c92e2da2afad386/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-03-25 19:56:56.121608

Sustainable aviation fuels represent the most viable near-term pathway for decarbonizing aviation. Produced from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, municipal solid waste, agricultural residues, and algae, they can mitigate up to 80% of carbon dioxide emissions in lifecycle compared to conventional aviation fuels5. Key production technologies include Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids, Fischer-Tropsch, Alcohol-to-Jet, and Power-to-Liquid, which convert diverse feedstocks into energy-dense fuels tailored for aviation.

Sustainable aviation fuels are typically blended with conventional ones (up to 50%), ensuring compatibility with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Advances in feedstock optimization through biotechnology, renewable energy integration in conversion processes, and cost-effective supply chain development are essential to scaling the deployment of sustainable aviation fuels, reducing production costs, and meeting the growing global demand for sustainable aviation solutions.

Develop zero-emission technologies

Achieving zero-emission aviation requires a holistic approach, integrating advancements in propulsion systems, aircraft design, and materials. Hydrogen-powered aircraft, emitting only water vapor, represents a transformative solution for long-term decarbonization, relying on advancements in fuel cell technologies and cryogenic storage systems6. Electric propulsion provides a complementary pathway for short-haul and regional flights, reliant on breakthroughs in battery energy density and power-to-weight ratios.

Hybrid-electric systems represent a critical transitional step as they reduce fuel burn in conventional engines while advancing electric technologies. Moreover, novel aircraft designs, such as blended-wing bodies and laminar flow technologies, improve aerodynamic efficiency. Lightweight materials, such as advanced composites and metallic alloys, enhance the overall performance7.

Improve efficiency of flight operations

The optimization of flight operations, airspace management, and ground activities is a practical pathway for reducing fuel consumption and emissions8. The adoption of continuous descent operations and performance-based navigation can allow smoother and more direct flight paths9. The use of dynamic air traffic flow management can help minimize delays and holding patterns. The reduction of aircraft weight through improved loading practices can also contribute to reducing their environmental footprint.

On the ground, single-engine taxiing, electrification of ground support equipment, and minimization of the use of auxiliary power units further enhance fuel efficiency. Additionally, the use of real-time data analytics for predictive maintenance and fuel optimization can significantly contribute to sustainable operations.

Implement policies that incentivize sustainable practices to achieve net zero emissions

Driving aviation sustainability requires a robust policy framework based on carbon pricing and stringent criteria10. The International Civil Aviation Organization targets net-zero emissions for global aviation by 2050, supported by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation.

The European Union aims for a 55% reduction in aviation emissions by 2030 and net-zero by 2050, leveraging sustainable aviation fuels and emission trading systems. The United States similarly targets net-zero by 2050 through initiatives like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge. China plans to peak aviation emissions before achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, focusing on green airports and sustainable aviation fuels. Japan and the United Kingdom also target net-zero by 2050, with strategies emphasizing sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-powered aircraft, and optimized air traffic management. These efforts highlight global actions for promoting sustainable aviation.

Promote alternative transports

Leisure and social air travel are the largest and fastest-growing contributors to long-distance emissions11. In particular, private aviation is increasingly contributing to climate change, with direct emissions reaching at least 15.6 megatons of carbon dioxide in 202312. Airport operations electrification, renewable energy investment for ground services, and urban air mobility integration—for example, electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles—are emerging areas that complement broader aviation sustainability goals.

Integrate digital technologies

The integration of digital technologies, particularly artificial intelligence and digital twins, offers an opportunity to optimize operational processes across aviation systems, from aircraft operations to air traffic management. These technologies can improve fuel consumption efficiency and reduce emissions through enhanced predictive analytics and real-time operational decision-making. Furthermore, the incorporation of renewable energy sources and the principles of circular economy in airport infrastructure design and operations can play a pivotal role in reducing aviation’s broader environmental footprint.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43247-025-02222-3/MediaObjects/43247_2025_2222_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-03-25 19:57:00.761742

The economic impact of the biobased material and polymers sector could reach as high as $38 billion by 2030, according to the report.","The Biotechnology Innovation Organization, in partnership with Kearney, a global management consulting firm, on March 24 released a report showing the U.S. bioeconomy currently contributes $210 billion in direct economic impact to the U.S. economy, excluding healthcare. Indirect benefits push the total impact beyond $830 billion.

The sector currently supports 430,000 jobs across various industries, including biobased materials and polymers, biobased industrial chemicals, biofuels, and biobased food ingredients and additives.

By 2030, the report predicts the full economic potential of the bioeconomy could reach $400 billion, nearly doubling its current impact. According to BIO, the report’s findings reinforce the bioeconomy’s status as an essential economic driver.

""The power of biotechnology in food, agriculture, and manufacturing plays a pivotal role in fostering long-term economic growth and enhancing our national security,"" said John Crowley, president and CEO of BIO. ""The U.S. must now take a series of bold measures to modernize the regulatory frameworks that govern the review and approval process of new biotechnologies to ensure that our nation continues to lead the world in agricultural innovation.”

“For the first time, we have a comprehensive, data-driven analysis that quantifies the economic impact of this critical segment of the bioeconomy,” said Sylvia Wulf, interim head of BIO’s Agriculture and Environment Center of Excellence. “This report highlights the immense economic contributions of plant, animal, and biobased product innovations. These insights underline the urgency of public policies and investments that will unlock the bioeconomy’s full potential.”

The U.S. industrial biobased products industry had an estimated economic impact of $172 billion in 2023. The report predicts the economic impact of the industry could expand to $247 billion to $345 billion by 2030, depending on the impact of key market drivers and barrier to growth. The industry is defined to include biofuels, industrial chemicals, biotech-based materials and polymers, and biotech-based food ingredients and additives.

According to the report, the economic impact of the U.S. biofuels sector could grow to as high as $123 billion by 2030, up from approximately $55 billion in 2024. Factors driving expected growth in biofuels include higher mandates around the world, strong ethanol exports, a potential move to E15, increasing focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, and Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

The biofuels sector, however, is also experiencing uncertainty around government mandates and policies, including IRA tax credits. The report notes that developers and investors are concerned about potential modification to tax credit policies, which could significantly impact project financing and market stability.

The economic impact of the biobased material and polymers sector could reach as high as $38 billion by 2030, according to the report. The economic impact of the sector was less than $25 billion in 2024. According to the report, government policy and consumer awareness, emerging bioidentical polymers, and emerging technologies are driving growth in the sector. Price competitiveness, the lack of a universal carbon tax credit and a lack of logistical advantage in the U.S. are some factors that could limit growth in the sector.

The report also indicates that the biobased industrial chemicals sector could create an economic impact of up to $50 billion in 2030, up from approximately $22 billion in 2023, driven by environmental factors. The lack of a carbon tax, however, could impede potential growth in the sector.

Airbus highlighted its cutting-edge technologies, innovative design and novel engineering capabilities during the third edition of its Airbus Summit in Toulouse on 24 and 25 March, 2025.

Airbus’ Head of Future Programmes Bruno Fichefeux said that: “Every second, an Airbus aircraft takes off – connecting people, cargo and business around the world. We have the most advanced aircraft portfolio in the market and the A321XLR is at the very forefront of today’s single-aisle aircraft technology. Now we are taking the best of what we’ve done and preparing another jump to make our single-aisle aircraft even better and pioneer the future of flight, when the time is right.”

The company provided a glimpse at the roadmap it has drawn up to pioneer the future of commercial aviation, and unveiled a number of new next-generation single-aisle aircraft design concepts. These showcase some of the different configurations being studied, highlighting potential solutions that are being explored in order to achieve a major leap forward in aircraft efficiency. Airbus hopes that these will bring a real contribution to the decarbonisation of air travel in the decades to come, underpinning the future of sustainable aerospace.

Technologies for this future single-aisle aircraft aircraft could include more efficient engines, including disruptive open fan designs; long foldable wings allowing for significant aerodynamic gains; next-generation batteries to enable hybrid architectures where electricity is increasingly used to support propulsive and non-propulsive functions aboard the aircraft and lightweight materials and integrated systems for a connected aircraft.

Airbus says that it is “investigating the potential of a few promising engines technologies,” and that “one primary contender is the open fan.” An open or unducted fan engine looks quite different from a modern turbofan, as the fan blades are larger and not contained within the nacelle. This allows air to move efficiently through the engine, reducing fuel consumption.

Airbus is working with engine-maker CFM on the Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) open fan engine demonstrator, and plans to flight test RISE on its A380 flight test aircraft by the end of the decade. The demonstrator is planned to demonstrate a reduction in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 20% compared to today’s most efficient equivalent engines.

Unducted fan (UDF) engines were previously explored in the early 1980s by General Electric (the GE36, tested on a Boeing 727), Pratt and Whitney (the Model 578-DX tested on a Gulfstream II) and International Aero Engines (the IAE V2500SF). McDonnell Douglas began developing propfan variants of its MD-80, the MD-91X, and the MD-92X, and flew a UDF prototype (N980DC, also known as the UHB (Ultra High Bypass) Demo testbed) with a GE-36 engine to port. This aircraft made 93 flights totalling 165 hours of testing and was even displayed at the Farnborough Air Show in September 1988. Falling oil prices and technical issues led to the abandonment of the various unducted fan projects.

Airbus hopes that the time has come for the open fan engine, marking the next step after the piston, turbojet and turbofan. These engines will consume 20% less fuel than current powerplants, making air travel more decarbonised and cost-effective.

A video shown at the Airbus Summit showed two main open fan powered variations of a notional next-generation single-aisle airliner, one with underwing engines and a conventional empennage, the other with a stretched forward fuselage and a T-tail, and two rear-mounted engines.

Airbus Head of R&T Karim Mokaddem said: “Airbus teams are working relentlessly towards the key decisions that will ultimately finalise the choices of the aircraft’s engine type, wing design and additional innovations once their maturity is demonstrated.”

The end result will be an anticipated 20-30% increase in fuel efficiency compared with the current generation of airliners, as well as the ability to fly with up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). This will, it is hoped, support the aviation sector’s roadmap towards achieving net-zero emissions in 2050.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-25-at-18.45.13.png,N,,2025-03-25 18:56:34.583603

The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

Creating a sustainable future through clean fuels The shift towards clean fuels has the potential to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits.","The world is undergoing a major shift towards cleaner, more sustainable energy sources. In addition to expanding renewable energy, the fuel landscape must transform to lower emissions in sectors that are difficult to electrify directly, such as aviation and shipping. These fuels—including low-carbon fuels, e-fuels, and renewable fuels—are vital to meeting global climate targets.

Production, however, is currently far from the levels needed to realize a pathway to net zero in 2050. By 2030, 0.8 billion gallons are needed to meet the EU’s mandates for SAF and e-SAF. In 2024, only 0.3 billion gallons of SAF was produced, according to the International Air Transport Association.

The role of industrial policy in the fuel transition

Supportive policies are crucial to speed up the adoption of clean fuels. The industry for clean fuels is being built on an accelerated timeline in a short amount of time, relying initially on rudimentary supply chains with relatively high costs due to the small scale. This makes it difficult for new technologies and pathways to compete with an efficient industrial system that has been optimized for over 150 years.

Conventional fuels have a daily volume of over 3 billion gallons, are supported by mature value chains and established industry standards, and have been able to optimize efficiencies and economies of scale over many decades. In addition, market prices fail to account for the climate impact of fossil fuels.

This creates a price gap, where clean fuels are, on average, three to five times more expensive than conventional fuels. Consequently, consumers are often reluctant to commit to using clean fuels due to increased costs and fear of losing competitiveness in their downstream markets. Many clean fuel plants are first-of-a-kind industrial projects, and without committed off-take, they are not considered bankable and, therefore, fail to move to final investment decisions.

Robust industrial policies are needed to drive down costs for new technologies and pathways in order to level the playing field and drive the fuel transition.

Building a strong policy framework

In recent years, several governments have taken the lead in establishing supportive industrial policies driven by climate considerations and the desire to strengthen energy security, enhance resilience and foster sustainable economic growth and job creation.

A crucial component of industrial policy is setting 'demand-pull mechanisms,' such as mandates and regulations. For example, the EU's Renewable Energy Directive(RED II and III) requires that a specific percentage of fuels used in industry and the transport sector come from renewable sources, encouraging investment in cleaner alternatives. Similarly, the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandate requires fuel suppliers to supply SAF at airports, ensuring a market for these fuels.

The use of market-based measures that allow the trading of emissions certificates, such as the European Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), can be another powerful driver for the fuel transition. Following the 'polluter pays principle,' efficient carbon pricing mechanisms are essential to create a level playing field between conventional fuels and cleaner alternatives, encouraging consumers to reconsider their fuel choice.

In the absence of a global carbon market, regional or sectorial approaches offer tangible solutions to move forward. The International Maritime Organization, for instance, is considering introducing a global greenhouse gas levy. If adopted, this measure could generate billions in revenues that could be re-invested to finance a just and equitable transition and the development of sustainable marine fuels. The European Hydrogen Bank is already demonstrating how ETS money can be used to produce renewable hydrogen.

Beyond mandates and carbon pricing, governments are also using financial incentives to help fuel producers. The Clean Hydrogen Energy Standard, for example, is a support programme for hydrogen-generated electricity in South Korea. It includes a series of auctions for clean ammonia to be used in co-firing plants, allowing project developers to receive a fixed or indexed price over a 15-year period. Providing clean fuel projects with long-term revenue certainty is critical to unlocking initial investments.

Another example is the UK, where the government has announced a revenue certainty scheme for SAF production, providing much-needed support to the industry. This approach, which combines demand-driving policies with financial incentives, helps ensure that the supply of clean fuels will grow at the same pace as demand.

Fostering innovation and resilient SAF supply chains

Industrial policies focus on productivity growth and innovation. The EU and UK SAF mandates, for instance, encourage the innovation of advanced fuels, particularly with the introduction of a synthetic jet fuel mandate (e-SAF) from 2030 onwards. Fostering technological advancement can help build future industrial leadership and competitiveness.

Both the United States and the EU have adopted measures to support clean energy value chains in their industrial policies, allowing for faster deployment of innovative technologies. The Net-Zero Industry Act, the Critical Raw Materials Acts, and the Inflation Reduction Act are examples of these measures. They aim to support the scaling of critical clean technologies by aligning industrial and energy policies and providing long-term viability to attract investments.

Local content requirements can further ensure that the ramp-up of domestic clean fuel production capacities and cleantech manufacturing benefits the local economy and helps mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities, especially in the context of increasing geopolitical tensions. This is particularly relevant to strengthening energy security and reducing and preventing reliance on imports for critical components, such as electrolyzers used in hydrogen production.

At the same time, industrial policies must balance these goals with the need for global cooperation. The transition to clean fuels is a global challenge that requires international collaboration. While regional policies are essential, they must be carefully designed to avoid isolating markets and ensure that global trade continues to flow, fostering innovation worldwide and facilitating economies of scale.

Creating a sustainable future through clean fuels

The shift towards clean fuels has the potential to deliver significant economic and environmental benefits. It can drive economic growth by supporting new industries and creating jobs. It can also boost energy security. By developing domestic production capacities for fuels like green or low-carbon hydrogen and SAF, regions like Europe can reduce their dependence on foreign energy sources, creating more resilient economies.

Governments must act decisively to ensure the transition is fast and sustainable. By fostering partnerships between public and private sectors, aligning policies across borders and incentivizing local production, industrial policy can accelerate and unlock the full potential of clean fuels.

The time to act is now — and industrial policy will be the catalyst for the transformation that is urgently needed to achieve a sustainable, low-carbon future.

MUMBAI: The International Air Transport Association (IATA) recently announced that it has enhanced its IATA CO2 Connect emissions calculator to account for carbon emissions reductions related to the usage of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

Initially, CO2 Connect will apply equal per-passenger emission reductions across an airline’s network, meaning that all flights will benefit from an equal (percentage) reduction based on total SAF purchases. In future enhancements, the ability to allocate per-passenger SAF emission reductions to specific routes will be added, said IATA.

“Corporations and individual travellers want to clearly understand how sustainable their flying is. And, particularly if they invested in SAF, they want to know what impact it is having. By enhancing CO2 Connect with the IATA SAF Accounting and Reporting Methodology, we are providing the transparency and accuracy that individuals and corporates demand,” said Frederic Leger, IATA’s Senior Vice President Commercial Products and Services.

IATA CO2 Connect uses real operational data, such as aircraft type-specific fuel consumption, directly contributed by airlines. This approach contrasts with other calculators that primarily rely on modelled averages. With the recent inclusion of Air India, Air Astana, Air Europa, Amelia, Clic Air, Corsair, Hi Fly, Oman Air, Plus Ultra Líneas Aéreas, and Royal Air Maroc, some 60 airlines are now contributing data to CO2 Connect. With each new airline participant, the accuracy and transparency of IATA CO2 Connect’s calculations improve—for individual travellers and corporates.

“With the strong support of all our participating airlines and the new ability to accurately account for SAF in the calculation, IATA CO2 Connect is going from strength to strength. It is a powerful tool to support aviation’s decarbonisation powered by global standard methodologies and high-quality data,” said Leger.

The development follows the recent publication of the IATA SAF Accounting & Reporting Methodology, which helps airlines and industry stakeholders accurately report SAF-related emissions reductions and sets the accounting foundation baseline in the upcoming IATA SAF registry. It also provides guidance to reflect SAF emissions reduction in per-passenger and per-shipment emissions calculations.

Developed in collaboration with more than 40 airline experts worldwide, the methodology is designed to complement existing international frameworks and to reinforce consistency without duplicating efforts, according to IATA. The IATA methodology fully intends to serve as a reference for both regulatory and voluntary environmental initiatives, it said.

SAF has been identified as the biggest lever in decarbonizing aviation. As airlines scale up SAF, the need for the aviation industry to demonstrate clearly and transparently the emissions reduction from SAF use becomes more eminent, said IATA. ""Clarity in a global and robust SAF accounting framework is essential for SAF deployment and its commercial viability. A robust, feedstock-agnostic, and technology-neutral methodology, irrespective of chain-of-custody used, is critical to avoid double-counting and uphold environmental claims’ integrity,"" it added. A robust and global SAF accounting framework can also help to deploy SAF most efficiently while widening market access of SAF irrespective of its uplift locations, said IATA.

Aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean faces challenges that require a coordinated and efficient approach. Dialogue among all stakeholders is essential, which is why the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA) is holding its 3rd ALTA Fuel & Sustainability Conference this week in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. This event brings together industry experts to discuss strategies for a more sustainable and economically viable future.

Jet fuel accounts for approximately 35% of airline operating costs in the region. It is the largest expense in the cost structure and is considerably more expensive than in other parts of the world. This is a critical challenge that requires urgent attention, as it directly impacts airfares and, consequently, the ability of more people to access this essential service.

Experts will also discuss key strategies for decarbonizing the sector. While airlines have made significant progress through fleet modernization and operational improvements, decarbonization requires a broader range of measures: large-scale adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF)—which still faces barriers such as high costs and limited availability—emission offset strategies, and other initiatives.

Peter Cerdá, ALTA’s CEO, highlights that “aviation is an essential sector for the prosperity of Latin America and the Caribbean. We connect communities, drive tourism, commerce, and job creation. Although we account for approximately 2% of global emissions, we are strongly committed to making air transport more sustainable. However, there is no sustainable future without economic and operational feasibility. Decarbonization strategies must be viable for our region.”

Cerdá stresses that “if the measures we adopt to reduce emissions increase air transport costs and limit access to aviation, they will simply not be sustainable over time. We need solutions that are efficient, realistic, and tailored to our region—this means promoting the development of sustainable fuels with effective regulations, improving infrastructure, and optimizing operations with a focus on competitiveness.”

In addition to SAF, the conference will examine the evolution of traditional fuels like Jet A-1 and Jet A, the need to optimize their supply chains, the impact of climate change on aviation, circular economy initiatives, and the role of regulation in fostering a more sustainable industry.

A key highlight will be the discussion of a regional sustainability roadmap being developed by ALTA and ICF, with active participation from governments.

With the support of the Dominican Institute of Civil Aviation (IDAC) and the Superior Academy of Aeronautical Sciences (ASCA), ALTA reaffirms its commitment to a more efficient and sustainable aviation sector. This conference marks a milestone in the pursuit of innovative solutions that will enable aviation in Latin America and the Caribbean to move toward a future where sustainability and competitiveness go hand in hand.",https://ala.aero/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/alta-logo-color-transparent.png,N,,2025-03-25 17:56:45.255318

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) seems to have been more easily available in the US on the West Coast. Is that still the case?

Since SAF was introduced to business and general aviation operations in 2019, its availability has been heavily concentrated in the West, largely due to California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard and the state’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions.

However, in 2025 we’re seeing a shift as supply infrastructure on the East Coast strengthens. At Avfuel, we’re actively working to close the gap through strategic collaborations, including a new supply relationship with Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and an expanded agreement with Neste.

Through our agreement with Valero, we now have SAF supply sources in Port Everglades, Florida, Linden, New Jersey, and Pasadena, Texas. These locations are instrumental in broadening our reach and ensuring SAF is available at key hubs across the eastern US.

This is supplemented by a proprietary book-and-claim registry that allows Avfuel to effectively sell SAF attributes no matter where an operator flies. With multiple purchasing options, new supply locations coming online and our investment in multimodal delivery methods – including truck and pipeline solutions – we’re ensuring greater nationwide availability of SAF for our customers.

Avfuel sells fuel globally. How are your sustainability efforts looking in overseas markets?

Avfuel operates with a global mindset. Sustainability is a universal challenge, making the demand for SAF grow internationally. In Europe and the UK, regulatory momentum – including ReFuelEU and various SAF mandates – is pushing SAF adoption forward.

We not only continue to monitor those developments, but also directly support them. Along with 24 SAF locations in the US, Avfuel’s customers can purchase physical SAF molecules at 26 locations across the EU and into the UK.

With our focus on supply agreements and the future of fuel, Avfuel is positioned to significantly expand its SAF footprint and help advance global SAF adoption.

Avfuel supplies the full spectrum of aviation segments along with business aviation. Does SAF translate across other segments?

As a drop-in replacement for jet fuel, SAF is a viable solution across all aviation segments. Business aviation operations have been early adopters, driven by the industry’s ability to move quickly on ESG [environmental, social, governance] commitments. However, we’re also working with airline and cargo companies who are increasingly interested in supporting the SAF initiative.

As commitments from these segments grow, the next challenge will be scaling production to keep pace. Scalability will be crucial in ensuring all segments can access SAF at the volumes they require; it will also likely contribute to the price gap between SAF and jet fuel narrowing, which can only further encourage adoption.

Avfuel was among the first companies to offer SAF. How has it differentiated itself from other companies who have since entered the space?

Avfuel has been a leader in SAF’s adoption and supply from the beginning, and remains a definitive leader in supplying SAF to business aviation operations.

Several companies offer sustainability programmes, audits or book-and-claim, but don’t have direct access to physical SAF molecules – they have to source these molecules from other suppliers in order to meet the needs of their end customers. At Avfuel, we provide a full, end-to-end sustainability programme – AvfuelZero – that not only helps customers pinpoint their emissions, set goals and report on their progress, but also effectively reduce emissions with in-house products. These products include physical SAF molecules, carbon credits and a robust book-and-claim system with the highest regard for accuracy, ensuring each environmental attribute is only counted once.

AvfuelZero is a complete, closed system that simplifies what has historically been a complex process. Our aim is to make it easy for operators to adopt sustainable practices by supporting them from end to end, or anywhere in between, with the assistance of ESG experts and the products that make the biggest difference within any budget.

Along with supplying SAF, Avfuel has become an expert industry resource on the matter. Where do you see the SAF market going?

The SAF market is at a critical juncture. With production capabilities expanding, supply chains maturing and increasing adoption rates, 2025 and beyond hold significant potential for SAF to become a mainstream fuel solution. Industry analysts predict continued exponential growth, with Avfuel expecting to once again increase its supply capabilities in 2025 and beyond, particularly with extended supply reach geographically. This is fuelled by strategic agreements with producers including Neste, Valero Marketing & Supply Company, and Gevo, whose new production facility will contribute to a more robust supply chain.

One of the key drivers of market growth will be the advancement of next-generation fuel technologies, which will diversify SAF feedstocks. To this end, Avfuel has made significant investments in technology-driven fuel solutions coming from organisations like AIR Company, Alder Renewables and VerdeGo Aero.

For instance, AIR Company’s carbon conversion technology represents a major step forward in producing SAF from CO2. Similarly, Alder Renewables is advancing woody biomass-based SAF production, while VerdeGo Aero is working on hybrid-electric power solutions to complement sustainable fuel strategies. These collaborations allow Avfuel to remain at the cutting edge of the industry and ensure our customers have early access to next-generation solutions.

As the US changes presidential administrations, what is the state of sustainability initiatives?

No doubt policy will also play a pivotal role in determining the pace of SAF’s market expansion. With the US presidential administration changing, there’s been a bit of uncertainty regarding the future of sustainability initiatives. Federal incentives like the Producers Tax Credit and other state credits have historically supported SAF affordability and production expansion. If these incentives are renewed or expanded, the market could see unprecedented acceleration.

Should federal incentives not be renewed, we still expect state-level initiatives to come into play in the coming years, much like we’ve seen in California with low-carbon fuel standard credits and its new emissions reporting legislation. Support from the states will certainly help maintain progress in sustainability initiatives.

Furthermore, public and private corporations alike have made ESG commitments; we expect those initiatives to remain in place, helping to maintain and grow SAF commitments from business aviation operations.

Avfuel remains committed to leading the industry forward in all aspects of sustainability. Our efforts in securing new supply agreements, investing in future-ready fuel technologies, and working alongside regulatory bodies position us to help customers transition toward a more sustainable future. The SAF market is evolving rapidly, and Avfuel is leading the charge to ensure its success.

Avfuel is also taking a leading stance on removing lead from avgas. Can you provide an update on that initiative?

Beyond SAF, Avfuel has heavily invested numerous resources toward the unleaded avgas initiative. We understand the importance of providing a viable, safe alternative to 100LL, and we’re actively engaged with industry partners to progress this initiative. While there’s still work to be done in terms of approvals and infrastructure, we’re making meaningful progress. Our goal is to ensure orderly, safe and widespread adoption of unleaded avgas while maintaining the reliability and performance that general aviation operators depend on.

Transitioning away from leaded avgas is a complex process, but with industry collaboration and continued investment, we are optimistic about a future where general aviation supports a cleaner world.",https://evaint.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/25/2025/03/09-Av-Fuel-2-10-25-Florida-596-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 16:56:34.512650

SINES, Portugal (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia's gasoline exports to the United States could be curtailed if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes tariffs on European goods, but the company is confident it can find alternative destinations.

Executive Board member Ronald Doesburg, who is in charge of industrial assets, told Reuters on Tuesday that if U.S. demand for gasoline drops as a result of higher prices stemming from the proposed 25% tariffs, Galp will be able to deal with it.

Galp's only refinery in Sines usually produces about 2 million metric tons of gasoline per year, of which between 1.2 million and 1.5 million tons are exported to the United States. The remainder is taken by the Portuguese market.

Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all European goods, raising the risk of a trade war that could prove damaging for export-oriented European companies.

""The energy market is global, gasoline streams are global, and hence our gasoline production will have sufficient flexibility to find its way to different markets,"" Doesburg said.

Tariffs would have an impact, ""but it's an impact that will be managed ... We will look at our options"", he said, adding that Galp has handled trade-related disruptions in the past and that Sines could be realigned towards different types of products, depending on prices and demand.

SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL

In the meantime, Galp continues its shift towards greener fuels and expects to start producing biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel from waste, such as used cooking oil, by mid-2026 at a unit it is building at its refinery, said Galp's head of hydrogen, Sergio Machado.

The 400 million euro ($432 million) Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) plant, a 75% to 25% joint venture with Japan's Mitsui, will have annual production capacity of 270,000 tons and will be using green hydrogen from a 100 megawatt electrolyser that will cost 250 million euros.

""Our expectation is to have both units in production by mid-2026 and to reach cruising speed shortly thereafter,"" Machado said.

In an online statement, the airport claimed it is already one of the “largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021.”

Through the supply deal with H2R, Farnborough Airport will become the “first and only” airport in the world to offer fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, according to CEO, Simon Geere.

The CEO added, “The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.”

Offtake agreements offer a way to derisk investment in crucial climate tech.

These four examples of best practices can build a winning offtake strategy.

As the world works towards reducing emissions from fossil fuels, it is increasingly important to develop new technologies that can maintain our quality of life without contributing to climate change. Many promising solutions that could enable a circular carbon economy already exist, but not at the necessary scale. These first-of-a-kind (FOAK) projects need to scale up, but that’s easier said than done.

Offtake agreements can boost investments

Scaling up takes financing, which can be difficult to acquire. This is because climate tech projects are inherently risky. New technologies that test well in a lab may not work in the real world. Investors know about these high risks, and don’t want to waste their money. But without investment no new technologies can be developed, preventing new climate tech from coming to market.

Offtake agreements offer a solution to this problem. Under an offtake agreement, a buyer agrees to purchase a certain portion of a seller’s goods once produced, guaranteeing cash flow as soon as the product is ready. This security makes a product seem less risky to investors, significantly increasing funding chances. Plus, offtake agreements demonstrate market interest to stakeholders, boosting a company’s credibility.

The right offtake agreement for each stage: the 'Maslow Pyramid'

Not all offtakes are created equal. Different types of offtake agreements are useful at different stages of a project’s life. Think of this like Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, where the bottom of the pyramid is occupied by basic needs that must be fulfilled in order to build up to greater things.

The “Maslow Pyramid of Offtakes” looks a bit like this (bullet points start from the bottom of the pyramid):

Soft agreements: Non-binding letters of intent (LOIs) and memorandums of understanding (MOUs) are essential at the Prototype stage (TRL 4-5). These build early trust without heavy commitments.

Binding agreements: During the pilot/demo phase (TRL 6-7), binding agreements offer legal certainty for short-term engagements or smaller quantities, often tied to conditional milestones.

Bankable agreements: By the time you reach FOAK and NOAK (Nth of a Kind) (TRL 8-9), bankable agreements provide long-term cash flow certainty, crucial for securing major capital and scaling.

When the right offtake agreement type is used, offtakes help founders secure project financing by de-risking projects for investors. Think of offtakes for climate tech as equivalent to Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for software startups – they're critical indicators of an ability to develop technology the market actually wants and will pay for.

Here are four best practices which can be used to build winning offtake strategies:

1. Don't sell – partner

If you want to succeed in the long run, you have to be strategic from the very beginning. Strategic players repeatedly mention that they aren't interested in signing offtake agreements as customers – they want to be partners for the journey.

Secure key corporate partners who align with your vision at an early stage. This will allow you to collaborate on co-development opportunities, leveraging their expertise and infrastructure to help you refine your product, giving you credibility at an early stage and allowing you to negotiate for favourable terms. Use pilot plants to showcase your technology, allowing partners to test and validate it early.

For example, consider the partnership between Holcim and Sublime Systems, which included both equity investment and offtake agreements, creating a win-win relationship beyond mere customer-supplier dynamics.

2. Diversify offtakers to mitigate risks

Offtakes mitigate risks for investors, but they come with their own risks. Never put all your eggs in one basket. Offtake agreements can fall through, so it’s important to avoid over-reliance on a single customer. Instead, it’s a good idea to engage multiple offtakers across the value chain.

This means you’ll want to move beyond just your own direct offtakers, and start thinking about your offtakers’ offtakers. Having a diverse group of offtakers at different parts of the value chain reduces your vulnerability to market volatility and means that your projects can progress even if one partnership fails.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

3. Design flexible contracts

Uncertainty is a fact of life, so if you want to make investors feel comfortable financing your project, you need to ensure that your offtake contracts are adaptable in the face of those uncertainties. While early-stage agreements are flexible by default, as you move towards more binding agreements you’ll need to balance flexibility and preparedness to get the most out of your offtakes.

Include mechanisms like cost caps, tiered pricing, and competitive bidding to manage risks and align with ever-evolving project realities. Avoid rigid terms that could limit you in the future. Don’t rush into firm commitments, but keep agreements flexible until you’re ready. By staying flexible, you can ensure that both parties can adapt to changes without compromising commitments.

4. Align agreements with offtakers' operational cycles

When making offtake agreements, it helps to remember that your offtakers are running companies of their own, which means they’re also beholden to procurement, R&D, or seasonal cycles. To get the most out of your offtake agreements, integrate them into your offtakers’ normal operational dynamics, ensuring seamless adoption of your product. Tailoring your agreement to their timelines significantly increases the likelihood of success.

Climb the offtake pyramid

Whatever you decide to do, and whoever your offtakers are, offtake agreements are a necessary part of financing your FOAKs. If you play your cards right, you can use your offtake agreements to help you negotiate complexities and balance your scalability needs with customer expectations, manage fluctuating demand and pricing uncertainties, and transition your FOAK projects to scalable, NOAK operations.

Start with low-risk commitments and work your way up to bankable agreements as you deliver on key milestones, and build customer relationships and trust.

The project named Contrail Research Yielding STimulating Advanced RQL Learning (CRYSTAL) includes a ground and flight test campaign at Airbus’ Mirabel site in Canada, the A220 Programme headquarters. The CRYSTAL project aims at measuring emissions on-wing (ground testing) and in-flight emissions and contrails at various altitudes (flight testing) using the A220 flight test aircraft.

Both ground and flight tests will be operating on Jet A-1 and 100 per cent Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to study the effects on emissions and contrail properties, and the associated climate impacts. The data generated will be used by the scientific community to improve contrail models and identify engine technology and fuels that could minimise the climate impact from contrails.

The ground tests are planned to happen as of Q3 2025 and the flight tests in 2027. YMX International Aerocity of Mirabel airport managed by ADM (Aéroports de Montréal) will support this collaboration. The CRYSTAL project will be one of the key projects under Espace Aero – the first official Quebec aerospace innovation zone project this year.

The project includes expertise from Polytechnique Montréal, École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS) and FSM Management Group. Airbus and its partners are in discussion with government programmes including Canada’s Initiative for Sustainable Aviation Technology (INSAT) and Consortium for Research and Innovation in Aerospace in Québec (CRIAQ) to support the project.

Mélanie Lussier, president of Aéro Montréal, said, “Espace Aéro is proud to see a major project take shape with CRYSTAL, driven by Airbus’ leadership and its partners. This collaborative initiative, led by CRIAQ and INSAT, perfectly reflects our innovation zone’s commitment to decarbonization and showcases how Quebec’s ingenuity and innovation are helping to shape the sustainable aviation of tomorrow. By bringing together industrial and academic players around concrete solutions, we are strengthening Quebec’s position as a leader in aerospace environmental performance.”

Martin Massé, VP, Public Affairs, Communication and Sustainability, ADM, said, “ADM Aéroports de Montréal is proud to be involved in this visionary research project. For many years now, our organization has prided itself on making its facilities available to support partners in the aviation ecosystem on their journey towards net zero emissions. As a world-class aeronautical hub and innovation zone, the YMX site was the perfect place to be at the forefront of this initiative, which will ultimately enable our industry to take the next step towards decarbonizing its activities.”

Catherine Guillemart, head of Public Affairs and Sustainability, Canada, Airbus said, “We are delighted to collaborate with world-class partners in Canada, as we are committed to supporting the aviation industry’s efforts to research on non-CO2 emissions. Increasing the scientific data to further understand the formation of non CO2-emissions remains key for the industry to understand their effects.”",https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airbus_Airbus_launches_study_on_non_CO2-aircraft_emissions_with.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 11:56:17.177171

Airbus Head of Future Programs Bruno Fichefeux said, “Hydrogen is at the heart of our commitment to decarbonize aviation. While we've adjusted our roadmap, our dedication to hydrogen-powered flight is unwavering. Just as we saw in the automotive sector, fully electric aircraft powered by hydrogen fuel cells have the potential in the longer term to revolutionize air transport for the better, complementing the sustainable aviation fuel pathway.”

These technologies were showcased as part of a new concept of a hydrogen aircraft powered by four 2-megawatt electric propulsion engines, each driven by a fuel cell system that converts hydrogen and oxygen into electrical energy. The four fuel cell systems would be supplied via two liquid hydrogen tanks. This concept will continue to be refined over the coming years as additional tests will help mature the technologies associated with hydrogen storage and distribution, as well as with the propulsion systems.

Airbus Head of the ZEROe Project Glenn Llewellyn added, “Over the last five years, we have explored multiple hydrogen-propulsion concepts, before down-selecting this fully electric concept. We are confident it could provide the necessary power density for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft and could evolve as we mature the technology. In the coming years, we will concentrate on advancing the storage, distribution and propulsion systems, while also advocating for the regulatory framework needed to ensure these aircraft can take flight.”

In 2023, Airbus demonstrated a 1.2MW hydrogen-propulsion system, and in 2024, end-to-end testing of an integrated fuel cell stack, electric motors, gearboxes, inverters and heat exchangers was completed.

In simple terms, the book and claim approach allows a buyer to ""book"" a certain amount of SAF and ""claim"" the corresponding emission reduction, even if the fuel is used elsewhere. Through a pilot programme running throughout 2025, Airbus will leverage this system to improve SAF accessibility for potential customers, particularly those with limited volumes and far from supply points.

As a facilitator, Airbus will purchase SAF certificates and manage the associated sustainability attributes through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognised sustainability certification body. These certificates will then be resold to interested customers, such as aircraft and helicopter operators, thereby stimulating short-term demand for SAF.

The pilot programme is expected to generate key insights into the capacity and robustness of this innovative book and claim mechanism.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which can help reduce carbon emissions, provides an opportunity for India, where sustainability is high on the agenda, Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury has said. One of the world's fastest growing civil aviation markets, Airbus sees ""more and more potential in India"", with one of the senior officials saying the country is nothing but ""growth"" for the company.

Apart from having hundreds of aircraft orders placed by Indian carriers, the plane maker has a joint venture Final Assembly Line (FAL) for C295 aircraft and a FAL for helicopter H125 will be set up this year in India.

Besides, Airbus sources more than 1 billion euros worth of components and services for global exports from the country.

""SAF is an opportunity for India... sustainability is something that is very high on the agenda in India.... India has a bigger share of aviation... of the global aviation. Therefore India has a bigger role and a bigger responsibility to play in the global equation,"" Guillaume Faury told PTI on Monday.

He was speaking to PTI on the sidelines of the Airbus Summit 2025 in Toulouse.

Aviation accounts for around 2-3 per cent of the global carbon emissions and SAF can help in reducing these emissions.

By replacing 10 per cent of global jet fuel consumption with SAF, the aviation industry could reduce the emissions by around 50 million tonnes of carbon emissions per year, as per Airbus.

India has a great potential to become a SAF producer, Head of SAF and CDR Developments Sustainability Organisation at Julien Manhes said.

For SAF production, the country can look at utilising its ethanol supplies and availability of lipids feedstocks like non-edible industrial oils.

Talking about the development of the global aviation sector, Faury said the first revolution was about getting in the air more than a century ago and the second was to have a safe mode of transport.

""The third was making travel affordable for people. Going to sustainability, which is the fourth revolution, we do not want to lose the benefits of what we have achieved so far,"" he emphasised.

Meanwhile, Chief Executive Officer of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Christian Scherer told PTI on Monday that the company is growing its supply chain in India.

""We are increasing our supply, whether it is engineering services where India is really good, it is intellectual supply compared to metallurgical supplies. We are also increasing our metallurgical supplies,"" he said and stressed that ""India is nothing but growth for Airbus"".

Executive Vice President Operations of the commercial aircraft business at Airbus Florent Massou said there are more and more products being made and also sourced from India.

""We see a lot of opportunities... we see more and more potential in India.... many companies are ramping up their capabilities, automotive for instance... we are having a lot of discussions with them and see under which conditions they could join our club of suppliers,"" he said.

Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives.

Stakeholders in the aviation industry must navigate these changes carefully, as the stakes are becoming higher.","The future of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) under United States President Donald Trump in this new year is uncertain. Trump’s administration has promised to significantly scale back federal efforts to mitigate climate change, which could impact the development and use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Production of domestic sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has grown rapidly in recent years, driven in part by Biden administration incentives. But early moves by the Trump administration are fuelling uncertainty about what will come next in the United States and ultimately globally.

SAF is a fuel that can be produced from non-petroleum-based renewable feedstocks, including, but not limited to; the food and yard waste portion of municipal solid waste, woody biomass, fats/greases/oils, and other feedstocks. SAF can be blended at different levels with limits between 10 percent and 50 percent, depending on the feedstock and how the fuel is produced.

The Biden Administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which included a tax credit for SAF production, has been frozen by Trump’s administration. This tax credit was crucial for the development of SAF, as it helped bridge the price gap between SAF and traditional petroleum-based fuel. The Trump administration has also removed some federal web pages related to SAF initiatives, including sites detailing the $244.5 million in grant funding the FAA allocated last year to SAF projects, according to reports.

Also, the Trump administration’s potential increase in tariffs on imported goods from China could affect the availability of non-petroleum feedstocks needed for SAF production.

Despite these challenges, some experts believe that the SAF industry could still thrive under Trump’s administration. For example, Trump’s focus on rural economic priorities could lead to an increase in corn-based ethanol production, which could be used as a feedstock for SAF.

However, the long-term outlook for SAF under Trump’s administration remains uncertain. The industry relies heavily on government incentives and support, which could be reduced or eliminated under Trump’s administration.

IATA estimates that SAF will be responsible for 65 percent of the emissions reductions that will be required for the industry to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, also adopted by the United Nations aviation arm. It seems SAF is entering a turbulent future, with many questions arising from the uncertainty that currently clouds it around achieving net zero.

Less than four years after boldly pledging to reach net zero emissions by 2050, IATA appears to be dropping the target. Willie Walsh, IATA director general, speaking at an industry event in Phoenix, expressed strong doubts airlines could meet their emissions goals in the next 25 years. Facing a diverse audience of financiers, lessors, banks, and industry stakeholders, Walsh acknowledged for the first time that the sector is unlikely to meet its long-standing target. This admission not only marks a turning point for IATA but also calls for deep thinking about the feasibility of the aviation industry’s current sustainability plans.

The benefits of SAF point to how fundamental its production is for achieving net zero. The aviation industry accounts for 2.5 percent of global Co2 emissions, but it has contributed around four percent to global warming to date, say reports. With SAF, however, it has the potential to lower flight emissions by 80 percent, compared to conventional jet fuel. It is also a drop-in fuel, meaning there is no need for modifying aircraft or constructing new fuelling stations. SAF produces fewer harmful pollutants and contains lower levels of sulphur and aromatic components, allowing aircraft engines to burn more cleanly and generate less pollution compared to conventional fuels.

Perhaps there are indications that the ESG landscape is in a state of flux. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley have officially exited the Net Zero Banking Alliance, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing discourse around financial commitments to climate goals. Their departures signal not just a retreat from collective climate pledges but also raise questions about the future of net zero ambitions among U.S. banks.

From high-profile exits of major banks to ambitious corporate sustainability goals, the actions taken now will shape the future of responsible investing and corporate accountability.

Through this model, Airbus aims to overcome existing challenges that limit the adoption of sustainable fuels, especially for smaller operators and those located far from SAF supply points.

The Book and Claim approach allows buyers to “book” a specific amount of SAF and “claim” the related emissions reductions, even if the physical fuel is used elsewhere. This system separates the sustainability benefits from the actual delivery of fuel, creating flexibility and opening the door for wider use of SAF across the aviation sector.

As part of a year-long pilot program running throughout 2025, Airbus will act as a facilitator by purchasing SAF certificates and managing them through the registry of the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB), a recognized certification body. These sustainability attributes will then be resold to interested customers—ranging from aircraft to helicopter operators—helping to create short-term demand for SAF and support long-term growth.

SMBC Aviation Capital was the first company to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to support this program. Other key partners who have since confirmed their interest include AerCap, Comlux, Luxaviation, Novespace, Rive Private Investment, and SAF Aerogroup. Their participation reflects a growing commitment across the aviation industry to scale SAF adoption through innovative and collaborative models.

The pilot is expected to generate valuable insights into the operational capacity and effectiveness of the Book and Claim system. Airbus will use these findings to explore the potential for third-party facilitation of similar SAF solutions and gauge broader market interest.

By enabling companies to financially support SAF production and usage—even when physical access is limited—the Book and Claim method lowers the barrier to entry for operators of all sizes. This is particularly significant for smaller carriers and private aviation firms that often face logistical or economic hurdles in securing SAF for direct use.

Julien Manhes, Head of Sustainable Aviation Fuel and Carbon Dioxide Removals at Airbus, emphasized that this system is designed to simplify and derisk the process. By purchasing certificates upfront and distributing them when needed, Airbus aims to make SAF more viable and attractive for a broader group of stakeholders. Manhes also noted the opportunity to prove that Book and Claim is both reliable and scalable, paving the way for its adoption in both voluntary and regulatory frameworks.

This move by Airbus marks a step forward in the effort to make aviation more environmentally responsible. SAF has long been seen as one of the most promising tools to cut carbon emissions in flight, but limited supply and complex logistics have slowed progress. By decoupling sustainability benefits from fuel logistics, Airbus’s system offers a practical workaround that can help bridge the gap between current demand and future capacity.

While this pilot program is still in its early stages, its success could signal a turning point for green aviation. If the system proves reliable, it could become a cornerstone of sustainable strategies in the sector, especially as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to reduce its climate impact.

For now, the Book and Claim pilot offers a glimpse into a more inclusive and scalable future for sustainable fuel—one where geography and infrastructure no longer stand in the way of meaningful environmental action.

CADO, created by IATA, will manage the new SAF Registry to promote a transparent, global market for sustainable aviation fuel.

The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has launched the Civil Aviation Decarbonisation Organisation (CADO) to manage the IATA-developed Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry. CADO will operate as an independent entity from IATA, with an open and global approach to build trust across all stakeholders. “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President Sustainability and Chief Economist.

“The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor,” added Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

CADO, incorporated as a not-for-profit in Canada with headquarters in Montreal, is open to organisations within the SAF value chain, including governments and interest groups benefiting from SAF in the aviation system. IATA, as the founding member, will provide ongoing technical support.

The SAF Registry will track SAF transactions in a transparent manner, allowing the environmental benefits of SAF to be claimed against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes. It addresses the challenge of limited SAF supply by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers worldwide.

IATA has established the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) to manage its SAF Registry when it is released.

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organisation in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

CADO membership is open to organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry; and related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

IATA said it is developing the soon-to-be-launched SAF Registry as a global system to record SAF transactions in a standardised and transparent way.

The Registry is designed to ensure that the environmental benefits of SAF can be tracked as they move across the SAF value chain and enable the claiming of these against regulatory obligations and voluntary schemes by airlines and corporate customers.

The SAF Registry helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply — which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally — by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location, said IATA.

Additionally, the Registry gives airlines’ corporate customers access to in-sector emissions reductions and utilises firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation, added the trade body.

Participation in the SAF Registry will be free until April 2027, after which it will be operated on a cost-recovery basis.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s senior vice president sustainability and chief economist, said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry.

The campaign demonstrated the effectiveness and viability of the company’s Flexiforming technology in producing SAF that is chemically comparable to conventional jet fuel from various renewable feedstocks. The project was conducted at the facilities of RPD Technologies in Crosby, Texas, from August through December of last year. It produced nearly 100 liters of SAF sample material under stable process conditions, signaling readiness for the technology to scale up. The campaign focused on converting methanol and ethanol to SAF and ethanol with paraffinic renewable naphtha made via Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) to SAF. Samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF have been thoroughly tested and are now being analyzed at Washington State University’s Bioproducts, Sciences, and Engineering Lab for Tier 0 screening—the initial step of the SAF certification process.

“As an industry, it’s crucial that we continue to support and explore new technologies to advance SAF to match the functionality of petroleum-derived jet fuel,” said Joshua Heyne, Director of the Bioproducts, Sciences and Engineering Lab (BSEL) at Washington State University. “The capability to make aromatic molecules and process various feedstocks through a single technology platform not only streamlines SAF production but also significantly lowers production costs, making it more economically viable and accessible for producers and airlines.”

The pilot yielded two distinct forms of SAF: Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), an essential aromatic blend component for maintaining compatibility of paraffinic SAF with the composition of fossil kerosene, and a 100% drop-in, fully synthetic SAF that contains the correct aromatic content for commercial use, pending certification by ASTM International, the leading global technical standards organization. As a result, the aromatic component of SAF produced through Flexiforming, made from HEFA and FT naphtha, can be blended with the primary paraffinic SAF stream from these units. This creates the opportunity to produce drop-in SAF directly at HEFA and FT units, reducing the costs and complexity of the logistics and aiding in industry adoption.

“The impact of this pilot project reaches far beyond technical validation,” said Alexei Beltyukov, CEO of Universal Fuel Technologies. “A considerable value of Flexiforming is that it contributes to making SAF fully interchangeable with fossil jet fuel once ASTM approved. Because of its aromatic properties, which are essential for compatibility with today’s aircraft, Unifuel’s SAK can be blended with paraffinic SAF from HEFA or FT and sold directly to airlines without the need for blending with another fuel. As the aviation industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact and contain costs, technologies like Flexiforming could be crucial in scaling up sustainable aviation fuel production to keep pace with demand.”

Flexiforming provides several options for SAF production, making it especially adaptable for various renewable fuel scenarios. The pilot campaign validated ethanol-to-jet (ETJ), methanol-to-jet (MTJ), and renewable naphtha-with-ethanol-to-jet (NETJ) production routes, offering flexibility in feedstock selection. Due to the technology’s substantially lower energy and hydrogen requirements, Unifuel estimates Flexiforming to be half the cost of current ETJ processes. Moreover, Flexiforming allows renewable fuel plant operators to upgrade low-value byproduct naphtha from existing HEFA or Fischer-Tropsch (FT) processes to create high-value aromatic SAF that can be blended into fully synthetic drop-in-ready jet fuel.

“The samples of Unifuel’s Flexiforming SAF candidates show promise to proceed to full certification as aviation turbine fuel,” said Harrison Yang, Research Assistant Professor of the BSEL at Washington State University.

Unifuel’s team has completed over a decade of research and extensive testing on its Flexiforming technology. As Unifuel transitions to the next stage, samples of the Flexiforming SAF produced during the campaign are being prepared for ASTM certification submission. This certification process is essential for validating the fuel's safety and performance characteristics, ultimately determining its viability for commercial aviation use.

Another way of monitoring contrail pattens to minimise the extent of aircraft forming them can be observation from space.
Business aviation too, is also looking at contrail management as way of reducing its climate impact, with Flexjet sustainable aviation spin-off 4AIR conducting research and integrating contrail forecasting into Flexjet long range aircraft dispatch automatically- giving pilots and dispatchers visibility of contrail areas.
She showed delegates an example of planning software, in which contrail avoidance can be turned on and off at will.
With tough questions now being asked over whether SAF can help meet aviation's net zero targets, contrail management is thus becoming more important.","As the world looks for ways to reduce the climate impact from aviation as the net zero by 2050 target looms, several different ways are being sought to achieve this. From 10 to 11 March, the RAeS and IATA hosted a joint workshop on how the management of aircraft contrails can play its part in this in relation to other solutions such as eco-friendly fuels. JACK RICHARDSON reports.

Looking into the sky, eyes are regularly drawn to the tiny shapes of aircraft flying high above, in their wake, are contrails, formed when water from the combustion process freezes to form ice crystals before turning into water vapour. Although these can either be short or stretch for many miles looking harmless and perhaps even photogenic, there is a risk that they may have longer lasting environmental implications through trapping heat from the Earth in the atmosphere, leading to increased atmospheric warming. RAeS Past President 2001-2002, Professor Ian Poll has argued that through basic measures such as managing the altitude and routes of aircraft to avoid zones most likely to form contrails, the environmental impact of aviation can be significantly reduced for relatively little intervention (see AEROSPACE January 2025). In order explore these issues, the RAeS jointly hosted a workshop with IATA from 10 to 11 March, entitled ‘Contrails: From modification to avoidance to management’.

Addressing the problem

An Emirates Airbus A380 leaves long contrails in its wake, with a range of potential consequences for the environment.

Opening the event, Hemant Mistry, Director Net Zero Transition at IATA said ""there are no quick fixes,"" something that is apparent when the various options to mitigate the climate impact of aviation are examined. Managing demand for flights would have adverse impacts on the economy while solutions such as electric aircraft are not practical for long distance flights due to their limited range and small size. Also, there are well publicised issues with producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) due the costs involved (see AEROSPACE March 2025) with many of the proposed solutions yet to be produced at scale. Giving a keynote address, Stephen Barrett, Professor of Engineering at Cambridge University made the point that although aircraft designed to reduce emissions are in the process of being developed, with innovations such as the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, these are still some time away from maturity. He added that they will take ""a generation"" to bring into service when the length of production backlogs for existing aircraft are taken into account. With these issues in mind, Marc Stettler of Imperial College London described contrail management as “lower hanging fruit” for addressing aviation emissions. With the modern technology ecosystem being key to this strategy, Dinesh Sanekommu of Google Research, said to delegates: “Hopefully, what we can be for everyone in this room is one of those grabbers that help you get the fruit or like a footstool that will help you reach what you want to reach.” Taking many different factors into account, techniques are emerging to counter the environmental impact of contrails.

Finding the contrails

If the management of contrails is to play its part in reducing climate impact, ways in which to do this will have to be trialed and perfected. An initial step is being able to observe contrails, their formation and dissipation. At a basic level, real-time observation of contrails can be achieved in some parts of the world by using cameras placed on buildings at ground level. However, companies all over the world are developing more sophisticated methods. German holiday carrier TUI performed test flights in January 2024 at first involving ten pilots, who would carry out post flight evaluations and take photographs on the contrails whilst inflight. Managing contrails requires a significant amount of data and in order to get this, SWISS has taken advantage of the data which is generated from the aircraft’s flight data recorder combined with sophisticated modelling to produce methods for its aircraft to circumvent areas where contrails are most likely to form.

Other well-known organisations working on the observation of contrails include NASA, measuring emissions from both ground and air vehicles as well as the world first use of a downward looking LIDAR in order to examine the exact structure and moisture level of contrails. Another way of monitoring contrail pattens to minimise the extent of aircraft forming them can be observation from space. The first image of a contrail from space was taken in 1975 and since then, more advanced methods have been employed to exploit this imagery, including deep learning systems from 2022. The effectiveness of this method very much depends on the type of satellite used, with those in geo-earth orbit (GEO) being able to provide a broad view due to their higher altitude, but their distance from the earth as well as the time it takes for the contrail to become visible, means information they generate can quickly become outdated. By contrast, low earth orbit (LEO) satellites have the ability to observe the aircraft which produces the contrails, although these have a more narrow field of view. This is a disadvantage which can potentially be mitigated through the deployment of an LEO satellite array, such as the FireSat system Google is deploying order to monitor wildfires.

Business aviation too, is also looking at contrail management as way of reducing its climate impact, with Flexjet sustainable aviation spin-off 4AIR conducting research and integrating contrail forecasting into Flexjet long range aircraft dispatch automatically- giving pilots and dispatchers visibility of contrail areas.

Trade-offs

With a growing number of tools to monitor contrails emerging, Adrien Chabot of Amelia, a French Airline which has deployed contrail management techniques on its routes within France using an Embraer jet with plans to extend this over 2025 to 10,000 eligible flights on larger aircraft including the A320 family, delivered a message to delegates. “Come and experiment contrails mitigation with us.” Although progress has been made and the potential of contrail management to reduce emissions is attractive, questions still have to be asked about how effective and desirable they will be.

While Sian Andrews from the UK’s NATS described contrail management as: “a very small price for a large climate benefit” she sounded a note of caution about key questions that have to be asked. These are in terms of practicalities around the feasibility for a large number of airlines to alter their flight paths to manage contrails when many others are looking to do this at the same time, leading to the risk of congested airspace. On this theme, she raised the question of how any changes could increase the workload of air traffic controllers across the world, with solutions currently being focused on existing tools instead of AI. Similarly, several speakers raised the point that in order to manage the contrails produced by their aircraft, airlines could end up sending their aircraft on longer routes and therefore generating more carbon emissions. Brice Bergantz of Airbus pointed out planning for contrail management will vary according to route, with short haul flights being able to plan their whole route prior to departure, but long haul flights have to keep up-to-date with contrail conditions for the journey’s duration. As a result, Sigrun Matthes of Germany’s DLR said that fuel and time costs will have to be factored into flight plans. She showed delegates an example of planning software, in which contrail avoidance can be turned on and off at will. She stressed during her remarks however that: “we need to investigate if such eco-efficient flight trajectories are feasible.”

Trails to the future

Despite the return of notable climate change sceptic President Trump, the world is still moving towards net zero with all of the behavioural and technological change this entails. The workshop showed that managing contrails could be a potent tool in this arsenal, but it also highlighted key challenges. Examples include having the necessary information to know where contrails are as well as being able to tell when their management would be counterproductive. As with any new environmental technology in aerospace, this innovation has several trade-offs that need to be managed. With tough questions now being asked over whether SAF can help meet aviation's net zero targets, contrail management is thus becoming more important.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26130/contrail-control-gathers-pace-header-web.jpg,N,,2025-03-25 05:56:08.734711

The PACIFIC project will investigate the impact of fuel composition and engine cycle on particle emissions, from laboratory tests to full-scale aircraft ground testing.

The project, funded by the European Union, started in January 2025 and will last until June 2028 with the aim of improving modelling and prediction capabilities to better assess contrail formation and the broader climate impact of aviation.

The results will support future fuel specifications and policy recommendations to minimise the environmental footprint of aviation.

Airbus, within a consortium of 10 partners from four European countries, has launched PACIFIC, a project to study the impact of aviation's non-CO2 emissions on Local Air Quality and Climate with a focus on contrails. Recent studies suggest that the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) could reduce both soot particles and contrail ice crystals. However, additional information on fuel composition and its processing in the engine is necessary to better understand the effects and benefits of SAF.

PACIFIC (Particle emissions, Air Quality and Climate Impact related to Fuel Composition and Engine Cycle) seeks to bridge the gap in understanding aviation’s non-CO2 emissions by testing an unprecedented range of fuels under controlled conditions. The project will ensure consistency in combustion parameters and hardware similarity from lab-scale experiments at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) to full aircraft engine tests at Airbus Toulouse.

The research will focus on understanding how soot forms during fuel combustion, using improved prediction tools to better anticipate its presence in engine emissions. It will also analyse the quantity of fine particles released at different engine power levels, refining methods to estimate their impact from ground tests to real flight conditions. Another key aspect is assessing how these particles contribute to ice crystal formation, a major factor in contrail development, using advanced measurement techniques. Finally, the project will evaluate the broader climate effects of these emissions by examining how different fuel compositions and engine settings influence contrail formation and properties, and their impact on global warming.

By consolidating these insights, PACIFIC will contribute to a robust cost-benefit assessment of various fuel options, providing crucial inputs for potential future fuel-related regulations. The project will ultimately help define new fuel specifications aimed at reducing aviation’s climate and air quality impact while reinforcing Europe’s leadership in sustainable aeronautics.

Airbus Chief Technology Officer Sabine Klauke says, ""Addressing aviation's non-CO2 emissions is critical in our journey toward truly sustainable flight. Through collaborative science-based approaches and innovative technologies, we're committed to minimising these effects while maintaining operational efficiency. The PACIFIC project will quantify and measure the non-CO2 emissions emitted from various SAF compositions. Using an innovative ground experiment process, we will be able to replicate conditions without delay and repeat them if needed. We look forward to the results of this multi-year project.""

Since its introduction, this pioneering technology has redefined approach operations, delivering remarkable environmental benefits and operational efficiencies that have set a new standard for the aviation industry.

TBS dynamically adjusts the spacing between arriving aircraft based on time rather than distance. This intelligent approach has been instrumental in reducing the need for extended airborne holding, saving fuel and cutting carbon emissions and improving on time performance.

Since its introduction for Heathrow in 2015, TBS has achieved remarkable results, cutting headwind delays by 62%, reducing airborne holding by 1,500,000 minutes – the equivalent of almost three years of holding time – and saving over 100,000 tonnes of fuel, worth approximately $70 million based on current jet fuel prices. Additionally, TBS has saved over 300,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions, contributing to a more sustainable aviation industry.

The success of TBS is a testament to the power of collaboration between industry leaders. Originally developed and delivered by NATS and Leidos for Heathrow Airport, the technology has set a benchmark for airport arrivals management worldwide, inspiring the adoption at other major airports across the globe as part of the Intelligent Approach toolset.

Chris Norsworthy, NATS Director Airspace and Future Operations, said: “Time Based Separation is a great example of how technology can transform air traffic management. By working closely with Heathrow and Leidos, we pioneered and delivered a solution that benefits passengers, airlines, and the environment. We’re incredibly proud of what we’ve achieved together.”

Beyond its environmental benefits, TBS has delivered substantial economic savings. By reducing the time aircraft spend holding, TBS has delivered cost savings for airlines. Based on an estimate of €100 per minute for the operational costs associated with extended flight times - as per a 2015 Eurocontrol study - airlines have saved an estimated €184 million since TBS was introduced.

Dale Reeson, Heathrow Director of Airside and Airspace Operations, said: “Time-Based Separation has been a game-changer for Heathrow. For airlines, it has unlocked major efficiencies, cutting fuel consumption and costs. For passengers, it has meant smoother, more reliable journeys. And for us, it has enabled Heathrow to be more resilient while reducing our environmental impact. TBS is a perfect example of how innovation can deliver benefits for everyone.”

The success of TBS as part of Intelligent Approach demonstrates the potential for advanced air traffic management solutions to deliver significant benefits for the aviation industry and the environment. As the industry continues to evolve, NATS and Leidos remain committed to driving innovation and enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of air travel.

The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally.
Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF.
By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.","The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced the establishment of the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO), a new entity tasked with managing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Registry. This move aims to drive the aviation industry’s decarbonization efforts by establishing a transparent and efficient framework to support the global adoption of SAF, which is a key component in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

CADO’s creation marks a pivotal moment in IATA’s broader strategy to accelerate sustainability in the aviation sector.

The organization’s mandate is to operate the SAF Registry as an independent entity, distinct from IATA, to ensure credibility, transparency, and inclusivity across the SAF value chain.

The registry will play a crucial role in developing a liquid and transparent global market for SAF, fostering trust and enabling stakeholders from governments to fuel producers and investors to engage in SAF production and use.

Marie Owens Thomsen, IATA’s Senior Vice President of Sustainability and Chief Economist, emphasized the significance of this initiative. “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its role is critical in managing the registry with an open, global approach that supports scrutiny from all stakeholders. The door is open for any entity within the SAF value chain to join CADO, including governments. This inclusive model is crucial in harmonizing the principles that govern SAF registries worldwide,” she said.

The SAF Registry, a key infrastructure component in IATA’s decarbonization strategy, will allow aviation stakeholders to track and verify SAF production and consumption globally. This transparency will help drive confidence in SAF as a viable, scalable alternative to conventional jet fuel. CADO’s leadership in managing the registry will help the industry meet the ambitious goal of ramping up SAF production to significant levels, a necessary step to reduce the aviation sector’s overall carbon emissions.

Willie Walsh, Director General of IATA, shared his perspective on the initiative’s importance: “The SAF Registry is indispensable in building a transparent, global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to launching the registry and establishing CADO as its manager should encourage governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage more vigorously in the SAF market. Our common goal is to significantly increase SAF production, and the structure we are creating with CADO is a vital step forward in advancing aviation decarbonization.”

As the aviation industry navigates the path toward sustainability, the SAF Registry will serve as a critical tool to ensure the transparent and efficient scaling of SAF. By involving a wide range of stakeholders, CADO aims to ensure that the global SAF market is built on shared principles and international cooperation.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented: We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.
Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power.
“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF.
We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.","Farnborough Airport, the Birthplace of British Aviation and Europe’s leading airport for premium air travel connectivity, has today announced that it has signed a landmark deal with Hydrogen Refinery for 12.5 million litres or 10,000 tonnes per annum of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) produced locally from waste.

Farnborough Airport is already one of the largest single-site suppliers of SAF to the business aviation community, having sold over 2 million litres of 38% blended SAF since 2021. With the introduction of SAF mandates taking effect at the start of this year, domestic sales of SAF are increasingly being put at risk by the lack of production and investment within the UK.

The UK and the European Union have legislation-backed mandates on both the amount of SAF that must be used from January 2025 and also the way that SAF must be produced in the future. This is to ensure advanced fuels can be developed over time to support the required growth in SAF production without incentivising farmers to switch from growing food to growing SAF feedstocks. SAF today is almost entirely produced from waste cooking oil or HEFA (Hydro processed Esters and Fatty Acids), however Hydrogen Refinery’s ground-breaking technology is able to produce carbon negative SAF from a variety of mixed waste products, sourced locally or from landfill sites.

Simon Geere, CEO at Farnborough Airport, commented:

We are delighted to be forging this ground-breaking alliance with e-fuels developer Hydrogen Refinery.

“Their patented technology has the potential to provide Farnborough Airport with enough proprietary supplies of SAF for us to become the first and only airport in the world to be offering fuel with a 20% blend across its entire supply by 2028, well ahead of the UK Government’s own target of 10% by 2030. What’s more, this is entirely consistent with our ambitions to be an incubator for the advancement of sustainable technologies, as well as being a vital commercial enabler for kick-starting the domestic refining of SAF, at scale and right here within the UK.

He went on to comment:

The transition to new fuelling technologies like this requires markets like ours which are able to sustain the higher upfront investment costs necessary to make things happen.

“Farnborough Airport is in a unique position to advance this technology given the smaller-modern aircraft which we handle and the significant economic value of the flights we support. As a local company, Hydrogen Refinery exemplify the deep-rooted technological capabilities of the companies which form part of Farnborough Airport’s aeronautical research heritage, and this is a fantastic example of a partnership which will generate significant local inward investment and will reinforce our ambitions to become a Global Sustainability Showcase for Airports around the world.”

This news follows a series of successful milestones in recent years at the Airport. In 2024, Farnborough Airport was awarded Level 4+carbon accreditation status by the Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) scheme, one of only five UK airports and the only business aviation airport to achieve such recognition. Also last year, Farnborough Airport completed one of the largest light-weight solar installations in the South East, enabling the Airport to generate 25% of its own power. In 2022, for a two-week trial period in the lead up to the Farnborough International Airshow, Farnborough Airport became the first airport in the world to offer SAF at the same price as standard Jet A1 fuel, after it took a major step in driving the adoption of SAF by offering it to all customers the year prior. Also in 2022, Farnborough Airport made a commitment to be Net Zero by 2030 or sooner for emissions within its control, setting one of the most ambitious targets in the aviation industry.

Stephen Voller, CEO at Hydrogen Refinery, commented:

We live in a throwaway society, and waste such as mixed plastics and municipal solid waste (MSW) continues to rise despite efforts towards recycling.

“Hydrogen Refinery has a unique process called the plasma electrolyser system (PES) that can process mixed waste, including airline passenger food waste, into SAF. This is not only a low-cost process but is also carbon negative because the waste is processed without the emissions from incineration or landfill. We are excited to be working with Farnborough Airport to make their vision of sustainability a reality”.

IATA senior vice-president for sustainability and chief economist Marie Owens Thomsen said: “CADO will turbo-charge the imminent launch of the IATA-developed SAF Registry. Its mandate is to manage the SAF Registry as a separate entity from IATA with an open and global approach that supports the scrutiny needed to build trust among all stakeholders. In fact, the door is open for any stakeholder in the SAF value chain, including governments, to join CADO. This inclusive approach should also be a force for the harmonization of the principles on which all SAF registries operate.”

IATA director-general Willie Walsh added: “The SAF Registry is a critical piece of market infrastructure that is indispensable in building a global, transparent, and liquid global market for SAF. The industry’s commitment to build the Registry and establish CADO to manage it should inspire governments, fossil fuel producers, and investors to engage in the SAF market with commensurate vigor. Ramping-up SAF production is the common goal and the structure we are putting in place with CADO is an important step in moving decarbonization forward.”

What exactly is CADO?

CADO is incorporated as a not-for-profit organization in Canada with its headquarters in Montreal. IATA is the founding member of CADO and its role in CADO will include ongoing technical support and operations.

CADO membership is open to organisations that operate in or contribute directly to the SAF value chain, or that represent any association or group of participants in the SAF value chain; states or quasi-state organisations with a direct interest in the operations and benefit of the SAF Registry; and related interest groups indirectly benefitting from SAF deployed in the aviation system.

The SAF Registry that CADO will take charge of helps solve the challenge of limited SAF supply which is acutely scarce and available in only a few locations globally.

The Registry will do this by connecting airlines with SAF producers and suppliers, regardless of their geographical location.

In addition, it gives access to airlines’ corporate customers to in-sector emissions reductions and capitalizes on firms’ capacity to co-finance the cost of decarbonisation.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/01d01186-iata-saf-registry.jpeg,N,,2025-03-25 00:57:03.828421

That volume is up approximately 52% when compared to 2023, accounting for 43% of China’s total UCO exports in 2024.
The country’s total UCO exports, however, fell by 60% between November and December after the government of China eliminated a 13% export tax rebate on UCO.
In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays.
Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report.","China’s exports of used cooking oil (UCO) reached a record high in 2024 but fell sharply in December after the Chinese government eliminated the 13% export tax rebate for UCO, according to a report filed with the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service’ Global Agricultural Information Network.

The U.S. was the top export market for Chinese UCO in 2024, at 1.27 million tons. That volume is up approximately 52% when compared to 2023, accounting for 43% of China’s total UCO exports in 2024. The country’s total UCO exports, however, fell by 60% between November and December after the government of China eliminated a 13% export tax rebate on UCO.

The elimination of the UCO export tax rebate was announced on Nov. 15, 2024, and became effective Dec. 1, 2024. According to a November 2024 GAIN report, the policy shift aimed to redirect China’s biobased diesel industry from an export-focused model to a more domestically oriented industry. The change is also expected to create export opportunities for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in China, as the European Union provisionally excluded SAF from proposed antidumping duties in July 2024.

The policy shift triggered immediate changes in UCO pricing, according to the report. Leading Chinese UCO producers set initial December and January contract prices at $1,000 to $1,050 per metric ton, an increase of $100 to $150 over previous rates.

In addition to the 60% reduction in UCO exports experienced in December, the GAIN report indicates that the China’s UCO market slowed further in February due to declining order numbers and prices, traffic congestion and logistics delays. According to the report, many UCO traders are reluctant to sell at lower prices and are minimizing purchases to avoid losses from price fluctuations.

Despite China’s sluggish domestic UCO market, international demand for UCO has reached unprecedented levels, according to the report. The current domestic market slump in China is expected to be temporary, as growing international demand and tightening domestic supplies lead to a market rebound.

A full copy of the report is available on the USDA FAS GAIN website.

But in an increasingly competitive environment, can European carriers keep pace with the rise of Middle Eastern and Asian cargo hubs?

Global air cargo demand has been in flux since the pandemic, with new trade corridors emerging and geopolitical uncertainties reshaping supply chains. While Asia-to-Europe routes remain a dominant force, new markets like India and Vietnam are growing rapidly, requiring airlines to adapt their networks.

“Trade is becoming more diverse, and airfreight markets are evolving,” said Lufthansa Cargo.

“We see strong growth in Southeast Asia, and to remain competitive, European cargo hubs must ensure they are well-positioned to handle these shifts efficiently.”

This diversification is reflected in Lufthansa Cargo’s 29 percent increase in freighter capacity to Asia during the last peak season, with new stations added in Shenzhen and Zhengzhou to support the e-commerce boom. However, the question remains—will Europe continue to lead global air cargo, or is it at risk of losing its stronghold?

e-commerce revolution

The rise of e-commerce-driven air freight has been one of the most significant shifts in recent years. The need for rapid delivery times has increased demand for dedicated freighter capacity, particularly from Asia.

Airlines must adapt to the fast-paced nature of e-commerce logistics, ensuring long-term capacity commitments and flexible charter options. However, with passenger flights returning to full capacity, the balance between freighters and belly cargo remains a delicate challenge.

“We’re seeing increased demand for long-term capacity commitments, particularly from e-commerce customers,” Lufthansa Cargo’s representative added.

“Adjusting our freighter network accordingly is essential to maintaining efficiency.”

While dedicated freighters offer greater control over cargo operations, belly capacity remains a crucial part of European carriers’ strategies.

However, the industry is facing yield pressures, with Lufthansa Cargo reporting only a 3 percent increase in cargo yield in 2024, a sign that post-pandemic peak freight rates are now stabilising.

AI and automation

European cargo hubs have long been criticised for inefficiencies, particularly in handling times and operational bottlenecks, addressing this by embracing automation and AI, positioning itself at the forefront of digital transformation in air cargo.

A pilot project launched in the autumn of 2024 saw autonomous tow vehicles (AGVs) introduced in Frankfurt, transporting freight between buildings without human intervention. Meanwhile, AI-driven automation has reduced response times in Lufthansa Cargo’s customer service centres, with 40 percent of inquiries now handled automatically.

“Automation and AI are not just about efficiency—they are about resilience.”

“As the industry faces a growing skills shortage, digitalisation will play a key role in ensuring smooth operations and reducing delays.”

Additionally, Lufthansa Cargo is supporting the push towards IATA’s ONE Record initiative, which aims to create a standardised, open data-sharing framework for air freight. If fully implemented, such initiatives could revolutionise cargo visibility and tracking, eliminating inefficiencies caused by fragmented data systems.

Despite digitalisation and network expansion, the biggest challenge for European cargo carriers remains sustainability. With net-zero targets looming, airlines are under increasing pressure to reduce emissions and invest in cleaner technologies.

Lufthansa Cargo has committed to halving net CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieving full carbon neutrality by 2050. However, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption remains limited due to high costs and restricted availability.

“Our biggest CO2-saving potential lies in the air,” stated Lufthansa Cargo.

“Sustainable aviation fuel and fleet modernisation are critical, but the reality is that the industry needs broader collaboration to make SAF scalable and commercially viable.”

xThe airline has already transitioned its entire freighter fleet to Boeing 777Fs, the most fuel-efficient aircraft in its category. It also has seven Boeing 777-8 freighters on order, which promise further emission reductions. However, with SAF still making up a small fraction of overall fuel use in aviation, sustainability remains one of the biggest hurdles for Europe’s air cargo industry.

Investing in the future

As European cargo hubs face rising competition from the Middle East and Asia, investment in infrastructure modernisation is seen as a key differentiator.

Lufthansa Cargo is investing €600 million into modernising its Frankfurt hub through the LCCevo project, aimed at boosting efficiency, reducing handling times, and expanding digital capabilities. The 330,000m² Lufthansa Cargo Center will undergo phased upgrades to minimise disruption while enhancing operational capabilities.
