The European Union’s “Fit for 55” package represents one of the most ambitious climate policy frameworks in the world, aiming to reduce GHG emissions by at least 55% by 2030 (compared to 1990 levels) and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. As a growing source of emissions, the aviation sector is directly addressed in this wide-ranging legislative bundle through multiple complementary measures. In this article, we explore how Fit for 55 is reshaping the future of European and global aviation through regulatory, fiscal, and infrastructure-based reforms, with a special focus on Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF).

The Pillars of Fit for 55 Impacting Aviation

Fit for 55 is not a single regulation but a comprehensive suite of policy updates. The most aviation-relevant pillars include:

ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation

Revision of the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS)

Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) Revision

Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR)

These policies are strategically interlinked to create demand, reduce emissions, and drive investment in low-carbon aviation technologies.

ReFuelEU Aviation: Fueling the SAF Revolution

One of the most impactful components for aviation under the Fit for 55 framework is the ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation, which introduces binding mandates for the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) across the European Union. This regulation is designed to create a unified market demand signal and drive the production, distribution, and use of SAF at scale.

Under the regulation, fuel suppliers must ensure that all jet fuel made available at EU airports contains a minimum share of SAF. Starting in 2025, this blending mandate is set at 2%, and it increases incrementally every five years to reach 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. Importantly, the mandate also requires that a growing proportion of the SAF component consists of synthetic aviation fuels, or e-fuels, which are derived from renewable electricity and captured CO2. By 2050, at least 35% of the SAF blended into jet fuel must be synthetic.

The regulation applies to all departing flights from EU airports, regardless of the airline’s country of origin, thereby preventing competitive distortions and carbon leakage. To ensure transparency and accountability, fuel suppliers and airlines are obligated to report the volumes and sustainability credentials of the fuel they use. Annual compliance checks and penalties for non-conformance are built into the legislation, creating robust enforcement mechanisms.

ReFuelEU Aviation not only addresses supply-side challenges by stimulating SAF production but also reinforces demand certainty for the aviation industry. It incentivizes airlines to incorporate SAF into their decarbonization strategies and encourages long-term investment in SAF technologies and infrastructure. As such, the regulation is a cornerstone of the EU’s strategy to make sustainable flying a commercially viable and operationally scalable reality by mid-century.

EU ETS Reform: Full Emissions Accountability

The EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has undergone substantial reforms to align more closely with the ambitious decarbonization targets laid out in the Fit for 55 package. One of the most significant changes is the complete elimination of free emissions allowances for intra-EU flights, starting in 2024. From this point forward, airlines operating within the European Union are required to purchase allowances for 100% of their verified CO2 emissions. This shift marks a clear departure from earlier leniencies and establishes a firmer price signal on carbon.

In addition to the end of free allowances, the overall emissions cap for the aviation sector under the EU ETS will be reduced annually, further tightening the system. This progressive reduction is designed to ensure that aviation emissions decline in tandem with the EU’s broader climate objectives. Airlines must now factor these escalating costs into their long-term operational planning.

One of the most forward-looking aspects of the reform is the integration of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into the ETS framework. Since SAF emits significantly fewer lifecycle emissions than conventional jet fuel, its use results in reduced compliance obligations under the ETS. This makes SAF not only an environmental solution but also a financially strategic one, as it can lower the overall cost burden of emissions compliance.

Ultimately, this reform raises the effective carbon price for airlines and introduces stronger financial incentives to accelerate the adoption of low-emission fuels and more efficient aircraft technologies. It reinforces the message that polluting less is not just a moral imperative, it is an economic necessity in the EU’s evolving aviation landscape.

Tax Reform and Infrastructure Investment

Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) Revision:

As part of the Fit for 55 legislative suite, the revision of the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) introduces critical fiscal reforms that target fossil fuel use in aviation. Historically, kerosene used for intra-EU flights was exempt from taxation, effectively subsidizing carbon-intensive air travel. Under the new rules, this exemption will be phased out beginning in 2025. Airlines operating within the EU will gradually be required to pay taxes on their fossil fuel consumption, increasing the cost of high-emission operations.

In parallel, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is granted preferential tax treatment. This includes reduced or zero tax rates to improve its price competitiveness relative to kerosene. By creating a financial differential between fossil-based and renewable fuels, the directive provides a clear incentive for airlines to transition to SAF as a more economically viable option over time.

Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR):

To support the practical deployment of SAF at scale, the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) mandates that major EU airports invest in the necessary infrastructure. This includes the development of facilities for SAF storage, on-site blending, and dedicated refueling systems that ensure seamless integration with existing operations.

The regulation ensures that supply chain bottlenecks do not undermine SAF adoption. By requiring airports to be SAF-ready, the EU is proactively addressing the logistical challenges associated with distributing new fuel types. This foresight is crucial to aligning infrastructure with regulatory mandates and industry targets.

Together, the tax reforms and infrastructure investments function as a balanced policy mechanism—offering financial incentives for sustainable practices while gradually phasing out subsidies for polluting fuels. This dual approach is designed to accelerate the aviation sector’s transition toward lower-emission operations in a structured and enforceable manner.

Market Implications and Global Influence

The Fit for 55 package sets a global benchmark for aviation climate policy, significantly influencing both regional operations and global strategies. One of the most prominent effects is the surge in investment into SAF production capacity across Europe. Driven by clear regulatory targets and supportive incentives, fuel producers are ramping up infrastructure to meet the anticipated demand for low-carbon aviation fuel.

Meanwhile, airlines that continue to rely heavily on fossil-based jet fuels are encountering higher compliance costs. The tightening of emissions regulations and the removal of traditional tax exemptions are creating strong financial pressures, prompting companies to reconfigure fleet operations, fuel sourcing, and sustainability strategies.

Technological innovation is also accelerating. As SAF requirements become stricter and long-term decarbonization goals loom, there is a growing push to advance alternative propulsion methods such as electric and hydrogen-powered aviation. These emerging technologies, while still nascent, are beginning to attract increased R&D investments as the industry seeks long-term solutions.

Internationally, Fit for 55 is already generating a ripple effect. Airlines outside the EU, especially those operating flights to or from Europe, are compelled to adapt to these stringent rules. This global spillover effect not only amplifies the EU’s influence but also encourages other jurisdictions to strengthen their own aviation climate policies.

Already, fuel producers, airlines, and airport authorities are aligning capital expenditures to meet Fit for 55 mandates. Moreover, the package complements international measures such as ICAO’s CORSIA, but with stronger enforcement and timelines.

Conclusion

The EU’s Fit for 55 package is transforming aviation from a hard-to-abate sector into a climate innovation frontier. Through coordinated policy levers such as SAF mandates, emissions pricing, taxation reform, and infrastructure development, the initiative creates a robust ecosystem for decarbonizing air travel. While challenges remain around cost, scalability, and international harmonization, Europe’s regulatory clarity is providing a flightpath toward net-zero aviation by 2050. As other regions evaluate their own approaches, Fit for 55 stands as a model of integrated, enforceable, and future-ready climate governance.

This breakthrough positions Mexico as a potential leader in SAF production in Latin America, aligning with global goals to achieve net-zero aviation emissions by 2050.","The Autonomous Metropolitan University (UAM) Iztapalapa, in partnership with the Universidad de Guanajuato, has developed an innovative process to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from agricultural waste. Known as Furanos-to-Jet (FTJ), the method leverages furans—compounds formed during biomass degradation—as precursors for jet fuel.

Dr. Gabriel Contreras Zarazúa, a chemical engineering expert and lead researcher, highlighted the FTJ process's advantages over existing SAF production methods like Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ). He explained that furans offer properties essential for SAF, such as suitable freezing points and densities, which alcohol-based intermediates lack.

Developed entirely in Mexico, the FTJ process earned third place in the 2025 Airbus SAF Award, presented during the 2025 Aerospace Fair (FAMEX). This recognition underscores the project’s importance in advancing sustainable aviation in the country.

Dr. Contreras Zarazúa estimates that SAF production in Mexico could begin within two to three years but identifies a key obstacle: insufficient collaboration between academia and industry. “There are many excellent ideas in academia with scaling potential, but no connection with industry,” he told A21.

He also stressed the need to engage with farmers who produce the biomass necessary for SAF. “The missing piece is the entire biomass supply chain. Once that is in place, building the technology will be the easiest part,” he added.

Regarding infrastructure, Dr. Contreras Zarazúa suggested repurposing existing facilities from Petróleos Mexicanos (PEMEX) but advocated for dedicated biorefineries near biomass sources to reduce costs and emissions. For instance, sugarcane residues could be processed in coastal areas, while agave waste would require specialized facilities in Jalisco, tailored to local agricultural byproducts.

By securing strategic partnerships and diversifying its feedstock supply, the company is building a scalable and secure foundation to capitalize on soaring demand for low-carbon fuels. This article explores how TotalEnergies' recent moves—particularly its focus on feedstock security and production capacity expansions—could drive long-term growth, making it a compelling investment in the energy transition.

Strategic Partnerships: Building the SAF Ecosystem

TotalEnergies has woven a network of partnerships that span research, production, and distribution. Its collaboration with Safran, a major aerospace supplier, began in 2021 and has already yielded breakthroughs, such as a SAF-blend flight in a military helicopter in 2023. The partnership with Airbus, announced in 2024, is even more significant: it aims to supply over half of Airbus's European SAF needs and co-develop next-generation fuels compatible with 100% SAF use.

These alliances are not just about R&D—they're about scaling production. In France, the Grandpuits biorefinery, a €500 million project, will produce 230,000 tons of SAF annually by 2026. Meanwhile, the La Mède biorefinery has already begun blending SAF into jet fuel for southern French airports.

Feedstock Security: The Key to Scalability

The aviation sector's shift to SAF hinges on one critical factor: access to reliable, low-carbon feedstocks. TotalEnergies has addressed this head-on through long-term agreements. In June 2025, it signed a 15-year deal with Quatra, a European leader in used cooking oil (UCO) collection, securing 60,000 tons of UCO annually starting in 2026. UCO-based fuels reduce lifecycle emissions by 70–80% compared to fossil fuels and offer a steady, non-food-based feedstock.

The company also partners with SARIA, which supplies organic waste from agriculture and households to Grandpuits. By diversifying its feedstock sources—UCO, agricultural waste, and other non-food biomass—TotalEnergies mitigates supply risks and ensures its fuels meet stringent EU sustainability criteria.

Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's Role in Fueling Growth

The EU's ReFuelEU mandate requires airlines to blend 2% SAF by 2025, rising to 6% by 2030. TotalEnergies is not just meeting these targets—it's exceeding them. By 2028, the company aims to supply over 500,000 tons/year of SAF, enabling it to deliver 10% SAF in jet fuel volumes in Europe by 2030—a full four years ahead of regulatory requirements.

This proactive stance positions TotalEnergies as a supplier of choice for airlines like Air France-KLM, which signed a landmark 10-year deal for up to 1.5 million tons of SAF. Such agreements lock in demand, stabilizing revenue streams and reducing financial risk.

Financial Resilience and Risk Mitigation

TotalEnergies' $6.5 billion annual renewables budget (including biorefineries) underscores its commitment to the transition. Its refinery upgrades—such as coprocessing SAF at Antwerp and Leuna—are cost-effective, leveraging existing infrastructure. Long-term feedstock and offtake agreements further insulate the company from commodity price volatility.

Investment Thesis: A Leader in the Aviation Transition

The data tells a compelling story. Over the past three years, TotalEnergies' stock has outperformed peers like BP and Shell, reflecting investor confidence in its green strategy.

Why invest now?

1. Scalability: TotalEnergies' production capacity is set to grow from ~250,000 tons/year in 2025 to over 500,000 tons/year by 2028—a 100% increase in just three years.

2. Feedstock Security: Its partnerships ensure a stable, low-carbon supply chain, critical as SAF demand surges.

3. Regulatory Tailwinds: The EU's mandates create a guaranteed market, while TotalEnergies' overperformance positions it to capture premium pricing.

Conclusion: A Bridge to Net-Zero Aviation

TotalEnergies has masterfully combined strategic partnerships, feedstock diversification, and regulatory foresight to build a dominant position in SAF. Its ability to scale production while securing supply lines makes it a standout play in the energy transition. Investors seeking exposure to decarbonization should take note: TotalEnergies is not just adapting to the future—it's designing it.

The deal reflects the European Union’s big ambitions for SAF, with a mandatory 2% blend in 2025 and a target of 70% by 2050.

Intermediate crops that do not compete with food production

Intermediate crops are planted between main crops on the same plot. Therefore, they require no additional land and do not compete with the production of food or animal feed, while providing farmers with an additional income stream. Under EU regulations, they qualify for SAF production.

These crops also lead to the production of vegetable protein, contributing to French and European sovereignty in animal feed. They also have a number of agronomic benefits: preventing soil erosion by improving its structure, reducing water loss and helping preserve biodiversity.

Vegetable oils that qualify for SAF production

Under the terms of the agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will jointly assess the entirety of the value chain, from plant variety selection to SAF production, in order to establish viable activity in France.

Avril will supply vegetable oils from the intermediate crops to TotalEnergies, which will turn them into SAF in its French biorefineries and in its French and European refineries through coprocessing,

“The deal with Avril marks a significant step towards the development of a French industry producing vegetable oil for SAF production.

“This thing is a long way from being done and there’s still a lot of differences to iron out.”

Geoff Cooper tells Brownfield the Senate Finance Committee’s budget proposal preserves the transferability for the 45Z tax credit over a seven-year period.

“The expiration of the transferability in the House bill was a real problem for us and we’re grateful the Senate Finance Committee heard our concerns.”

Both versions of the bill also extend the 45Z tax credit for four years. But Cooper says the Senate’s draft includes other provisions that would limit ethanol producers’ participation.

Cooper says the Senate’s approach reduces the value of the credit for Sustainable Aviation Fuel.

“Under current law, SAF could qualify for as much as $1.75 per gallon and the Senate’s version would knock that down to a maximum of $1 per gallon.”

He says the U.S. Senate didn’t completely ban foreign feedstocks from being used to make biofuels, while the U.S. House version does.

Other ag organizations, including the Missouri Soybean Association, say they’re disappointed the U.S. Senate didn’t completely ban foreign feed stocks from qualifying for 45Z. Cooper says he’s optimistic there can be good compromises made as the bill goes through the reconciliation process

“We have no doubt it’s not going to be perfect right out of the gate, but what we’re hoping for is there’s a willingness in Congress and the administration to keep working on this and keep improving it. And keep doing everything we can to get it right.”

The U.S. Senate is expected to consider its version of the budget reconciliation package next week and has a goal to pass the bill before Independence Day.

This pioneering agreement underscores a shared commitment to meet the European Union's ambitious mandates for SAF incorporation, starting at 2% by 2025 and escalating to a formidable 70% by 2050.

The collaboration focuses on leveraging ""intermediate crops"" – plants sown between two main harvests on the same plot of land. This innovative approach offers a dual advantage: it avoids competition with food and animal feed production, thereby addressing concerns about land use, and simultaneously provides additional income for farmers. Crucially, these intermediate crops are fully compliant with European regulations for SAF production.

Beyond their role in sustainable fuel, these crops also yield valuable plant proteins, directly contributing to France and Europe's protein sovereignty for animal feed. Furthermore, the agronomic benefits of intercropping are substantial, including reduced soil erosion, improved soil structure, decreased water loss, and enhanced biodiversity – all vital aspects of sustainable agriculture.

Under the terms of the agreement, TotalEnergies and Avril will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the entire value chain. This will span from the meticulous selection of optimal plant varieties to the final production of biofuels. Avril, with its deep expertise in the French vegetable oils and proteins sector, will be responsible for supplying the vegetable oils derived from these intermediate crops to TotalEnergies. TotalEnergies, in turn, will process these oils into sustainable aviation fuels at its French biorefineries, such as La Mède and Grandpuits, and through co-processing at its French and European refineries. The Grandpuits biorefinery, for instance, is set to have an annual SAF production capacity of 230,000 tons by 2026.

This collaboration signifies a proactive and integrated approach to tackling aviation's environmental footprint. By fostering a domestic supply chain for SAF derived from non-food competing crops, France aims to solidify its position in the green energy transition and set a precedent for sustainable agricultural practices within the European Union's ambitious climate goals. The partnership is expected to drive innovation in agricultural techniques and biofuel production, contributing significantly to a greener future for air transport.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-06-18 14:08:06.920959

How? Thanks to a third generation of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) called e-fuel, or “power to liquid” fuel.

Experts say that the science is actually surprisingly straightforward. The main problem the aviation industry must overcome is cost.

According to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, e-fuels cost $8,720 per ton, compared to bio-based SAF at $2,365 per ton and conventional jet fuel at $830 per ton.

Conor Madigan, CEO at Aether Fuels, explained that e-fuel is made by converting carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere or industrial emissions into carbon monoxide (CO) via direct electrolysis or in combination with hydrogen.

The carbon dioxide and hydrogen can then be combined to create various hydrocarbon compounds that can be refined into jet fuel.

Duncan McCourt, CEO of Sustainable Aviation, points out that when burned, it emits the carbon. That means it’s entirely net zero if a renewable energy plant is used to make it. And unlike with bio-feed SAF, feedstock limits and land-use concerns aren’t factors.

The hurdle, Mr McCourt tells The Independent, is “scaling it to commercial levels and doing so at a reasonable cost”.

Mr Madigan explains further, revealing that the cost of e-fuel plants “is high and the scarcity of the kind of hydrogen required under current policies restricts projects to smaller scale operations”.

This, he says, “leads to poor cost efficiency and very high prices to generate acceptable capital returns”.

Mr Madigan continues: “There are only two markets where policies exist to incentivize 'CO2 plus H2' fuels, the UK and EU, and they allow the use of only waste hydrogen or green hydrogen.

“Many companies have sought ways to reduce capital expenditure, but most approaches compromise yield in the process.”

Mr Madigan explains that capturing CO2 from the atmosphere is “very energy-intensive and therefore very expensive” but that this problem makes a smaller contribution to the price of the fuel.

So, what’s the solution?

It’s partly in the hands of politicians.

Mr McCourt says: “The cost of the energy required to produce hydrogen and capture carbon at scale is one of the primary challenges.

“Overcoming this will require significant investment and supportive governmental policy.”

And would the aviation industry embrace “thin-air” fuel? It would seem likely, with several carriers already experimenting with alternative ways to power flight.","https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/18/17/45/iStock-2152046671.jpeg?trim=16,178,29,173&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-06-18 14:08:22.924367

Pasture and bananas make way for palm Palm oil production in Roraima as a whole rose nearly 40 times between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
It is because of the high risk of ILUC linked to palm oil cultivation – and the related carbon dioxide emitted when forests are destroyed – that virgin palm oil is not permitted as a feedstock for SAF in Europe.","Discovery of illegal palm crops comes as Grupo BBF grapples with financial problems sparked by warnings over its human rights record

Located in the heart of the Amazon, it has been billed as Brazil’s first sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) project, but the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in Manaus is now grappling with a financial crisis triggered by concern over possible rights abuses.

Reporting in the region by Brazilian news outlet InfoAmazonia in partnership with Climate Home News, has also found that the company – São Paulo-based Brasil BioFuels (Grupo BBF) – is growing oil palm on three areas subject to sanctions by Brazil’s Ibama environmental agency over illegal deforestation.

The embargoed plots lie in São João da Baliza, a sparsely populated district strung along the highway where former grazing pasture and biodiversity-rich scrubland have steadily been replaced by neat rows of oil palms. Signs hanging on fences say the crop will be used to make SAF.

While many locals living in the district’s towns welcome the jobs and economic boost provided by BBF’s palm plantations, Indigenous people and environmentalists see them as a threat to nature, traditional ways of life and the rainforest.

“If these areas are completely replaced by crops for biofuel production, we will lose unique species, many of which are still little known to science,” said Lucas Ferrante, a researcher from the zoology postgraduate programme at the Federal University of Amazonas (UFAM).

BBF, which announced its plans for the Manaus SAF project back in 2022, makes much of the fact that – in line with Brazil’s strict environmental laws – it only grows oil palm on land that was degraded before 2007, rather than freshly deforested land.

Stressing the company’s green credentials in an interview with Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico last year, CEO Milton Steagall said the firm – which grows palm on about 75,000 hectares (185,000 acres) in the northern Amazon states of Pará and Roraima – “only cultivates the plant in the areas permitted by law”.

“Our sustainable palm cultivation recovers areas already degraded by deforestation and contributes to keeping the Amazon rainforest standing,” he said.

Illegally cleared land

BBF, which says it is the biggest palm oil producer in Brazil, makes palm-based biodiesel that fuels a network of power stations in the Amazon region, supplying some 140,000 customers with electricity.

The plan to produce SAF from the same feedstock would be its first foray into a new market that is set to take off in the coming years, as more countries – including Brazil – require their aviation sectors to start using greener fuel – read more about SAF here.

But InfoAmazonia’s investigation suggests that sourcing rising amounts of SAF from crops like palm that are grown in tropical forest countries – from Brazil to Malaysia – poses a threat to rainforests that are vital stores of climate-heating carbon.

InfoAmazonia identified the illegally deforested areas being used by BBF in southern parts of Roraima by analysing data from the Earth Index platform, which draws on artificial intelligence and satellite images to determine land use.

The data was then cross-referenced with maps of embargoed areas produced by the government’s Ibama agency. In April this year, the InfoAmazonia team visited the sites and confirmed the existence of the palm crops.

Their analysis found that a total area of 164 hectares (405 acres) close to São João da Baliza had been embargoed by Ibama, meaning the land cannot be used for agriculture.

While the area – roughly equivalent to 250 soccer pitches – represents a small fraction of BBF’s total plantations, the findings highlight the deforestation risks of large-scale oil palm cultivation in the Amazon.

None of the plots are officially registered in BBF’s name – something that is relatively common in Brazil’s land registry – but when InfoAmazonia visited them, the company’s logo could be seen displayed clearly on the fences of each.

Pictures taken with a drone of one of the areas show a field that appears to have been recently planted with palms cutting into a forested area that stretches toward the horizon. A few tall trees dot the newly planted area.

Asked about InfoAmazonia’s findings, BBF said it had never been informed about the issuance of environmental penalties on any of its land in Roraima.o estratégico e retomada do crescimento sustentável de suas operações na região Norte”.

“(The company) has (completed) the environmental licensing processes with the State Foundation for the Environment and Water Resources (FEMARH) in all of its areas, which are necessary for the sustainable cultivation of oil palm in the state of Roraima,” a BBF spokesperson told InfoAmazonia.

Pasture and bananas make way for palm

Palm oil production in Roraima as a whole rose nearly 40 times between 2019 and 2023, according to data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).

Even when palm is planted only on degraded land, the spread of plantations puts “indirect pressure” on forested areas, said Eder Carvalho, chief inspector at Ibama’s Roraima branch.

“Old pasture is replaced by palm, with forested areas in turn being cleared to make way for new pasture and banana cultivation,” he said, explaining a process often referred to in climate and environmental risk assessments as “indirect land use change”, or ILUC.

It is because of the high risk of ILUC linked to palm oil cultivation – and the related carbon dioxide emitted when forests are destroyed – that virgin palm oil is not permitted as a feedstock for SAF in Europe.

Large plantations of a single crop, a practice called monoculture, cause other environmental problems, too, opponents say, taking a heavy toll on biodiversity, depleting water supplies and often involving substantial use of pesticides and other agrochemicals.

In the Amazon, researchers say monoculture also depletes the so-called flying rivers – moist air currents – that carry rain to other parts of Brazil.

“The forest stores a lot of water in the soil, and the trees have deep roots, which lead to evaporation that cools the air, keeping the temperature low,” said climatologist Carlos Nobre, from the National Institute for Space Research (INPE), one of the first scientists to study flying rivers.

Green fuel of the future?

Environmental campaigners warn that allowing the use of non-waste vegetable oils like virgin palm oil as a feedstock for SAF would both fuel forest loss and harm the global and local climate in big commodity-producing nations with important rainforest ecosystems such as Brazil, Malaysia and Indonesia.

“We can’t go backwards and return to fuels made from plants, like palm,” said Cian Delaney, a campaign coordinator with the Belgium-based Transport & Environment organisation, adding that no agricultural crop should be used in SAF production.

“This is a fundamental point from an environmental point of view. This cannot open space for the expansion of first-generation crops,” he said.

Due to such concerns, the EU and Britain require SAF to be made from waste products such as used cooking oil (UCO), as they began this year to mandate SAF blending into jet fuel as a way to reduce air travel’s hefty carbon emissions.

But a months-long investigation by Climate Home and its partner The Straits Times has uncovered an opaque global supply chain for UCO that exposes jet fuel providers and their aviation clients to fraud risks and raises doubts about the climate benefits of the sector’s main green hope for the years ahead.

The United States takes a more lenient approach on SAF feedstocks, allowing crop-based SAF derived from corn or sugarcane.

‘Saudi Arabia of SAF’

Brazil, which is set to allow non-waste vegetable oils like palm to be used in SAF production, wants to position itself as a major global player in efforts to decarbonise transport – including flying.

Aviation currently accounts for about 2.5% of global carbon emissions.

The government of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has highlighted Brazil’s potential to become a leading producer of feedstocks for SAF, which it has dubbed the “fuel of the future”.

As part of the government’s plans, airlines operating in Brazil will have to meet emissions-cutting targets by using a SAF fuel blend, starting with a 1% emissions reduction in 2027 that will rise to 10% by 2037.

Since BBF unveiled its trailblazing SAF plan, several more such projects have been announced, with tallow – a byproduct of cattle ranching – soy oil and ethanol made from sugarcane among the planned feedstocks. Brazil unveiled $1 billion in public financing last year for SAF projects, and received more than 70 proposals.

Human rights warning

Despite the growing hype around green aviation fuel, BBF’s financial difficulties and the ongoing debt negotiations with creditors have clouded its target to launch SAF production at the 2 billion reais ($390 million) biorefinery this year or in 2026.

Asked whether the refinery was scheduled to launch as planned, the company told InfoAmazonia it “will not be able to comment on new business operations due to the complex debt restructuring process”, adding that BBF aimed to “continue its strategic plan and resume sustainable growth of its operations”.

In its first-quarter report this year, the company told investors it faced “difficulty in obtaining new lines of financing to complete long-term projects”, without directly mentioning the refinery.

The company’s financing troubles began in August 2023, when Brazil’s National Human Rights Council (CNDH) recommended that seven banks – among them state development bank BNDES, state-run Banco do Brasil and Banco da Amazônia – should halt loan deals with the company over suspected violations against Indigenous people and others in Acará and Tomé-Açu in Pará, related to land disputes.

For years, tension between some local communities and BBF has simmered in the Amazon region over land ownership and rights – sometimes erupting into violence. The CNDH’s recommendation to banks came months after state prosecutors sought the arrest of a BBF director and its security chief for offences including torture.

The company denies wrongdoing in the case and says it has “suffered continuous invasions” of its properties in Pará since 2021.

‘No hunting, no fishing’

Back in Roraima, beside a muddy unpaved road outside São João da Baliza, signs reading “Private property” and “Hunting and fishing prohibited” stand in front of a plantation of mature oil palms.

The protected Indigenous Territory (TI) of the WaiWái people lies only about 10 km (six miles) away, but local leader Alexandre Waiwai said community members had no interest in hunting on the palm plantations, preferring to search for animals in the forest beyond.

Standing in his wooden house, the walls decorated with bows and arrows, Waiwai said many people feared that animals grazing on the plantations might ingest agrochemicals – despite BBF’s assurance it does not use them on its palm crops.

“Some animals like boar eat palm fruit. We’re afraid of contamination through the meat we hunt and also our water,” Waiwai said.

Villagers also complain about fires in areas surrounding their territory and smoke billowing out of the chimneys of BBF’s industrial plant. Community health worker Vanilda Waiwai said locals report high levels of respiratory problems.

The challenges facing BBF could hold lessons for other firms hoping to launch SAF projects in Brazil.

Guedes, from the E+ Energy Transition Institute, said Brazilian SAF producers expect human rights to be key parameters for entering international markets, adding that the country’s recently created national SAF programme is likely to take into account rights as well as biodiversity safeguards.

“We know we’ll have to present our credentials on human rights. There’s a concern in general (about human rights impacts) and Brazil is aware of that concern,” he said.

SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”.
Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel.
Meanwhile, the price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is kept artificially low due to wide-ranging tax exemptions.
The US has opted for direct subsidies and tax credits – rather than mandates – to stimulate SAF production.","The world’s appetite for flying keeps on growing, fuelling concerns about how to shrink the carbon footprint of air travel – today the cause of about 2.5% of all energy-related emissions.

While that’s a relatively small share of global emissions, it looks set to increase in the decades to come as other sectors, such as road transport, cut their emissions by switching to electric – still a distant technological prospect for commercial aircraft. Increasing demand for air travel will also play a role.

For the airline industry and many governments across the world, the solution is so-called sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can cut emissions by between 50% and nearly 100%, depending on how it is made, without requiring aircraft modifications.

How is SAF made?

SAF can be made from a variety of raw materials, or feedstocks, using different techniques, but today virtually all of it is made using the Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA) process. This refining technique involves stripping oxygen from the fat molecules of natural oils and fats and replacing it with hydrogen. HEFA fuel has various uses, including in aviation.

Used cooking oil (UCO) is currently the most common feedstock for SAF, especially in Europe where policies promote its use as a recycled waste product that does not compete for land with food production or carry a high risk for deforestation, in contrast to virgin oils derived from soybeans or palm.

Other countries are prioritising feedstocks that can be easily sourced locally, such as soy in the United States or palm oil in Brazil. The two agricultural powerhouses are also expected to produce large quantities of SAF by converting ethanol made from corn or sugarcane – another kind of drop-in fuel known as alcohol-to-jet.

SAF can also be made without crops or organic waste. Synthetic fuels – known as e-SAF or power-to-liquid SAF – are made from two gases: green hydrogen, generated from renewable electricity, and carbon dioxide captured from the atmosphere or industrial processes. E-SAF can reduce emissions by up to 90% compared to fossil fuel-based jet fuels, but it remains prohibitively expensive to manufacture.

How much SAF are airlines using?

SAF accounted for just 0.3% of global jet fuel production in 2024, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which has called the take-up rate “disappointing”. The industry body estimates SAF will reach 0.7% in 2025.

Cost is the main reason for the slow rollout. Currently, SAF is between two and seven times more expensive than traditional jet fuel. That’s primarily down to the limited availability of feedstocks like UCO and challenges in making production more cost-efficient by scaling it up. Meanwhile, the price of fossil fuel-based jet fuel is kept artificially low due to wide-ranging tax exemptions.

Some countries are trying to expand the market for cleaner aviation fuels by offering financial incentives and making SAF use compulsory.

The European Union and the UK introduced the world’s first SAF mandates in January 2025, requiring fuel suppliers to blend at least 2% SAF with conventional kerosene. The blending requirement will gradually increase to reach 32% in the EU and 22% in the UK by 2040.

SAF mandates are also coming into force over the next few years in Singapore and Brazil, and other major aviation hubs such as Japan and China plan to introduce targets.

The US has opted for direct subsidies and tax credits – rather than mandates – to stimulate SAF production.

Will SAF lead to net-zero air travel?

Existing and advanced-stage SAF projects will meet just 2%-4% of jet fuel demand by 2030, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), far short of what is needed to put the sector on track to meet its goal of reaching net zero by 2050.

Airlines have been sounding the alarm about scant supplies and demanding policies to incentivise production. In March, the CEOs of Ryanair, International Airline Group (IAG), Lufthansa and Air France-KLM said the EU’s 6% SAF requirement for 2030 would be impossible to meet because of the high cost and scarcity of the fuel.

Luis Gallego, CEO of IAG, the parent company of British Airways and Iberia, called for an urgent EU aviation strategy “to have SAF at competitive prices”, Reuters reported. Without that, he said, “the only realistic solution is to move the 2030 SAF mandate to the right”.

The EU responded at the time by saying its SAF targets were “realistic and feasible”.

Airlines and fuel producers have also been pressing for more government financial support to expand the production of e-SAF and lower the cost.

Is SAF really a sustainable and climate-friendly solution?

Governments and the International Civil Aviation Organization require certification to prove the sustainability of any given batch of SAF, and the raw materials used to make it.

The world’s leading certification system is the industry-led ISCC (International Sustainability and Carbon Certification), which issues certificates used by EU regulators to prove the origin and sustainability of SAF produced and used in the bloc.

Approved third-party auditors inspect SAF producers and traders of raw materials around the world, and – if standards are met on feedstock origins and carbon savings – they receive the ISCC’s stamp of approval.

But guaranteeing the sustainability of feedstocks throughout complex supply chains is challenging.

In the case of UCO, suppliers at the point of origin such as restaurants and individuals are required to fill out a self-declaration form. The system relies on their honest declaration that their product is actually waste oil, used repeatedly and no longer suitable for cooking.

The ISCC verification system has been criticised by European industry members and national regulators for failing to catch cases of fraud in biodiesel supplies. In 2024, the ISCC conducted 79 “integrity assessments” – around two-thirds targeting Asia-based suppliers – which independently monitored the work of auditors. A third of the analysed cases showed violations of certification requirements, leading to the withdrawal of 11 certificates.

Is SAF making air travel more expensive?

With airlines currently paying a significant premium to add SAF to their airport fuel supplies, some have started to pass the extra cost onto passengers.

Air France-KLM and Lufthansa have added mandatory SAF levies to tickets, with the German flag carrier charging up to 72 euros ($82) per flight depending on the route and fare.

In Singapore, which wants to become a regional SAF hub, travellers flying out of the country will pay a SAF levy from 2026, when all departing flights will be required to carry 1% SAF. Preliminary estimates from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore suggest that economy-class passengers may incur an extra S$3 ($2.30) levy for short-haul flights and S$16 ($12.40) for long-haul flights.

A growing number of airlines also offer customers the option to pay a voluntary SAF charge to help offset the carbon footprint of their journey. British Airways, for example, encourages members of its loyalty programme to make voluntary contributions, enabling them to pay with and earn points.

Low-cost Spanish airline Vueling, also owned by IAG, offers passengers the chance to make a contribution equivalent to the cost of 2% of the total fuel needed to reach their destination to be provided in the form of SAF – a contribution it matches.",https://infoamazonia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DJI_20250413160506_0133_D.jpg,N,,2025-06-18 16:06:11.031177

Backers claim that SAF, when derived from waste products such as used cooking oil (UCO), can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 80%.

This cross-border investigation by Climate Home News, InfoAmazonia and The Straits Times started with the idea to explore whether the EU’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) targets could be met amid supply shortages, whether deforestation and land conflicts appeared linked to the soybean supply chains for European SAFs, and whether there was any potential fraud to be detected in the supply chain for used cooking oil in Southeast Asia, another SAFs feedstock.

Eventually the main part of the story came to focus on the UCO trade between Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest palm oil producer, and Spain, Europe’s largest aviation market and home to one of its SAF pioneers, Repsol. Barely used and virgin palm oil – not permitted under European Union rules because of its links to rainforest loss – is being passed off as UCO, suppliers in Malaysia told journalists.

After being denied access to comprehensive trade data by EU regulators and Repsol, the team was able to piece together the Spanish energy giant’s supply chain in alternative ways: the reporters submitted FOI requests, obtained private commercial trade data and attended UCO collection events in person in Malaysia to reveal for the first time a complete picture of Repsol’s SAF supply. The journalists have been able to trace the full supply chain of Repsol from its new SAF refinery in Cartagena to the Malaysian city of Melaka.

While UCO struggles with fraud allegations in Asia, InfoAmazonia in Brazil uncovered the challenges of resorting to crop-based SAF – allowed in some parts of the world due to the lack of harmonised green standards. The journalists found that the palm oil producer behind a planned biorefinery in the Amazon region - billed as Brazil’s first SAF project - is growing the crop on land areas subject to sanctions by the national environment agency over illegal deforestation, and is struggling financially after rights abuse allegations.

This investigation compiles a global picture of the SAF industry and the obstacles it faces in meeting rising demand with environmental integrity as more countries seek to cut aviation emissions while increasing air travel. Fuel producers will need to address these challenges fast, as they are required to supply airports across Europe with increasing amounts of SAF from this year under new EU and UK rules, with other parts of the world also planning to introduce mandates.

Climate strategy and emissions reduction

FedEx continues to advance its decarbonisation strategy across Scope 1, 2 and selected Scope 3 emissions categories.

In FY24, FedEx achieved a 6.1% year-on-year reduction in Scope 1 emissions, with aviation-related Scope 1 emissions from jet fuel decreasing by 4.9% thanks to efficiency upgrades and fleet modernisation efforts.

The company has achieved a 31% reduction in aviation emissions intensity since 2005 and is targeting a 40% reduction by 2034.

Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity has fallen to 179.50 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent per million USD in revenue, representing a 58% decrease from FY09, even as daily package volumes increased by an average of 121%.

Fuel conservation and aircraft modernisation saved the company approximately 140 million gallons of jet fuel and an estimated US$400m in FY24 alone.

FedEx has committed to procuring 30% of its jet fuel from sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blends by 2030.

“As the world’s preeminent express transportation company, our initial US deployment of this fuel advances our sustainability goals and bolsters the aviation industry’s efforts to source and use more SAF,” says Richard Smith, Chief Operating Officer, International, and CEO, Airline, FedEx.

“While we know further growth of the SAF market is needed, alongside other innovations, we are proud to celebrate this milestone with our world-class air network.”

However, less than 1% of global jet fuel produced in 2024 was SAF, which underlines the challenges ahead.

To offset emissions that cannot be mitigated through technology, FedEx has invested US$100m in the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.

Research includes the development of durable carbon removal methods such as enhanced weathering using basalt, which reduces soil acidity and improves crop yield while sequestering CO₂.

FedEx is also expanding its emissions reporting, including Scope 3 Categories 3, 4 and 6, and has committed to science-based targets pending validation.

While the original goal of a 50% improvement by 2025 is now unlikely to be met due to operational restructuring under Network 2.0, the company is progressing toward full fleet electrification.

More than 8,000 electric vehicles were in service in FY24, including e-cargo bicycles and tricycles in markets such as Canada, the UK and Taiwan.

Following successful pilots, FedEx has ordered 150 Shyft Group Blue Arc trucks with larger capacity to better match operational needs.

The company aims to have 50% of all PUD vehicle purchases be electric by 2025 and 100% by 2030, with the entire PUD fleet – including contracted vehicles – fully electric by 2040.

FedEx is addressing the associated infrastructure needs by installing new EV chargers and working with utilities and regulators to build out grid capacity.

It has supported RMI’s GridUp tool with more than US$2.5m to help utilities forecast grid demand from transport electrification.

“Procuring SAF is an important component of our aviation emissions-reduction strategy in the coming years and we are pleased to have executed a deal with Neste to begin using this fuel in our air operations,” says Karen Blanks Ellis, Chief Sustainability Officer and Vice President of Environmental Affairs, FedEx.

“Our aviation network represents the largest amount of FedEx fuel use globally and, as a result, is our biggest opportunity to drive down emissions.

“As we work toward our goal of carbon-neural operations by 2040, we need the SAF market to continue to grow to meet industry demand.”

Facility energy use accounts for around 6% of FedEx’s total emissions.

FedEx aims to source 100% of its facility electricity from renewable sources by 2040, with interim targets of 500 GWh by 2028 and 1,300 GWh by 2033.

In FY24, it generated more than 31 GWh from solar at 34 global sites and made contracts to install 8 MW of new capacity in FY25.

Total energy intensity declined to 3.19 terajoules per million USD revenue.

A project to replace plastic packaging bags with reusable mesh bags at FedEx Ground hubs saved US$20.4m and prevented 50 million plastic bags from going to landfill.

Dive Brief:

Otto Aviation is investing more than $430 million to establish an advanced manufacturing and production facility at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Monday at the 55th International Paris Air Show.

The project entails upgrading an existing hangar to establish initial operations, building an 850,000-square-foot factory and creating more than 389 jobs with an average salary of $90,388, according to a Florida Commerce press release.

The new facility will also serve as the primary final assembly site for Otto Aviation’s fuel-efficient Phantom 3500 aircraft, with production of its flight test vehicles slated to begin in 2026, according to the aerospace startup’s press release.

Dive Insight:

Otto Aviation aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions with the Phantom 3500, set to enter service around 2030, according to the company’s press release on Tuesday.

The jet’s release date will be two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s goal to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which the International Civil Aviation Organization adopted in 2022. The United Nations agency embraced the target in support of the Paris Agreement's goal tolimit the global average temperature increase to well below 2 degrees Celsius, or 35.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

Otto’s plane has an artificial intelligence-supported clean sheet design and high-speed airflow construction that makes the Phantom 3500 lightweight and burns 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets, according to the press release. The design enables the plane to travel farther on less fuel and reduces emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

“This new facility will become more than a manufacturing site — it’s the launchpad for the future of sustainable aviation,” CEO Paul Touw said in a June 16 statement.

Otto Aviation’s new facility will occupy 80 to 100 acres of land at Cecil Airport, expanding the company’s ability to service the commercial and defense markets while giving it room for potential growth.

The company also plans to move its headquarters from Fort Worth, Texas, to Jacksonville, according to the press release.

Jacksonville’s incentives were a “material factor” in choosing the new plant’s location, according to city council documents. The Jacksonville Aviation Authority approved a $34.9 million incentive package, and the city of Jacksonville approved an up to $20 million tax grant to support the startup’s investment.

Additionally, Florida state officials approved over $430 million in corporate income tax credits and performance incentive grants, the company said in the release.

“Jacksonville stood out as a city that shares our long-term vision: pushing boundaries in aerospace innovation while creating high-quality jobs and meaningful impact,” Touw said in a statement.

Florida is aiming to become “The Aerospace State,” according to a Florida Commerce press release on Tuesday. Last month, DeSantis announced that Boeing supplier Williams International is investing more than $1 billion to establish a gas-powered turbine engine manufacturing site in Okaloosa County.

The Florida governor also signed legislation earlier this week to draw more aerospace companies, according to the state’s Commerce Department. One new law will establish a plan to attract the advanced air mobility sector and increase spending on the state’s spaceports to support industry growth.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/PqjKa3UChN-RinbBO4ZExOuNT8c0-m1XQw5_jqxpSHI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9waGFudG9tLWNsb3Vkcy5wbmc=.webp,N,,2025-06-18 13:08:49.138919

SABA supports and provides momentum to existing airline-company agreements, while driving investment and production of SAF and furthering technological innovation in the field of sustainable aviation.","As part of Deloitte’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions as part of WorldClimate, Deloitte has entered into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) agreements with several US airlines—Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines—which will cover a portion of Deloitte’s business travel. Following pilot transactions with multiple airlines, we began exploring transactions with fuel producers, upstream in the value chain, including Shell Aviation and World Energy, to further demonstrate our commitment to decarbonizing aviation. Through our SAF collaborations to date, we have contracted to avoid the emissions from approximately 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (equivalent to approximately 48,000 passengers flying one way from New York City to Los Angeles).

For more information, the initial SAF agreements between:

Alaska Airlines and Deloitte reduce the life cycle emissions of their business travel by approximately 1,050 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

American Airlines and Deloitte reduce life cycle emissions from aviation by approximately 3,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

Delta Air Lines and Deloitte reduce life cycle emissions from aviation by approximately 1,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide.

JetBlue and Deloitte are part of JetBlue’s “Sustainable Travel Partner” program. Deloitte is an inaugural participant in JetBlue’s program helping business travel customers understand and reduce their business travel emissions to meet their own organization sustainability targets.

Southwest Airlines and Deloitte are supporting and advancing sustainability initiatives within their corporate travel portfolios.

United Airlines and Deloitte are part of United's new Eco-Skies AllianceSM program, the largest SAF program to date. As an inaugural participant, Deloitte will be one of several Eco-Skies Alliance leaders that will work with United to collectively purchase emissions reductions from 3.4 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel this year.

SAF is made from renewable waste materials, such as used cooking oil. Unlike fossil fuels which release additional carbon, SAF recycles CO2 emissions that were emitted previously and subsequently absorbed from the atmosphere during biomass production.1 Sustainable aviation fuel reduces the life cycle carbon emissions from airline fuel by up to 80% when used in pure form, compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, it's compatible with existing airplanes and aviation fueling infrastructure.2

These collaborations are a critical early step for the future of sustainable business travel—uniting the goals of a large business organization seeking to reduce their carbon footprint with US airlines that already use SAF in their daily operations, as well as with fuel producers upstream in the value chain that are shifting towards lower-carbon fuels. The investment in SAF is one way for Deloitte to actually avoid generating carbon emissions within our own value chain, as opposed to solely retroactively purchasing carbon offsets for emissions already generated.

The SAF certificate concept, initially developed by the World Economic Forum's Clean Skies for Tomorrow initiative, sets out to increase sustainable fuel production by aligning ambitious corporate sustainability goals with the aviation industry. Businesses that buy into SAF agreements pay a green premium on this investment in cleaner fuel technologies, as opposed to the initial cost burden being placed on either consumers or producers. Through this agreement, Deloitte takes an important step toward our goal of reducing business travel emissions by 50% per FTE by 2030.

The regular and widespread use of SAF is expected to be pivotal in reducing aviation emissions. That being said, it is a new market solution and not yet available at the scale or price needed to be the primary source of fuel for US airlines. Through these initial SAF agreements, Deloitte is leading efforts to create more market demand for SAF, with the goal of increasing availability and affordability and further SAF development. A cost-effective business model and an increased supply of SAF will allow us to meet our own sustainability goals and help accelerate the transition to lower-carbon air travel. To this end, Deloitte is also one of the founding members of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), launched by RMI and the Environmental Defense Fund. SABA supports and provides momentum to existing airline-company agreements, while driving investment and production of SAF and furthering technological innovation in the field of sustainable aviation.

Businesses have an opportunity to play a key role in addressing climate change by redesigning day-to-day experiences. Regardless of the evolution of hybrid workplaces and the future of business travel, joint initiatives like these help Deloitte continue to serve our clients in a way that reflects our commitment to sustainability.

“This facility will be a game-changer in the infrastructure and economic development for the Pittsburgh region and will present a unique opportunity for airline partners to secure SAF readily and cost-effectively to meet their ambitious decarbonization targets,” Avina said, citing PIT’s “commitment to resiliency and energy innovation initiatives for the aviation industry.”

PIT recently revealed plans to significantly expand its onsite solar array, which powers airport facilities. PIT in 2021 completed a 3-megawatt solar array comprising nearly 10,000 panels.

Hari Ravindran, KBR’s global SVP for technology, said PureSAF “is designed to allow the facility to deliver 100% drop-in fuel made from renewable feedstocks while meeting global specifications for sustainable jet fuel.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-18 12:15:32.198858

JAL joins Maeve to develop hybrid-electric jet

Japan Airlines (JAL), its engineering division JALEC, and Dutch aviation start-up Maeve Aerospace have entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to jointly develop the MAEVE Jet — a hybrid-electric regional aircraft set to reshape short-haul air travel. The collaboration is focused on tailoring the aircraft to meet Japan's regional aviation needs while advancing low-emission technology.

The MAEVE Jet introduces a mission-optimised approach, combining reduced design weights with an innovative systems architecture. Maeve states this configuration will deliver a significant boost in energy efficiency, enabling up to 40% fewer emissions compared to conventional regional aircraft, without relying on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

As part of the partnership, the three companies will exchange updates on the MAEVE Jet's development and assess what is needed for its introduction into Japan's aviation landscape. They will explore the airport infrastructure and operational methods required, and collaborate on establishing the maintenance, monitoring and support systems essential for its smooth day-to-day operation. The alliance will also work on planning the future MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) framework to sustain long-term serviceability of the aircraft. Additionally, JAL's operational experience will help shape a new aircraft design system aimed at strengthening airworthiness and reliability.

This agreement aligns with JAL Group's broader strategy of supporting regional connectivity through innovation and sustainability. By joining forces with Maeve, JAL continues its commitment to fostering next-generation aviation technologies that could redefine regional travel in Japan.

In November 2024, the Scottish Government published its draft Grangemouth Just Transition Plan for consultation. There, we outlined both the historic and critical role that Grangemouth has played in shaping Scotland’s industrial heritage, and the important role we want it to have in shaping our net-zero future. For over a century, the industrial cluster has been a source of high value employment and the output from businesses, driven by dedicated and highly skilled workers, has contributed hugely to Scotland’s economy.

However, the industrial cluster now faces a time of unparalleled change. This has manifested prominently in the cessation of refining at Grangemouth - a facility which has played an important role in maintaining Scotland’s energy security for decades. For many, this has been an uncertain time and nowhere has this been felt more acutely than by those who live and work at Grangemouth.

Beyond the refinery’s closure, many of the challenges outlined in our draft plan, remain the backdrop to operations at Grangemouth, presenting a significant risk to securing a sustainable, low carbon future for the site.

However, the Scottish Government remains steadfast in its commitment to Grangemouth’s future, it’s transition to net-zero and its skilled and dedicated workers. We recognise the imperative for tangible and effective actions now, and have taken decisive steps to maximise our support, as far as possible. This includes;

Our £25 million Grangemouth Just Transition Fund to support industry, the workforce and community throughout this period of transition. This supplements the £7.8 million in our budget for 2025-26, providing the Just Transition Plan with up to £33 million from the Scottish Government immediately, to support delivery this year.

Our initial and ongoing support for Project Willow has rapidly considered and identified a number of alternative developments for the existing Refinery site.

A targeted skills intervention for Petroineos workers facing redundancy at the Grangemouth refinery and Finnart Terminal to support the transition of impacted workers through the job market into in-demand industries.

Signing of the Falkirk and Grangemouth Growth Deal, that includes development of Grangemouth Sustainable Manufacturing Campus, the Greener Grangemouth Programme and a £4m Skills Transition Centre.

£2.8 million this year of a total funding commitment of £5 million to support INEOS’ Grangemouth’s Fuel Switching Net Zero Project, Supporting the business to switch their power source from natural gas to hydrogen, initially supported by the construction of a blue hydrogen plant on site.

However, we cannot do this alone – we rely on a broad range of partners in the public sector, business and the community to work with us to realise Grangemouth’s potential. The UK Government must commit to playing its part and stand by the community and workers at Grangemouth.

We desperately need the UK Government to commence positive changes to existing policy that enable the deployment of future commodities like Sustainable Aviation Fuel production in Scotland.

Key to the successful deployment of the Project Willow technologies is certainty regarding the future of Acorn/ the Scottish Cluster on which we continue to call on the UK Government to confirm a final decision, including a full funding package and timeline.

Project Willow has showcased the scale, complexity and significant effort that will continue to be required across all partners to ensure a long-term future for industrial manufacturing at Grangemouth, that is both climate compatible and commercially viable. But it has also highlighted the clear opportunities there too.

This plan, now finalised following recent revisions and consultation analysis, will act as the framework for all activity that supports Grangemouth’s transition– utilising agreed outcomes that span the interests of community, workers and wider business. Much work lies ahead, for industry, Governments and wider partners across the Grangemouth Future Industry Board, however we can build on the progress made over recent months.

We remain incredibly grateful to each and every person who has provided the ongoing commitment of time and knowledge taken to reach this point.

The time is now for focused action.",https://www.gov.scot/assets/images/logos/SGLogo1200x630.png,N,,2025-06-18 13:09:07.552006

Note to Editors:

Hydrogen has the potential to play a crucial role in decarbonising aviation in the long term, and to bring a revolution in air transport comparable to that of electric vehicles in the automotive sector.

To that aim, Airbus’ ambition is to bring a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft to market. The ZEROe project was launched in 2020 to explore the feasibility of two primary hydrogen propulsion technologies: hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells.

In March 2025, during the Airbus Summit, Airbus announced that it was focusing efforts on a fuel cell fully-electric propulsion system. The results of the fuel cell prototype and powertrain testing, as well as research into complementary technology such as cryogenics, supported the viability of this technology.

More information on the ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Beyond the aircraft technologies, Airbus will continue to foster the emergence of a hydrogen aviation economy and the associated regulatory framework, which are also critical enablers to the advent of hydrogen-powered flight at scale.

MTU Aero Engines has been making continuous good progress with regard to a fuel cell-related revolutionary propulsion system. It has reached some important milestones over the past months: The design for the company’s Flying Fuel Cell has been nailed down, stack manufacturing for the demonstrator has started, the eMoSys electric motor was successfully tested for the first time, and the first test cell went into operation in Munich.

Beyond this, MTU Aero Engines is leading the Clean Aviation technology project HEROPS (Hydrogen-Electric Zero Emission Propulsion System). Launched in early 2024, HEROPS aims to develop innovative technologies for a climate-neutral, hydrogen-powered electric powertrain based on MTU’s Flying Fuel Cell.

Investment Considerations: Risks and Rewards TotalEnergies' strategic moves present compelling opportunities for investors, but risks remain.
- Competition: Rivals like Shell and bp are also expanding SAF capacity, though TotalEnergies' current scale and partnerships give it an edge.","The global push to decarbonize aviation has thrust sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into the spotlight, and TotalEnergies has positioned itself as a front-runner in this critical transition. By leveraging strategic partnerships with aerospace giants and aggressively expanding production capacity, the French energy giant is not only meeting regulatory mandates but also laying the groundwork for long-term market dominance. Here's why investors should take note.

Strategic Partnerships: Building a Decarbonization Ecosystem

TotalEnergies' leadership begins with its ability to align with industry leaders, ensuring its SAF solutions are both technologically viable and commercially scalable. A standout partnership is its 2024 collaboration with Airbus, which commits TotalEnergies to supply over half of Airbus's SAF needs in Europe. This deal isn't just about volume; it includes a joint R&D program to validate high-blend SAF (over 50%) and even 100% SAF formulations. Such collaboration addresses a critical barrier to SAF adoption: proving that existing aircraft systems can safely handle higher blends without costly retrofits.

The company's partnership with Safran since 2021 further underscores its technical prowess. Together, they developed a SAF blend that successfully powered a military helicopter flight in 2023—a milestone demonstrating SAF's feasibility in high-performance aviation. These alliances not only validate TotalEnergies' fuel quality but also integrate it into the core operations of companies shaping the future of air travel.

Capacity Expansion: Scaling Production to Meet Demand

While partnerships secure demand, TotalEnergies' true edge lies in its aggressive expansion of production capacity. The company has invested over €500 million in its Grandpuits Biorefinery, which will produce 230,000 tons of SAF annually by 2026—a significant leap from its current output. This facility, along with others like the La Mède Biorefinery (15,000 tons/year) and the Normandy Refinery (160,000 tons/year by 2025), forms a production network capable of delivering over 500,000 tons annually by 2028. This scale not only exceeds the EU's 2030 mandate of 6% SAF blending but also positions TotalEnergies to supply over 10% of European jet fuel demand with SAF by that date.

The Antwerp Refinery (80,000 tons/year by 2025) and the planned Leuna Refinery (50,000 tons/year by 2026) further solidify its European footprint. Crucially, these expansions utilize coprocessing—a method of blending biomass with conventional feedstocks in existing refineries—thereby reducing capital costs and accelerating timelines.

Supply Contracts and Market Penetration

TotalEnergies' production ambitions are matched by its commercial commitments. Its 10-year deal with Air France-KLM to supply 1.5 million tons of SAF—one of the largest such contracts globally—ensures steady demand.

These partnerships not only secure revenue streams but also build brand credibility as airlines and governments prioritize green credentials.

R&D and Innovation: Addressing Feedstock Challenges

Despite its progress, SAF faces hurdles like limited feedstock availability and high costs. TotalEnergies is tackling these through its Solaize research center, which focuses on sustainable biomass sources such as algae and agricultural waste. By diversifying feedstocks, the company aims to reduce reliance on food-based materials and lower production costs—a critical step for mass adoption.

Investment Considerations: Risks and Rewards

TotalEnergies' strategic moves present compelling opportunities for investors, but risks remain. Key concerns include:

- Feedstock Supply: Competition for sustainable biomass could strain costs.

- Regulatory Shifts: While the EU's mandates are clear, global adoption remains uneven.

- Competition: Rivals like Shell and bp are also expanding SAF capacity, though TotalEnergies' current scale and partnerships give it an edge.

Despite these risks, TotalEnergies' proactive approach has already driven investor confidence. Its stock has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years, reflecting market optimism about its green transition. With a robust pipeline of projects and partnerships, TotalEnergies is well-positioned to capitalize on the $24 billion SAF market expected by 2030, according to industry estimates.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Play on Decarbonization

TotalEnergies' leadership in SAF is not merely about compliance—it's about redefining the energy landscape. By marrying cutting-edge partnerships with scalable production, the company is turning decarbonization from a distant goal into a tangible reality. For investors seeking exposure to the clean energy transition, TotalEnergies offers a compelling mix of growth, diversification, and strategic foresight.

UK’s tighter immigration rules may affect net zero target efforts

A report warns that the recent rule amendments announced in the UK government’s immigration white paper may put the country’s net-zero mission at risk by causing labour shortages. The Labour Party’s white paper released last month includes plans to raise minimum qualifications, and the Centre for European Reform (CER) calculates that more than half – 260,000 out of 465,000 – of the foreign-born workers doing “green jobs” in the UK would not have been allowed into the country based on these new rules. Under the rules of this new visa, the construction industry may become understaffed, which poses challenges to the government’s target of decarbonising buildings and building 1.5M homes by the end of the parliament. Experts state that a lower net migration rate may not only result in labour shortages, but the independent Office for Budget Responsibility may need to downgrade its growth forecast.

Sources predict that U.S.A. may object to green jet fuel recommendation at UN aviation council

Sources state that the U.S.A. is expected to object to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council, as Washington says it unfairly favours Brazilian corn farmers over American producers for the development of green jet fuel. Global carriers that aim for net zero emissions by 2050 are being pressed to make a switch from kerosene to cleaner, but pricier material alternatives such as municipal waste, or cooking oil. Currently, global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) accounts for less than 1% of the industry’s total jet fuel usage, and the International Air Transport Association projects the long-term cost of the aviation sector’s green transition to be $4.7T. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) technical panel made recommendations in March which were objected to by the U.S. State Department, but said recommendation will be under review by the ICAO’s 36-member council before the global agency’s triennial assembly this coming autumn.

📊 Insight: As the need for sustainable development grows, cleaner fuel alternatives should enter expanding markets. However, political interference with certain decisions regarding environmental protection may delay and undermine people’s confidence in sustainable efforts.

BY Erin Voegele

The Senate Finance Committee on June 16 released its draft of the “big, beautiful bill.” The legislation extends the 45Z clean fuel production credit but proposes changes that would cut the value of the credit by 20% for fuels made from imported feedstocks and alter the value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

The existing 45Z tax credit, established by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, provides a tax credit for the production and sale of low-emission transformation fuels. The credit starts at 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). For facilities that satisfy the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the value of the tax credit is up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. The tax credit is currently in place for 2025, 2026 and 2027.

Some 45Z provisions included in the Senate’s reconciliation bill are the same as those included in the House version of the bill, which narrowly passed by a 215 to 214 vote on May 22. Other 45Z provisions differ significantly.

Both version of the bill aim to extend the 45Z credit through the end if 2031; exclude indirect land use change (ILUC) from being used to calculate the lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of eligible fuel; direct the U.S. Treasury Department to establish distinct emissions rates for specific manure feedstocks, including dairy manure, swine manure and poultry manure; and restrict access to the credit for certain prohibited foreign entities.

Both bills also place limits on the use of imported feedstock, albeit in different ways. While the House version of the bill limited availability of the 45Z credit to fuels produced from feedstocks produced or grown in the U.S., Mexico or Canada, the Senate bill takes a different approach. Under the Senate bill, fuel producers can utilize feedstock produced anywhere, but the value of the 45Z credit is reduced by 20% for fuel produced from feedstocks produced or grown outside the U.S., effective Jan. 1, 2026.

Notably, the Senate bill also eliminates the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF. The change would essentially cap the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF. Currently, SAF is eligible for a credit of up to $1.75 per gallon.

The Senate bill also includes language that prohibits the use of negative emissions rates by specifying that the emission rate for eligible transportation fuel under 45Z may not be less than zero.

Both versions of the bill leave the 45Q credit for carbon sequestration largely intact, but repeal various other bioenergy-related tax credits, including the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit, which supports retail availability of E85, B20, and renewable natural gas (RNG); the clean hydrogen production tax credit; and the energy efficient home improvement credit, which, in part, supports the installation of residential wood heating appliances. Both bills also aim to phase out the production tax credit (PTC) and investment tax credit (ITC) for clean electricity.

The Senate has not yet scheduled a vote on its version of the bill, and it is possible the bill could be altered before a vote takes place. Once the Senate is able to pass its version of the bill, it is likely that any differences between the two version of the bill be resolved via conference committee. Both the Senate and House need to pass an identical version of the bill before the legislation can be delivered to President Donald Trump for his consideration.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional fossil-based jet fuel.
Boosting Fossil Fuel Free Aviation Neste is a Finland-based global leader in the production of renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuel.
Global SAF production reached about 1.3 billion liters in 2024 and is projected to increase sharply over the next five years.
Amazon’s expanded use of sustainable aviation fuel marks a pivotal step in its efforts to decarbonize its supply chain.","Amazon is ramping up its net-zero commitment and reducing carbon emissions from its logistics operations by increasing its use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The e-commerce giant just announced it will buy over 9 million liters, or about 7,500 metric tons, of SAF. This will come from Finnish producer Neste.

The fuel will power Amazon Air cargo flights until 2025. This volume will aid cargo operations at two key California airports: San Francisco International and Ontario International.

This move follows Amazon’s previous SAF investments, including more than 6 million liters used in 2023. Since then, the company has been increasing its SAF purchases, aiming to make air freight more sustainable.

What’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel? The Science of Cleaner Jet Fuel

Air freight has a history of high emissions. Amazon’s choice to work with Neste, a top renewable fuel producer, shows how private firms are speeding up climate action in supply chains. And SAF shows a promising solution.

Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. SAF can come from many sources. These include used cooking oils, agricultural waste, municipal solid waste, and woody biomass.

Renewable sources can cut aviation fuel’s lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel. SAF meets aviation standards – it can blend with fossil fuels, so no engine modifications are needed.

Despite these benefits, SAF still represents only a small fraction of total jet fuel consumption worldwide. In 2024, it accounted for just 0.3% of global aviation fuel use, according to estimates from the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

Yet, the push to scale up SAF production is gaining momentum. Amazon’s investment in SAF helps meet its net zero and climate goals. It also supports the wider push to reduce carbon emissions in aviation.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, remarked:

“We are excited to provide SAF to Amazon Air at two major airports in California… This milestone sends a positive signal that SAF is available to airlines and cargo operators, like Amazon Air at these airports.”

RELATED: Gevo and Axens Boost SAF with Innovative Ethanol-to-Jet Technology

The SAF Struggle: Costs, Feedstocks, and Gaps to Fill

High Cost and Supply Gaps. SAF typically costs 2 to 7 times more than fossil jet fuel, creating hurdles for airlines unless long-term commitments and mandates exist.

Feedstock Scarcity. HEFA feedstocks (like used fats and oils) are limited, pushing producers toward agricultural or woody waste—though these bring logistical and certification challenges.Regional Supply-Demand Mismatch. In Asia, production capacity is soon to exceed demand, potentially lowering prices, but without mandates, airlines may lack incentive.

Amazon’s SAF Purchase: Why It Matters?

Amazon’s decision to purchase nearly 10 million liters of SAF in 2025 is important for several reasons. First, it shows that sustainable fuels can be scaled to serve logistics operations, not just commercial passenger flights.

Amazon’s fuel volume is now over three times its 2023 SAF usage. This makes the retail giant one of the top adopters of SAF among large cargo operators.

Second, the deal provides a level of demand certainty for Neste and other SAF producers, encouraging them to expand production capacity and invest in new technologies. Long-term agreements like this help stabilize the growing SAF market.

Also, this deal gives producers the confidence to expand their operations. Thus, major buyers will fund decarbonization efforts, even without global rules.

Third, the emissions impact of this fuel use is notable. SAF has the potential to reduce lifecycle emissions by up to 80%. Based on the 2023 figures, Amazon’s SAF purchases that year helped avoid an estimated 15,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e).

With even more fuel planned for 2025, Amazon’s climate gains could be substantially higher. These cuts help the company keep its promise to The Climate Pledge. Amazon plans to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040.

Using SAF for cargo flights meets rising demands from consumers, investors, and regulators. They expect companies to lower their environmental impact. Amazon’s global growth may lead the way in clean logistics. This investment could inspire other big retailers and logistics firms.

Boosting Fossil Fuel Free Aviation

Neste is a Finland-based global leader in the production of renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuel. Originally an oil refining company, Neste has transformed itself into one of the largest producers of renewable diesel and SAF made from waste and residue raw materials like used cooking oil and animal fats.

The company operates SAF production facilities in Finland, the Netherlands, and the United States. It supplies fuel to airlines, airports, and corporations aiming to reduce their carbon footprint.

Neste’s SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over the lifecycle of the fuel compared to fossil jet fuel. The company plays a key role in helping the aviation industry meet climate targets. It is actively expanding its SAF production capacity to meet rising global demand.

Future Fuel: Where SAF Goes from Here

The outlook for SAF is promising, though challenges remain. Global SAF production reached about 1.3 billion liters in 2024 and is projected to increase sharply over the next five years.

Forecasts suggest SAF annual production could reach between 23 and 30 billion liters—roughly 6 to 8 billion gallons—by 2030. This would be a big step, but it would only meet a small part of global jet fuel demand. So, more policy and industry support are still necessary.

Efforts are also underway to diversify SAF production technologies. Current supplies mainly use HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) from used oils.

Researchers and producers are also working on alternatives. These include alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuels, Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and synthetic e-fuels. The latter uses green hydrogen and carbon capture. These technologies can ease feedstock limits. They also allow for bigger emissions cuts in the long run.

Amazon’s SAF Bet Sets the Pace

In the meantime, corporate buyers like Amazon play a critical role in demonstrating market demand and driving investment. Using SAF widely and building strong supply chains can help companies lower the environmental impact of air travel.

Amazon’s expanded use of sustainable aviation fuel marks a pivotal step in its efforts to decarbonize its supply chain. By securing more than 9 million liters of SAF for 2025, the company is not only reducing emissions from its cargo flights but also helping the aviation sector move closer to net zero.

As policies tighten and global demand for low-carbon logistics increases, Amazon’s leadership in adopting SAF could influence competitors and partners to follow suit. While the journey to net-zero aviation is far from complete, initiatives like this one from Amazon show that meaningful progress is underway.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/shutterstock_1076484365.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 20:02:40.660386

While some short-haul flights can be replaced with high-speed rail and could possibly be electrified in the future, most of the emissions reductions needed from aviation through midcentury will have to be achieved through alternative liquid fuels—also known as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—or compensated for through carbon dioxide removal.

Not all alternatives to petroleum jet fuel reduce the environmental impact of air travel, and they often have unwanted side effects. For example, diverting soybeans and corn from food and feed markets to make fuel—currently the leading approaches to producing alternative jet fuel in the United States—harms consumers by driving up food prices (Malins 2023) and leads to deforestation, biodiversity loss, and emissions from land-use change.

Federal and state support for alternatives to petroleum jet fuel should focus on approaches that avoid the conflict between food and fuel production by using waste biomass, carbon captured from the atmosphere, and clean hydrogen as feedstocks for SAF. Technologies such as biomass gasification, Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis, and electrofuels (e-fuels) made from clean hydrogen and captured carbon dioxide are nascent but have the potential to produce truly sustainable aviation fuel (Energy Institute 2024; Ringle 2024; Twelve n.d.).

Europe a leader on e-kerosene announcements, laggard on implementation

A new T&E study shows that Europe can be a leader in e-kerosene (also called e-SAF), housing more than half of the world’s announced production capacity. Around 40 large-scale projects [1] are planned in Europe, with a potential e-kerosene production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes (Mt) per year — roughly 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

Europe’s early lead in the e-kerosene market has been driven by the EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels, ReFuelEU, which set specific targets for using e-fuels in aviation. If all the announced projects were built, the EU could meet these targets — but none of the large-scale plants identified in this report are even under construction. Only four are at an advanced stage [2], and none have reached a final investment decision (FID). This slow progress is due to an array of challenges, with financing posing the biggest barrier, and traditional fuel suppliers being notably absent from the conversation.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said: “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe — but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

With a potential to cut CO₂ emissions by more than 90% compared to fossil kerosene, e-kerosene is key to decarbonising aviation, an emission-intensive industry that is projected to keep on growing [3]. As representatives of the industry gather at the International Paris Air Show today, an event showcasing the growth, prowess and latest innovations in aviation, the study’s findings highlight that despite progress, the path to significantly reducing aviation emissions through truly sustainable solutions remains long and complex.

While Europe is currently the leader for e-kerosene [4], other markets are creeping up. China is the second-largest hub – around 10 large-scale projects have been announced here, representing around 20% of global capacity. The United States is also picking up the pace, with the largest e-kerosene offtake agreement to date secured by a US-based startup, and one of the world’s first FIDs for a large-scale e-kerosene plant secured in May by Infinium, another US-based startup [5].

Funding bottlenecks and oil majors are hampering progress

Despite favourable conditions, e-kerosene projects continue to face significant hurdles in Europe, including challenges related to energy costs, infrastructure, and CO₂ sourcing. Regulatory uncertainty is also in the mix, brought about by industry pressure [6] to delay ReFuelEU’s SAF targets in anticipation of the scheduled review of the legislation in 2027

Financing poses the biggest barrier, with each plant requiring €1–2 billion in capital, bringing total capital requirements to €10 – 20 billion by 2030. EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground, and traditional fuel suppliers are notably absent from the conversation. To date, major oil companies have made negligible contributions to e-kerosene, while continuing to spend billions on fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Camile Mutrelle acknowledged. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed. Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs. The upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan is a chance to set the right flight path by prioritising e-SAF, providing a comprehensive mechanism to address the challenges EU projects face.”

T&E urges EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets, especially in the run-up to the legislation’s scheduled review, and prioritise e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). It also calls for a European market intermediary using a double-sided auction mechanism to be established to address the current issues around financing.

Otto says the Phantom 3500 will burn 60% less fuel than similar-sized jets, reducing emissions by 90% when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

The aviation industry’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” Touw said at a press briefing at the International Paris Air Show in France. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

Otto also offered details about suppliers for the plane, which will be assembled in at Craig Airport in West Jacksonville. The company also will move its headquarters there from Texas.

The jet’s twin FJ44 engines will be made by Pontiac, Michigan-based Williams International.

In May, Williams announced a $1 billion plan to build jet engines in Crestview in Okaloosa County about 320 miles west of Craig Airport. A manufacturing facility will be built in three phases in the Shoal River Industrial Park.

In 2022, the state of Florida awarded $3.2 million through the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund to expand manufacturing in Okaloosa County.

“Williams International’s investment in the Florida Panhandle will create more than 330 jobs, and is a success story of the Florida Job Growth Grant Fund in Northwest Florida,” Gov. Ron Desantis said in a May news release announcing the deal.

Williams’ first 250,000-square-foot facility is planned for completion in late 2026. The second phase is planned for completion in 2028 and the final phase by 2035/36.

Williams also has plants in Pontiac and Ogden, Utah.

Another Otto supplier is Italian aerospace company Leonardo, which will make the jet’s carbon fiber fuselage at its plant in Grottaglie in southern Italy.

Flying Magazine reported that Otto is also working with Mecaer Aviation, an international provider of aircraft solutions headquartered in Borgomanero, Italy.

The Phantom 3500 will carry nine passengers and use digital displays instead of windows to reduce drag, using laminar flow to boost efficiency.

Otto said it can sell 1,600 aircraft over the 2030-2040 period with around one-third of that total “already spoken for.”

Otto will begin operations at Craig Aiport in Hangar 825, which was vacated by The Boeing Corp.

Otto plans to begin flight tests by early 2027 and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

Flying Magazine said Otto plans to conduct about three years of flight testing using four production-conforming aircraft and plans to complete a preliminary design review by October.

Aviation International News reported that Otto has raised more than $170 million to date and is expected to close on another round of funding by year-end.

“Right now, the aircraft is at a stage where our design is mostly locked down,” he said, noting that the parts for flight-test vehicle one will arrive in Hangar 825 next year in preparation for assembly.

Flying Magazine said Touw estimated the program will cost $1 billion, with half going toward aircraft development and the rest supporting construction of a final assembly line.",https://media.yourobserver.com/img/photos/2025/06/17/otto_aviation_t1100_r1080x720.jpg?a5a8e335434cfe3a93dc299de6ea435221e0bf0d,N,,2025-06-17 15:10:15.205222

At 1pm on Saturday (14 June), as part of King Charles’ birthday celebrations, over 30 Royal Air Force (RAF) planes flew over Buckingham Palace in a ceremonial flypast.

As every year, the grand finale featured a dramatic aerial display by the pilots of the RAF aerobatic team flying the Red Arrows.

But unlike previous years, the nine Red Arrows’ BAE Systems Hawk fast-jets were powered by a high-ratio blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) biofuel used to produce the trademark red, white and blue vapour trails.

According to the RAF, using these renewable fuels is a “world-first” and the result of many trials by its engineers and logisticians.

Squadron leader Andy King, the Red Arrows’ senior engineering officer, who led the pioneering fuels project, said: “The vibrant vapour trails that we generate is what sets the Red Arrows apart and so to be the first aerobatic team in the world to move to a fully sustainable option is really exciting.”

Made from sustainable sources, including materials such as household waste or used cooking oil, SAF is considered a major tool in helping to lower climate change emissions from air travel – widely regarded as one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise.

SAF can be used in existing aircraft, and it emits on average 70% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than using fossil jet fuel on a life-cycle basis.

HVO is a type of renewable diesel made of 100% renewable raw materials, with a chemical structure almost identical to the regular diesel traditionally used by the aerobatic team for its vapour trails.

Compared with standard diesel, HVO emits up to 90% fewer emissions across its life span.

To switch the nine Hawks to greener fuels took the RAF less than six months and was done entirely using existing resources and staff.

A successful trial flight took place earlier in the year.

King said: “The beauty of these alternative fuels is how easily they can be used and with little additional work.”

Before Saturday’s flypast, the aircraft were topped up at the team’s home base of RAF Waddington, Lincolnshire, as they headed to London.

The RAF has said it will continue to work with alternative fuels to power its aircraft. The aim is not not only reduce carbon emissions but also to help lessen reliance on global fossil fuel supply chains.

Air Vice-Marshal Shaun Harris, the RAF’s director support, said: “Importantly, this technology has the potential to increase our resilience and protect our operational outputs in a more volatile world, with no loss of performance.

“As the Red Arrows have shown, the RAF is adapting to ensure we can continue to fly and fight globally, using any fuel source, as these alternative supplies become more common.”

A recent study found that emissions from European airlines have soared to pre-Covid-19 levels .

On 1 January 2025, the UK’s SAF mandate came into force, which requires the flight sector to supplant 2% of its jet fuel demand with SAF in flights taking off from the UK from 2025. This will grow year-on-year to 10% by 2030 and 22% by 2040.

To support green aviation fuel producers, in May 2025 the Department for Transport announced a revenue certainty scheme and an additional £400,000 in funding.

While the government wants the UK to be a global hub for SAF production, there is concern about where the feedstocks for this production will come from. In 2023, a study by the Royal Society found that the transition to SAF would require the use of 50% of the UK's agricultural land.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-06/web-Red-Arrrows-%C2%A9-Crown-Copyright-CRN-OFFICIAL-20250614-0704-051.jpg?itok=pIMVKFs_,N,,2025-06-17 16:10:53.079502

by Allison Lampert and Oliver Griffin (Reuters) Global aviation sector strives for net zero emissions by 2050; Sustainable aviation fuel made from ethanol seen as one option; Brazil ethanol producers fear US interference in UN's SAF rules -- The U.S. is expected to object this month to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council that Washington says unfairly favors Brazilian corn farmers at the expense of U.S. producers in development of green jet fuel, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

One of the sources said the discussions could be resolved by a compromise. Still, Brazil's corn ethanol producers have warned that the disagreement could undermine global confidence in certification of sustainable aviation fuels.

Global carriers, aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, are being pressed to swap kerosene for cleaner but costly alternatives made from materials such as municipal waste or cooking oil.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the long-term cost of the aviation sector's green transition at $4.7 trillion.

Global SAF now accounts for less than 1% of industry’s total jet fuel usage. But products that can make fuel with lower emissions should find growing markets due to European quotas at airports, tax incentives and global targets.

With U.S. corn production outpacing domestic demand, farmers and ethanol producers in the Midwest have said they are trying to lower the emissions involved in producing and marketing corn ethanol for new markets like green jet fuel. For instance, some U.S. ethanol producers have suggested using carbon capture technology.

The Iowa Corn Growers Association, which supports carbon capture and sequestration projects to lower emissions, has said Brazil already has a lower carbon score for corn ethanol than the U.S., which would give the South American country an advantage in meeting demand from airlines.

The U.S. State Department raised objections in March, opens new tab to a recommendation from an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical panel, which has proposed criteria for SAF. The U.S. argued that the recommendation unfairly helps Brazil over the rest of the world as it would award a lower carbon score to multicropping, or farming when two or more crops like corn and soy are grown on the same land, a common practice in the South American nation.",https://advancedbiofuelsusa.info/assets/images/Advanced-Biofuels-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 16:11:10.979431

MONTREAL/SAO PAULO (Rtrs) -The U.S. is expected to object this month to a recommendation at the UN aviation agency council that Washington says unfairly favors Brazilian corn farmers at the expense of U.S. producers in development of green jet fuel, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

One of the sources said the discussions could be resolved by a compromise. Still, Brazil’s corn ethanol producers have warned that the disagreement could undermine global confidence in certification of sustainable aviation fuels.

Global carriers, aiming for net zero emissions by 2050, are being pressed to swap kerosene for cleaner but costly alternatives made from materials such as municipal waste or cooking oil.

The International Air Transport Association estimates the long-term cost of the aviation sector’s green transition at $4.7 trillion.

Global SAF now accounts for less than 1% of industry’s total jet fuel usage. But products that can make fuel with lower emissions should find growing markets due to European quotas at airports, tax incentives and global targets.

With U.S. corn production outpacing domestic demand, farmers and ethanol producers in the Midwest have said they are trying to lower the emissions involved in producing and marketing corn ethanol for new markets like green jet fuel. For instance, some U.S. ethanol producers have suggested using carbon capture technology.

The Iowa Growers Association, which supports carbon capture and sequestration projects to lower emissions, has said Brazil already has a lower carbon score for corn ethanol than the U.S., which would give the South American country an advantage in meeting demand from airlines.

The U.S. State Department raised objections in March to a recommendation from an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) technical panel, which has proposed criteria for SAF. The U.S. argued that the recommendation unfairly helps Brazil over the rest of the world as it would award a lower carbon score to multicropping, or farming when two or more crops like corn and soy are grown on the same land, a common practice in the South American nation.

The recommendation is coming to ICAO’s 36-member council for review ahead of the global agency’s triennial assembly this fall. ICAO cannot impose rules on member states, but countries that approve the agency’s standards and guidance usually abide by them.

The U.S. State Department declined comment. Brazil’s agricultural ministry acknowledged it received questions from Reuters but did not respond further. Montreal-based ICAO was not immediately available for comment.

In Brazil, where annual corn ethanol output is forecast to almost double to around 16 billion litres by 2032, the producers’ association UNEM told Reuters that recommendations from ICAO’s Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) should be free from politics.

""Any attempt at political interference would undermine not only the decision-making process, but also the international community’s confidence in the sustainable aviation fuels certification system,"" said Bruno Alves, director of institutional relations and sustainability at UNEM.

""UNEM believes it is essential that this technical and transparent process be respected and preserved.

At the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, though, a U.S. startup committed to achieve carbon neutrality two decades earlier—without the help of electric or hybrid-electric engines.

Otto Aviation believes its “ultra-low-drag” Phantom 3500, which it says will reduce emissions by 90 percent versus traditional jets through the use of sustainable aviation fuel, could shift the sustainability paradigm. The 3500’s breakthrough is a laminar flow architecture, which Otto says has been tested and proven to cut drag by 35 percent—and fuel burn by nearly 60 percent—compared to similarly sized conventional aircraft. It will be propelled by a pair of gas- or SAF-powered Williams International FJ44 engines.

“The basic energy storage system for an electric aircraft is about 24 to 27 times heavier for the same energy stored as Jet-A fuel,” Otto CEO Paul Touw told FLYING in Paris. “Everyone designing airplanes knows weight matters a lot. Therefore, electric energy storage systems are vastly too heavy to effectively fly anything beyond approximately 200 nm. Turbofan aircraft can fly 8,000 to 9,000 nm—something electric aircraft will likely never achieve.”

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Monday revealed Otto will relocate from Fort Worth, Texas, to Jacksonville, Florida, where it will set up a manufacturing plant at Cecil Airport (KVQQ) to produce the super-midsize business jet. The company will invest about $430 million into the move, which is also backed by a $35 million incentive package and $20 million grant. Maiden flight is planned for 2027, with certification and entry into service expected around 2030.

“By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation,” Touw told reporters. “It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

A Decade in the Making

Otto has refined its laminar flow for more than a decade. In 2017, it began flight testing with a demonstrator, the Celera 500, designed specifically with that architecture in mind. The Celera was built with a streamlined fuselage and smooth surfaces, with few external rivets or panel gaps on the entire airframe—not just the wing. That uniformity makes airflow less turbulent.

“The technology to understand laminar-to-turbulent flow transition didn’t exist…until the last five years,” Touw told FLYING. “Everyone was comfortable with turbulent-flow aircraft, and no one was willing to take the risk and dive into the laminar-flow world until we came around. Plus, advanced manufacturing capabilities have improved significantly, allowing for extremely precise, high-tolerance production methods.”

Over three years, Celera racked up north of 100 hours across more than 50 test flights in real-world conditions. Beyond the drag reduction, it proved an 80 percent reduction in operating costs versus traditional models and “near-jet speeds at a fraction of the fuel burn,” per Otto. Wind tunnel testing in 2024 further proved those benefits, which Touw told FlightGlobal “surprised even us.”

With laminar flow refined on Celera, Otto transitioned the technology to the Phantom 3500, which it claims will reach transonic speeds beyond 260 knots. But with reduced fuel burn, it aims to do so for about 43 percent less than the hourly cost of burning Jet A on a super-mid. Lightweight and low burn means Otto will use fewer materials to build the model, which can lower manufacturing costs. Touw said the company aims to churn out about 1,600 Phantoms annually after the model enters service but was tight-lipped about the number of firm orders.

The 3500’s estimated maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of 19,000 pounds places it toward the upper limit of the FAA’s Part 23, under which Otto intends to certify it. That process is typically reserved for lighter jets with shorter range and is uncommon for a business jet. But Otto claims the Phantom’s 3,500 nm range beats aircraft with a similar MTOW, due to its fuel efficiency. Its range and performance are intended to match that of the Bombardier Challenger 3500 or Embraer Praetor 500, but with half the MTOW.

The Phantom’s balanced field length, less than 3,500 feet, opens up operations at twice as many airports, the company says. And with greater range and efficiency, it will require fewer stops. Its cruising altitude of 51,000 feet will help avoid turbulence caused by inclement weather, further cutting drag and fuel burn.

Otto also claims the Phantom’s 800-cubic-foot cabin will be twice the size of a conventional jet, with its 6-foot, 5-inch height allowing as many as nine passengers to stand comfortably. Porthole-style windows—removed to smooth out the airframe—are replaced by high-definition displays that give a view of the sky and scenery below.

Prior to Part 23 authorization, Otto plans to conduct about three years of flight testing using four production-conforming aircraft. It is working with suppliers—including Leonardo and Mecaer Aviation—to complete a preliminary design review by October. The company is also working toward a Series B raise to fund production.

Touw has estimated the program will cost $1 billion, with half going toward aircraft development and the rest supporting construction of a final assembly line.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/Screenshot-2025-06-17-124131.png,N,,2025-06-17 12:18:08.371983

On June 14, 2025, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz approved an omnibus tax bill that increases the state’s cannabis tax rate. The bill makes numerous corporate franchise and personal income tax changes including new income tax subtractions, changes to the alternative minimum tax, changes to treatment of certain retirement benefits, and changes to the sustainable aviation fuels, education, film production, research, renter’s, short line, and the homestead credit refund. The bill makes a number of sales and use tax changes to provisions relating to payments of tax by large vendors, changes to the qualified data center and sustainable aviation fuels exemptions, the definition of “certified service provider,” and the location of sales. The bill allows a brewer qualifying for the brewer tax credit to file its alcohol excise tax annually; and also makes changes to the provider tax research credit rate and pharmacy refund. The bill makes a number of changes to the state’s property taxes, including the exemptions for institutions of public charity, property used to distribute electricity to farmers, property owned by certain Indian tribes. The bill also enacts changes to the property tax treatment of low-income rental properties, agricultural property, class 1 property, affordable housing, utility cooperatives, the Sustainable Forest Incentive Act, and certain penalties relating to certificates of rent paid. Finally, the bill makes several changes to the insurance premium tax and the estate tax. ( L. 2025, H9 (S.S.), effective as stated.)

Individual income and corporate franchise tax provisions.

The bill makes a number of amendments to the state’s individual income and corporate franchise tax law. Among the changes made are the following:

New income tax subtractions: Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the bill creates new income tax subtractions for coerced debt, certain consumer enforcement public compensation payments, and for foreign service pensions. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, the bill creates a new income tax subtraction for student loan payments made by critical access dental clinics. Effective June 15, 2025, the bill creates an income tax subtraction for stipend payments that were included in a collective bargaining agreement between the state of Minnesota and SEIU Healthcare Minnesota and Iowa. The bill excludes stipends for the income measures used to calculate the renter’s credit, homestead credit refund, and alternative minimum tax. The bill specifies that stipend payments must not be considered income, assets, or personal property for the purposes of determining eligibility for child care assistance, general assistance, housing support, the Minnesota Family Investment Program, other economic assistance programs, or certain health care programs.

Temporary additions and subtractions: Effective retroactively at the same time the provisions adopted in the 2023 conformity bill were effective for federal purposes, the bill amends the temporary provisions of the 2023 conformity law relating to individuals, estates and trusts to clarify that “net income” includes the delayed business interest addition for composite and pass-through entity filers.

Alternative minimum tax: Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024, the bill specifies that the income tax subtractions enacted by the bill also reduce alternative minimum taxable income for the Minnesota alternative minimum tax.

Correction of errors for certain retirement contributions: Effective retroactively for contributions made in calendar year 2023 and designated to apply to the tax year 2022 contribution limitation, an annuity contract provider must designate certain IRA contributions to the tax year prior to the year the contribution is made, provided that the contribution is timely made under federal law and notice is provided to the provider within three years of the taxpayer’s return filing deadline.

Retirement benefits: Effective June 15, 2025, the bill clarifies that the public pension subtraction for “basic” pension plans applies to pensions earned based on service for which the member or survivor did not earn Social Security benefits.

Political contribution refund program: Effective for contributions made on or after December 31, 2026, the bill makes a number of amendments to the law governing the processing of political refund contribution claims, to reflect the electronic filing system required by the bill.

Refund claims must be submitted using the electronic filing system and must reflect a minimum $10 claim amount.

Sales tax changes.

The bill makes a number of amendments to the state’s sales and use tax laws. Among the changes are:

Large vendors: Effective for taxes remitted after May 31, 2027, vendors with $250,000 or more of annual sales tax liability must remit 5.6% of their June liability two business days before June 30.

The Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, for example, aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by the year 2030.
As a result, there’s increasing scrutiny about making global freight operations greener.
This initiative reflects a broader push within the industry to reduce emissions both in the skies and on the ground.
A sustainable transition By combining smarter packaging, transitioning to SAF, and investing in renewable energy for ground operations, a future where airfreight supports global commerce efficiently and sustainably seems to be underway.","AS the industry faces increasing pressure to reduce its environmental impact, Finnair’s green initiatives blend pragmatic innovation, cross-sector collaboration, and a forward-thinking approach that addresses both waste reduction and decarbonisation.

Anna-Maria Kirchner, Finnair’s Head of Global Cargo Sales and Sustainability, explained, “For starters, one of our main focuses is reducing packaging waste, which is often overlooked but has a real impact on the overall sustainability of air cargo. For example, we’re testing reusable pallets that weigh less than traditional wooden ones. By switching to those, we reduce weight, which translates directly to lower fuel consumption and in turn, lower emissions.”

Besides their packaging practices, the airline is also transitioning to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). These fuels are usually derived from renewable sources such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste, and can cut lifecycle emissions by up to 80 percent, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

While European carriers have been early adopters, the US has also begun scaling its SAF ambitions in the past few years. The Biden administration’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge, for example, aims to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF annually by the year 2030.

Finnair has also actively participated in partnerships focused on sustainability in cargo logistics. These alliances promote knowledge sharing, joint innovation projects, and coordinated efforts to help reduce carbon footprints throughout supply chains.

“Collaboration is key,” Kirchner said. “We can’t simply tackle these challenges by ourselves. When we work together, sharing data and innovations, we help accelerate progress.”

Airfreight is responsible for about three percent of worldwide CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). That said, emissions are growing rapidly due to e-commerce expansion and ever-increasing global trade. As a result, there’s increasing scrutiny about making global freight operations greener.

At the conference, Kirchner emphasised the airline’s holistic approach. “Sustainability is not a single fix; rather, it’s the sum of applying many small improvements across our processes,” she said. “From lighter packaging materials to cleaner fuels and better collaboration, it’s all part of the big picture.”

A path to sustainable aviation?

While Finnair and other European carriers have taken massive strides in regard to sustainability, adoption around the rest of the world is a little more fluid. The United States, for instance, has shown varying degrees of commitment and hesitation when it comes to sustainable aviation practices.

On one hand, as noted earlier, the US Department of Energy has launched the SAF Grand Challenge, and in light of that initiative, private companies have ramped up production. For example, Infinium is developing a Texas facility backed by Amazon and Breakthrough Energy to create electrofuels using renewable power and waste carbon dioxide.

However, SAF in the US still costs roughly two to three times more than conventional jet fuel, thus limiting more widespread use. Binding SAF blending mandates like the EU’s ReFuelEU initiative—which requires two percent SAF by 2025 and 70 percent by 2050—make for a broader and faster push to adopt newer fuel sources. Instead, airlines in the US rely on incentives such as the Blender’s Tax Credit, which was introduced under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Solar-powered

In addition to its in-flight efforts, Finnair also addresses its emissions when it comes to ground operations. The airline has installed solar panels at its Helsinki cargo terminal, a move that powers parts of its facility with clean energy and helps reduce dependency on fossil fuels for ground support equipment.

This initiative reflects a broader push within the industry to reduce emissions both in the skies and on the ground. These panels are expected to cut tons of CO2 annually by offsetting grid electricity consumption.

A sustainable transition

By combining smarter packaging, transitioning to SAF, and investing in renewable energy for ground operations, a future where airfreight supports global commerce efficiently and sustainably seems to be underway.

The agreement forms part of Amazon’s efforts to achieve its goal to reach net zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040. The company’s aviation-focused initiatives include sourcing lower-carbon aviation fuels and using SAF credits to reduce its airfreight emissions. The company is a founding member of the Sustainable Aviation Buyers Alliance (SABA), and played a role in the Sustainable Aviation Fuel certificates (SAFc) Registry, aimed at enhancing transparency to SAF emissions reduction claims and accelerating SAF deployment.

Carl Nyberg, Senior Vice President, Commercial, Renewable Products at Neste, said:

“We are excited to provide SAF to Amazon Air at two major airports in California. This milestone sends a positive signal that SAF is available to airlines and cargo operators, like Amazon Air at these airports. Our supply chain solution for these California gateways builds on our existing SAF supply capabilities on the West Coast in the U.S., and leverages our partnership with Diesel Direct to transport SAF by trucks running on renewable diesel.

At the Paris Air Show on Monday, the stakeholders, brought together under the 75-member Project SkyPower coalition, sent an open letter to EU member state governments asking them to fund an eSAF pilot auction via H2Global. The push comes ahead of the first European eSAF mandates taking effect in Germany (2026), the UK (2028) and the EU (2030).

Electro-sustainable aviation fuel, which is also known as power-to-liquid (PtL), is a low-emissions kerosene replacement that can be synthetically manufactured from water, carbon dioxide and renewable electricity, creating a virtually unlimited supply.

However, eSAF production is caught in a chicken-and-egg dilemma in which eSAF producers need long-term contracts, but most airlines cannot afford to tie themselves into long-term contracts at today’s prices, which are up to 10 times the cost of traditional kerosene.

To date, no EU commercial-scale eSAF projects have reached final investment decision and only a third of the mandated supply is on track to be available by 2030.

With European Commission input, Project SkyPower developed a double-sided auction mechanism to help kickstart the EU eSAF market. This model, which has already been used by H2Global in the green ammonia sector, would match the lowest cost producers and highest offtake bids, and the government funding would be used to bridge any price differential.

“This intermediary would act like a government-backed commodity trader, purchasing e-SAF in long-term contracts to provide revenue certainty to producers and selling in short-term contracts,” Project SkyPower said, noting its plans to continue working with the EU on the model.

The signatories included Airlines for Europe (A4E), Air France-KLM, Boeing, Copenhagen Airports, easyJet and SAS, plus a number of eSAF suppliers and financiers.

During a separate Paris Air Show briefing, executives from Air France-KLM and Airbus also called on the EU to extend EU emissions trading system SAF allowances and consider introduction of a formalized book-and-claim system. Under book-and-claim, companies can buy SAF for use elsewhere, when there is no local supply.

The EU is developing the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP), which is expected to be finalized in Q3. Aviation stakeholders are pushing for SAF and eSAF to be included in the STIP.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-17 12:18:40.435713

This deal contributes to secure the feedstock to produce biodiesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

From the collection of used cooking oil to the production of biofuels in France

Under the terms of the agreement, Quatra will collect used cooking oil directly from restaurants, restaurant chains and industry in France and the rest of Europe. The oil will then be delivered to Quatra sites for filtering before being shipped to TotalEnergies’ biorefineries to produce road biofuels and SAF.

TotalEnergies has converted its refineries at La Mède in the south of France and Grandpuits near Paris into biorefineries.

La Mède: The biorefinery at La Mède, launched in 2019, has an annual production capacity of 500,000 tons of biofuel. Through this site, TotalEnergies is the only producer of HVO biodiesel in France. This year, La Mède will also produce sustainable aviation fuel for airports in the south of France.

Grandpuits: the site’s conversion into a zero-crude complex includes a biorefinery with an annual production capacity of 230,000 tons of sustainable aviation fuel. Commissioning is planned for 2026. TotalEnergies has partnered with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and reuse of organic waste in the form of sustainable products, which will supply most of the site’s feedstock.

“I am delighted with this strategic agreement with Quatra that contributes to our aim to secure the feedstock we need to produce biofuels in our biorefineries. The development of biofuels is one of our Company’s strategic goals. By directly reducing the carbon intensity of the energy products used by our customers, we are actively working with them as part of our net zero approach, together with society,” said Valérie Goff, Senior Vice President, Renewable Fuels & Chemicals at TotalEnergies.

“At Quatra, we believe in long-term partnerships with leading industrial groups that combine logistics, environmental responsibility and financial viability. The deal between Quatra France and TotalEnergies is an excellent example of that. By supplying locally collected used cooking oil, we are contributing to a sustainable value chain. That allows us to focus on our core business, which is the efficient collection of used cooking oil across France, allowing TotalEnergies to turn that valuable resource into biofuel,” stated Pol Van Pollaert, Co-CEO, Quatra.

This agreement makes Amazon the first company to purchase and use sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) at Ontario International Airport, ranked among the top 10 cargo airports in the U.S.*

Amazon has made an ambitious commitment to reach net-zero carbon emissions across its global operations by 2040, and adopting SAF is a key lever to decarbonize its air cargo operations. The agreement to use SAF in California is part of a broader cooperation between Amazon and Neste that started four years ago when Neste delivered SAF to Amazon at Cologne Bonn airport in 2021.

Neste’s SAF is blended with conventional jet fuel and supplied to the Amazon Air network at both airports. The first volumes were successfully delivered earlier this year. Leveraging Neste's SAF supply capabilities established in Northern California in 2020, the fuel is delivered directly to San Francisco International Airport via existing pipeline infrastructure. For Amazon Air’s operation at Ontario International Airport, the SAF is delivered to the airport by trucks from Neste’s SAF terminal facilities in Los Angeles by Diesel Direct, Neste’s long-term partner. Diesel Direct uses Neste’s renewable diesel to fuel trucks dedicated to the SAF deliveries to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from SAF transportation.

“We are excited to provide SAF to Amazon Air at two major airports in California.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel. Sustainable aviation fuel is a renewable aviation fuel providing a more sustainable alternative to conventional, fossil-based jet fuel. Using Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel™ reduces greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%** over the fuel’s life cycle, compared to using conventional jet fuel. Neste’s SAF is made from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste. SAF is certified for commercial use and can currently be blended up to 50% with conventional jet fuel before use. It works seamlessly with existing aircraft engines and fueling infrastructure. Today, Neste’s global SAF production capability is 1.5 million tons (around 515 million gallons) per annum, and it is set to grow to 2.2 million tons (around 750 million gallons) in 2027.

That this House has considered hydrogen powered aviation.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I will start by thanking everyone who has come this morning to participate in this debate. This subject sits at the crossroads of three major challenges facing our country today: our climate ambitions, our pursuit of technological innovation and our desire to kickstart domestic industry.

As the Member of Parliament for North Somerset, my constituency is certainly no stranger to the aerospace industry. Since the pandemic, Bristol airport has emerged as one of the UK’s fastest-growing airports, now serving 10 million passengers a year, with plans to increase that to 15 million passengers a year by 2040. Although many of my constituents have expressed support for the potential for the 10,000 or so additional jobs such an expansion may bring to my local area, many more have expressed concern over how it can be squared against the airport’s aim to achieve net zero by 2030.

Last week, we saw the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill enter the House for its Second Reading. That Bill will do much to spur and support the nation’s sustainable aviation fuel sector, in which Bristol airport is already a leading light. I—and I have no doubt many Members in this room—would echo those sentiments. I am a strong supporter of sustainable aviation fuel, and I look forward to seeing the transformational effect it will have on aviation emissions in the years to come.

The Government have already clearly displayed their vision and leadership in this space, and set forth a sensible plan to bring about the maturity of this sector. That is why I wish to focus our debate today not on the technology of tomorrow, but on that of the day after. Hydrogen-powered aviation presents one of the few truly scalable zero-emission pathways for the future of aviation, allowing us to meet our net zero targets while simultaneously keeping flying affordable and accessible.

We currently find ourselves in a fortunate position. The UK is already home to some of the most innovative aerospace companies in the word. From Airbus, located near my old house in Filton—in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Claire Hazelgrove)—to Rolls-Royce in Derby, we have a wealth of expertise to draw on, with a track record of innovative success. Aviation is currently responsible for around 7% of emissions in the UK today, with that figure expected to rise to 16% by 2035 unless meaningful action is taken soon.

Although in recent years we have had great success in decarbonising our power generation, cars, heating and many other sectors, the stark reality is that aviation is one of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise. Currently aviation is primarily fuelled by kerosene, and although great strides have been made in sustainable aviation fuel in recent years, there are currently no cost-competitive alternatives available. As the world continues on the inextricable path towards even greater levels of globalism and integration, the aviation industry’s ability to move people and goods swiftly across continents will only continue to grow in importance.

However, as aviation’s role in the global economy continues to grow, so will its contribution to global emissions, unless we have the foresight today to take the necessary steps for tomorrow and begin supporting the nascent hydrogen aviation industry. In my constituency, Bristol airport has shown real vision and leadership by taking a leading role in the Hydrogen in Aviation alliance, which has laid out a clear case for immediate action to secure our comparative advantage, not just for the betterment of our environment but for the economic prospects. That is a part of this debate that is not spoken about enough.

Many years ago, the UK was an early innovator and pioneer in the offshore wind sector, but a slow, disjointed deployment saw many of the manufacturing opportunities shift abroad to Europe, China and elsewhere. Today we find ourselves in a similar situation with hydrogen. The next 10 years will be critical: either we develop a coherent policy framework, which encourages private sector investment, or we will cede our leadership to the United States, China, the European Union and others, who are already heavily investing in hydrogen-powered aviation. By 2050, the global hydrogen economy is predicted to be worth around $8 trillion. Let us not make the mistake of the offshore wind sector again. Let us be leaders in this space, and so reap the rewards.

The west of England boasts the largest aerospace cluster in the UK. I recently had the privilege of visiting my former university in Bath, and the science park it has developed in tandem with the University of Bristol. They are doing excellent work to realise hydrogen’s potential to transform the aviation sector. Those twin pillars of south-west higher education are working closely with Airbus and Bristol airport as part of the Hydrogen South West group, which aims to cement the position of North Somerset, Bristol and the surrounding area as a national leader in the field.

During my visit to the science park it was made clear to me that although they are excited about the role that hydrogen has to play in the future of the aviation industry, the ever-shifting net zero policy landscape—especially the perceived lack of clarity from the Government on hydrogen’s future role—has handicapped the sector’s ability to draw in private investment. The Government must make it clear to the private sector that they do have faith in hydrogen’s ability to transform the aviation sector, and that early investment into the nascent industry will be rewarded in future.

According to data supplied by the sector’s trade association ADS, the global aviation industry could require more than 100 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050, even by today’s lacklustre transition plans. As we have seen with sustainable aviation fuel, the scaling up of production to those levels will require not just significant private and Government investment, but years to develop plans, build plants and train a sufficiently skilled workforce. It is imperative that we get moving on this issue today.

Although in one moment we must applaud the Government for their work on sustainable aviation fuel, in the next we must begin turning and then fixing their gaze towards hydrogen. The Government have already signalled support of the sector by announcing £100 million for the development of hydrogen planes through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme shortly after coming to power last July. In the autumn Budget, the Government announced almost £1 billion for the aerospace sector over the next five years. Similarly, in the spending review delivered by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor last week, £500 million was committed to support the development of hydrogen infrastructure.

Over the past year, however, I have had innumerable conversations with leading figures in the sector, who have told me time and again of significant anxiety as to whether the UK Government envisage hydrogen having a direct role in the aviation industry in the medium to long term. While other countries push ahead with hydrogen, rightly seeing it as a valuable export market, we run the risk of being left in their wake—or contrails—unless we get a move on and make clear to the industry our steadfast support.

The experience of transition to renewables taught us that although Government investment can catalyse partnerships with the private sector, it ultimately must fall to the private sector to be the driver of change. Before the private sector will start the engine, it falls to this House and this Government thoroughly to investigate this area, set sensible standards and support the development of the necessary infrastructure, to enable a hydrogen-powered aviation future. To that end, I eagerly look forward to hearing from the Minister how he intends to support the industry further in the critical 10 years to come.

It is a real pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for leading the debate and setting the scene so well. It is a pleasure to see the Minister and shadow Minister in their places. I look forward to the Minister’s response and helpful answers to our questions, to ensure we are encouraged by this debate that benefits will come to our constituencies.

Hydrogen is an alternative that is becoming more widely explored. There is no doubt it could and must play a part in the UK’s contribution to net zero targets. The ultimate secret to reaching net zero targets is how to do so without adversely impacting our constituents. I am not a sceptic—I never have been. Some people might be sceptics, but I am not one of them. I recognise the importance of meeting the targets, and hydrogen is one way to do that. Alternative forms of energy are being used in many transport paths, so it is important that we are here today to discuss the progression of our aviation industry.

I want to mention some of the things that are happening in Northern Ireland. Undoubtedly, a progression to hydrogen rather than fossil fuels has its benefits in terms of the transport industry. There are zero carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrogen is attractive for long-haul flights and has faster refuelling mechanisms. Of course, cost implications are very important as we move forward. Any new technology is always costly at the start, but as it gets easier to do, the cost implications reduce. At this moment in time the implications are incredibly large. Airports across the UK will require massive infrastructure upgrades. Most planes will require to be redesigned with larger storage capacity and the freezing temperature of hydrogen must be considered, so there are cost implications there. But for every airport across this great United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we can do it better together.

Companies across the UK such as Airbus, easyJet, Boeing and Wrightbus in NI have looked at and announced plans for hydrogen-powered aircraft and other modes of transport. We just need to look at the transition that was made back home in Northern Ireland by Wrightbus in Ballymena, who developed a green hydrogen production facility capable of powering up to 300 hydrogen buses daily. It has taken some time to get there, but it was on the cusp of something new, and I understand that now almost every bus in London is a Wrightbus, with potentially more across the country. Furthermore, Airbus has announced plans for a hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft by 2035. That is another indication of the timeline. easyJet successfully tested a hydrogen combustion engine in 2022. There have been many advances—small steps now, but great steps for the future as we look forward.

We have spoken a lot today about the importance of our aviation and aerospace sector to the economy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. When we look at transforming capabilities for the future, the key word is investment, so I am keen to get the Minister’s thoughts on how he sees that investment happening with all of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the beneficiaries of that. We are very fortunate to have a Minister in place who is a friend of Northern Ireland and who regularly visits. He has had discussions with the Minister back home at the Assembly to formulate ideas and move forward positively and constructively.

The key phrase is investment in the sector. I look at companies such as Spirit AeroSystems in Belfast and in my constituency of Strangford, which offers world-class aerospace engineering capabilities but is in the middle of a “buyover” that guarantees nothing for Northern Irish jobs. In the Chamber last week, when I had an opportunity to ask the Secretary of State for Business and Trade about this, they were agreeable to the idea of meeting unions and people who could “buy over” to ensure the continuity of jobs across Northern Ireland. How can we possibly talk about investing in companies like this but offer nothing to preserve the future? It is really important that we get it all together in the right way. Perhaps this is a reminder to the relevant Ministers that issues like this will not go away, and that Government intervention to protect the future of our aviation sector is imperative.

There are roles in which all companies across the United Kingdom can play a part, small to large. All of us have a role to play. Some are more critical, but all of them are very helpful. For the likes of Northern Ireland, for instance, we have smaller airports that are perfect for short-haul early flight trials. We are very fortunate to have Belfast International, Belfast City and Londonderry airports, but they are all for short-haul and domestic flights, although there is an indication that next year there will be direct flights to the United States of America.

On early flight trials I have one thought. Ards airport is a small constituency airport—we have the Ulster flying club—and there are possibilities for using that for early trials. Why not? That shows that the reach of this debate can go even further. We have green targets that we are planning to meet. It would be fantastic if the UK could be a global leader in green aviation, but we must never underestimate the cost, the time and the infrastructure that are required.

There is no doubt about the Minister’s commitment to the aviation sector, but I look to him to get an idea of his plans and strategy for the future. That is the encouragement that I am looking for today arising from this debate, and I seek reassurances about people’s jobs in the aviation sector. We need to retain people with the relevant skills, so in the event of any changeovers—for instance, at Spirit AeroSystems back home—we must ensure that jobs are retained and encouraged. The industry would be nothing without the workers in it, who make it what it is, and Government intervention is required to maintain its success.

I look forward to seeing what the future looks like for hydrogen-powered aviation, and I have a very strong and positive hope—indeed, perhaps a vision—that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland can showcase what we have to offer for the future of aviation, and particularly for hydrogen-powered aviation.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this timely and very important debate.

My constituency of Mansfield is just a stone’s throw away from East Midlands airport, which is one of the UK’s key freight and passenger hubs. It is important not only to our local economy, but to many of my constituents, who use the airport to get away on family holidays. With climate change being a significant concern to many of my constituents, and with the instability of hydrocarbon-based aviation fuel pricing as a result of numerous factors, including global conflict, I very much welcome the consideration of hydrogen-powered aviation as a practical and vital path towards sustainable flight.

The east midlands has always been at the heart of British industry and innovation, and now we must be at the forefront of clean technology. Aviation accounts for around 7% of our carbon emissions and the figure is growing, but rather than grounding its progress, we need to power it differently. Hydrogen offers us a really tangible solution: it produces zero carbon emissions at the point of use, and has great potential to fuel short and medium-haul flights by the mid-2030s—exactly the kinds of routes that operate out of East Midlands airport.

Hydrogen has real, tangible benefits over other approaches such as sustainable aviation fuel and battery power. We are already seeing British companies—including companies local to me in the east midlands, such as Rolls-Royce, and ZeroAvia in the south-west, which is working with East Midlands airport—investing in hydrogen engines. I believe that the Government have a responsibility to at least consider supporting that transition, not only to meet our climate targets but to protect and grow jobs in aviation, engineering and logistics in the east midlands.

Let us not forget that our constituents all want cleaner skies and to reach net zero, but they also want the opportunity to travel. Hydrogen-powered aviation can potentially deliver both, but to develop the technology to do that, we need the right investment in infrastructure, and particularly in research and development. We can turn regional airports into hubs of innovation that are important for the regions, and create a new export market in green aviation technology—that is not pie in the sky thinking. It will take some work to achieve it, but it is practical and necessary.

We should back British innovation and cleaner aviation. Let us ensure that the east midlands, Britain and the UK lead the world with this new, exciting technology.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this debate, which is particularly important for the west of England.

Hydrogen-powered flights have real potential to cut carbon emissions in a notoriously difficult to decarbonise industry, while still allowing people to enjoy flying around the world, as the aircraft would emit only water vapour. The industry needs support now, however, which means thinking about the technology, infrastructure and regulation.

Airbus, where many of my constituents work, is aiming for hydrogen-powered airliners by 2035. Its studies suggest that UK hydrogen aviation could support up to 110,000 jobs in this country, and we absolutely have the potential to show global leadership. When I discussed the ZEROe project on a visit to Airbus last year, it was trying to decide between hydrogen combustion and hydrogen fuel cells. It has now plumped for the latter, although it does not rule out direct combustion in the future. It and other manufacturers are working in collaboration with academia, and there is some excellent knowledge in this area in our local universities. We need to back investment in research, development and manufacturing infrastructure. Other companies such as GKN, which has a base in my constituency, are also looking at hydrogen.

The west of England has a long history of innovation in aviation, going back to the days of Sir George White; it has many things that co-ordinate to make it a place to invest. For example, just outside my constituency, we have the Bristol and Bath science park, and we have the national composites centre. Hydrogen molecules are very small, so containing it is a challenge, but that is where the national composites centre’s expertise can help. In the science park, the institute for advanced automotive propulsion systems is also looking at hydrogen.

Obviously, it is no good having hydrogen-fuelled aeroplanes if we do not have the hydrogen, so we need large-scale investment in green hydrogen. It is all very well having zero emissions on our flights, but if the electricity is being generated from non-low carbon power in the first place, there will still be associated emissions. As the Energy Security and Net Zero Committee has heard a number of times in its inquiries, it is really important that the Government make a decision about the future use of hydrogen. Given that we will only ever be able to produce a finite amount of green hydrogen, I think we need to prioritise it for industries where there are no realistic alternatives, including aviation.

We need to be thinking about how we produce that energy, and again our area has something to offer the country, because we have the potential for new nuclear at Oldbury and we have the River Severn, where there was a recent commission on tidal power. We therefore have the means of producing green energy. We have expertise in all those areas, with excellent nuclear specialism in our local universities, the aviation expertise to develop its use in aviation, and the facilities that I described in the Bristol and Bath science park to help to tackle some of the problems associated with deploying the technology.

On infrastructure, we obviously need to think about not just how we are producing that energy, but how we are delivering it to airports and how we are storing it. Again, that comes back to the question about the future of the gas grid in this country—will it be repurposed for hydrogen at some point? Regulation and having the right regulatory environment are important. People are very aware that hydrogen is highly flammable, but we can make it safe by putting the right protocols in place.

Our 2024 manifesto set out taxation reform that would help to redirect people away from frequent high carbon flights. It is important that we give people a means of judging the carbon emissions from their flights. Many companies will be looking at their own net zero aims, and it is important that people understand the implications of their choices when flying.

Hydrogen-powered aviation has the potential to cut transport emissions and boost our economy through new jobs. The west of England is particularly well placed to support the industry. It is time to make sure that the regulatory environment is right and that limited public money is invested effectively.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairship, Mr Stringer. I thank the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) for securing this debate and for continuing the conversation that we have been having over the last couple of weeks about the future of aviation—something it is always a pleasure to talk about.

Nothing is inevitable about the pollution in our skies. Aviation does not have to be the easy poster child for conspicuous consumption of resources and casual carbon emissions. It does not have to be part of the problems we face with a warming planet, melting ice caps and increasingly extreme weather. With the right choices, it can be part of the solution. Britain is already feeling the mounting toll of climate change: flash floods, record heatwaves and freak storms. That is not abstract; it is already costing lives and livelihoods across the country. Aviation contributes to that problem and we cannot pretend that it does not.

In 2022 alone, UK domestic and international flights produced nearly 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 7% of the nation’s entire greenhouse gas emissions. If nothing changes, the Climate Change Committee projects that aviation will account for 16% of UK emissions by 2035. We cannot meet our net zero goals without tackling this issue. This debate is particularly well timed following the introduction of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill last week, which addresses the climate emissions of existing technology fuels.

There is good news beyond that, however, and aviation can be part of the solution to our fight against climate change. Thanks to scientific progress and industry innovation, we now have the technology to fly without fossil fuels. Green hydrogen, produced using renewable energy, is a clean fuel that emits no carbon when used. It is one of the most promising solutions for decarbonising aviation, whether by powering aircraft directly or by creating sustainable aviation fuels. That is not a pipe dream; it is already happening.

Hydrogen aircraft are being trialled, green fuel production is scaling up and aircraft around the world are beginning to prepare for a hydrogen-powered future. However, the UK risks being left behind unless we match ambition with investment. The ATI estimates that aerospace’s economic contribution to the UK economy could increase from £8.4 billion today to over £37 billion by 2050, driven by new low and zero emission technologies such as hydrogen-powered aircraft.

Britain’s aerospace sector is ready, but it lacks confidence that essential infrastructure exists, such as the hydrogen production that those aircraft will require. ADS, the UK trade association for aerospace, defence, security and space, estimates that global aviation could require more than 100 million tonnes of hydrogen by 2050—3 million tonnes of which would be used in the UK. It is essential that we scale up the production of green hydrogen to meet that challenge, and enable the shift in the industry to take place. Investment is required in production, as is massive investment in refuelling systems and supply chains, as well as the planning approvals that are required to approve projects necessary for that development.

The ATI strategic programme has supported several key projects in the shift to develop hydrogen-electric propulsion systems, including ZeroAvia’s HyFlyer and advanced fuel cells for aviation decarbonisation projects, GKN’s H2GEAR and H2FlyGHT—lots of confusing acronyms and project names—and Project Fresson, led by Cranfield Aerospace Solutions. Some of those projects, including those by ZeroAvia, have resulted in or will soon result in certification applications with the Civil Aviation Authority that will complete in the coming years—the earliest of them by 2026.

ZeroAvia, which is based in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for South Cotswolds (Dr Savage), is backed by many huge investors, including Airbus, British Airways, and the Amazon Climate Pledge Fund. It is already attracting orders from airlines such as Alaska Airlines and United Airlines. Critically, it has also had investment from the UK Infrastructure Bank and the Scottish National Investment Bank, which shows the immediate viability and attractiveness of investing in this technology.

Having raised over $250 million and grown a team of more than 200 employees across Gloucestershire and London, ZeroAvia is already making a significant contribution to the aviation industry. It is currently targeting certifying with the CAA a hydrogen-electric powertrain for planes with up to 20 seats, with the target of it entering service next year. The step after that will be developing an engine for larger 40 to 80-seat aircraft by 2028. The certification will require investment in the CAA to provide the skills and expertise to evaluate and then certify the aircraft as safe.

The advantage of ZeroAvia’s approach is the ability for airlines to retrofit the engines into existing fleets. This is not a tale about a technology of the future. ZeroAvia has already performed several world-first breakthrough flight demonstrations of its powertrain technology from its base at Cotswold airport. ZeroAvia is an incredibly exciting new entry to the sector, but existing aviation giant Airbus has also seized the opportunity of hydrogen. Its plans are bigger and depend on more infrastructure; as a result, Airbus recently announced its ZEROe hydrogen-powered aircraft programme would be delayed by a decade because of concerns about the availability of infrastructure to support hydrogen flight.

The ZEROe aircraft features an electric-propellor propulsion system powered by hydrogen fuel cells that uses the hydrogen to generate electricity on board through a chemical reaction, similar to the approach taken by ZeroAvia. The only by-product of this reaction is water, and when combined with green hydrogen production, the process is carbon-neutral. The ZEROe approach with propeller propulsion is the likely first-generation hydrogen powerplant type, replacing domestic and regional aircraft, like those ZeroAvia is already developing, for shorter flights.

That approach contrasts with the one Rolls Royce is taking with its project to modify existing technology engines to run on gaseous hydrogen, instead of requiring a conversion to electrical energy to power an onboard electric motor. Rolls showed the huge potential of that work back in 2022 when it successfully ran a modified AE 2100-A engine, which is a variant of the turboprop powerplant that equips the Saab 2000 regional airliner, which is a long-established and widely used regional turboprop.

The next stage of that work is to modify a Pearl 15 business jet engine, which is a twin shaft turbofan that currently powers the Bombardier Global Express, showing that this approach is potentially applicable to turbofans as well as turboprops. The direct combustion of hydrogen in a modified existing-technology engine shows an alternative route to harnessing hydrogen to decarbonise the aviation industry. These projects show the huge potential of this fuel to take aviation into the modern era of low and zero-emission operations.

There are three approaches: eSAF, fuel cell to electrical production on the aircraft and direct hydrogen propulsion. They are all viable technologies and approaches that the market, industry and research will understand and develop for the appropriate sectors. For now, those projects are all being held back by infrastructure availability, and I call on the Minister to fix that. I welcome his Government’s July announcement of the commitment of over £100 million for the development of hydrogen and electric aircraft through the Aerospace Technology Institute, and nearly £1 billion over five years to support innovation in the aerospace sector. There is no denying that those are serious, positive moves, but they must be only the start. If we get sustainable aviation fuel right, the benefits for cities such as London will be enormous. Clean flights mean cleaner air, fewer respiratory illnesses, fewer days lost to sickness, and longer, healthier lives. Getting it right would also mean economic leadership, new green engineering jobs, revitalised manufacturing, and a chance for Britain to lead the global hydrogen economy.

Of all transport sectors, on a first-principle basis, aviation is the one to which hydrogen is most applicable. In fact hydrogen will be essential if aviation is to make its net zero targets. Aviation is the most energy-intensive mode of transport and the most sensitive to mass, as the Breguet range equations that I explained to all hon. Members last week show. That is why aviation will be the most suitable use of hydrogen fuel in the future. Aviation has the least competition from other zero-emission pathways, due to their various shortcomings. The sector’s energy demand is plannable and high, creating significant offtake that can bring H2 down the cost curve. Additionally, the professionalised and regulated environment of aviation is very well suited to handling the new fuel, and establishing standards and safety. Hydrogen’s success in aviation will be a major proof point against many existing investor concerns for other sectors.

I urge the Minister first to provide longer-term clarity to industry on the availability of hydrogen. The Government must signal their intentions on renewable energy and hydrogen production targets beyond 2040, and, to bring forward the business models for hydrogen transport, storage and power, they should also extend Aerospace Technology Institute funding to a 10-year horizon.

Unlike what we have heard from other hon. Members in this debate, this is absolutely not a call for flights to be grounded and Britain isolated. This is a call to fly smarter and cleaner, to back British science and leadership to build a better and more sustainable future. Aviation connects us to people, places and possibilities. It can drive innovation. It boosts economies and it brings the world closer together. With the right action, it can keep doing all of that without costing us our planet.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. I congratulate the hon. Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) not only on securing the debate but on setting out the case for hydrogen aviation so clearly in his opening remarks. The Second Reading of the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill last week was but the precursor to this Westminster Hall debate—this debate was trailed in that one. I also congratulate all other hon. Members who have spoken in the debate.

It is a pleasure to speak for His Majesty’s Opposition in this important debate on the policies of the Government of the United Kingdom on hydrogen-powered aviation. Aviation is a sector that underpins global connectivity, international trade, and regional economic growth, but its long-term sustainability requires bold innovation, and a clear policy framework that supports low-carbon propulsion technologies while enabling British industry to lead.

Let me be clear: hydrogen is not a hypothetical solution. It is a practical, viable and strategically critical path forward for decarbonising flight. The UK has a golden opportunity to lead the world in this technology, not just by developing aircraft but by creating the entire hydrogen aviation value chain, from production and distribution to propulsion and maintenance. When combusted purely, hydrogen emits only water vapour, unlike kerosene, obviously, which produces carbon dioxide. Moreover, unlike battery electric aircraft, hydrogen aviation scales better over distance and payload, making it suitable for not just short-term hops but future regional and potentially transcontinental routes. That is not only good for the planet, but good for Britain.

According to the Aerospace Technology Institute, the UK could generate up to £34 billion in GVA and support 60,000 jobs by 2050 through hydrogen powered aviation. That is thousands of skilled engineering, manufacturing and research and development roles across the country. These areas stand to benefit significantly from hydrogen aircraft production, airport infrastructure retrofitting and fuel supply chain development. In Bristol and Gloucestershire, Airbus and GKN Aerospace are already laying the groundwork for hydrogen propulsion and systems integration. In the midlands, particularly in Derby and Coventry, Rolls-Royce is developing hydrogen combustion engines in work that has the potential to sustain and expand our world leading turbo machinery industry. In Teesside, the Conservative Government-designated hydrogen transport hub is pioneering fuel production and logistics, with Teesside international airport poised to become a hydrogen aviation testbed. In Scotland, Prestwick airport is leading hydrogen aircraft trials and Aberdeen is already a recognised centre for hydrogen fuel development. Belfast, home to Spirit AeroSystems, is well positioned to play a central role in manufacturing structural components for the hydrogen aircraft of the future.

A successful future-focused aviation sector means more than environmental progress; it means greater reliability and connectivity for passengers, and competitive ticket prices driven by fuel efficiency. For business, it means faster, lower emission logistics, better access to export markets and the growth of regional airports as hubs for commerce and investment. There is an important distinction to be made here, and one that we in this place must be honest about. While hydrogen fuel cells offer lower energy losses and may suit smaller aircraft or drones, it is pure hydrogen combustion that offers the best chance of achieving decarbonisation for medium to large aircraft, especially within the constraints of airframe weight and power density. Combustion also enables more rapid retrofit of existing aircraft designs and is more compatible with current maintenance ecosystems and airport infrastructure. Simply put, hydrogen combustion is the most practical, scalable route for commercial aviation and the UK should be focusing investment accordingly.

It was the Conservatives in government who recognised that early on. Under the jet zero strategy established in 2022, we committed funding to Project FlyZero, supported by trials by ZeroAvia and Rolls-Royce. We ringfenced funding for hydrogen infrastructure at UK airports. We laid the groundwork for the SAF price mechanism that this current Government is carrying through with the SAF Bill. We established the hydrogen transport hub in Teesside, where our fantastic mayor Ben Houchen, now Lord Houchen, oversaw a combined £23 million funding package to kick-start the local hydrogen-based economy. We also made Britain one of the first countries to support regulatory frameworks for hydrogen-powered flight trials.

Turning to the new Government, the mantle has clearly democratically passed to them, and the test on whether hydrogen aviation can succeed lies with them. The promised expansion of the aerospace growth partnership, sadly, has been watered down. The Aerospace Technology Institute’s hydrogen propulsion roadmap seems to have stalled, and companies at the cutting edge, from Cranfield to Kemble to Prestwick, report difficulty in accessing follow-on support, despite clear potential and private co-investment. The Government must stop conflating hydrogen policy with overreliance on electric-only solutions, which simply cannot be scaled to long-haul aviation. A narrow vision such as that would be misguided; it is actively stifling British leadership in this vital sector. If we want to lead the next aviation revolution to match our leadership in jet engines with leadership in zero carbon propulsion, then ambition must be matched by action. That means committing long-term funding for hydrogen combustion propulsion research and development, providing meaningful and long-term support for airport hydrogen infrastructure trials, especially in regional hubs, accelerating the certification and regulatory pathway for hydrogen aircraft and aligning hydrogen production strategies with the wider UK aviation sector.

The hydrogen age is not coming. It is here, and unless the Government correct course, the opportunity to lead it will pass us by. The last Conservative Government laid the foundations for hydrogen-powered aviation. I very much hope that this Government, and this Minister, do not allow the UK to lose that legacy through indecision. I challenge the Minister, who is very thoughtful on this subject and has the best interests of aviation at heart, to ensure that hydrogen is part of that future.

It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Stringer. It was also a pleasure, as a young councillor, to serve under your leadership of Manchester city council in the early ’90s. As I said in a debate the other day, you were chairman of the airport that last built an international runway in the UK—the only one in 80 years. I learned a lot in that period, and I am always grateful to you.

I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset (Sadik Al-Hassan) on securing an excellent first debate in Westminster Hall and thank other hon. Members for their contributions. Famously, my hon. Friend is a pharmacist by training and by trade; he actually lives in a village called Pill, which is probably the strongest case of nominative determinism I have come across in my political career. He is also a doughty champion for Bristol airport. He never fails to tackle me about the issue in the Lobby or the Chamber. The airport plays a crucial role in providing connectivity and enabling growth in the south-west, and I welcome the leading role that it has played in developing hydrogen, such as the recent Project Acorn trials, which demonstrated the safe use of zero emission ground handling equipment in an airside environment.

I am grateful to hon. Members for their contributions on the SAF Bill last week. The Opposition spokesman, the hon. Member for Mid Buckinghamshire (Greg Smith), spoke well about his passion for this issue, and mentioned that hydrogen fuel produces only water vapour. It is good for the environment, jobs and airports. It can help general and commercial aviation.

Upon coming into government, I had to take some tough decisions. The Jet Zero Council, established under the last Government, was reasonably ineffective. It hardly met and it was unwieldy; people said that it had become a talking shop with limited outcomes. I made big decisions to refocus it, narrow it down and ensure that it had tangible outcomes.

For all the groundwork that the Opposition spokesperson said that the last Government laid, we have had to make tough decisions. We are the Government that introduced the mandate for SAF, which came into law on 1 January this year, and in the first Session of this Parliament we are making decisions about the revenue certainty mechanism. I am grateful to all hon. Members who are supporting that, but we should have been doing this years ago. We now have a Government who are committed to making progress, and we will continue doing so.

As the Secretary of State noted when introducing the Bill last week, the Government recognise the key role of the aviation sector in driving growth, and

“we will not accept false trade-offs that pit aviation’s growth against our commitments to net zero.”—[Official Report, 11 June 2025; Vol. 768, c. 1031.]

I want to see a future in which more passengers and goods fly while we transition to a greener aviation sector. In addition to introducing the SAF Bill, the Government have already established a SAF mandate, as I have said. The mandate and the revenue certainty mechanism will provide much-needed support to SAF producers, stimulating investment in domestic production, which we all want to see, by reducing financial risk and uncertainty for those producers and supporting the UK to become a world leader in sustainable fuel production. As I said in last week’s debate, the world is looking to us and asking us about our revenue certainty mechanism, because we are leading the world in that field.

As we all know, we are also acting to modernise our airspace. Earlier this month, we released a response to the consultation on a new UK airspace design service—UKADS—and support fund. UKADS will make flightpaths more direct and efficient, reducing unnecessary emissions and supporting flights with fewer delays.

Let us get to the subject in hand. I recognise the clear potential of hydrogen as a zero emission aviation fuel and what it could contribute towards greener aviation. As the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) said in his customarily excellent speech, it produces zero CO2. He is right that it is costly, but we know that the costs will become competitive as we scale up. He speaks well of Spirit in his constituency and the workers who work there in this field. I pay tribute to him and them for what they do in Northern Ireland.

Given our world-leading aerospace sector, we should seek to capture in the UK the jobs and growth benefits emerging from these technologies. The Government have already acted to support the use of low-carbon hydrogen in aviation through the SAF mandate, with eligible hydrogen rewarded through the provision of tradeable SAF certificates. Innovation led by the sector is key, and I welcome the work by Airbus and GKN on hydrogen technology in the south-west and the support provided by academia, such as by Bath University. I congratulate the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Claire Young); the south-west is well placed in the R&D world for this technology. Given her work as a former leader of the council and her expertise in the tech sector, I welcome her valuable contribution to the debate.

We will continue to co-invest with industry on a range of R&D projects, which a number of Members raised, including the development of hydrogen aircraft technology through the Aerospace Technology Institute programme that the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Luke Taylor) mentioned. As announced in the spending review, we will invest more than £3 billion in the next four years in the advanced manufacturing sector on zero emission vehicles, batteries and aerospace technologies. I join him in congratulating Cranfield Aerospace Solutions, which I visited while in opposition, on its work.

The Government will further set out our approach to the advanced manufacturing sector in the modern industrial strategy later this month. That will benefit from the UK-US trade deal signed today, under which there will be zero tariffs on UK aerospace trade with the United States. I am aware that aircraft developers are moving at pace, with ZeroAvia announcing plans last month for a manufacturing base in Glasgow. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Steve Yemm) for mentioning it and for being a doughty champion for East Midlands airport near his constituency. He is right to mention the geopolitical situation. There are many reasons why we should make these changes, but energy security is one of them, given that we are in an increasingly uncertain world. He brings his previous tech experience to the debate, and I congratulate him on his contribution.

The wider sector should prepare for the adoption of this new technology and, to support those whole-system changes, the Government, the aviation and aerospace sector, and academia must work together. The Jet Zero Taskforce that I have established is a key focus for that collaboration, and I am pleased to co-chair the expert group alongside the Minister for Industry. Importantly, one of the task and finish groups of the Jet Zero Taskforce is reviewing barriers to the commercial operation of hydrogen aircraft. The group will report on its findings in the autumn, and I look forward to considering them closely.

As the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate said, regulation is critical. Improving regulation in the UK, and ensuring that it enables growth and does not unduly hold back investment, is an essential part of the Government’s growth mission and of delivering on the plan for change. For that reason, in March the Chancellor announced that in the current financial year the Department for Transport will fund the Civil Aviation Authority’s hydrogen in aviation regulatory challenge. This work is helping the CAA to collaborate with innovative companies through regulatory sandboxes, in order to develop a proportionate regulatory framework for them.

Finally, I will touch on the production of low-carbon hydrogen, which is essential not only for aviation but for the wider economy. We have strong domestic expertise and favourable geology and infrastructure to develop a thriving low-carbon hydrogen sector in the UK. We are delivering real projects to kick-start the UK’s hydrogen economy, as demonstrated by the recently signed contracts for projects that were successful in the first hydrogen allocation round.

Later this year, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero will publish a refreshed hydrogen strategy to ensure that hydrogen achieves its unique role in the Government’s clean energy superpower and growth missions. Just last week, the Government announced over £500 million to develop the UK’s first regional hydrogen transport and storage network, boosting industrial regions such as Merseyside, Teesside and the Humber.

The week of the international Paris air show is an important time to reflect on the progress that we are making towards a greener aviation sector. I therefore reiterate my ambition on this important matter, as well as my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset for securing today’s debate and to other hon. Members for contributing to it.

I, too, thank all the hon. Members who have contributed to the debate. It was fantastic to hear from the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) about the importance of mitigating any impact of this change on constituents and of challenging scepticism about hydrogen’s role. He is definitely on the bus when it comes to hydrogen. My hon. Friend the Member for Mansfield (Steve Yemm) is a champion of his local airport and of green hydrogen, which offers us strategic energy independence and jobs while also helping us to meet climate targets. The hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Claire Young) talked about the innovation history in the west of England, a region that she said is up for the challenges of hydrogen while prioritising change in aviation.

Front Benchers made a number of important points, too, including about the risk of doing nothing for our ability to meet our climate targets; the skills needed to reflect the changes to regulation to go alongside the Government’s announced funding; the need for a long-term plan to drive investment; the fact that hydrogen is good for the planet and good for Britain; the role of the Government in providing leadership in this hydrogen age, not only in the UK but internationally; and the effect of a refocused Jet Zero Council on progress on catching up in order to meet our plans for a greener aviation sector. I also welcome the UK-US trade deal and its potential benefits for the nascent hydrogen economy. I thank all the relevant Members for bringing those points to the fore; I am certain that the Minister has heard them and will take them away.

We have heard today about the extraordinary opportunities across the country that the development of the aviation sector might bring. I have seen at first hand in my constituency of North Somerset that it is an incredibly exciting sector, which has long been at the cutting edge of innovation in this country; hydrogen-powered aviation is just the latest link in a chain stretching back over 100 years.

I get the sense that we are unified behind hydrogen-powered aviation. We all agree on the need to reach our legally binding net zero targets, and that we must do so in a way that maintains the affordability and accessibility of the modern aviation industry. I believe that hydrogen-powered aviation is the answer. Down the line, we might disagree on some minor tactical points, but so long as we agree on the overarching aim and strategy, I believe that we can get there.

Realising the potential of hydrogen-powered aviation is incredibly important, not just for the long-term regional economic prospects of constituencies such as mine, in which Bristol airport plays such a key role in our local economy, but for our nation as a whole. As we have heard, the aviation industry supports over 1.6 million jobs across our country and contributes over £120 billion to our economy every year. While we are here to recognise its contributions to our emissions, I think we agree on its importance to our future economic growth and, therefore, on the need to support its decarbonisation while not imperilling its expected strong growth.

I thank Members again for their contributions. I look forward to seeing how the sector continues to develop in the years to come. As they say, the sky’s the limit.

Question put and agreed to.

The Senate draft proposes offering a maximum subsidy of $1/USG for all fuels based on their carbon intensities starting next year.
The Senate proposal would also scrap a provision in the House bill that starting next year would restrict eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks.
Instead, the Senate committee has proposed cutting subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit.
The Senate draft is just a proposal and could be changed.","The US Senate tax-writing committee is proposing cutting a tax credit's extra subsidy for low-carbon jet fuels over road fuels and introducing less-restrictive limits on foreign biofuel feedstocks, major shifts from current law and the House version of the bill.

Republicans have planned to use a far-reaching budget bill this year to alter climate policies from the Inflation Reduction Act, which created a new tax credit for clean fuel producers known as ""45Z"". The House passed its version of the bill last month, which would have kept the general structure of that incentive — upping fuel subsidies as emissions fall — and extended the incentive by four additional years through 2031. The credit took effect this year.

But the Senate Finance Committee in draft language released Monday floated its own changes, suggesting that Republican lawmakers are not yet aligned on how to alter the subsidy just weeks before President Donald Trump has pushed lawmakers to pass the major bill into law.

The Senate draft proposes offering a maximum subsidy of $1/USG for all fuels based on their carbon intensities starting next year. The House made no changes to that part of the law, which currently offers road fuels up to $1/USG and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) up to $1.75/USG, plus inflation adjustments for all types of fuel.

That change would reduce the incentive's upfront costs — potentially alleviating concerns among some conservative lawmakers that the bill would add to the budget deficit — but could reduce alternative fuel availability for airlines and upend many refiners' plans to convert more renewable diesel output to SAF.

""We have always supported tech-neutral biofuel incentives and at first blush the Senate draft seems to be moving toward making 45Z truly tech-neutral,"" said David Fialkov, executive vice president of government affairs at the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, which had opposed treating aviation fuels differently than road fuels.

The Senate proposal would also scrap a provision in the House bill that starting next year would restrict eligibility to fuels derived from North American feedstocks. Instead, the Senate committee has proposed cutting subsidies for fuels from foreign feedstocks by 20pc while still allowing them some credit. That change would provide more flexibility than the House bill to refineries that have scaled up biofuel production in recent years by relying on foreign inputs like used cooking oil and tallow.

The Senate draft is just a proposal and could be changed. Both bills notably would extend 45Z and prevent regulators from considering indirect land use change emissions.",https://www.argusmedia.com/-/media/project/argusmedia/mainsite/images/14-generic-hero-banners/herobanner_1600x530_generic-c.jpg?h=530&iar=0&w=1600&rev=2cf023b4e0484c1bb091b9f72dbf7771&hash=72DBDFEBEF6EE62E751AB5DD2221C77E,N,,2025-06-17 12:19:08.894324

Those mechanisms, for us, must include directing aviation-related regulatory costs toward SAF development.

LE BOURGET—Air France expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) costs to rise to €650 million ($750 million) in 2030, up from €90 million in 2024, as a European mandate for SAF use rises to 6% SAF, the airline’s CEO Anne Rigail says.

“Our issue at the moment–it’s not new but we have to fight against it–is that SAF is currently very expensive, about three to four times more expensive than conventional fuel,” Rigail said June 17 in an address at the Paris Air Lab, part of the Paris Air Show.

The cost—and availability—of SAF is a big issue for European airlines, which have in recent months been expressing doubts about whether the 2030 SAF target, part of ReFuelEU Aviation legislation, is attainable, and even controversially suggesting the target should be pushed back.

On that same timescale, Rigail says European Union (EU) Emissions Trading System (ETS) costs will reach more than €200 million, up from €100 million, while the cost of fleet renewal—which the airline says is currently the most efficient way for it to decarbonize—will be stable at around €1 billion.

Rigail says European airlines risk being put at a disadvantage to airline peers from other parts of the world because of rising decarbonization costs in the region.

“It’s crucial for us to implement mechanisms in the EU to narrow the price gap between SAF and fossil kerosene to preserve our competitiveness. Those mechanisms, for us, must include directing aviation-related regulatory costs toward SAF development. This is what Germany just announced with the intention to allocate toward SAF 50% of its aviation ETS revenues,” Rigail says. “This is also what has been decided in France in the maritime sector. It’s time to reassess aviation taxation.”

At a European level, airlines are awaiting the presentation of the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, due to be presented later this year, which they hope will be a stepping stone to increasing SAF volumes and bringing down prices.

Speaking to Aviation Week on the sidelines of the air show, Rigail says it is a question of “wait and see” as to whether investment in SAF would be tackled as the industry hopes in this plan.

But she says Air France is hopeful of a growing move in the region toward allocating ETS revenues to SAF purchase and investment in the SAF supply chain, as recently seen in Germany.

“That’s something we’re asking for in France,” Rigail says. “We have hope that little by little awareness is growing that European airlines will not be able, in a world in which there is international competition, to finance their decarbonization costs by passing them on to customers.”

During her speech, Rigail noted that European carriers had lost 11 points of market share on routes to and from Europe over the past 20 years, with a total market share of 41% in 2024 compared to 52% in 2004. Non-European carriers have been growing twice as fast on that timescale, she says. French carriers have lost 19% of market share between France and the rest of the world over that period.

“With the increase in environmental regulation in the EU but not in other regions, the risk is not only to see this trend continue, but to see this trend … worsen. The core issue is that those environmental constraints and their associated costs are not harmonized in the world,” Rigail says.

The airline industry is still waiting for other parts of the world to follow the EU and the UK in imposing SAF mandates, she adds.

Referring to the recent move to increase the so-called “solidarity tax” on aviation in France, a move heavily criticized by airlines, Rigail says: “Overtaxing aviation does not reduce its impact, it only undermines its accessibility and limits the ability of airlines like Air France to invest in fleet renewal and SAF. We urgently need a wake-up call in the EU. We know that the UK, US and China are moving very fast on SAF and we cannot let the EU be marginalized. We need a clear, coordinated policy.”",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-06-17 08:05:56.800858

@Vietjet @Airbus #A321neo #PAS25","Paris, France, 17 June 2025 - Vietjet, Vietnam’s largest private airline, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Airbus covering a major new order for 100 single-aisle A321neo aircraft, with the potential to add another 50 in the future.

The agreement was signed during the Paris Air Show by Vietjet CEO Dinh Viet Phuong and Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business.

“This new agreement marks a significant milestone in our strategic partnership with Airbus,” said Vietjet Chairwoman Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao. “These modern and efficient aircraft have been instrumental in Vietjet’s growth, helping us make air travel more accessible and affordable for millions, while strengthening our role as a connector for economic development, cultural exchange and global connectivity. This landmark agreement represents a vital step in Vietjet’s growth strategy as a multi-national aviation group.”

“Our latest agreement comes just weeks after the airline placed an additional order for A330neo widebody aircraft,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry. “Together the A321neo and A330neo will be perfect partners for Vietjet to continue to spread its wings, efficiently matching capacity more closely to demand across its network. The airline will also benefit from the high levels of technical commonality that are unique to latest generation Airbus aircraft.”

Operating a fleet of more than 100 Airbus aircraft, Vietjet continues to expand its global network and fleet modernisation.

The A321neo is the largest member of Airbus’ best-selling A320neo Family, offering unparalleled range and performance. By incorporating new generation engines and Sharklets, the A321neo brings a 50% noise reduction and more than 20% fuel savings and CO₂ reduction compared to previous generation single-aisle aircraft, while maximising passenger comfort in the widest single-aisle cabin in the sky.

At the end of May 2025, more than 7,000 A321neo aircraft have been ordered by over 90 customers across the globe.

As with all in-production aircraft, the A321neo is able to operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), with a target to increase to up to 100% SAF capability by 2030.

He said, “The drafting agency needs to closely the Politburo on innovation in law-making and enforcement to meet the requirements of national development. Major policy issues will come under the legislative authority of the National Assembly, while implementation and technical management issues will be the responsibility of the government, ministries, and agencies. We need to clearly define who does what, with the right role, and the right task.""

The DPM noted that aviation security and safety is facing new threats that require addressing, from regulations on infrastructure, telecommunications equipment, and pilots, to flight safety officers and security systems inside and outside the airport.

According to Uong Viet Dung, director of the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, based on a review of the current law, the recommendations made by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), and emerging development needs, the drafting agency has proposed five main policy groups for revision.

The first is completing a legal framework on the organisation of state management of the aviation sector, clarifying the role and legal status of aviation authorities and aviation security authorities, and developing the aviation industry.

The second is completing aviation safety policies, closely following the eight key elements in the ICAO's safety monitoring system.

The third is updating and supplementing aviation security policies, considering them part of national security, with specialised organisations and independent investigation mechanisms.

The fourth is amending policies on investment and operation of airports, especially dual-use facilities with defence-security functions and public-private partnerships.

The fifth is developing air transport, including policies to encourage cargo carriers, improve service quality, and airline responsibility.

The Ministry of Construction (MoC) has proposed adding regulations for drones and flying taxis to catch up with technology trends and pave the way for piloting new models.

DPM Ha emphasised that new policies on aviation must aim to create breakthroughs, remove bottlenecks, and improve state management, closely following international commitments and paving the way for the development of a modern, integrated aviation industry.

He stressed that the revised law must definitively address land use and defence-security asset management at dual-use airports to prevent overlaps among aviation, land, and defence laws. Clear rules are also needed to define public-private roles in airport infrastructure investment, and operation and management, ensuring transparency and avoiding duplication.

“The drafting body should review policies on competition, slot allocation, and operating rights to ensure fairness between state-owned and private airlines, as well as a mechanism to support Vietnam's aviation development,” DPM Ha added.

He also called for the addition of environmental protection and sustainable development policies, such as updating the CO₂ emissions reduction roadmap, fully participating in the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, and encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuels.",https://vir.com.vn/stores/news_dataimages/2025/062025/17/14/in_social/deputy-prime-minister-tran-hong-ha-chaired-a-meeting-photo-vgp-20250617142133.jpg?randTime=1750161979,N,,2025-06-17 08:06:26.590306

According to T&E, Europe has the potential to host more than half of the world’s e-kerosene production, with a production capacity of close to 3 million tonnes – or around 5% of the fuel that Europe’s aviation sector needs to operate.

While Europe’s early progress has been boosted by EU law on sustainable aviation fuels, specifically ReFuelEU, the development of production facilities is hampered by financing challenges, as well as by traditional fuel suppliers being ‘notably absent from the conversation’, T&E said.

‘E-kerosene revolution’

“|The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential,” commented Camile Mutrelle, aviation policy officer at T&E.

“Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

T&E notes that only four projects are at an advanced planning stage, with financing the main barrier – each project requires between €1 billion and €2 billion in capital. Overall, the capital required to meet 2030 targets for SAF is estimated at €10 billion to €20 billion.

Europe’s lethargy is being echoed by an acceleration in SAF development in other regions, however – China has announced around 10 large-scale e-kerosene projects, accounting for approximately 20% of global planned capacity.

Funding mechanisms

Currently, EU funding mechanisms for e-kerosene are ‘not strong enough to support the level of investment needed to get these projects off the ground’, T&E noted, while traditional oil companies have made ‘negligible contributions’, continuing to invest in fossil fuels.

“Despite their huge financial capacity, major oil companies are largely absent from the e-kerosene market,” Mutrelle added. “Startups have taken the lead, but lack the internal resources to finance the capital-intensive infrastructure that is urgently needed.

“Getting oil majors on board and EU financing mechanisms up to scratch will give e-kerosene the lift-off it needs.

Otto Aviation’s CEO, Paul Touw, has detailed how his company plans to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030 with the design, certification and production of its clean-sheet business jet, the Phantom 3500.

During a briefing held at Paris Air Show on Tuesday 17 June, Touw explained that Otto’s breakthrough technology for its groundbreaking aircraft builds on the Celera 500 experimental aircraft and is based on unlocking the physics of laminar flow. Studied by NASA for over 60 years, Touw described laminar flow as “the holy grail of aerodynamics”.

First ultra-low drag aircraft to fly at transonic speed

First unveiled in 2023 the Phantom 3500’s ultra-low drag aircraft design leverages laminar flow to achieve a 35% reduction in viscous drag. Touw explained that “laminar flow keeps air moving smoothly along the aircraft’s surface, reducing resistance and improving aerodynamic efficiency. Lower drag lowers aircraft systems and weight and in turn exponentially lowers fuel burn and emissions.”

Following wind tunnel testing at Europe’s high-tech European Transonic (ETW) last year, which saw the company conduct over 30,000 trials, the company has validated performance metrics of its 87% laminar flow airfoil.

Touw explained that the Phantom 3500, which is expected to enter service in the 2030s, could cut fuel burn by over 60% when compared with competitive aircraft such as the Bombardier Challenger 3500. “On a 1,000nm trip the Phantom would burn 115 gallons of fuel while larger aircraft would burn 300 gallons” said Touw. The Phantom will also reduce emissions by more than 90 when combined with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)%.

Contrail reduction

Capable of flying at 51,000 ft and therefore avoiding jet streams, the aircraft will also reduce contrail formation by 90%. It will have a maximum range of 3,500nm and a maximum speed of 600+mph.

The mid-sized jet will feature a spacious 6.5 feet high cabin. Meanwhile, high-definition Super Natural Vision digital windows will replace traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, maintaining the aircraft’s streamlined design.

Powered by Williams International FJ44 engines, Touw highlighted that he hoped selecting already-certified engines would help to accelerate the certification process.”

First test flight aimed for 2027

While the first test flight is planned to take place in 2027, Touw aims to achieve certification in 2030 with around 1600 of the aircraft being produced between 2030 and 2040. Touw revealed that “around a third of that production is already accounted for and we hope to be making announcements on that in September.”

He anticipates an $18m price tag for the aircraft.

Earlier this week Otto also announced that it is relocating its production facility to Jacksonville, Florida. The move is supported by a $515 million incentive package from Florida state.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Otto-Aviation-Paul-Touw-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 06:02:31.743056

The new company, North Sky, will focus on producing approximately 40 million Nm³ of biogas annually - enough to meet the gas needs of around 20,000 Danish households.

It also plans to build on Skovgaard Energy’s existing biogas infrastructure while exploring the potential of e-SAF, an emerging sustainable aviation fuel made from carbon dioxide and green hydrogen.

This marks Sumitomo Corporation’s first foray into the biogas sector and forms a central part of its broader strategy to scale up its energy solutions business, one of the key pillars of its Medium-Term Management Plan.

Denmark, known for its agricultural output, is positioning biogas as a cornerstone of its transition to carbon neutrality. With a national target to fully replace fossil natural gas with biogas by 2030, the country is investing in infrastructure that utilises organic waste as renewable energy sources. Biogas plays a dual role: reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing energy self-sufficiency by relying on domestic raw materials.

Skovgaard Energy, founded in 1999, has a strong track record in renewable energy and already operates biogas facilities that process cattle manure. The company has also secured long-term feedstock supply agreements with Danish agricultural cooperatives, ensuring a steady input of raw materials through to 2032. It has also secured land suitable for Power-to-X projects, including the development of e-SAF.

By combining Sumitomo Corporation’s extensive European business network with Skovgaard Energy’s technical expertise and local partnerships, North Sky aims to become a key player in Denmark’s green energy transition.

Denmark’s near-total reliance on renewable electricity makes it well placed to produce green hydrogen, a key component in the synthesis of e-SAF. With its own network of biogas plants, the new joint venture will also be able to supply the necessary biomass-derived carbon dioxide efficiently and cost-effectively.

The collaboration aligns with the Sumitomo Corporation Group’s wider commitment to achieving carbon neutrality across its operations by 2050. The group is already active in other bioenergy projects globally, including the MORISORA Project in Japan for domestic SAF production, and a partnership with Malaysian firm reNIKOLA to explore biomethane opportunities in Southeast Asia.",https://www.bioenergy-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/skorsgaard.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 06:02:42.202114

About Otto Otto Aviation is an advanced aerospace company committed to transforming private and regional aviation through innovative aircraft design.","PARIS, June 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Otto Aviation, a pioneering force in sustainable aviation, held a press briefing today at the Paris Air Show where CEO Paul Touw announced the company would achieve net-zero carbon emissions with its Phantom 3500 aircraft when it enters service around 2030 – two decades ahead of the aviation industry’s net-zero carbon goal.

The aviation industry has set a goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. This goal, adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and supported by organizations like the International Air Transport Association (IATA), aims to mitigate the industry's impact on climate change by balancing CO2 emissions with equivalent amounts sequestered or offset.

Touw’s remarks took the assembled journalists and industry leaders behind the scenes of Otto’s groundbreaking aircraft, the Phantom 3500, the first true aircraft of the sustainability era. With an AI-supported clean sheet design, transonic super-laminar flow architecture, and cutting-edge aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 is a lightweight, ultra-low-drag aircraft that burns 60 percent less fuel than similar-sized jets and reduces emissions by 90 percent when combined with sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Phantom 3500 is the result of relentless innovation and bold thinking,” said CEO Touw during his remarks. “By achieving carbon neutrality 20 years ahead of the 2050 target, we’re not just meeting expectations—Otto is redefining what’s possible in aviation. It’s a transformative step toward a future where cutting-edge technology and sustainability go hand in hand.”

On the inside, the Phantom 3500 provides space for nine passengers and has a cabin height of 6 and a half feet. In place of traditional porthole-style windows along the fuselage, the Phantom 3500 includes high-definition digital displays called Super Natural Vision™, which provides passengers with views of the sky and scenery while also enjoying increased efficiency thanks to the streamlined design.

Otto Aviation plans to manufacture the Phantom 3500 at Cecil Airport in Jacksonville, Florida, an announcement made yesterday at the Paris Air Show by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. The company will invest approximately $430 million and move its headquarters to the city. Otto’s plan is to establish initial operations in an available hangar, then build a new plant to manufacture the Phantom 3500 on land at the airfield. The company plans to begin flight tests by early 2027, and aims to achieve certification and enter service in 2030.

The roadmap spans seven fuels—bioethanol, compressed biogas (CBG), biodiesel, bio-pellets, green hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), and bio-methanol—with a production target of 2.2 exajoules (EJ) by 2029-30. Bio-pellets and green hydrogen will dominate, with ethanol, biodiesel, and CBG also playing vital roles. While often derived from organic waste and considered sustainable, these fuels lose credibility when food crops are diverted, or land is repurposed—raising hard questions about food security, land use, and fairness.

The food-fuel-feed tradeoff is a concern. Meeting the 2025-26 ethanol target (10.16 billion litres) may require 275 million tonnes (MT) of sugarcane, 6.1 MT of maize, and 5.5 MT of rice—using up to seven million hectares of cropland. This diverts resources from food and poultry feed, threatening nutrition security and rural livelihoods.

Another aspect is subsidisation of fuel via food subsidy. In Ethanol Supply Year (ESY) 2024-25, 5.2 MT of rice from the Food Corporation of India was sold for ethanol production at Rs 22.5/kilogram (kg). This was well below the economic cost of producing a kg of rice at Rs 42. The price gap was absorbed through the national food subsidy. This raises concerns about the use of grains from public stocks for fuel, especially when surpluses are driven by minimum support price-linked bonuses.

There is also the impact on meal markets. Ethanol by-product Dried Distillers Grains with Solubles or DDGS is displacing soybean meal in animal feed, depressing soybean prices and discouraging domestic crushing. Despite surplus soybean, edible oil imports continue, undermining farmer incomes and India’s self-reliance goals.

And what of energy efficiency? Producing a kg of green hydrogen requires 60-70 kWh of power but yields only 33-37 kWh, raising concerns about efficiency and energy returns.

Biofuels can support India’s green transition—especially when waste-based. But using food crops or subsidies for fuel creates difficult trade-offs.

According to the EU’s own published fuel cost data, the average SAF price is around 2.8 times higher than conventional jet fuel.
Blending just 4.8% SAF and 1.2% RFNBO into the fuel mix raises total airline fuel costs by approximately 21%, which translates to an 8% increase in overall flight costs.
And it exemplifies a wider trend in EU policy—one where symbolic targets take precedence over system-wide efficiency and cost-benefit logic.
As it stands, ReFuelEU appears less like a climate win and more like a cautionary tale in how not to design sustainable policy.","When the European Commission quietly authored an aviation industry declaration on sustainable fuels, later sent to airline lobbyists for sign-off, it wasn’t just a bureaucratic misstep—it was a symptom of a deeper issue with the EU’s climate policy design. Behind the symbolic push for greener skies lies a regulation—ReFuelEU—that risks imposing real costs on businesses and travelers while delivering negligible climate benefits.

Under ReFuelEU, the EU mandates that by 2030, all flights departing from EU airports must use at least 6% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), with 1.2% of that consisting of Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs), such as hydrogen-derived e-kerosene. On paper, the policy aims to decarbonize one of the hardest-to-abate sectors. In practice, the arithmetic paints a different picture.

According to the EU’s own published fuel cost data, the average SAF price is around 2.8 times higher than conventional jet fuel. RFNBOs—still in early development and production—come in at an eye-watering 11.5 times the cost. Blending just 4.8% SAF and 1.2% RFNBO into the fuel mix raises total airline fuel costs by approximately 21%, which translates to an 8% increase in overall flight costs. In a sector already wrestling with razor-thin margins and post-pandemic volatility, the mandate risks pricing out consumers while subsidizing inefficiency.

Critically, the environmental return on this regulatory investment is dismal. The 1.2% RFNBO blend would reduce EU emissions by an estimated 0.02%—a number so small it’s statistically negligible. And it gets worse. The renewable electricity used to produce e-kerosene could yield emissions reductions nine times higher if redirected to sectors like residential heating (via heat pumps), electric vehicles, or displacing coal in the power grid. In other words, the SAF mandate not only misallocates scarce green energy, it does so in a way that ultimately increases overall climate inefficiency.

While the ReFuelEU policy does not rely on direct subsidies, its costs are very real. They are embedded in consumer airfares and the operating costs of freight and business travel, feeding directly into inflation. At a time when the EU faces populist backlash over the cost of living, this kind of opaque climate policymaking—where high costs produce negligible results—undermines public trust and provides ammunition for political opponents of the energy transition.

The RFNBO quota in particular seems emblematic of what Michael Liebreich calls “badly-designed net zero policy”: expensive, ineffective, and politically convenient. It shifts wealth toward favored industrial players while failing to deliver meaningful environmental progress. And it exemplifies a wider trend in EU policy—one where symbolic targets take precedence over system-wide efficiency and cost-benefit logic.

The aviation sector needs decarbonization pathways, but not at any cost, and certainly not at the expense of more effective carbon abatement elsewhere. As it stands, ReFuelEU appears less like a climate win and more like a cautionary tale in how not to design sustainable policy.",https://energynews.biz/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/airport.jpg,N,,2025-06-17 07:02:23.454843

However, this significant milestone still represents just 0.7% of total airline fuel consumption, highlighting the substantial journey ahead for complete aviation decarbonisation and the massive scale required for meaningful environmental impact.

SAF costs approximately five times more than conventional jet fuel due to complex production processes and limited availability of sustainable raw materials. The ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation mandates minimum 2% SAF supply in Europe starting 2025, progressively increasing to 70% by 2050, with sub-mandates for synthetic e-fuels beginning at 0.7% in 2030. Airlines face additional US$4.4 billion in global fuel costs, with European carriers potentially spending an extra US$1.7 billion for regulatory compliance, raising concerns about cost pass-through to passengers.

Despite implementation challenges and elevated costs, industry leaders maintain optimism about SAF’s long-term potential for aviation transformation. SAF could contribute approximately 65% of emission reductions needed for aviation’s ambitious 2050 net-zero target, requiring massive production increases primarily in the 2030s when policy support becomes global and SAF achieves cost parity with fossil kerosene. Current production predominantly utilises the HEFA method using cooking oils and animal fats, but diversification into Alcohol-to-Jet and Fischer-Tropsch processes using biological and agricultural wastes could significantly boost volumes.

To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, IATA estimates between 3,000 to 6,500 new renewable fuel plants will be required globally, demanding annual investment of US$128 billion over thirty years. Co-processing existing refineries with renewable feedstocks could save US$347 billion in capital expenditure by 2050.

Australia’s private aviation sector increasingly embraces SAF adoption for charter flights operations. Industry leaders advocate for government support through production incentives rather than punitive mandates that raise operational costs. Book-and-claim systems allow Australian charter operators to access SAF credits globally whilst local infrastructure develops, supporting environmental commitments without operational disruption.

Conclusion Safran and Saft's collaboration is a masterclass in strategic alignment, combining technological prowess with regulatory know-how to tackle aviation's toughest challenges.","The aviation industry's race to decarbonize is intensifying, and Safran and Saft—two French powerhouses in aerospace and battery technology—are positioning themselves to lead the charge. Their collaboration to develop an 800V high-voltage battery system for hybrid and fully electric aircraft represents a critical milestone in aviation electrification. By combining Safran's expertise in aircraft systems integration with Saft's cutting-edge battery chemistry, the partnership aims to redefine sustainable aviation while capturing market share in a sector projected to grow exponentially.

A Strategic Play for Technological Leadership

The aviation industry faces a dual challenge: reducing emissions while maintaining the performance and safety standards demanded by regulators and passengers. Electrification is the clear path forward, but progress has been hampered by battery limitations in energy density, safety, and scalability. Safran and Saft's partnership addresses these pain points head-on. Their modular 800V battery system, initially using lithium manganese ferro phosphate (LMFP) chemistry, is designed to be adaptable to aircraft ranging from 9-seat commuter planes to narrowbody jets like future A320 variants. This scalability is a game-changer, as it allows the system to serve both hybrid and fully electric architectures, appealing to manufacturers of all sizes.

The partnership's roadmap, however, is even more ambitious. By 2029, they aim to transition to solid-state batteries—a leap that could double energy density and enhance safety by eliminating flammable liquid electrolytes. Solid-state technology, already being pursued by automotive giants like Toyota and CATL, is still in its infancy for aviation. Safran and Saft's goal to flight-test their system by 2029—reaching Technology Readiness Level 6—could put them years ahead of competitors. This timeline aligns with broader industry trends: .

Safety and Certification: The Critical Edge

Aviation's stringent safety standards make certification a major barrier for new technologies. Here, Safran's decades of experience in thermal management and system integration are invaluable. The battery's advanced thermal runaway containment and proprietary safety algorithms are engineered to meet the rigorous requirements of CS-25-category aircraft—the regulatory class covering large commercial planes. This expertise, combined with Saft's leadership in battery chemistry, reduces the risk of costly delays.

The collaboration also benefits from French government support through the DGAC-funded aviation battery consortium, ensuring alignment with certification bodies. This institutional backing underscores the project's strategic importance for Europe's green aviation goals, potentially unlocking public-private funding streams.

Market Opportunity and Catalysts for Growth

The electric aircraft market is nascent but rapidly expanding. Regional and commuter airlines are early adopters, but the real prize is the $500 billion market for narrowbody and single-aisle jets. Safran and Saft's modular system positions them to dominate both tiers. Their ability to scale from 9 to 100+ seats without redesigning the core battery architecture gives them a cost and time-to-market advantage over rivals like Siemens or MagniX, which focus on smaller segments.

The 2029 flight-test milestone is a pivotal catalyst. Success here would validate the system's readiness for commercialization, attracting aircraft manufacturers like Airbus or Embraer to partner on development programs. Meanwhile, the transition to solid-state batteries post-2029 could solidify their leadership as energy density improves, enabling longer ranges and larger aircraft.

Risks and Investment Considerations

Investors should weigh the risks. Competitors in battery tech—such as CATL's aviation division or Tesla's rumored forays into aerospace—are formidable. Delays in certification or solid-state technology development could erode margins. Additionally, geopolitical tensions over battery raw materials (e.g., lithium, cobalt) pose supply chain challenges.

However, the partnership's near-term focus on LMFP-based systems mitigates some of these risks. LMFP is proven, cost-effective, and aligns with existing supply chains. By targeting hybrid-electric regional aircraft first, Safran and Saft can generate revenue and data while scaling up toward solid-state adoption.

The Investment Thesis

Safran's stock () has historically been a stable play on aerospace recovery, but its battery venture offers a secular growth catalyst. The partnership's 2029 milestone, if achieved, could accelerate adoption of their systems by manufacturers, driving recurring revenue streams from battery sales, servicing, and upgrades.

For investors, this is a “buy the dip” opportunity in a sector poised for long-term growth. Safran's valuation currently trades at 15x forward earnings—below its 5-year average—despite its electrification tailwinds. Meanwhile, Saft's parent, TotalEnergies (TTE.F), has been divesting fossil fuel assets to fund green initiatives, suggesting sustained investment in the venture.

Conclusion

Safran and Saft's collaboration is a masterclass in strategic alignment, combining technological prowess with regulatory know-how to tackle aviation's toughest challenges. Their roadmap—LMFP now, solid-state later—positions them as pioneers in a $2 trillion electrification market. For investors, backing this partnership means betting on a future where sustainable flight isn't just possible but profitable. The 2029 flight test will be a litmus test, but the groundwork is already laid for leadership in the skies of tomorrow.

Europe leads in announcements but lags in implementation

T&E’s analysis reveals that Europe holds more than half of the world’s announced e-kerosene production capacity, with around 40 large-scale projects planned that could produce close to 3 million tonnes annually — about 5% of the fuel needed by Europe’s aviation sector. This fuel could reduce aviation CO? emissions by up to 90%, making it vital for decarbonizing the emission-intensive industry.

However, despite this leadership in announced projects, none are yet under construction. Only four projects are at an advanced stage, and no final investment decisions (FID) have been made. The biggest barriers are financing challenges, high energy costs, infrastructure issues, CO? sourcing difficulties, and the notable absence of major oil companies, which continue to invest heavily in fossil fuels rather than e-kerosene.

Camile Mutrelle, Aviation Policy Officer at T&E, said “The EU’s law on sustainable aviation fuels kick-started an e-kerosene revolution in Europe – but fuel suppliers are not cashing in on this potential. Without more final investment decisions, the EU’s 2030 target and plans to prosper from green aviation will fail. To succeed, these projects need a stable legal framework, as provided by ReFuelEU, and funding through an array of public support mechanisms and private capital investments.”

Global competition and calls for stronger EU support

While Europe currently leads, other regions are gaining ground. China hosts about 10 large-scale projects, accounting for roughly 20% of global capacity. The United States is accelerating as well, with the first large-scale plant FID recently secured by US startups.

Funding bottlenecks and oil majors are hampering progress

T&E calls on EU leaders to reaffirm their commitment to the existing ReFuelEU targets ahead of the 2027 legislative review and to prioritize e-kerosene in the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The organization also recommends establishing a European market intermediary with a double-sided auction mechanism to solve current financing bottlenecks.

The results provide critical insights for aerospace leaders transitioning to sustainable, low-emission fuels, while ensuring safety and reliability.

As the aerospace industry focuses on decarbonization, SAFs offer substantial CO2 reductions of over 65% compared to traditional jet fuels. Nevertheless, challenges like seal compatibility remain. To address this, Greene Tweed conducted rigorous testing to ensure its seals perform effectively with these advanced fuels.

""Sustainable aviation fuels offer a practical path to reducing emissions, particularly for long-haul flights, where batteries and hydrogen remain less feasible,” said Shawn McCloskey, Greene Tweed Chief Commercial Officer. “Our study ensures aerospace customers have reliable seal solutions for SAF adoption without compromising safety or performance.”

Greene Tweed collaborated with multiple suppliers to evaluate SAF blends and their effects on the physical properties of fluorine-based elastomers FKM and FVMQ. The study assessed performance in SAF blends, including Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) and Synthetic Aromatic Kerosene (SAK), following ASTM D7566 standards. Testing simulated extreme aerospace environments, including temperatures up to 120°C and prolonged SAF exposure.

Key findings from the study include:

Consistent Performance: FKM compounds (731, 772, 665) maintained performance across blends, including three SPKs, 50/50 blends with control fluid, and 20% SAK with 80% SPKs.

Material Properties: FKM elastomers showed strong compatibility with harsh SAF conditions, including fluid aging and dry-out scenarios.

Aromatic Content Impact: Aromatic content in SAF formulations, particularly SAK blends, is critical for maintaining material performance.

Advanced Testing Protocols: Testing under accelerated aging conditions confirmed long-term reliability.

“By analyzing the effects of chemical interactions between SAF blends and advanced elastomers, we have developed a robust data set that established long-term reliability and compatibility in extreme aerospace conditions,” noted Ronald Campbell, PhD, Senior Technical Advisor.

As the aviation industry works toward carbon-neutral growth, with U.S. airlines targeting a 50% CO2 reduction by 2050, SAFs are vital. Greene Tweed’s findings support these goals, ensuring component compatibility with SAF while maintaining safety and operational performance. These results were highlighted in a recent Aviation Week webinar, where Greene Tweed detailed its testing process. Representatives will also discuss these solutions at the Paris Air Show 2025.

Click from there and you'll be directed to the Wheels Up website, where you can charter a private aircraft for the final leg of your journey.
Between each leg, Wheels Up arranges a private transfer service that can pick you up directly from the tarmac, when permitted.
(In 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it’s not yet widely available at the majority of airports.)","For most travelers, flying to Europe's summer hot spots like the South of France, Amalfi Coast, or Greek Islands requires a lengthy, multi-stop journey: The transatlantic flight takes a day of travel in itself, and then you have to factor in layovers, hours spent at the airport, and final-leg drives, puddle jumpers, or ferry rides. That is, unless you have a private jet to whisk you straight there.

This summer, Delta Air Lines is making it easier for commercial fliers to get to hard-to-reach destinations like these with the option to connect international Delta flights to “last leg” jet charters via Wheels Up, a private aviation company (of which Delta is a major shareholder).

Here's how it works. If you purchase a flight in Delta One, the airline's business class cabin, to Athens, Barcelona, Naples, Nice, or Rome this summer, you'll receive an email or mobile app prompt notifying you of the ability to book your onward travel plans—perhaps to St. Tropez, the Amalfi Coast, Mykonos, or Ibiza—through Wheels Up. Click from there and you'll be directed to the Wheels Up website, where you can charter a private aircraft for the final leg of your journey.

A real-life itinerary includes a Delta One flight between New York-JFK and London Heathrow, followed by a charter plane from Farnborough Airport to Toulon Hyères Airport in France, ending with a helicopter ride or car transfer to St. Tropez. Between each leg, Wheels Up arranges a private transfer service that can pick you up directly from the tarmac, when permitted.

While the details—and pricing—will vary depending on the trip, the whole idea is to get you as close to your final destination in as little amount of time as possible. Thanks to its 2022 acquisition of the UK-based private aviation company Air Partner, Wheels Up's charter business now has access to 7,000 aircraft around the world, including seaplanes, helicopters, and private jets of varying sizes, such as the Bombardier Challenger 300 jet and Embraer Phenom 300 (both can seat up to 9 passengers). The vast network means both the aircraft type and destinations are incredibly customizable.

“Delta has a huge global network, they fly to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of airports,” George Mattson, CEO of Wheels Up and former member of Delta's Board of Directors, tells Condé Nast Traveler. “But if you connect it now to Wheels Up, it's every airport—it's infinite.”

For travelers concerned about the environmental impact of private jet travel, Wheels Up customers have the option to purchase Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) through Delta’s SAF program, something that is not typically available to private fliers due to the fuel’s limited availability. (In 2024, it only accounted for 0.3% of global jet fuel production, and it’s not yet widely available at the majority of airports.)

The integration between the Delta and Wheels Up also includes loyalty program incentives: Wheels Up Members who spend $100,000 over a one-year period receive Diamond Medallion Status with Delta, and Delta SkyMiles members with Diamond or Platinum Medallion status can select a Wheels Up private flight credit as one of their annual Choice Benefits (Diamond members receive a $2,000 credit, while Platinum members receive a $1,500 credit). And this summer, Wheels Up members who purchase a new fund or add to their existing balance through June 30, 2025 will receive Delta SkyMiles Diamond Medallion Status along with one of three reward options: up to 5% in Wheels Up Flight Credit, up to 1 million bonus SkyMiles, or enhanced fund benefits, including lower maximum hourly rates.

The ultimate goal is to merge two historically siloed sectors of the aviation industry to better serve the flying habits of premium travelers. “The vast majority of people who fly private also fly commercial,” says Mattson. “So why should they have to manage these two things separately?”","https://media.cntraveler.com/photos/684c8ae502a22aa7433f8c07/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/33494_09.jpg",N,,2025-06-17 00:58:53.903636

Greenwashing is when companies use deceptive claims to convince the public that their products or operations are environmentally friendly.","The European aviation industry is awash with misleading climate-related claims, consumer groups said Tuesday, over a year after the EU launched a probe into airlines' greenwashing.

An analysis of 17 air carriers found many misled passengers by suggesting that flying was more eco-friendly than it really is -- a breach of EU rules -- pan-European consumers organisation BEUC said.

""Travellers are lulled into believing they are choosing a sustainable transportation rather than a highly polluting one,"" said BEUC director general Agustin Reyna.

Aviation accounts for up to four percent of all the European Union's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Brussels.

In 2023 BEUC filed a complaint with the European Commission, accusing European airlines of greenwashing and unfair commercial practices for inflating their green credentials.

A year later, the commission opened a probe, which is still ongoing, into 20 firms over misleading green claims.

In a report published to coincide with the Paris Air Show, a major trade fair, BEUC said Tuesday that little has since changed.

Some of the airlines analysed have removed or amended their climate-related marketing claims.

Norwegian airlines for example removed all climate-related claims during the booking process and Wizz Air similarly did away with an option touted as offsetting carbon emissions.

But other changes have often been light, such as the choice of words or colour codes.

""These improvements should not hide that greenwashing is still widespread,"" said Reyna.

Airlines for Europe (A4E), an industry association, said it did not have any comment beyond what it said last year.

After the EU probe was launched, the group said it recognised the importance of clear, transparent information about sustainability -- and it was engaging in discussions with EU bodies to that end.

BEUC Tuesday said that many of the companies analysed, which included Air France and Lufthansa, still offered ""green"" fares, charging passengers more to purchase carbon credits or sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Yet, the former did little to offset a flight's climate impact, and the latter were not widely available.

EU rules currently require carriers to include only two percent of SAF in their fuel mix.

Airlines also often oversold their long-term sustainability goals, BEUC said.

Greenwashing is when companies use deceptive claims to convince the public that their products or operations are environmentally friendly.

The New Rise Reno facility initially produced renewable diesel but was later converted to SAF production.

New Rise Renewables in April 2024 announced that work was underway to convert its existing renewable diesel plant located near Reno, Nevada, to SAF production. The 3,200 barrel per day (49.06 MMgy) renewable diesel plant originally began operations in mid-2022.

Development of the facility was supported by loan guarantee awarded through the USDA’s 9003, Biorefinery, Renewable Chemical and Biodiesel Production Manufacturing Assistance Program, according to Greater Commercial Lending, which helped assemble the loan package that made the project possible. According to a 2017 USDA announcement, the facility at that time was being developed under the name Ryze Renewables Reno LLC.

The plant was the subject of at least two acquisition agreements that were eventually cancelled before XCF completed the acquisition of the facility earlier this year.

The bill, AB 839, was initially introduced in February. Following its passage in the Assembly, the bill was transferred to the California Senate, where it is currently under review by the Committee on Environmental Quality and the Committee on Judiciary.

If signed into law, the legislation would provide for expedited California Environmental Quality Act review for up to three SAF projects that do not use fossil fuels in the production process and meet specified environmental and labor requirements.

CEQA, signed into law in 1970, established statewide regulations for the environmental review of discretionary projects and a process for mitigating or avoiding potential environmental impacts. The review process aims to inform the public, local agencies and decision makers about the potential environmental impacts associated with certain planning approvals.

Separate bills signed into law in 2021 and 2023 allow the California Governors Office of Land Use and Climate Innovation to certify eligible infrastructure projects to benefit from expedited judicial review of lawsuits challenging the projects under CEQA. According to the office, the certification can reduce lawsuit-related delays from 3-5 years to approximately 270 days. Certified projects may also have improved access to financing and be more competitive for federal funding. AB 839 would allow up to three SAF projects to qualify for this expedited judicial review as “infrastructure projects.”

The bill defines SAF projects to include projects to manufacture, process, store, distribute or transport SAF or feedstock used for the production of SAF. If the project involves the conversion or replacement of an existing major source of air pollution, such as a refinery, the project must reduce emissions of air pollutants compared to the baseline environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project. Projects that do not involve the conversion or replacement of an existing major source of air pollution must not cause a significant effect on the environment attributable to any air pollutant.

Through direct meetings with senators, representatives and congressional staff, members from GBTA’s 38 U.S. chapters shared insights and championed policies to advance business travel’s impact as an economic driver and to create a more connected and resilient travel ecosystem.

Held June 10-12, the summit provided industry professionals with the opportunity to network, learn and engage directly with legislators to underscore the value of business travel in the U.S. economy. GBTA also advocated for streamlined international travel, including policies that enhance the traveler experience and restore confidence in U.S. entry processes. GBTA participants also discussed the need to modernize the U.S. air traffic system, support Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and improve passenger rail to provide viable travel alternatives.

“For more than two decades, GBTA has hosted legislative fly-ins to connect business travel experts with U.S. policymakers to foster understanding, advocate for priority issues and facilitate a better experience for business travelers,” said Suzanne Neufang, CEO, GBTA. “By promoting the strategic role of business travel in driving economies, innovation, jobs and strategic collaboration, we foster a more resilient future for business travelers and those who support them.”

Summit attendees heard perspectives directly from members of Congress, including Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nevada) and Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington), as well as from various experts on critical topics, including air traffic system modernization, the evolution of SAF and improving U.S. passenger rail travel.

In close to 150 meetings with legislators, attendees shared GBTA’s policy priorities for U.S. business travel. Based on these priorities, GBTA constituents asked legislators to:

Support the modernization of the air traffic system

Improve business travel at U.S. borders

Support funding for the hiring of 5,000 additional Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers

Reject efforts to extend the diversion of the 9/11 Passenger Security Fee

Support additional resources for CBP’s implementation of the Entry and Exit Program in order to accelerate the safe facilitation of business travelers at the nation’s points of entry

Support the inclusion of the extension of the Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) through 2031

Support future funding for U.S. rail improvements

Summit attendees also shared with Congressional members key takeaways from the “GBTA U.S. Economic Impact Study: Business Travel’s Impact on Jobs and the U.S. Economy” outlining how U.S. business travel contributes $484.4 billion annually, or 1.9% of the U.S. gross domestic product. They also showcased GBTA’s recent poll results reflecting industry concern about the potential negative impact of U.S. government actions on business travel.

GBTA presented Rep. Rick Larsen (D-Washington) and Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) as the 2025 recipients of its GBTA Navigator Award. The award is presented to elected officials who have been strong advocates for issues integral to the business travel industry and recognizes them for championing the needs of business travelers and the broader travel sector.

Rep. Larsen is the Ranking Member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and in his role, he has advocated for safety and efficiency for aviation. Last year, he worked in a bipartisan fashion to pass the Federal Aviation Administration Re-Authorization Bill, which included several GBTA-supported priorities such as safety improvements to the National Airspace System, studies to improve accessibility concerns and workforce investments to train more pilots and air traffic controllers. This year, Rep. Larsen has worked with the Department of Transportation to make improvements to our nation’s air traffic control system, strategically enhance the workforce for long-term success, and foster innovation to improve aviation safety.

Sen. Moran has championed increasing the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Late last year, he formed the bipartisan SAF Caucus to find ways to promote technologically innovative solutions to create a sustainable aviation industry and increase U.S. competitiveness in the domestic production of SAF.

On Friday, India’s civil aviation minister confirmed that the aircraft’s black boxes had been found at the crash site.
Scheibner said: “This puts the dual-engine failure theory in first place.
“It must be said that the 787 Dreamliner has a very good safety record.
It had a very long certification period with the FAA.” Boeing has not had the best safety track record of late.","Early speculations on the fatal crash in India last week of the Air India-operated Boeing 787 Dreamliner point to possible dual-engine failure.

On Thursday (12 June), the aeroplane crashed into a residential area shortly after take-off from Ahmedabad, India, en route to London Gatwick.

Of the 242 passengers and crew onboard only one person survived, and an additional 38 fatalities occurred on the ground. This makes it the deadliest aviation disaster in India in nearly two decades.

On Friday, India’s civil aviation minister confirmed that the aircraft’s black boxes had been found at the crash site. Flight data, including all the cockpit conversations, will be crucial in determining the cause of the crash.

While the facts around the crash will only be known once a full analysis of this data is complete, there has been some speculation as to the possible cause of the crash.

For instance, Captain Steve Scheibner, a former US Navy pilot, told US broadcaster CNBC that, having scrutinised video footage of the flight, he could see what looked to be the deployment of the ram air turbine (RAT), which activates automatically in the event of a massive electrical, hydraulic or dual-engine failure.

Scheibner said: “This puts the dual-engine failure theory in first place. But we’re still at square one. We don’t know why both engines on a 787 flamed out after take-off. It’s a real head-scratcher.”

However, the crash may not be the result of a single factor.

Ali Elham, professor of multidisciplinary design optimisation in the department of aeronautics and astronautics at the University of Southampton, told The Conversation that often these sorts of crashes involved a “chain of problems”.

According to The Times of India, a team of officials from Boeing and the FAA have arrived on site to assist in the inquiry, which is being led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.

As these organisations work together to establish the facts around the crash, no doubt questions will be raised about Boeing's safety record, albeit this is the first fatal crash of a Dreamliner.

Elham said: “Unless investigators identify a recurring technical problem that poses an immediate risk to other 787s, a fleet-wide grounding would be unlikely. Safety is always the top priority, but regulatory responses typically depend on whether an issue appears to be isolated or part of a broader pattern.

“It must be said that the 787 Dreamliner has a very good safety record. It had a very long certification period with the FAA.”

Boeing has not had the best safety track record of late. In 2020, the US-based aircraft manufacturer saw the grounding of its 737 Max planes following two fatal crashes caused by faulty flight control systems.

There have also been incidents of engine parts falling off soon after take-off in 2021 and again in April 2024 .

In January 2024, an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 suffered a mid-flight blowout of a plug filling an unused emergency exit, causing rapid decompression of the aircraft.

These incidents caused the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to investigate Boeing’s manufacturing process. In 2020, the FAA reported that the two Boeing 737 Max crashes were the result of “a disturbing pattern of technical miscalculations and troubling management misjudgments”.

To add to Boeing’s woes, in April 2025 it was scrambling to find buyers for as many as 50 planes sent back to the company by Chinese airlines following tariff hikes by the Trump administration.",https://eandt.theiet.org/sites/default/files/styles/uncropped_small/public/2025-06/web--Boeing-787-Dreamlinershutterstock_2640374705.jpg?itok=FLfUkyAd,N,,2025-06-16 16:02:02.448311

The company cites increasing jet fuel demand and decreasing gasoline demand as the reason for the project.

Carbon sequestration is key to producing low-carbon jet fuel and increasing profitability.

Gevo is also considering expanding the ethanol plant and adding wind turbines.

WEST FARGO, N.D. — The demand for jet fuel is going up. The demand for gasoline is going down.

That’s the simple explanation from Chris Ryan, the president and chief operating officer of Gevo, on why the company plans to add a sustainable aviation fuel plant to the corn-based ethanol plant it purchased at Richardton in southwest North Dakota.

Ryan said the low-carbon jet fuel won’t come cheap – throwing out a ballpark figure of $500 million for a potential project still years down the road.

Ryan spoke Tuesday in Fargo at the Midwest Agriculture Summit hosted by The Chamber of Fargo, Moorhead and West Fargo.

Colorado-based Gevo bought the Red Trail Energy ethanol plant at Richardton last year.

The Red Trail plant was the first ethanol producer in the country to implement carbon sequestration — capturing carbon dioxide from the plant’s corn fermentation tanks and pumping it into permanent underground storage.

The CO2 sequestration is key in lowering the carbon intensity score of the plant and for sustainable jet fuel production. Low-carbon fuels can fetch a higher price than traditional liquid fuels.

“We could make gasoline, but it’s a diminishing market,” Ryan said. “So jet fuel is a kind of sexy thing to talk about these days.”

In an interview with the North Dakota Monitor, Ryan said there is plenty of room to add a jet fuel plant at the 500-acre Richardton site. He said the plant would add about 50 jobs, about the same number that the ethanol plant employs.

Expanding the ethanol plant also is a possibility, Ryan said.

The company also is considering adding wind turbines at Richardton to provide power and lower the carbon score even further, he said. Even though renewable energy tax credits are a possible target for budget cuts under President Donald Trump, he said wind energy at the site still makes good economic sense.

Gevo also has plans for a sustainable aviation fuel plant at Lake Preston in southeast South Dakota.

The future of that plant depends in large part on the five-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline project that would take carbon emissions from ethanol plants to western North Dakota for underground storage.

Ryan said when the South Dakota project was conceived, it did not include carbon capture. But as construction costs soared with the COVID-19 pandemic, he said it became necessary to sign on to the Summit pipeline project. He said the federal tax credits for carbon sequestration would help offset the higher building costs.

The project has stalled as Summit has run into permitting challenges and a new state law giving landowners more power in easement negotiations.

“We really need the pipeline,” Ryan said.

He added that Gevo bought more land than it needed for the project. That is allowing for other projects at the site, benefiting Gevo and the Lake Preston area, he said.

The Summit delays spurred the purchase of Red Trail, which had the advantage of sitting almost on top of an area suitable for underground carbon storage.

“We had to take our destiny into our own hands,” Ryan said, and not be dependent on the Summit pipeline.

He said Gevo can “copy and paste” the engineering work done for the South Dakota site to the Richardton site.

While the carbon dioxide from the Richardton plant is being pumped underground, Ryan said Gevo recognizes that it has a potential for use in North Dakota’s oilfields, making oil wells more productive through what is called enhanced oil recovery.

North Dakota leaders have been trumpeting the economic benefits of enhanced oil recovery.

Ryan said if the oil industry is willing to pay for carbon dioxide to use in enhanced oil recovery, Gevo would sell the CO2 rather than pump it underground.

“We don’t care where the revenue comes from, right? Today, we sequester it for a tax credit, and we can sell carbon credits,” Ryan said. “Or you can sell it to somebody for enhanced oil recovery.”

He said he sees it as another advantage of doing business in North Dakota.

“People in North Dakota get that, they understand the value of that,” Ryan said.

A new initiative aims to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from domestically grown canola, potentially transforming both the energy and agriculture sectors, reports ACB.Net.

Aviation accounts for around 2.5% of global carbon emissions and is among the hardest industries to decarbonise. The growing global demand for SAF is now positioning Australian-grown canola—long valued for its oil and pretty yellow flowers—as a potential solution.

Currently, most Australian canola is exported to Europe, where it is processed into biofuel. Now, a local plan led by fuel company Ampol, agribusiness GrainCorp, and investment firm IFM Investors is exploring how to refine canola oil within Australia for use in aviation.

GrainCorp is planning a new canola crushing facility capable of processing 1 million tonnes of canola each year—almost double the capacity of its existing plant in Numurkah, Victoria. Although a site hasn’t been finalized, options include Western Australia and New South Wales. The by-product, canola meal, would be used for livestock feed, while the oil would be transported to Ampol’s Brisbane refinery to be converted into renewable diesel and SAF.

Brent Merrick from Ampol described the project as a major opportunity, with engineering already underway and a target production date around 2030. “This is a rare chance to make a real change in how Australia produces and uses energy,” he said.

However, the companies involved say they’ll need government support to get the SAF sector off the ground. Don Campbell from GrainCorp said that while SAF is currently more expensive than conventional jet fuel, financial assistance could help bridge the gap.

“We’re still figuring out how much support we need,” said Campbell, adding that temporary subsidies, start-up funding, and government mandates for airlines to use SAF could all be part of the package.

Australian airlines are already showing interest. Qantas recently imported nearly 2 million litres of SAF from Malaysia—enough to power about 900 Sydney-to-Auckland flights once blended.

The federal government has committed over $30 million toward building an SAF industry in Australia, including $8 million for Ampol and $6 million for GrainCorp. In addition, a $250 million fund has been announced to accelerate local low-carbon liquid fuel production.

Speaking at a GrainCorp facility, Transport Minister Catherine King emphasized the importance of keeping value-added production within Australia. “It doesn’t make sense to keep sending our feedstock overseas to make low-carbon fuels,” she said. “We should be doing this here—for our farmers, our manufacturing sector, and the broader economy.”

The national science agency CSIRO estimates that a domestic SAF industry could contribute up to $12 billion annually to the Australian economy. GrainGrowers spokesperson Zach Whale said regional areas would benefit the most, with added fuel security and more market options for farmers.

“We don’t expect farmers to abandon other crops, but canola could see stronger domestic demand and better prices,” Whale noted.

CSIRO scientist Dr. Cathryn O’Sullivan highlighted the importance of sustainability checks to ensure food systems aren’t negatively affected. “This isn’t a roadblock, but we do need strong measures to balance food production and fuel use,” she said.

Canola, she added, is a good example of a dual-purpose crop: its oil can be used for either food or fuel, and the remaining meal supports the livestock industry.

Whale agreed, stressing the dual benefits: “It’s not about choosing between food and fuel—it’s about producing both.”

This year, Australian grain growers are expected to harvest 5.7 million tonnes of canola from 3.4 million hectares, indicating that the crop’s future could be as prominent in energy as it is in agriculture.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2025-06-16 15:04:45.802515

The so-called Le Bourget Declaration backs the Commission’s targets for increasing the use of sustainable aviation fuel, which are included in the ReFuelEU legislation, starkly contrasting with the recent request from major European airlines to delay.

It is set to be presented to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas during the Paris Air Show at Le Bourget Airport, which starts on Monday.

“This didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE,” a lobby representative told POLITICO, speaking on condition of anonymity. DG MOVE is the Commission’s department for mobility and transport.

“A couple of weeks ago, DG MOVE contacted us and said, ‘We want you to sign this and give it to the Commissioner,’” the lobbyist said. “Officially, it’s our initiative, but unofficially it came from the Commission, which is highly unusual.”

The Commission did not respond to a request for comment.

Other lobbyists confirmed they received the document from DG MOVE weeks ago. They responded by asking that the draft be integrated with actual industry requests, such as introducing a tradability system for SAF called book-and-claim, which the Commission has so far opposed.

A draft of the document, seen by POLITICO, includes this request.

“Now it’s basically a Frankenstein that carries all sorts of different messages,” said another lobbyist.

“In the end, it’s probably not going to achieve anything because the main message has been diluted,” the sector representative added.

The industry paper of dubious origin recommends various “calls for immediate action” to be included in the upcoming Sustainable Transport Investment Plan, which Tzitzikostas will announce later this year.

According to an airline representative, the Commission’s efforts to influence the message of the aviation industry are an attempt to repair the communication damage inflicted on ReFuelEU — the EU’s flagship legislation to decarbonize aviation — at the Airlines for Europe summit in late March.

On that occasion, the CEOs of major airlines, including Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, Ryanair and British Airways’ parent company, IAG, called for a delay in what they called “not realistic” mandates aimed at increasing the role of SAF — which is currently mainly made from used cooking oil — in the jet fuel mix.

The first SAF mandate to include at least 2 percent SAF in the jet fuel mix sold to airlines took effect on Jan. 1. But airlines are complaining that they are paying twice the expected price as suppliers are charging them additional “compliance fees” in addition to SAF, which already costs three times the price of fossil kerosene.

In 2030, fuel suppliers will be requested to provide jet fuel that is at least 6 percent SAF, including 1.2 percent of synthetic e-SAF made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2. No final investment decisions have been made on any e-SAF projects in Europe.

“The Commissioner doesn’t want to replicate the disaster of the automotive sector,” said the carrier lobbyist, referring to the ban on selling new gas and diesel vehicles from 2035, a measure openly opposed by many in the car industry. “He wants to ensure that airlines continue to support the measures adopted” with regard to aviation.

The declaration proposes several actions, including the joint creation of a revenue certainty instrument by the Commission and member countries to overcome the mismatch between the long-term production and short-term use of e-SAF.

This mechanism could take the form of contracts for difference, demand aggregation mechanisms, or double-sided auctions, and it should be operational by the end of 2026 to reduce the risk of investing in e-SAF.

Another recommendation is to introduce targeted simplification measures for early movers and small-to-medium businesses investing in SAF to reduce the administrative burden.

Ely’s team focused, in particular, in bringing down the cost of green hydrogen production.
Green hydrogen costs maybe four or five times as much as hydrogen created from fossil fuels,” says Ely.
The pair generated the idea for the company during their long commute while working as colleagues at a West Sussex-based firm developing clean energy technology.
“The standard way of making green ammonia is making hydrogen, then feeding it into a Haber-Bosch reactor, combining it there and then creating green hydrogen.","While there is no shortage of investment in alternative energy sources like hydrogen, sustainable batteries, ammonia and sustainable aviation fuel — about twice as much will be invested in these fields this year as well as into fossil fuel-related developments according to projections by the International Energy Agency. But bringing costs down has been a key hurdle.

A number of startups, backed by SETsquared, a UK enterprise partnership and collaboration between six leading research-led UK universities of Bath, Bristol, Cardiff, Exeter, Southampton and Surrey, are making progress in tackling the cost problem. They are among the 14 startups that will be exhibiting at the GCV Symposium in London this week.

Avena Fuels

Founded: 2024

Located: Shannon, Ireland

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Mark Currass (pictured left), CEO and director of Avena Fuels, came up with the idea for the sustainable aviation fuel startup while discussing some of the challenges of traditional fuel refineries with friends at Shannon Airport Group in Ireland.

The concept focused on a decentralised sustainable aviation fuel refinery, without heavy capital expenditure, suitable to be placed near the source of feedstock or integrated directly into airports.

“Then we started some commercial feasibility studies, working with [UK research institute for manufacturing innovation] The Manufacturing Technology Centre, engaging with universities, talking to some really bright people, and it transpired that not only is it possible, it’s feasible. And we have the capability to reduce the capital investment costs from hundreds of millions to 10s of millions and reduce the time it takes to build these facilities from six-seven years to 12-18 months,” Currass says.

With an experienced team of British airline captains in aviation, sitting on aviation boards, Avena Fuels is currently at a technology readiness level (TRL) 2 or 3, meaning it has a ready proof of concept. It is also working with technologies at an advanced TRL 9 where the technology has qualified through successful operations, and integrating them all into a modular system.

Having gone through a feasibility study and currently fundraising in a seed round for £4.7m, the team is estimating to be at production capacity before 2030.

Avena Fuels has also secured a 10-year contractual agreement from a global purchaser of fuels which has committed to buying an initial 10 million litres of fuel a year. “So that tells us once we’re producing fuels, we can sell them into the marketplace immediately,” Currass says.

In the short term, the company is developing a digital twin of its refinery – a digital physics-based environment which will represent the real-world model with artificial intelligence.

The team is working in collaboration with Siemens to develop the digital twin, with all components, from the size of the pipelines to the pressure valves, as well as adding a virtual feedstock and demonstrating the production of virtual aviation fuel.

Latent Drive

Founded: 2020

Located: Winfrith Newburgh, Dorset, UK

Funding raised to date: $2.2m

The idea for this green hydrogen startup came during the pandemic when there was a shortage of oxygen for the treatment of covid-19 patients. Responding to a UK government call for technologies to help with the shortage, Frazer Ely (pictured left) and his son proposed a device that would extract oxygen from the atmosphere and compress it for use in hospitals.

“We were doing electrochemistry. I’d already been working on electrochemical devices, energy harvesting, and we were splitting and rejoining water molecules within stacks of cells like this. Basically, the same technology as fuel cells and electrolysers,” Ely, CEO of Latent Drive, says.

Following the pandemic, when their help wasn’t needed for oxygen production, they pivoted to focus on green hydrogen.

Ely’s team focused, in particular, in bringing down the cost of green hydrogen production. They engineered their own catalysed electrodes – called catrodes — using industrial stainless steel instead of the much more expensive platinum-coated version.

“The fundamental problem is that green hydrogen is too expensive. People don’t talk about that enough. Green hydrogen costs maybe four or five times as much as hydrogen created from fossil fuels,” says Ely. So the potential of the proprietary technology bringing the cost down is key.

With electricity supply also attaching significant costs to the production of green hydrogen, the team came up with the idea of getting their electrolysers to the source of energy, in this case offshore wind farms in the North Sea.

That’s how they created SeaStack, the first commercial electrolyser designed to go offshore to the wind farm and harvest the energy directly. Latent Drive also designed the technology to run with sea water, instead of having to purify it first.

Being developed side by side, the two technologies are at different stages. “The catrodes are at an advanced stage as we’re now setting up manufacturing facilities for catrodes and getting orders and inquiries in. But SeaStack is at an early stage and it’s going to be a few years before this is ready to go to market,” Ely says.

As a next step in the development of the technologies, Latent Drive is doing a demonstration project, called Hydroport, funded by Innovate UK, at the underused Portland Port in the south of England, powering the harbour patrol boat with hydrogen while developing its prototype SeaStacks.

Rhizo PTX

Founded: 2024

Located: Guildford, Surrey, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Ash Stott and Ben Kyffin are co-founders of green ammonia startup Rhizo PTX, which recently came out of stealth mode. The pair generated the idea for the company during their long commute while working as colleagues at a West Sussex-based firm developing clean energy technology.

As senior electrochemist and materials chemist, Stott and Kyffin were musing about the next generation of fuel, which led them to develop an electrochemical system that directly converts nitrogen, water and electricity into carbon-free green ammonia.

“The standard way of making green ammonia is making hydrogen, then feeding it into a Haber-Bosch reactor, combining it there and then creating green hydrogen. But we’re doing it in a one-step electrochemical way,” Kyffin, now CTO of Rhizo PTX, says.

The main goal of the business is to reduce the cost of green ammonia. The traditional approach of first making green hydrogen and then converting it into green ammonia is not cost competitive with gray ammonia (produced with fossil fuels), because of the longer process it requires.

“Our system is a direct single-step process, which allows us to also unlock the use of intermittent renewable energy, because our system can ramp up and ramp down very quickly with intermittent power,” Stott explains.

In addition to lower costs, the company can use cheaper materials as the technology doesn’t require the use of expensive materials, such as platinum or iridium, increasing the potential for a much more cost competitive green ammonia.

The company just raised a pre-seed round from a venture capital investor, helping it purchase specialised equipment, and has set up a laboratory space in Guildford, south England.

Rhizo PTX is currently at TRL 3, meaning it has completed a proof of concept as it aims to reach commercial scale within the next five years.

The founders are looking to partner with people in the commodity and chemicals trade of ammonia willing to try out a new business model for green ammonia.

“We are considering a new type of business model where instead of selling intellectual property or selling electrochemical systems, we sell the product of our electrochemical system – green ammonia,” Stott says.

There still aren’t many ecosystems in place for selling green ammonia, says Stott. “There’s a lot of interest in creating these systems. The main drivers are new emerging markets and the fact that ammonia can be used as a shipping fuel and as a hydrogen carrier – it’s easier to move ammonia than it is to move hydrogen and you can very easily convert it into hydrogen,” he says.

Its use is also rising in countries like South Korea whose government plans to import 9.27 million tons of ammonia produced from renewable energy and gas by 2030.

Global Nano Network

Founded: 2018

Located: Coventry, West Midlands, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

Ravi Daswani (pictured left), founding partner and CEO of Global Nano Network (GNN), says the team started with the motivation to reduce toxic chemicals required to produce lithium-ion batteries.

The wet chemical process used to make these batteries involves liquefying materials with solvents in an extremely toxic process that uses a great deal of energy as the materials are re-dried afterwards.

“That’s exactly what we fixed at GNN. We got rid of the requirement to use toxic solvent by transitioning from a wet to a dry chemical process. So, what that means is we can go straight from powder to producing the cathode, which means you can reduce your energy intensity,” Daswani, says.

The dry materials manufacturing process has historically had a higher failure rate, but GNN developed a novel step using a technology called hyper foil, which improved efficiency.

This patented technology allows the company to reduce the cost of one specific component in a battery by close to 20% and reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions by close to 50%.

The startup is currently at TRL 5 or 6, meaning it is scaling up and starting to work with large organisations, both as suppliers and potential customers. Meanwhile, it is looking to build the first manufacturing plant for its hyper foil core technology.

With current market pressures and high costs of producing batteries outside the already established manufacturing supply chains in East Asia, competing against those producers doesn’t just involve setting up more businesses elsewhere, “the only real opportunity [to compete] is using technologies that can help reduce costs automation, and this is really what we’re focusing on,” Daswani says.

“This means leapfrogging completely what they’re doing in China today. Instead of using wet chemical processes, let’s focus on the environment. Let’s make ESG a priority and then let’s provide the right technologies that are going to help not only reduce costs but meet the CO2 emission targets.”

Volador Energy

Founded: 2023

Located: Mildenhall, Suffolk, UK

Funding raised to date: Undisclosed

The idea for this battery startup emerged while Sachin Ramesh (pictured left) was developing an electric aircraft at aerospace company Volador FlyTech.

“We faced significant limitations with existing battery technologies – especially in safety, reliability and performance. As interest grew specifically in our battery innovations, we spun off the battery division into a dedicated, independent company to focus on scalable, sustainable energy storage for diverse sectors,” says Ramesh, now director and CEO of the spin-out, Volador Energy.

The battery startup aims to bridge critical gaps in the energy storage market by offering batteries that are modular, repairable at the cell level and free from toxic adhesives or welds.

Its proprietary press-fit casing aims to simplify maintenance and extend lifecycle while optional immersion cooling can enhance safety for high-demand or sensitive environments. This can contribute to grid resilience, off-grid applications and decarbonisation goals.

Immersion-cooled battery systems are gaining traction for their superior thermal management and safety, especially in high-performance sectors like off-road electric vehicles, aviation and industrial energy.

While the market for such batteries is niche and complexity and cost currently remain as adoption barriers, “our modular approach and use-case adaptability help overcome these challenges,” Ramesh adds.

The startup is currently focused on completing certifications, scaling manufacturing and commercialising minimum viable product. “With pilot projects in the UK and India, and strong interest from energy and infrastructure firms globally, we aim to enter new markets by late 2026,” Ramesh says.

These energy startups are part of 14 emerging companies that will be at the GCV Symposium in London on June 18 and 19. This is the full list of startups at the event:",https://globalventuring.com//content/uploads/2025/06/Energy-startups1.png,N,,2025-06-16 12:16:30.574467

G700 demand is growing

Satisfying demand for high-speed, long-range jets, the ultra large-cabin G700 entered service in April 2024. Since then over 50 of the business jets have already been delivered to customers worldwide.

Equipped with Rolls-Royce Pearl 700 engines and Gulfstream-designed advanced aerodynamic wing and high-speed winglet, the G700 has a range of 77,50nm and can be configured with up to five living areas for up to 19 passengers.

Qatar Executive was the Savannah-based OEMs first international customer and is this year showcasing the business jet on the static.

Gulfstream is also showcasing the jet, alongside the G600, with Burns saying he is looking forward to “showcasing the compelling combination of advanced technology, performance and comfort as increased demand for our next-generation aircraft continues in Europe.”

The spacious cabin featuring the Gulfstream Cabin Experience with 100% fresh air and the industry’s lowest cabin altitude also benefits from natural light flooding the interior from 20 panoramic oval windows.

With certification for the G800 “having gone smoothly,” Gulfstream is now gearing up for the first deliveries of its G800, which are “expected to be announced imminently.”

Marking the end of an era Gulfstream’s final G650 is due to be delivered this summer. As production winds down, the G800 will build on the G650s legacy with even greater range, advanced technology and enhanced efficiency.

300th delivery of G280

With orders ramping up for its larger business jets, Gulfstream’s super-midsize jet, the G280 is also in strong demand with the 300th delivery recently completed at the OEMs Dallas-Fort Worth area facility in Texas.

The milestone delivery is achieved just 13 years after the G280 first entered service in 2012.

“Achieving this milestone reinforces the continued strong demand for the G280,” said Burns. “Known for its unique combination of speed, performance and cabin flexibility, the G280 remains top of the super-midsize class.”

Powered by twin Honeywell HTF7250G engines, the G280 has a range of 3,600nm at its long-range cruise speed of Mach 0.80. It has achieved 87 city-pair speed records to date, while its steep-approach capabilities make it a convenient choice for some of the world’s most challenging airports.

Seating up to 10 with a four-place conference table and featuring Gulfstream’s cabin management and high-definition entertainment systems with high-speed Ka-band satellite systems, the G280 fills the gap between light jets and large cabin aircraft. It also boasts lower operating costs compared to larger Gulfstream jets such as the G550 or G650.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/The-Gulfstream-G700.20240329-scaled-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 12:16:39.527867

The declaration “didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE (the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport),” the EU Commission’s transport department, the lobbyist explained.
Still, the EU Commission wants to push on, eyeing to increase the mandated volume to 6% by 2030, including 1.2% synthetic ‘e-SAF’ made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, which would further increase costs.

According to the first anonymous aviation lobbyist, the goal is to manufacture a public perception of industry support in the absence of a real one.","If you still didn’t know how the lawmaking process in the EU works exactly, here’s a perfect example to sum it up.

A new lobby declaration from aviation industry executives in support of the EU’s sustainable jet fuel initiative was revealed to have been drafted by the EU Commission itself and merely sent to the industry to be signed, and then to present it to Transport Commissioner Apostolos Tzitzikostas during the Paris Air Show on Monday, June 16th.

The so-called ‘Le Bourget Declaration’ was fishy from the start, since it endorsed the same decarbonization targets, via gradually increasing the ‘sustainable aviation fuel’ (SAF) contents in their fuel mix, that major airlines heavily criticized as recently as March, slamming them as “unrealistic.”

And in fact, according to an anonymous aviation lobbyist, the industry didn’t make a U-turn overnight. The declaration “didn’t come from us; this came from DG MOVE (the Directorate-General for Mobility and Transport),” the EU Commission’s transport department, the lobbyist explained.

“A couple of weeks ago, DG MOVE contacted us and said, ‘We want you to sign this and give it to the Commissioner,” he said. “Officially, it’s our initiative, but unofficially it came from the Commission, which is highly unusual.”

According to Politico, other lobbyists involved in the drafting also confirmed the story, stating that they’ve received the same document and request. They eventually agreed to include it in the declaration only after integrating it with actual industry requests, such as a specific emission trading system for SAF, which Brussels keeps opposing.

The end result, however, is a heavily diluted and self-contradictory document that no one really wanted. “Now it’s basically a Frankenstein that carries all sorts of different messages,” another lobbyist said.

The green dispute between the EU and the aviation industry has escalated since the implementation of the first SAF mandate in January, which requires them to add at least 2% sustainable fuel—mainly made from used cooking oil—in their fuel mix.

Airlines have been complaining ever since that they’ve been paying twice as much for SAF as expected, since there’s not enough produced globally to ensure compliance, and its price is already three times as high as kerosene’s. That’s why back in March, the CEOs of several major airlines (including Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France-KLM, and Ryanair) all signed a joint letter callingl for an “urgent review” of the rules, and demand a delay in implementation until the SAF market becomes affordable.

Still, the EU Commission wants to push on, eyeing to increase the mandated volume to 6% by 2030, including 1.2% synthetic ‘e-SAF’ made from renewable hydrogen and captured CO2, which would further increase costs. And that’s just an intermediary goal before reaching “net zero” by 2050.

So, the Commission drafted a document to practically lobby itself, justifying moving forward with these measures. According to the first anonymous aviation lobbyist, the goal is to manufacture a public perception of industry support in the absence of a real one.

“The Commissioner doesn’t want to replicate the disaster of the automotive sector,” he explained, referring to the 2035 fossil fuel ban and other climate targets, which caused the European car industry to loudly push back with severe public criticism.

“He wants to ensure that airlines continue to support the measures adopted,” even if only on paper, in the hope of getting other, long-wanted concessions, he said.

The story is reminiscent of the Green Deal lobby scandal—also known as the ‘Timmermans Gate’—which revealed that the Commission paid over €700,000 from taxpayer funds to environmental NGOs to lobby EU and national lawmakers to adopt the flagship decarbonization package with its disastrous consequences to Europe’s energy security, industry, and competitiveness.",https://europeanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/eu-commissioner-for-transport.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 12:16:48.904546

With the A220’s advanced fuel efficiency and future compatibility with 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, LOT is setting a new industry benchmark for green innovation and operational excellence.

LOT Polish Airlines Embraces Airbus A220 in Ambitious Fleet Modernisation Drive

LOT Polish Airlines has taken a major step toward the next generation of air travel by confirming an order for 40 Airbus A220 aircraft, comprising 20 A220-100s and 20 A220-300s. Unveiled during the 2025 Paris Air Show, this landmark decision marks the first instance of Poland’s flag carrier incorporating Airbus aircraft into its fleet. The move represents a pivotal change in LOT’s fleet strategy and forms a core element of its broader plan to revamp regional operations while boosting fuel efficiency and advancing environmental sustainability amid intensifying global aviation competition.

Importantly, the deal includes provisions for future expansion, with options that could increase LOT’s A220 fleet to as many as 84 aircraft. Such a scale of investment underscores the airline’s confidence in the long-term capabilities of the A220 family and its suitability for a variety of regional and medium-haul missions.

“Today’s decision is about the future. The Airbus A220 family aircraft, which will start joining our fleet in 2027, open up new opportunities for development and growth – key pillars of our strategy. These modern, efficient, and passenger-focused aircraft will allow us to compete effectively in the European skies, strengthen our position as the preferred carrier in Central and Eastern Europe, and prepare LOT for its role as a leading airline at the Central Communication Port,” said Michał Fijoł, LOT Executive Officer.

“This order for 40 Airbus A220s marks a historic milestone as we officially welcome LOT Polish Airlines into the Airbus family. The A220 Family will be instrumental in LOT’s fleet modernisation and network expansion strategy with the A220-100 and A220-300 being the ideal combination for their needs. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with LOT, leveraging Airbus global expertise to support its renewal program and ensure the A220’s seamless integration,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business.

A Landmark Shift in Fleet Strategy

Historically, LOT Polish Airlines has operated a fleet dominated by Boeing and Embraer aircraft. The decision to turn to Airbus for its latest fleet renewal is not merely a change in aircraft supplier—it represents a larger shift in operational thinking. As airlines globally prioritize sustainability, cost efficiency, and flexibility, LOT’s adoption of the A220 reflects a calculated move toward modern, eco-friendly aviation solutions that meet both current and future needs.

The A220s will serve as replacements for LOT’s existing regional aircraft, many of which are approaching the end of their optimal service life. With this new fleet, LOT is positioning itself to capitalize on evolving market demands, including increased regional mobility, better connectivity across Europe, and a growing emphasis on environmentally sustainable operations.

The Versatility and Strengths of the A220

The Airbus A220 is widely regarded as the most advanced narrow-body aircraft in its class. Capable of seating between 100 and 160 passengers, depending on the variant and cabin configuration, the A220 brings with it a host of advantages that make it ideal for regional and medium-haul operations. The A220-100 is well-suited for routes requiring 100 to 135 seats, while the A220-300 efficiently serves markets that need between 120 to 160 seats.

One of the aircraft’s most compelling attributes is its impressive range—up to 3,600 nautical miles or 6,700 kilometers—enabling airlines like LOT to serve new destinations without the need for larger aircraft. This opens up new route possibilities, particularly for underserved secondary cities and direct international links, which previously may have been economically unfeasible.

Engine Innovation and Noise Reduction

A standout feature of the A220 is its propulsion system. The aircraft is powered by Pratt & Whitney’s latest-generation PW1500G geared turbofan engines. These engines have been designed with both performance and sustainability in mind. They reduce fuel burn by up to 25% compared to older models, and significantly cut down emissions.

Additionally, the PW1500G engines contribute to a dramatically quieter cabin and environmental footprint, with the A220 boasting a noise footprint 50% smaller than that of previous-generation aircraft. This makes the A220 not only an environmentally responsible choice but also a passenger-friendly one—especially for noise-sensitive urban airports and communities.

Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

LOT’s decision to incorporate the A220 into its fleet highlights its strong commitment to environmentally responsible aviation. The A220 is already approved to operate with blends containing up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), positioning it as a forward-looking choice for greener flying. Airbus, the aircraft’s manufacturer, has also outlined an ambitious roadmap to ensure that the entire A220 family—and all Airbus models—will be fully compatible with 100% SAF by the year 2030.

For LOT Polish Airlines, this aligns well with broader European Union climate goals and the airline’s internal drive to reduce carbon emissions. As regulators, investors, and travelers increasingly expect environmental accountability from air carriers, LOT’s fleet renewal with the A220 positions the airline as a forward-thinking, sustainability-focused operator.

A220’s Growing Global Footprint

The A220’s growing success globally further validates LOT’s decision. By May 2025, the Airbus A220 had attracted over 900 confirmed orders from a global base of more than 30 airline customers. With over 415 aircraft already delivered, the A220 is in active service with 24 airlines, operating across more than 1,600 routes and connecting over 470 destinations.

These figures highlight the A220’s adaptability and global appeal. From North America to Asia and now Central Europe, airlines are increasingly relying on the A220 to meet rising passenger demand, cut costs, and achieve sustainability targets. LOT’s entry into this expanding community of A220 operators ensures that the airline remains competitive and current in an evolving aviation landscape.

Boosting LOT’s Regional and International Connectivity

The integration of the A220 into LOT’s fleet is expected to have an immediate and transformative impact on the airline’s route network. With increased efficiency and range, LOT will be able to expand frequencies on existing European routes, introduce new point-to-point connections, and improve feeder traffic into its long-haul network via Warsaw Chopin Airport and other regional hubs.

This operational flexibility is essential for LOT as it navigates the complex post-pandemic travel environment. The ability to serve thinner markets with right-sized aircraft allows for greater profitability and improved passenger load factors. It also enhances connectivity for both business and leisure travelers, supporting tourism, trade, and economic activity across Poland and neighboring regions.

LOT Polish Airlines has placed its first-ever order for forty Airbus A220 jets to modernize its fleet, enhance passenger comfort, and advance long-term sustainable aviation.

A Vision for the Future of Polish Aviation

LOT Polish Airlines’ choice to collaborate with Airbus on the groundbreaking A220 acquisition goes beyond merely adding new aircraft—it reflects a bold declaration of the airline’s future vision. It signals the airline’s readiness to compete in a fast-changing aviation industry that demands innovation, responsibility, and resilience.

By embracing one of the most modern aircraft in the world, LOT is not only modernizing its fleet but also reimagining the role it can play in connecting Central and Eastern Europe with the rest of the world. With sustainability, passenger comfort, and efficiency as guiding principles, the future of LOT looks more dynamic and competitive than ever.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/LOT-Polish-Airlines-2-1.jpg,N,,2025-06-16 12:17:00.475756

We have the opportunity to distribute wealth through travel and to empower communities that need it the most.” And what about Antarctica?
Look closely at its marketing and storytelling, and how it engages with local communities and the environment, says Destination Queenstown’s Woods.","Hauf says the best practice is for carbon emissions to be removed or reduced where they are generated, if possible. If we must fly, “carbon removal through carbon-offset projects is a crucial part of the global emissions reduction journey, not least because for some industries, like aviation, the technologies to get to zero emissions do not yet exist commercially”. However, she believes it’s essential to have “a robust and transparent national carbon accounting system”. It’s worth checking your airline’s carbon offset program to see where your money is going and whether it aligns with your values.

I love cruising but realise it’s another form of travel with a big environmental footprint. How do I choose the right cruise line and what can I possibly do to help the planet while I’m on board and on shore?

Natalie Cherry, owner of Queensland’s Noosa Cruise & Travel, a member of the Virtuoso (virtuoso.com) group of luxury travel advisers, says today’s concerned cruisers have the option of choosing a cruise line based on how proactive it is in reducing its impact on the environment. “You could look to see [the nature of] their investment and implementation of sustainable practices. Consider choosing a smaller vessel both for the environment and to reduce the over-tourism in ports. Ideally, a ship that uses LNG and battery power in places like Antarctica and the Arctic.”

It’s not just engine power that travellers should consider. It’s the kind of basic things nowadays such as food waste management and whether single-use plastics have been eliminated. Does the company partner with local suppliers to support local economies? How does it manage its excursions so as not to disrupt host communities? Does it give back to communities and climate science through foundations it has initiated, such as those run by upscale cruise lines Ponant and Hurtigruten? On shore, passengers should aim to spend generously in local communities and avoid tours herded in large groups. While the ship itself may not tread lightly, you still can.

Everyone says travelling by train is the way to go to help save the planet, but how clean is rail really? Aren’t plenty of trains around the world propelled by diesel rather than electricity?

“Rail travel has a much lower fuel consumption and emissions profile than other modes of transport,” says Liam Davies, associate director of the Melbourne-based Institute for Sensible Transport. “While electric trains can be zero emission, when run on renewables, diesel trains do have an emissions impact. However, this is much lower than planes. The single biggest thing we can do to reduce our emissions when travelling is to use trains wherever possible. Trains have a small fraction of the emissions profile of planes; in France, high-speed trains emit just 2 per cent of the CO2 of a plane travelling the same route.” Even though Australians wishing to see the world have no option but to fly overseas, once there, “popular destinations like Europe, Japan and China all have great rail networks, with many high-speed rail options, and some incredibly scenic regular-speed rail too. Taking the train sometimes takes a little bit longer, but you can sit back and enjoy the view, knowing you are reducing your personal emissions by travelling in a lower impact way”.

I’m considering a visit to Saudi Arabia. Should I go?

“Everywhere we travel comes with risks and considerations,” says Sean Martin, managing director of Australia, Asia and New Zealand at G Adventures. “Saudi Arabia is open to tourism, but I’d encourage each traveller to make an informed decision for themselves before going. If you do choose to go, there are so many incredible female-owned businesses there that you can choose to support, and you can put your tourism dollar into businesses and communities that are marginalised. We shouldn’t underestimate the force for good that tourism presents. We have the opportunity to distribute wealth through travel and to empower communities that need it the most.”

And what about Antarctica?

Denise Sablone, executive vice-president of tour development at US-based escorted journeys operator Collette, advises travellers worried about their personal impact on the White Continent to choose companies regulated by the International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) and the Association of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO). “A less harmful way to visit the most precious and important places on our planet includes small ships with teams of naturalists and scientists on board that can positively educate and influence their guests,” says G Adventures’ Martin. Expedition cruise ships can play a crucial role in monitoring the fragile ecosystems of the polar regions. “We see our travellers as ambassadors, who we know will come back with even more respect and interest in caring for the planet than what they left with.”

US President Donald Trump has pulled the US out of the Paris Agreement for a second time. Does it mean I shouldn’t visit the US?

As of early January, only three countries had not ratified the Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change – Iran, Libya and Yemen. However, Trump withdrew the US from the agreement soon after inauguration, meaning the US is no longer required to provide annual updates on its greenhouse gas emissions. But is the only ethical path for the environmentally conscious traveller to boycott the country? We note the US government doesn’t necessarily reflect the feelings of its people on this issue. Hundreds of thousands of Americans have come out in recent times to protest the present administration on many grounds, from tariffs to immigration and environmental policies. The issue for travellers now is also one of personal safety and stringent border control. Are we welcome as visitors to the US? This is a yardstick the thinking traveller should apply to every country they wish to visit.

Tipping has become a big issue, even for some Americans. If I do visit the States, should I resist tipping? Isn’t it just another kind of tariff?

“When visiting any destination, we know we should be mindful and considerate of the local norms and ways of life,” says Roland Howlett, owner of Virtuoso member travel agency Frontier Travel. “Tipping in the US is no different. It is deeply embedded in the culture and is a critical part of how many service workers earn their income. Embrace it, and you’ll find you enjoy travelling around the US a lot more.” Noosa Cruise & Travel’s Natalie Cherry says travellers should always check their bills first as there may already be a tip included. “Be mindful that their wages are incredibly low, so they rely on a service fee. In general, because of this, they do give exceptional service, so be kind and grateful for this and show your appreciation.”

Are there any truly ethical hotel brands I can choose? And how do we know the difference? What do we look for?

“When it comes to ethics, the best thing to look for is always a business that really invests in its people, and the local community,” says sustainable luxury travel expert Juliet Kinsman. “For me, economic sustainability is what’s key. Seek out an independent hotel where the owners have a meaningful connection to that place and are quite literally invested; you know your cash is more likely contributing to them looking after all that’s on their doorstep.” Kinsman recommends resources such as The Long Run, Regenerative Travel as well as her own list, Bouteco Loves.

Does replacing small plastic water bottles and straws in hotels really make much difference?

“The collective impact of the movement away from single-use plastic in hotels is really powerful and does make a difference,” says Elissa Keenan, chief executive of Ecotourism Australia. “If people don’t think small changes make a difference, I challenge their thinking.” As she points out, one of the single biggest risks to the three species of turtles listed as endangered and three species listed as vulnerable in Australia is plastic pollution. “Plastic pollution is deadly to sea turtles through ingestion leading to starvation, internal injuries or entanglement resulting in life-threatening injuries. For anyone who has snorkelled or swum with these majestic creatures, or who has dreams of doing so, making small changes cannot be undervalued.”

How much so-called greenwashing is really going on, and how can we call it out?

“Yes, there’s impact-washing galore,” Kinsman says. “But dig a little deeper, or to really do your due diligence, give the hotel a call (when did anyone last do that?) and you’ll soon get a sense of whether their good work is the real deal or if their virtue signalling is a load of blarney.” She’s all for calling out “greenshifting” (when a hotel doesn’t take responsibility for its failings, such as plastic water bottles, and they shift the blame, saying guests insist on single use) and “greenrinsing” (when they keep changing their targets before achieving them, such as declaring net zero by 2025 but still running on diesel generators). But she’s also supportive of “greenlighting”, which she defines as spotlighting the good of an operator, even if it’s not “eco through and through”.

Do hotels that want you to keep the white towels and not change the sheets really want to help save the world or just their own bottom line?

“What we definitely need is fewer expressions of being conscious or sustainable without substantiated facts,” says luxury travel expert Kinsman. If a hotel is going to claim a “nature positive” or “ocean-friendly” label, they need to back it up with hard evidence. “Considering laundry gobbles up a huge part of their energy and water budgets, I don’t care if they’re cutting their turnover for economic benefits, as long as the end result is that they can actually reduce the amount of towels and sheets and all the detergents they use and the fibres they release into our waterways.”

How do you know the money you donate to a social enterprise is really going to the right cause?

Collette’s Sablone says social enterprises typically measure their impact through monitoring and evaluation, tracking the outcomes of their activities to confirm they are making a positive difference in their communities. Resources such as annual reports and partnership pages can be utilised to verify that donations are being used correctly. Transparency and trust are key when supporting social enterprises. “Don’t be afraid to ask many questions and to demand the details, and to see accountability being practised,” says G Adventures’ Martin.

How can it be overtourism when so many locals say they depend on tourism for their livelihoods?

“Overtourism occurs when too many visitors flock to a destination, exceeding the local capacity to manage them sustainably,” says Mat Woods, chief executive of New Zealand’s Destination Queenstown. “This can lead to overcrowding, environmental degradation, strained infrastructure, reduced quality of life for residents and a diminished visitor experience.” But places can have both healthy tourist numbers and a happy community if tourism is managed correctly. Queenstown, says Woods, is a good example due to its destination management plan, which outlines a vision for regenerative tourism, with local community input to ensure the region thrives not just economically, but also socially, culturally and environmentally. “A great place to holiday is a great place to live, so balance is the key,” Keenan adds.

What can I do personally to help combat overtourism? Should I just skip places such as Paris, Rome and Venice?

When people think of overtourism, they instantly think of “bucket-list” hotspots such as Paris and Venice, G Adventures’ Martin says. “But what many don’t think about is the idea that overtourism can affect small, remote communities as well. Travel should be seen as a force for good, and we shouldn’t react to overtourism by turning our back on any one place, city or town. You don’t need to rule out a tourist favourite to combat overtourism; you just need to be mindful and conscious about the best way and time to see it.” You can help ease the pressure on a destination by travelling more mindfully, staying longer, travelling off-peak and exploring alternative destinations and second cities. Consider holidaying at home as well, says Keenan, of Ecotourism Australia. “We are so lucky in Australia to have so many incredible places to go with virtually no crowds. Travellers are increasingly looking for immersive and untouched experiences – we have these in spades right here.”

How can I tell if a destination really is doing the right thing?

Look closely at its marketing and storytelling, and how it engages with local communities and the environment, says Destination Queenstown’s Woods. “Look for initiatives that both strengthen the economic resilience of the destination and foster connections between visitors, community and those which protect the environment.”

I know you shouldn’t ride elephants, so is it still OK to ride other animals like camels?

“Whatever the activity, ensure the animal’s mental as well as physical needs are provided for,” says John Roberts, group director of sustainability and conservation at the Minor Hotels group. The most important message is to look for science-based welfare certification from any animal excursion, no matter the species, to guarantee the best of care.

Is there any way I can pack for a trip that’s better for the planet?

Packing light reduces your carbon footprint and makes it easier to use trains and buses and not rely on less environmentally forgiving private transportation, says Ecotourism Australia’s Keenan. “Consider whether you really need to buy certain items before you go. If you really want to [do so], purchase them from small businesses or markets in your destination, helping the money stay in that local community.”

What’s the feeling these days about visiting and supporting zoos around the world?

There’s still a place for zoos, says Minor Hotels’ Roberts, since it’s still not possible for everyone to travel to view creatures in the wild and to be inspired to care for the natural world. A licensed and well-regulated zoo, for instance a member of the World Association of Zoos & Aquaria, will be providing the best possible care and, most importantly, will be prevented from being part of the illegal wildlife trade and other anti-conservation measures.”

How can I choose an ethical safari, as wild animals can be crowded on some tours?

Travel with a company that plays a part in conservation or pays extra for exclusivity, ideally with a local community as benefactors, says Roberts. “Certainly, it’s better for the animals’ wellbeing not to be overcrowded, and for conservation in general, but it does come at a price point that excludes the vast majority of people. But overcrowding problems come when the experience is too convenient and cheap.”

Charles requested the symbolic moves “as a mark of respect for the lives lost, the families in mourning and all the communities affected by this awful tragedy,” Buckingham Palace said.

An Air India flight from the northwestern city of Ahmedabad to London crashed shortly after takeoff on Thursday, killing 241 people on board and at least 29 on the ground. The plane was carrying 169 Indians, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese and one Canadian. One man survived.

In addition to being Britain’s head of state, Charles is the head of the Commonwealth, an organization of independent states that includes India and Canada.

The monarch’s annual birthday parade, known as Trooping the Colour, is a historic ceremony filled with pageantry and military bands in which the king reviews his troops on Horse Guards Parade adjacent to St. James’ Park in central London.

The military ceremony dates back to a time when flags of the battalion, known as colours, were “trooped,″ or shown, to soldiers in the ranks so they could recognize them.

Charles, wearing a scarlet military uniform, traveled to Horse Guards Parade in an open-topped, horse-drawn carriage accompanied by Queen Camilla.

Prince William and other uniformed members of the royal family rode behind the king on horseback, followed by Kate, the princess of Wales, and her three children in another open-topped carriage.

The festivities featured 1,338 soldiers, including 244 musicians, who paraded past the king following the moment of silence for those affected by the Air India disaster.

The royal family then returned to Buckingham Palace, where they appeared on the balcony to wave to the crowd and watch a flyover of military aircraft.

The finale of the flyover was an appearance by the Royal Air Force aerobatic display team, known as the Red Arrows, which for the first time used a blend of sustainable aviation fuel to power their aircraft and generate their signature red, white and blue smoke trails.

Air travel trends: Airline networks serve about 30 percent more airport pairs than a decade ago, providing more convenient non-stop flight options.

As the longest-running forecast of its kind, the CMO is regarded as the most comprehensive analysis of the commercial aviation industry.","Emerging markets, with expanding middle classes, dynamic and competitive airline networks and sustained aviation investment, will play an outsized role in global air traffic growth, helping drive a need for 43,600 commercial airplanes over the next 20 years, Boeing projected today.

These markets will represent over 50 percent of the global commercial fleet in 2044, up from nearly 40 percent in 2024.

Ahead of the Paris Air Show, Boeing released its 2025 Commercial Market Outlook (CMO), which also predicts airplane supply will catch up with market demand around the end of the decade, enabling carriers to increasingly renew and grow their fleets.

“Throughout the first quarter of this century, passenger air traffic tripled and the global airplane fleet more than doubled as the commercial aviation industry navigated significant challenges,” said Brad McMullen, Boeing senior vice-president of Commercial Sales and Marketing.

“Resilience will remain a hallmark of this growing industry as we continue to see strong demand for new airplanes with commercial aviation returning to its pre-pandemic growth trajectory.”

CMO forecast highlights through 2044:

Passenger traffic is forecast to grow 4.2 percent annually ─ more than doubling in size as it continues to outpace global economic growth.

The global fleet will nearly double to more than 49,600 commercial airplanes as airlines add capacity to meet travel demand.

About 80% of in-service airplanes will be replaced with more than 21,000 deliveries, improving fleet efficiency and capability.

Single-aisle airplanes will make up 72 percent of the global fleet, up from 66 percent in 2024, driven largely by short-haul travel and low-cost carriers in emerging markets.

• The global passenger widebody fleet will increase to approximately 8,320 airplanes, up from roughly 4,400 in 2024 ─ growth increasingly driven by carriers in emerging markets expanding their long-haul fleets. Supply chain diversification and expanding express cargo networks will drive a nearly two-thirds expansion of the global freighter fleet and the need for 2,900 production and converted freighters.

Air travel trends:

Airline networks serve about 30 percent more airport pairs than a decade ago, providing more convenient non-stop flight options.

As a share of discretionary expenses, travel spending has returned to pre- pandemic levels as consumers prioritize air travel.

Boeing has published the CMO annually since 1961. As the longest-running forecast of its kind, the CMO is regarded as the most comprehensive analysis of the commercial aviation industry. The complete outlook is available at: boeing.com/cmo.

La Mède Biorefinery (2025): This southern-France facility will deliver 15,000 tonnes of SAF to regional airports.

Normandy Refinery Coprocessing (2024): By blending biomass with conventional jet fuel in existing units, Normandy will generate 160,000 tonnes of SAF annually.

Antwerp Refinery Expansion (2024–2025): Initial coprocessing of 50,000 tonnes per year is underway, with capacity slated to reach 80,000 tonnes.

Leuna Refinery Project (2026): Plans are set to integrate 50,000 tonnes per year of coprocessed SAF.

Supplying Airlines and Airports

TotalEnergies is already delivering SAF through major contracts and airport partnerships:

Air France-KLM: Up to 1.5 million tonnes of SAF over ten years.

Volotea: SAF supply agreement through 2029 for multiple French airports.

Blends at Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand, and Saint-Nazaire airports.

Collaborative R&D for Next-Generation SAF

In tandem with production efforts, we are collaborating with aerospace leaders to test high-blend fuels and secure aircraft compatibility:

Airbus Partnership (2024): Supplying over half of Airbus’s European SAF requirements and co-developing fully sustainable fuel formulations.

Safran Collaboration (since 2021): Developed a 100% SAF that successfully powered a military-helicopter flight in February 2023.

Our Solaize research centre in Lyon is intensifying feedstock innovation to overcome supply-chain limits and further expand SAF availability.

As from 2028, the Company will be able to produce more than half a million tons of SAF a year to cover the increase in the European SAF blending mandate, set at 6% for 2030. TotalEnergies will be able to supply SAF more than 10% of the jet fuel volumes it will market in Europe, ahead of the European mandate set at 6% in 2030.

""TotalEnergies is taking action to meet the strong demand from the aviation industry to reduce its carbon footprint. Sustainable aviation fuels are essential to bring the air industry's CO2 emissions down immediately. Their development is fully aligned with our approach to get to net zero, together with society,"" said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TotalEnergies. ""For ten years, we have been pioneering and investing in biorefineries and developing coprocessing in our refineries.""

TotalEnergies, pioneering SAF production

The Grandpuits biorefinery: Thanks to a €500 million investment, TotalEnergies transforms its site into a zero-crude platform, including a biorefinery with a production capacity of 230,000 tons a year of SAF in 2026. TotalEnergies has joined force with SARIA, the European leader in the collection and recovery of organic materials, which will supply the majority of the feedstock supply.

The La Mède biorefinery: This year, La Mède will produce 15,000 tons of SAF for distribution to airports in the south of France.

The Normandy refinery: TotalEnergies has begun coprocessing SAF at its Normandy platform. Coprocessing involves the treatment of both fossil jet fuel and biomass in a standard refining unit. The site's annual production capacity is 160,000 tons

The Antwerp refinery in Belgium: An initial project to coprocess 50,000 tons a year of SAF was launched this year. Annual production capacity will subsequently be increased to 80,000 tons a year

The Leuna refinery in Germany: A coprocessing project for 50,000 tons a year is planned for 2026.

TotalEnergies, supplying SAF to customers in the air industry

TotalEnergies supplies aviation fuels including SAF, in line with blending mandates and the needs of its customers. Those customers include several airlines:

Air France-KLM, with whom the Company has signed a major deal to deliver up to 1.5 million tons of SAF over ten years. This is one of the Group's largest SAF supply contracts.

Volotea, which has also signed to buy SAF from TotalEnergies until 2029, in order to reduce the emissions of its flights out of several French airports.

TotalEnergies also supplies SAF-blended aviation fuel to several French airports, including Bordeaux, Toulouse, Paris-Le Bourget, Clermont-Ferrand and Saint-Nazaire

TotalEnergies, a partner committed to SAF research

TotalEnergies is also forging partnerships with aerospace groups to accelerate the sector's decarbonization. Those partnerships are playing a critical role in understanding the impact of sustainable aviation fuel composition on aircraft, especially for blends of over 50%. They include:

A partnership with Airbus, signed in 2024, to supply over half the company's needs in Europe, and conduct a shared R&D program to develop fully sustainable fuels.

A partnership with Safran, begun in 2021, that led to the formulation of a SAF that was completely compatible with current aircraft and was used to power a flight by a military helicopter in February 2023.

TotalEnergies is also stepping up its R&D effort, especially in feedstock, which remains one of the challenges to increasing SAF production. The Solaize research center in Lyon has specialist teams coordinating this work.
