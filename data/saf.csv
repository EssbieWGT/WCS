In North America, the United States is scaling up production capacity, while Canada is establishing a policy and infrastructure foundation to support future growth. However, the path forward is complex, shaped by policy dynamics, investment gaps, and emerging trade disputes.

United States: Production Acceleration Backed by Investment and Policy

Capacity and Infrastructure Expansion

The United States has significantly expanded its SAF infrastructure. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), SAF production has increased from 2,000 barrels per day in 2020 to 19,000 barrels per day in 2023, with projections reaching 51,000 barrels per day by 2025. These gains are primarily attributed to co-processing at renewable diesel facilities, an area where the U.S. leads globally.

The U.S. Department of Energy has made notable investments in next-generation SAF projects:

Calumet’s Montana Facility: With a conditional $1.44 billion loan guarantee, this plant aims to produce 315 million gallons of biofuels annually, with SAF comprising a significant share.

Gevo’s Net-Zero 1 Project in South Dakota: This facility received a $1.46 billion loan guarantee and will become the first commercial-scale operation converting corn starch to SAF, aiming for 55 million gallons annually.

Additional contributors include World Energy’s Paramount facility in California and Marathon’s Dickinson plant in North Dakota, both of which support SAF production alongside renewable diesel.

According to a MarketsandMarkets forecast, the U.S. SAF market is expected to grow from $0.86 billion in 2024 to $6.97 billion by 2030, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.8%. This expansion is driven by rising environmental concerns, supportive government policies, and successful demonstrations of SAF integration—such as United Airlines’ use of 100% SAF on a commercial flight.

Policy Support and the SAF Grand Challenge

The U.S. SAF Grand Challenge targets the production of 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030 and 35 billion gallons by 2050—covering 100% of projected U.S. aviation fuel demand. Current production, however, remains below 100 million gallons annually, less than 0.1% of total U.S. jet fuel consumption.

To meet these targets, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit, offering a $1.25-$1.75/gallon incentive for SAF producers. However, uncertainty around long-term subsidies—especially under shifting federal administrations—casts doubt over capital investments.

United Airlines, JetBlue, and Delta have made significant SAF offtake agreements, while Airbus and Boeing are investing in SAF pathways, including alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) and Fischer-Tropsch technologies.

Canada: Establishing a Foundation Amid Global Competition

Domestic Production and Imports

Canada currently lacks commercial SAF production. However, recent developments signal a strategic shift. In late 2024, Air Canada signed a deal with Neste for 77.6 million liters (20.5 million gallons) of SAF—the first time SAF has been imported for use in Canada. Deliveries began at the Port of Vancouver, with pipeline access to Vancouver International Airport.

Additionally, the Canadian government committed more than CAD 11 million to clean fuel projects, supporting early-stage SAF facilities that convert forest biomass, waste oils, and municipal waste into low-carbon fuels.

While specific Canadian projections are not detailed in MarketsandMarkets’ global outlook, North America as a whole is poised for rapid growth. The global SAF market is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $16.8 billion by 2030, at a CAGR of 47.7%—with the United States driving much of that expansion.

Policy and Market Mechanisms

Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations (CFR), which require a reduction in carbon intensity of fuels, create a national compliance market that could attract SAF producers. However, SAF remains too costly compared to renewable diesel. To bridge this gap, industry coalitions such as the Canadian Council for Sustainable Aviation Fuels (C-SAF) are advocating for:

Extension of the Clean Technology Investment Tax Credit to SAF facilities

Price guarantees through Contracts for Difference (CfD)

Public-private investment partnerships for regional SAF hubs

These recommendations echo the success of hydrogen and renewable electricity investment frameworks in Canada.

Barriers to Growth

Despite policy momentum, Canadian SAF development faces hurdles:

Cost disadvantage: Without U.S.-style subsidies, Canadian SAF costs remain 3–5x higher than Jet A fuel.

Investor hesitancy: Capital flight to U.S. projects offering more generous incentives.

Supply chain gaps: Lack of established logistics for feedstock aggregation and SAF blending.

U.S.-Canada Trade Tensions Threaten Cross-Border Biofuels Supply

In March 2025, the U.S. enacted a 10% tariff on Canadian biofuels, including ethanol and biodiesel. Though SAF is not directly named, the tariffs affect feedstock markets and investor confidence.

These trade actions could disrupt emerging North American SAF supply chains. For instance, several Canadian SAF proposals rely on feedstock imports from the U.S. Midwest. Trade friction increases risk premiums, potentially stalling biorefinery investment.

Industry leaders from both countries have urged for binational coordination to prevent fragmentation of climate-aligned energy markets. Without aligned SAF incentives and mutual trade facilitation, Canada may continue to lag in production while the U.S. grapples with policy volatility.

North America’s SAF Reality Check

SAF is essential for meeting aviation decarbonization targets in both the U.S. and Canada. However, production remains nascent, hindered by infrastructure gaps, high costs, and policy uncertainty. While the U.S. has made measurable gains through federal subsidies and commercial partnerships, it has not reached the scale required to meet its own SAF Grand Challenge goals. Canada, meanwhile, is establishing policy frameworks and initiating imports but needs bold investments to become a producer, not just a consumer.

For North America to become a global SAF leader, a harmonized regional strategy is needed—one that includes technology deployment, feedstock alignment, consistent incentives, and trade policy cooperation. The next five years will be critical in determining whether SAF remains a niche alternative or becomes the cornerstone of sustainable aviation on the continent.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250417-172018-ce1-An%20industrial-scale%20fuel%20refinery%20with%20multiple%20silver%20distillation%20towers%2C%20white%20storage%20tanks%2C%20and%20a%20complex%20network%20of%20metal%20pipes%20set%20against%20a%20clear%20blue%20sky..jpg,N,,2025-04-18 12:56:42.985287

This time, the world’s second-largest mining company is partnering with AMG Metals & Materials (AMG M&M) to explore the feasibility of setting up a large-scale low-carbon aluminium production facility in the country.

The proposed project includes plans for up to 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of primary aluminium and 2 mtpa of alumina, powered entirely by renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, backed by pumped hydro storage. In its first phase, the partners are evaluating the potential of establishing a 500,000 tonnes per annum aluminium smelter at a suitable location in India.

AMG M&M, promoted by the founders of clean energy company Greenko and AM Green, will work closely with Greenko to develop a firmed renewable energy infrastructure to support the project. Rio Tinto will focus on the supply of alumina and evaluate the most viable smelting technology for the initiative.

This move marks a significant shift towards sustainable materials production and aligns with Rio Tinto’s global strategy to expand its low-carbon aluminium portfolio. India, with its rapid industrial growth and increasing demand for decarbonised supply chains, presents a strategic opportunity for both players.

The project, once operational, could address growing global demand for low-emission aluminium across sectors like automotive, construction, and packaging. With aluminium consumption reaching 70 million tonnes globally, low-carbon aluminium is emerging as a preferred material for climate-conscious industries.

The development may require a total power input of 7–8 GW, supplied through 1.8–2.0 GW of wind and solar energy backed by hydro storage, and could demand an investment of $5–7 billion across phases.

Though India is the second-largest aluminium producer globally, it continues to rely heavily on bauxite imports. The plan includes sourcing bauxite from Rio Tinto’s Australian mines, potentially bridging India’s raw material gap and supporting exports of low-carbon aluminium to Europe.

""As a European company, I want to emphasize that while the United States may be retreating from the wave of globalization, climate change and energy transition have actually brought enormous opportunities for cooperation between China and Europe,"" said Pouyanne.

""We will jointly contribute to the success of the energy transition process and continue to collaborate with China, and TotalEnergies is fully committed to supporting China's balanced and strategic energy transition,"" he said.

Pouyanne lauded China's commitment to both providing energy and decarbonizing its economy, emphasizing the crucial role of affordable energy transition.

""TotalEnergies has a long-standing and stable relationship with China, with a history of over 40 years and extensive influence in numerous activities, while we also collaborate with Chinese energy companies and overseas subcontractors, utilizing Chinese products and solutions.

He added that the company's commitment to supplying LNG to meet China's growing gas demand has driven coal-to-gas switching and helps address peak power needs.

TotalEnergies announced in November the signing of a sales agreement with China Petroleum and Chemical Corp for the delivery of 2 million metric tons of LNG per year for 15 years, starting in 2028.

This came after the French energy provider announced a five-year extension of its sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) in September, on the delivery of 1.25 million tons of LNG per year to China until 2034, as the energy giant has been strengthening its long-term positions in the growing Chinese market, which is also the world's largest LNG importing country.

In China, natural gas serves as a crucial transition energy resource, mitigating the intermittency of renewable energy sources and reducing emissions when used as a substitute for coal in electricity generation.

In addition to fossil fuels, TotalEnergies also sees significant opportunities in China's renewable energy sector as well. Pouyanne outlined joint ventures with Chinese partners across the solar photovoltaic supply chain and agreements for offshore wind and onshore solar projects.

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan’s first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo’s sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel’s price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

Watch now: Delta announces innovative plans for its next 100 years of air travel

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet’s overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company’s fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines’ efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don’t require a flight.

Joby flew its air taxi demonstrator over NASA’s ground sensor array near the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California producing air flow data.
This technology will be important for future air taxi flights, especially those occurring in cities by tracking aircraft moving through traffic corridors and around landing zones.
Using this data from an experimental air taxi aircraft, NASA will further develop the technology needed to help create safer air taxi flights in high-traffic areas.","NASA engineers began using a network of ground sensors in March to collect data from an experimental air taxi to evaluate how to safely integrate such vehicles into airspace above cities – in all kinds of weather.

Researchers will use the campaign to help improve tools to assist with collision avoidance and landing operations and ensure safe and efficient air taxi operations in various weather conditions.

For years, NASA has looked at how wind shaped by terrain, including buildings in urban areas, can affect new types of aircraft. The latest test, which is gathering data from a Joby Aviation demonstrator aircraft, looks at another kind of wind – that which is generated by the aircraft themselves.

Joby flew its air taxi demonstrator over NASA’s ground sensor array near the agency’s Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California producing air flow data. The Joby aircraft has six rotors that allow for vertical takeoffs and landings, and tilt to provide lift in flight. Researchers focused on the air pushed by the propellers, which rolls into turbulent, circular patterns of wind.

This rolling wind can affect the aircraft’s performance, especially when it’s close to the ground, as well as others flying in the vicinity and people on the ground. Such wind turbulence is difficult to measure, so NASA enhanced its sensors with a new type of lidar – a system that uses lasers to measure precise distances – and that can map out the shapes of wind features.

“The design of this new type of aircraft, paired with the NASA lidar technology during this study, warrants a better understanding of possible wind and turbulence effects that can influence safe and efficient flights,” said Grady Koch, lead for this research effort, from NASA’s Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

Data to Improve Aircraft Tracking

NASA also set up a second array of ground nodes including radar, cameras, and microphones in the same location as the sensors to provide additional data on the aircraft. These nodes will collect tracking data during routine flights for several months.

The agency will use the data gathered from these ground nodes to demonstrate the tracking capabilities and functions of its “distributed sensing” technology, which involves embedding multiple sensors in an area where aircraft are operating.

This technology will be important for future air taxi flights, especially those occurring in cities by tracking aircraft moving through traffic corridors and around landing zones. Distributed sensing has the potential to enhance collision avoidance systems, air traffic management, ground-based landing sensors, and more.

“Our early work on a distributed network of sensors, and through this study, gives us the opportunity to test new technologies that can someday assist in airspace monitoring and collision avoidance above cities,” said George Gorospe, lead for this effort from NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley.

Using this data from an experimental air taxi aircraft, NASA will further develop the technology needed to help create safer air taxi flights in high-traffic areas. Both of these efforts will benefit the companies working to bring air taxis and drones safely into the airspace.

The work is led by NASA’s Transformational Tools and Technologies and Convergent Aeronautics Solutions projects under the Transformative Aeronautics Concepts program in support of NASA’s Advanced Air Mobility mission.

In a joint initiative with the Air Force and Joint Capabilities Group, Army is making regular use of the recently certified fuel.

SAF is a liquid fuel derived from renewable sources. Its use is primarily driven by the need for security of fuel supplies through lower reliance on conventional fuels.

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale demonstrated the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

All ADF aircraft are certified to use SAF, which is compliant with existing military aviation fuel standards and consistent with standards used by Australia’s allies and partners.

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

The meeting brought together the ministers of petroleum, environment, and civil aviation to discuss the project, led by the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (ECHEM). The initiative is a cornerstone of the petroleum ministry’s strategy to promote sustainable development and reduce environmental impact.

Environment Minister Yasmine Fouad stressed the need for inter-ministerial coordination to accelerate Egypt’s shift toward renewable energy, particularly in aviation—a sector with significant environmental challenges.

She noted that SAF production is crucial for cutting the aviation industry’s carbon emissions. Fouad clarified that carbon credits generated from the project must comply with strict guidelines before being traded. The petroleum ministry has already set emission reduction goals as part of Egypt’s climate commitments and established rules for carbon credit sales.

Fouad also pointed to Egypt’s broader bioeconomy strategy, which encourages biofuel production as a green alternative. Used cooking oil, a primary ingredient for SAF, has been reclassified as a valuable resource following a study by the Waste Management Regulatory Agency.

Tamer Heikal, head of the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel Company (ESAF), outlined the project’s $530 million business plan, confirming that feasibility studies—conducted with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)—are complete.

The facility, to be built on a 100,000-square-meter plot near Dekheila Port, will use advanced technology to convert used cooking oil into 120,000 tons of SAF per year. The fuel will cater to both local and international markets.

Heikal said the project is now in the process of selecting a technology provider and a construction firm, with backing from four global financial institutions. Efforts are also underway to secure long-term supply agreements for used cooking oil and to market the SAF to airlines worldwide.

In the present study, the versatility of NH3(l) extraction was assessed by applying it to six microalgal species with different contents of lipids. This method directly separated 25.6–70.6 wt % of the dry weight of the sample as crude extract. The total fatty acid methyl ester yield was 5.5–17.4 wt %, comparable to or exceeding that obtained by traditional approaches. The crude extract was highly enriched with valuable C12–C24 fatty acids. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy showed that after NH3(l) extraction, the cellular structure of the residue was preserved.

From ambitious fleet expansions to bold turnarounds, these CEOs aren’t just steering planes—they’re redefining an industry.

Jaideep Mirchandani

The Strategic Playmaker at Sky One

When Sky One’s Group Chairman Jaideep Mirchandani submitted his bid to revive GoFirst in mid?2024, it wasn’t just a splashy headline—it was a calculated move to cement India’s place on the global MRO and leasing map. Mirchandani, whose UAE?headquartered Sky One specializes in charters, training, MRO, and asset trading, sees GoFirst as more than just an airline acquisition. He aims to leverage its prized airport slots and traffic rights to build a home?grown aviation services powerhouse.

Building India’s MRO and Training Backbone

At Air Expo Abu Dhabi 2024, Mirchandani unveiled a roadmap focused on sustainability and operational reform. His blueprint calls for scaling pilot training academies, expanding MRO hangars, and rolling out cargo?optimization tech—all designed to support India’s target of 20,000 new pilots by 2030. With women’s empowerment initiatives and green fuel partnerships already underway, Sky One under Mirchandani is charting a new course for the sector.

Vinay Dube

The New?Age Disruptor at Akasa Air

If disruption had a poster child, it would be Akasa Air’s co?founder and CEO Vinay Dube. An Indian?American at the helm of a carrier barely three years old, Dube has guided Akasa from zero to a fleet of 27 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, serving 27 destinations. By July 2025, that fleet will swell to 30 planes—despite earlier delivery delays.

Growth with Grit and Green Fuel

Passenger traffic under Dube’s watch has more than doubled, surging from 7.75 million in March 2024 to a staggering 16 million in March 2025. But growth isn’t Dube’s only metric. With 199 more planes on order, he envisions Akasa as one of the world’s 30 largest airlines by 2030, commanding up to 15% of India’s domestic market. Strategic hubs at Navi Mumbai and Jewar airports will further boost connectivity, while experiments in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) demonstrate his commitment to eco?friendly expansion.

Campbell Wilson

The Turnaround Maestro at Air India

When former Scoot and Singapore Airlines veteran Campbell Wilson took charge of Air India in June 2022, he inherited a legacy airline weighed down by aging jets, outdated cabins, and bruised customer sentiment. Fast?forward to 2025, and his blueprint for revival is unmistakable: 250 Airbus and 220 Boeing jets on order, refreshed lounges across New Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru, and connection times slashed from 10 hours to just three for major transit routes.

Quality over Quantity… for Now

In February 2025, Wilson paused further Boeing orders, citing the need to clear existing backlog before committing to more aircraft—an uncommon move in an era of aggressive procurement. Meanwhile, his team is overhauling cabin interiors, standardizing in?flight entertainment, and rebranding the frequent?flyer program as the ‘Maharaja Club’. While the full payoff of these measures may take years, early indicators—higher on?time performance, rising transit volumes, and positive social?media buzz—suggest Wilson’s “drinking from a firehose” approach is yielding results.

Pieter Elbers

The Global Expansionist at IndiGo

Dutch aviation stalwart Pieter Elbers brought his KLM pedigree to IndiGo in 2022, and the low?cost leader has never looked back. Since his arrival, IndiGo has doubled its international footprint—from 20 overseas destinations to roughly 40 by March 31, 2025—while upping its route count from 60 to 120.

Charting New Horizons with A321XLR

Elbers isn’t stopping at just quantity; he’s targeting quality. With Airbus A321XLRs on the horizon, IndiGo plans to launch up to seven new long?haul routes—and even introduce business?class seating on select high?yield sectors. He envisions another 10 international additions in FY26, mapping out a network that rivals legacy carriers while keeping the “Rising A” ethos of simplicity and reliability intact.

These four CEOs share a common altitude: an unflinching focus on operational excellence coupled with a visionary zeal for growth and sustainability. Whether it’s building India’s MRO backbone, setting new benchmarks in fleet expansion, orchestrating a corporate revival, or weaving a global route tapestry, their collective efforts are not just lifting their airlines—they’re propelling India’s aviation narrative skyward. As FY25 takes flight, passengers, pilots, and the planet all stand to gain from their high?octane leadership.

In an industry already buffeted by global supply chain challenges, a high-stakes game of international tariffs and aircraft allocations is unfolding. As geopolitical tensions shape the aerospace market, Indian carriers could soon find themselves in a fortuitous position, thanks to unexpected shifts in aircraft deliveries stemming from U.S.-China trade sparring.

When Tariffs Alter Flight Routes

The Geopolitical Backdrop

In a dramatic twist, China recently instructed its airlines to halt the acquisition of Boeing aircraft. This move comes on the heels of U.S. tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump, which levied a hefty 145% duty on American-made aircraft. The intent behind these tariffs was to assert economic pressure, but the ripple effects have cascaded well beyond political corridors, directly impacting the global aerospace supply chain.

Shifting the Aircraft Allocation

Chinese airlines, who were expecting deliveries of approximately 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets and 11 Boeing 787 Dreamliners, now find themselves in a logistical limbo. With production slots at the Seattle final assembly line left unused, industry insiders predict that these “white tail” aircraft—originally built for Chinese carriers but not yet delivered—might soon be reallocated to Indian customers.

Indian Carriers at the Ready

A Beneficiary of Redirection

Indian carriers such as Air India Express and the relatively new entrant Akasa Airlines are in a prime position to capitalize on this unforeseen development. Last year, Air India Express acquired 25 white tail Boeing MAX jets, with another 25 jets scheduled for future delivery. The current scenario could allow these airlines to secure even more aircraft—either additional white tails or purpose-built models—to support their expanding fleet, mitigating the persistent challenges of aircraft acquisition amid global constraints.

Learning from History

This isn’t the first time Indian airlines have benefited from redirected aircraft. Recent history has shown similar occurrences, creating a precedent where white tail aircraft, manufactured to cater to specific foreign market demands, end up buoying domestic airline fleets. This not only ensures the continued growth of their services but also bolsters India's position in an increasingly competitive aviation sector.

The Boeing vs. Airbus Dynamic

Boeing's Strategic Dilemma

Boeing is now navigating choppy waters as the shift in aircraft orders creates uncertainty around its global production capacity. With Chinese orders in jeopardy, Boeing’s Seattle final assembly line earmarked for these deliveries risks remaining underutilized. This redirection does little to dent Boeing’s larger operations but signals a broader strategic reevaluation in the wake of volatile global trade policies.

Airbus Seizing the Opportunity

Not to be outdone, Airbus finds itself in a contrasting position. With two final assembly lines dedicated to the popular single-aisle A320 family, Airbus has the capacity to adjust more nimbly to the evolving market conditions. China, which might turn to Airbus for increased aircraft availability, could alter its stance, potentially increasing orders for the European manufacturer—a development that would ripple across the industry as alliances and supply agreements come under reconsideration.

Global Ripple Effects in the Aerospace Industry

A U.S.-Led Trade War in Full Flight

The ongoing tit-for-tat tariffs between the U.S. and China have thrown the global aerospace industry into a state of flux. Planemakers, airlines, and suppliers are reassessing contracts worth billions as they navigate the fine line between honoring delivery commitments and absorbing new costs. The disruption extends to the critical supply chains for parts and equipment. For instance, if China halts the import of U.S. components for its domestic projects like the C919 program, the repercussions could stall or even derail these ventures entirely.

Leasing, Logistics, and Long-Term Strategies

Beyond delivery schedules, the uncertainty has prompted airlines to consider deferring aircraft deliveries rather than accepting additional duties and costs. Beijing is reportedly even brainstorming measures to assist airlines leasing Boeing jets that are now burdened with higher operational costs—a sign that government intervention might be on the horizon as both countries grapple with the fallout.

Conclusion: Turbulence or Opportunity?

As the aerospace industry is drawn deeper into the vortex of global trade disputes, the interplay between tariffs, aircraft allocation, and supply chain disruptions presents both challenges and opportunities. While Boeing might suffer temporary setbacks, Indian carriers stand to gain significantly from redirected aircraft. Meanwhile, Airbus’s robust production capacity may enable it to capture a larger share of the shifting market. With each stakeholder recalibrating its strategy, the skies may indeed be getting a little more crowded—but also a lot more interesting.

In this rapidly evolving high-stakes game, one thing is clear: the next chapter in global aviation will be written not just in the skies, but in the intricate balance of international trade and diplomacy.

In a vibrant twist to the aviation narrative, Akasa Air is charting an ambitious course toward future growth, blending rapid expansion with strategic challenges. With less than three years in operation, the low-cost airline has become a dynamic player in India’s aviation market, doubling its passenger traffic and setting its sights on new heights—even as Boeing delivery delays pose hurdles along the way.

Fleet Expansion: A Bold Vision Takes Flight

Akasa Air is on track to grow its fleet to 30 aircraft, with its 28th Boeing 737 MAX scheduled to join later this month. This expansion is not just about more planes in the sky; it's a commitment to meeting soaring passenger demand. The airline boasts firm orders for 226 aircraft from Boeing, signaling a robust future despite the current delivery setbacks. The ambitious fleet plan underscores the strategic vision of chief executive Vinay Dube and his dedicated team.

Overcoming Challenges: Boeing Delays and Regulatory Hurdles

The journey hasn't been without turbulence. Akasa Air's rapid growth has encountered an unexpected headwind—delivery delays from Boeing. These delays are largely attributed to enhanced regulatory scrutiny following a 2024 incident, where a cabin panel on an Alaska Airlines 737 MAX aircraft blew out mid-flight. This heightened focus on safety has slowed down deliveries, with only around 65 of the 446 Boeing 737 MAX jets ordered by Indian carriers having been delivered to date. Boeing now aims to roll out two aircraft per month, a pace that, while steady, forces Akasa to sometimes ground pilots due to the inconsistency in fleet availability.

Financial Backing and Strategic Investment

In February, the airline secured $135 million in fresh capital—a robust financial boost that reinforces its aggressive expansion plans. The continued support of the Jhunjhunwala family, Akasa Air’s largest shareholder, exemplifies the strong confidence behind the airline’s vision. This investment surge ensures that operational hurdles, from fleet delivery gaps to pilot training interruptions, are met with prompt action and resourceful management.

Strategic Hubs: Navigating to Navi Mumbai and Jewar

Looking ahead, Akasa is gearing up to make a significant mark at two key airports in India—Navi Mumbai and Jewar. By the end of 2025, the carrier plans to station 5–7 aircraft at each location, with both airports expected to become central to its operational strategy. Dube has emphasized that being among the first tenants at these airports isn’t merely a logistical decision; it’s a strategic coup that will help define the airline’s identity in a competitive market. Interestingly, rival Air India Express is reportedly poised to expand its operations at these hubs as well, setting the stage for a dynamic rivalry that could spur further innovation and customer service excellence.

International Expansion: Charting New Global Routes

Beyond domestic success, international growth remains a core strategic pillar for Akasa Air. With flights already connecting 23 cities in India and five international destinations, the airline envisions a network that not only broadens its reach but also significantly boosts its profitability. Chief Executive Vinay Dube reiterates that venturing into international markets is both profitable and crucial for future sustainability. The airline’s rapid increase in passenger numbers—from 7.75 million in March 2024 to an impressive 16 million in March 2025—underscores the effectiveness of its expansion strategy and the burgeoning demand for its services.

A Dynamic Future in the Skies

As Akasa Air navigates the complex interplay between rapid growth and operational challenges, it stands as a testament to innovation in the aviation industry. Its ability to double passenger traffic, secure significant financial investments, and strategically position itself at upcoming major airports paints a picture of a company poised for long-term success. While Boeing delivery delays pose a temporary setback, Akasa’s forward-thinking approach suggests that these hurdles are just minor detours on a well-planned flight path towards industry leadership.

With its daring expansion plans and commitment to overcoming challenges, Akasa Air invites us to wonder: can this trailblazing airline redefine low-cost travel and set new benchmarks in aviation? Time will tell, but one thing is clear—the future of air travel in India is about to get a whole lot more exciting.

With Inputs from Business Standard

India’s largest carrier, IndiGo, is not just weathering global challenges—it’s setting a course for unprecedented growth despite the turbulence from worldwide tariff hikes. In a recent interaction with PTI, Chief Executive Pieter Elbers painted an upbeat picture of a carrier that remains undeterred by global price wars, aiming high in one of the world’s most promising domestic aviation markets. Let’s dive into the dynamic strategic vision that is steering IndiGo toward a horizon brimming with opportunities.

Resilience Amid Global Uncertainty

Navigating Global Tariff Wars

Global tariff hikes have recently sent ripples through international markets, but IndiGo’s management is steering clear of these headwinds. “Some of the more recent dynamics and the global scale are not changing any of our capacity expansion plans for next year,” said Pieter Elbers. The airline’s confidence underscores a deep belief that despite external pressures, strategic, long-term planning can weather even the roughest of economic storms. While acknowledging that a major economy such as India cannot be completely isolated from worldwide events, Elbers emphasizes that a transient “blip” in performance is no match for the robust trajectory set for the future.

Doubling the Fleet, Doubling the Vision

Ambition is at the heart of IndiGo’s strategy. With aspirations to double its size by the end of the decade, the airline is not only focused on maintaining its current market position but also on scaling up to meet both domestic and international challenges head-on. This ambitious roadmap reflects confidence and a commitment to long-term growth, irrespective of short-term market fluctuations.

Capitalizing on India’s Unmatched Domestic Market

The Power of a Big, Untapped Segment

India’s domestic aviation market remains a treasure trove of untapped potential. With thousands of cities and a burgeoning middle class, IndiGo sees a landscape ready to be transformed. Elbers pointedly noted that India’s enormous and competitively priced aviation sector, supported by relatively low average ticket costs, provides a fertile ground for expansion. This market dynamic not only fuels IndiGo’s growth engine but also positions the airline as a key player in bolstering India’s connectivity and economic development.

Competitive Edge in a Consolidating Market

While IndiGo enjoys a leading position, competition is fierce. The aviation duopoly in India, featuring formidable rivals like the Tata group, continues to drive innovation and efficiency. Elbers suggests that a globally competitive, large-scale airline elevates the entire aviation ecosystem in India. This consolidation, observed in various international markets, positions IndiGo at the nexus of increased market efficiency and improved customer service, ultimately benefiting the consumer.

Strategic Innovations and Industry Impacts

The “Missed Opportunity” of Parting Seats

During negotiations with international authorities, parting seats have become a contentious issue. Elbers highlighted that such arrangements represent a missed opportunity for Indian carriers. By sharing seats, foreign competitors often gain an unfair advantage, thereby limiting the growth prospects of domestic airlines. A strategic overhaul in such frameworks could empower IndiGo and its peers, reinforcing the broader narrative of Indian aviation autonomy and self-reliance.

Integration of Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Capabilities

Beyond flying passengers, IndiGo is also leveraging its robust operational network to extend its services globally. The airline’s practice of sending aircraft overseas for maintenance, repair, and overhaul underscores the employment potential of the aviation sector. With over 60,000 employees today, IndiGo’s growth signifies not just a corporate ambition but a substantial boost to the overall job market and ancillary industries tied to aviation.

Embracing Market Forces for Sustainable Growth

Flexibility in Fare Structures

The conversation around domestic airfares has been a hot topic, with voices calling for regulation. However, Elbers remains firm on trusting market mechanisms, emphasizing that fares adjust naturally with seasonality. Events like the Kumbh Mela may see a surge in costs due to heightened demand, but this dynamic pricing is a testament to the robust, competitive nature of India’s aviation market. Allowing the market to balance supply and demand reinforces IndiGo’s commitment to sustainable growth and consumer-centric policies.

Expanding Through Infrastructure Advancements

Infrastructure development continues to be a cornerstone of IndiGo’s expansion blueprint. With new airports emerging—such as the upcoming facility in Navi Mumbai—the carrier is set to enhance both its operational efficiency and regional connectivity. This dual approach of upgrading existing facilities while venturing into new territories ensures that IndiGo remains at the forefront of India’s aviation revolution.

Conclusion: A Flight Path to the Future

In the rapidly evolving world of aviation, IndiGo is charting an ambitious flight path that balances resilience with innovative growth—even in the face of global tariff-induced challenges. As worldwide price wars present transient hurdles, the airline’s long-term focus on capacity expansion, market dominance, and strategic consolidation remains unshaken. With an eye on both immediate opportunities and a vision that spans the decade ahead, IndiGo is not just flying—it’s soaring toward a future that promises robust economic and social impact for India.

The journey ahead is filled with challenges and triumphs alike, but one thing is clear: IndiGo is ready to lead the way in redefining India’s aviation narrative, setting a benchmark for competitors and inspiring a nation on the move.",https://www.100knots.com/airlines_dashboard/uploads/blog/1744945564.webp,N,,2025-04-18 08:56:36.942900

The Kremlin retaliated by blocking Western airlines from its airspace.
So far the Trump administration has not lifted any sanctions on Russia, but some signals are giving the Kremlin hope.
Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers.","BRUSSELS — Moscow is lobbying for the U.S. to open its skies to Russian airlines as part of a ceasefire deal with Ukraine.

But there's a big problem with that scheme — the EU isn't keen, and without Europe on board it won't be easy for Russian carriers to fly to the United States.

“First, EU sanctions stand firm against Russia, which includes a ban on Russian airlines flying over EU airspace,” said a European Commission official speaking on condition of anonymity.

Beyond the political decisions on sanctions, the EU official also pointed to “major safety and security issues” related to the possible reopening of EU airspace to Russian jets, as “it is not known if Russian air operators and air traffic services have been properly maintained over the past three years, putting the airworthiness of the Russian fleet seriously in question.”

Since Moscow's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Russian airlines have been banned from landing in and flying over the territory of the EU and the U.S., as well as from accessing spare parts for aircraft from Western manufacturers such as Boeing or Airbus. The Kremlin retaliated by blocking Western airlines from its airspace.

“As a result, there’s a high probability that bogus parts are being installed in aircraft operating within the Russian domestic market,” said Sander Starreveld, director of the SIG Aviation consultancy, warning of risks to aviation safety. “Allowing these aircraft to operate commercially in Europe is not only unsafe but also risks introducing counterfeit parts into the Union.”

Unsafe skies

In practical terms, reopening Europe's skies to Russian airlines such as flag carrier Aeroflot would also place a massive burden on the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The agency would be required to ensure that Russian airplanes have a level of safety that is equivalent with aircraft already operating in the EU, Starreveld said. “This process takes time, especially considering the workload involved.”

In addition to safety and certification issues, many Russian planes may never be able to land in Europe again because they are actually not Russian but were stolen from plane lessors after the invasion.

“Some aircraft could be seized immediately upon landing in Europe due to Russia’s unilateral decision to nationalize leased aircraft,” Starreveld said, noting that “there are massive debts owed to Western leasing companies, and I expect they’ll try to recover as many assets as possible.”

Pressure from Moscow

Despite such problems, Russia is demanding the resumption of direct flights to the U.S. as part of any agreement to stop fighting. Such a step “should be a consequence of the lifting of sanctions on Aeroflot,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on April 11.

“The Americans considered it, [but] so far we have not seen any reciprocal step,” the Russian minister said.

On Wednesday, Russia reportedly asked Washington to be allowed to buy planes built by U.S. manufacturer Boeing and to pay for them with Russian state assets that have been frozen since the start of the war, provided a ceasefire is reached.

So far the Trump administration has not lifted any sanctions on Russia, but some signals are giving the Kremlin hope.

In March, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Russia, Robert Agee, publicly called for the lifting of sanctions in the aviation sector.

“Russia has a huge fleet of Western planes, mostly Boeing. We believe we should provide spare parts and technical support for them, so we will try to have these sanctions lifted,” Agee told the Russian business daily RBC, adding: “This is less a business wish and more of a humanitarian necessity, as ordinary citizens suffer primarily from this.""

Any effort to loosen restrictions on U.S. and Russian airlines would increase pressure for similar steps from European carriers. The latter have long complained about the extra cost of avoiding Russia's vast airspace when flying to Asia, which has given an advantage to Chinese airlines.

Despite these competitive concerns, Brussels is wary of entering into negotiations with Moscow over access to its airspace, in part because of the unsafe nature of Russian skies.

The Commission official called the security of Russian airspace “problematic,” citing the Christmas Day crash of an Azerbaijan Airlines flight — allegedly after being struck by a Russian air defense missile — that prompted EASA to advise airlines to avoid all of western Russia.

Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized for the crash but stopped short of saying Russia had been responsible.","https://www.politico.eu/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=630,fit=crop,quality=80,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/16/12926648-scaled.jpg",N,,2025-04-18 04:56:35.440032

Marubeni Corporation (hereinafter, “Marubeni”), Japan Airlines Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “JAL”), Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation (hereinafter, “Mitsubishi Chemical”), Chugoku Lumber Co., Ltd. (hereinafter, “Chugoku Lumber”), Boeing Japan KK (hereinafter, “Boeing”) and Obayashi Corporation (hereinafter, “Obayashi”), have concluded a memorandum of understanding on a preliminary business feasibility study for the manufacture and sale of sustainable aviation fuel (hereinafter, “SAF”), bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel from domestic forest residues (hereinafter, the “Pre-Feasibility Study”).

Background and Significance

Japan is among the leading countries in terms of forest resources worldwide, with high expectations that thinning materials and residues generated from wood usage can be leveraged as sustainable raw materials due to their potential volume. In addition, the use of wood in large-scale wooden buildings, including high-rise buildings, is currently in the spotlight from the perspective of resource circulation, and it is expected that there will be an increase in opportunities to utilize the residues generated as a result of such initiatives.

Overview of the Pre-Feasibility Study

This study envisions the potential use of manufacturing technology developed by Licella*1 to produce a bio-intermediate (renewable oil) from wood residues, which will then be reformed and refined for use in making products such as SAF, bio-naphtha, and renewable diesel towards the building of a domestic supply chain. This supply will leverage a model involving local consumption of locally produced products. Specifically, the study will assess the economic viability of the business; consider the raw material supply and processing system as well as the manufacturing process; and evaluate product logistics and effectiveness in reducing CO2 emissions. The study is scheduled to run until December 2025 and aims to commercialize the product around 2030 depending on the progress of the study.

Future prospects

The companies participating in this study will pool their knowledge and expertise towards the realization of the domestic production of sustainable products; the creation of new industries utilizing forest resources throughout Japan; and the promotion of regional revitalization. In addition, by promoting the circulation of forest resources, they will aim to contribute to the resolution of Japan’s forestry challenges, including carbon fixation*2, water resource conservation*3, and disaster prevention.

Last Updated on:

A COMAC C919 rolls to the end of the runway at Shanghai Pudong, a clean-lined aircraft shimmering in the haze as ground crews finish their checks. In the background, a row of pristine Boeing 737 MAX aircraft sit unused, tails high, their future uncertain. The scene is an imagined one, but it’s reflective of reality: China is changing course, and one of the largest aerospace shifts in modern history is underway. Reports indicate that Beijing has instructed its domestic airlines to stop ordering U.S.-built passenger aircraft. The move is not simply an act of retaliation or trade war chess—it’s a signpost for a deeper transformation in industrial strategy, technological sovereignty, and geopolitical signaling.

The gravitational pull of China’s aviation market is well understood by insiders. In 2019, Chinese airlines carried over 660 million passengers, representing more than a trillion revenue passenger kilometers annually. The pandemic cratered that growth curve, but the rebound was swift. Today, passenger-kilometer totals are nearing pre-pandemic levels, with industry expectations of doubling by 2030, although I’m skeptical of that given the continued dominance of high-speed rail and Tencent Meeting (the Chinese alternative to Zoom). When Boeing or Airbus plan production lines, they do so with one eye on Toulouse and Everett, and the other fixed on Beijing.

For decades, China’s air fleets have been filled with Boeing and Airbus metal. The split was once relatively even, with Boeing holding the advantage in narrow-body workhorses and long-haul widebodies alike. ​Over the past decade, Boeing’s relationship with Chinese airlines has experienced a significant decline. Between 2015 and 2020, Boeing delivered 668 aircraft to Chinese customers, reflecting a robust partnership. However, from 2020 through March 2025, deliveries plummeted to just 109 aircraft. This downturn is attributed to a combination of factors, including the global grounding of the 737 MAX following two fatal crashes, escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, and China’s increasing investment in its domestic aerospace industry.

Europe’s Airbus built an assembly line in Tianjin in 2009, deepened its political relationships, and has increasingly become the go-to supplier. Boeing, meanwhile, has seen its position erode not just due to politics but performance—and that matters.

There’s also the emergence of China’s COMAC as a credible manufacturer. The ARJ21 was a slow, clunky, underperforming regional jet built with dated technology and endless delays. But it served its purpose as a systems integration testbed, and it taught COMAC and its suppliers how to build, certify, and support a commercial airliner. That experience paved the way for the C919, China’s first real attempt at challenging the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737 head-on. The aircraft uses modern avionics and Western engines, but it is designed, assembled, and delivered under Chinese control. More importantly, it’s being pushed into the fleet not as a speculative startup venture, but with the full weight of the Chinese state behind it.

At the same time, Boeing has been disassembling the institutional knowledge and engineering culture that once made it the world’s most respected airplane manufacturer. Its embrace of the Jack Welch school of quarterly capitalism from General Electric—cutting R&D, gutting engineering oversight, offshoring everything it could, prioritizing stock buybacks—has been well documented. The 737 MAX crisis wasn’t a one-off error. It was a systemic failure, the inevitable result of decades of eroding technical competence in favor of financial optimization. I have written about the substitution of engineers with finance MBAs, the rise of offshoring for supplier risk dilution rather than integration quality, and the near-total loss of executive leadership that understood the physics of flight. Boeing didn’t lose China. It gave it away.

There’s more. While Airbus capitalized on the vacuum, delivering hundreds of A320neo-family jets and securing long-term relationships, China has been working toward something even more consequential: not just supplier diversification, but supplier replacement. The orders for 300 C919s by China’s Big Three airlines are not just a vote of confidence—they are a domestic industrial policy in action. COMAC is ramping production capacity to 150–200 units per year by the end of the decade. That’s a credible share of China’s expected single-aisle fleet expansion, and a strategic firewall against geopolitical shocks. China doesn’t want to be held hostage to U.S. export policy or EU regulatory leverage. It wants to own the full stack of its own aviation future. And as a reminder, turbine metals are mostly processed in China, and it’s just put export licenses on them targeted at the USA and hence Boeing and Lockheed Martin.

The implications go far beyond fleet planning. The global aerospace sector relies on tight regulatory harmonization, overlapping supply chains, and decades of accumulated interoperability. COMAC’s current products use CFM engines and Western avionics, but the trend is toward domestic substitution where possible. In parallel, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) is working to establish its own certification regime that will rival the FAA or EASA—not just for internal purposes, but for export into Belt and Road countries with aligned regulatory standards. This is how parallel systems emerge: not through confrontation, but through quiet, persistent divergence.

And here’s the part that too few in Washington or Chicago seem to grasp: this isn’t a tantrum. It’s a transition. China is not rejecting Boeing as a company. It’s rejecting a model—a model of industrial dependency, of outsourced accountability, of financialized engineering. Airbus should not be resting easy. It may be the preferred Western supplier today, but its future status is conditional. COMAC’s widebody program, the CR929, has been bumpy, especially after Russia’s withdrawal. But the ambition remains. China is not interested in winning on price alone. It wants the prestige, leverage, and supply chain sovereignty that come from fielding a full domestic aviation stack.

This realignment isn’t purely about China either. It sends shockwaves through the entire global aviation system. Boeing’s declining relevance in the world’s most important growth market puts its long-term production planning at risk. Suppliers who depend on Boeing for orders are being squeezed. And smaller states that used to play Boeing and Airbus off one another may soon find they have a third axis in COMAC—one that comes with financing, infrastructure packages, and political ties. India, Turkey, and other regional powers are watching closely. Aviation is one of the last high-tech sectors with massive barriers to entry. China is demonstrating how to scale those walls.

And Trump’s tariffs hit Boeing hard. The 25% markup on imported aluminum, so essential to airframes, when the USA imports most of their supply of the metal, means Boeing is both losing customers and seeing increasing costs. This isn’t a good combination from a survival perspective.

In late 2024, China’s Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC) granted type certification to the RX4E, a four-seat electric aircraft developed by the Liaoning General Aviation Academy. This marked the first time an electric aircraft received such certification under China’s CCAR-23 regulations, which govern airworthiness for normal category aircraft. In fact, it’s the first commercial electric airplane certified to carry passengers globally. The RX4E, powered by a 70 kWh lithium battery and capable of a 1.5-hour flight time, is designed for applications like pilot training, sightseeing, and aerial photography. This certification signifies China’s commitment to advancing electric aviation technology and integrating it into its broader transportation infrastructure. China has also certified an evtol from eHang for passenger flights, which while mostly a dead end flex, is still more than the west has done. It’s also rapidly expanding production of sustainable aviation fuel.

All of this raises hard questions for the United States. The pivot to quarterly earnings as the primary metric of corporate health has gutted its industrial base across sectors, from semiconductors to power transformers to commercial aircraft. Boeing could have remained a globally dominant aerospace manufacturer, but instead financially engineered its way to failing aircraft and exclusion from the biggest growing market in the world. Meanwhile, China built plants, trained engineers, certified aircraft, and now fields its own jets, while keeping most of its citizens on the ground in low-carbon, high-speed rail. It’s a lesson in what happens when a nation-state takes industry, climate change and transportation seriously.

The future of aviation is becoming multipolar. Boeing, once a synonym for safe, efficient, and globally interoperable air travel, is now a full stop in one of the most critical markets on Earth and a question mark elsewhere. Airbus is the near-term winner, but it plays under the long shadow of strategic substitution. COMAC isn’t ready to compete globally yet—but it doesn’t have to. It only has to dominate at home, and in doing so, redefine what the next era of aviation looks like.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ChatGPT-Image-Apr-17-2025-09_17_34-PM-800x533.png,N,,2025-04-18 04:56:44.783329

In 1980, the United States accounted for 44% of global wheat exports; today that total is just 11%. Over the last five years, the US corn export market share has fallen to a record-low 31%, down from a high of above 80% in the 1970s. Once the leader in soybean exports, the United States has watched Brazil supplant it; it now accounts for only 27% of soybean shipments compared to 80% five decades ago.

And now, amid another trade war with China, the world’s largest soybean importer, and other countries that import US ag products, that downward spiral may continue.

In March, US President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, his social-media platform, that US agricultural producers should prepare to “start making a lot of agricultural products to be sold INSIDE of the United States.”

Sounds simple enough, but it flies in the face of reality. The United States currently exports about 25% of the grain it produces each year, including more than half of its soybeans. Even with domestic industrial uses of grain steadily climbing in recent years, the percentage of bulk ag commodities (corn, soybeans, wheat, rice, sorghum, pulses and cotton) shipped overseas has been trending higher, including a 22% increase last year, the biggest year-on-year increase in more than a decade.

Finding additional domestic demand drivers for grains and oilseeds is possible, perhaps with increased biofuel use such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel or some other industrial use that has yet to be discovered. But even in a best-case scenario, it takes years for these new markets to develop.

One of the long-term impacts of trade wars, even after they end, is a loss of reputation as a reliable supplier on the global market, something that can take years to repair. Countries that have no choice but to rely on grain imports to feed their people not only consider cost and quality, but they also want stable trading partners that deliver products in a consistent manner year by year, without disruption.

It took the United States a long time to be viewed as a reliable supplier following grain embargoes in the 1970s and 80s. The same thing has happened with soybean exports following the US-China trade war from 2018 to 2020, as China has shifted to Brazil as its primary soybean supplier.

The recent trade wars have not only fueled more conflict and mistrust between the world’s two major economic powers, but relationships between the United States and its allies like the European Union, Canada and Mexico have been strained by Trump’s freewheeling tariff policies.

Once the dust settles in this latest trade war, perhaps another era of free trade will begin. Until then, with tariffs and counter-tariffs flying back and forth between countries, what we’re witnessing is a race to the bottom with mostly losers and very few winners.",https://www.petfoodprocessing.net/ext/resources/Articles/2025/04April/041725_Trade-war-impacting-Ag_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1744891277&width=1200,N,,2025-04-18 07:56:14.417392

The job includes helping the agency get to its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, the same year Massport turns 75.
At the Barr Foundation, Horwood worked as director of its Boston Waterfront Initiative, which focused on promoting access and development focused climate resilience.
Overall, aviation fuel accounts for two to three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Davey.
“But still, we take care all of that, it’s only a 10 percent reduction of our own greenhouse gas emissions.","THE MASSACHUSETTS PORT Authority, which owns and operates high emissions-producing Logan International Airport, has hired its first chief climate and resilience officer.

The agency, also known as Massport, announced the hiring of Jill Valdes Horwood, who has worked for the Barr Foundation, a grant-making private foundation, and advocacy group Boston Harbor Now, as the new chief. The job includes helping the agency get to its goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2031, the same year Massport turns 75.

“Jill brings a strong track record in climate policy and advocacy that will be critical as we continue our Net Zero initiatives and prepare for the long-term impacts of climate change,” Rich Davey, Massport’s CEO, said in a statement.

At the Barr Foundation, Horwood worked as director of its Boston Waterfront Initiative, which focused on promoting access and development focused climate resilience. She served as Boston Harbor Now’s director of policy, and she previously has done legal work for victims of domestic violence and underserved populations.

Aside from Logan Airport, Massport’s portfolio of facilities includes Worcester Regional Airport; Hanscom, an airfield 20 miles northwest of Boston; the Port of Boston’s Conley Terminal serving container ships; and the Flynn Cruiseport, which serves cruise ships.

Massport’s emissions come from a central heating plant, cargo handling equipment, its maritime facilities, emergency generators, and snow melters, among other machinery. But the largest generator of emissions is aviation fuel.

“Ninety percent of greenhouse gas emissions at Logan Airport come from aviation fuels,” Davey said during a recent talk to members of the Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM) at a local law firm. Overall, aviation fuel accounts for two to three percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Davey.

“We’re doing all the things you would expect a manager of facilities to do. We’re changing our light bulbs, we’re buying electric vehicles, we’re putting in charging plug-ins for customers. We’re doing all that,” he said. “But still, we take care all of that, it’s only a 10 percent reduction of our own greenhouse gas emissions. So sustainable aviation fuel is still reasonably new and there are some promising technologies. We’ll see how far off they are.”

Massport is interested in helping the technology along. “We’re really focused on how we can scale it, how we can get some adoption going, at Hanscom for example, or at Worcester or Logan,” Davey said. “It’s exciting to be at the forefront of that question.”",https://commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Transportation_Logan-Airport_Plane_Sunset.png,N,,2025-04-17 20:57:06.301742

Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) has received a Level 4 accreditation in the Airports Council International (ACI) Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program, the second-highest level awarded by ACI. “Level 4 recognizes an airport for measuring carbon emissions from both an airport authority and third parties operating on site, and for demonstrating emissions reduction progress,” said Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), which runs LAX. LAX achieved Level 3 accreditation in 2017. “In 2023, a 26% reduction of [non-aeronautical] energy consumption per passenger at LAX from 2011 levels was achieved, two years ahead of LAWA's 2025 goal,” LAWA noted. Airports in the ACI APA program can ultimately achieve as high as a Level 5 accreditation, which means the airport has “reached net zero for emissions under their control and committed to full decarbonization across all scopes by 2050,” according to ACI.

Casablanca Mohammed V International Airport plans to build a new $1.5 billion passenger terminal. The facility—described by the National Airports Office of Morocco as a “hub-style terminal” aimed at facilitating connectivity—will have capacity to handle 20 million passengers annually. The project is targeted for a 2029 completion.

Hong Kong International Airport (HKG) was the busiest cargo airport in the world in 2024, according to Airports Council International World (ACI). HKG handled 4.9 million metric tons of cargo in 2024, up 14.1% year-over-year. ACI noted that combined volumes at the top 10 busiest cargo airports in the world in 2024—representing nearly 26% of global volumes—rose 9.3% year-over-year to 32.3 million metric tons. “The increase in cargo is attributed mainly to strong e-commerce demand, maritime shipping disruptions and declines in jet fuel price,” ACI said. Shanghai Pudong International Airport (3.8 million metric tons, up 9.8% over 2023) and FedEx base hub Memphis International Airport (3.7 million metric tons, down 3.3%) were the second- and third-busiest cargo airports in the world, respectively, in 2024, according to ACI. Four through 10 on the ACI busiest cargo airports list for 2024 were: Anchorage, UPS Airlines base hub Louisville, Seoul Incheon, Miami, Doha, Guangzhou and Taipei. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport remained the busiest passenger airport in the world in 2024.

New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) will roll out trials of four full body scanners at security checkpoints in May. “These advanced scanners detect both metallic and non-metallic threats, including explosives, significantly improving upon traditional metal detectors,” DEL said. “The technology … enables rapid screening, with each scan taking just three seconds and a maximum throughput of 1,200 scans per hour, dramatically improving efficiency while minimizing passenger inconvenience.” The scanners generate a 2D image on a preset human avatar and images are not stored, DEL noted. The machines have already been installed—two in DELs Terminal 1 and two in Terminal 3. DEL said the trial of the four scanners will last 3-4 months, after which a committee will evaluate the findings and determine whether and how a full-scale implementation could be put in place.

India boasts one of the youngest aircraft fleets globally. Nearly 59% of commercial aircraft in operation today belong to the latest generation of narrowbody and regional jets. This number is expected to rise to an impressive 95% by 2041. Airlines like IndiGo, Akasa Air, Air India Express, and SpiceJet are investing heavily in fuel-efficient aircraft such as the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX to reduce fuel burn and emissions per seat.

Fleet renewal, however, is just the beginning. The real test will be compliance with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which India is set to formally join in 2027. CORSIA requires airlines to purchase offsets for emissions above 2020 levels on international routes, effectively placing a price on carbon-heavy operations.

While CORSIA is a global step toward aviation decarbonization, its rollout raises tough questions: Who will pay for greener flying? And how will Indian carriers remain cost-competitive while absorbing higher operational costs? Answering such tough questions on carbon emissions airline leaders pooled together their thoughts at recently held India Travel & Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025. Speaking on Air India Express’ objectives Aloke Singh, managing director, Air India Express said: “We have started a green flight program to optimize fuel consumption and reduce emissions.” But Singh also emphasized the need for robust planning: “It is vital to involve finance teams early to understand the cost implications of CORSIA compliance,” he added.

This concern over cost is echoed across the industry. Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), seen as a key enabler of low-carbon flight, currently costs five times more than traditional jet fuel, a pricing mismatch that makes large-scale adoption challenging without subsidies or policy incentives. In spite of this, industry leaders are optimistic. Aditya Ghosh, Co-Founder of Akasa Air and former President of IndiGo, believes India can play a pivotal role in reshaping the economics of green aviation: “India can play a leading role with respect to sustainable aviation fuel by plugging into the global supply chain opportunities.” However, he warned of a growing financial gap, adding: “There is a funding gap of around $350 million between traditional aviation fuel and a 10% SAF blend.”

This gap poses a serious question for airlines: Should passengers absorb this cost through ticket prices, or will governments and fuel producers step in to help bridge it? So, what does aviation need? The answer lies in Tech-Led innovation and policy reform.

Beyond SAF, Indian airlines are also investing in data-driven efficiencies and emerging aircraft technologies to reduce carbon intensity. Ajay Singh, Chairman and Managing Director of SpiceJet, offered a forward-looking perspective: “We need to use technology advances like artificial intelligence and machine learning to find new ways to burn fewer fossil fuels. We need to aggressively pursue the development of electric aircraft for our future flying needs.” He further urged the government to foster a more supportive ecosystem: “India needs to reduce taxes on aviation turbine fuel and improve the business environment to make the sector globally competitive.”

These structural reforms, combined with strategic partnerships, could position India as both a hub for sustainable aviation and a leading voice in shaping equitable global climate policy.

As India’s aviation market is projected to become the world’s third-largest by 2030, the country has a unique opportunity to demonstrate how rapid growth can coexist with environmental responsibility. The transition won’t be easy: high fuel prices, regulatory compliance, and supply chain hurdles for SAF and offsets will require shared responsibility across the aviation value chain.

But with forward-thinking leadership, fleet investments, and a collaborative approach to sustainability, Indian aviation could become a case study in how to scale responsibly lifting passengers and carbon standards at the same time.",https://english.mathrubhumi.com/image/contentid/policy:1.10329823:1740314637/flight.jpg?$p=c600d7d&f=16x9&w=1080&q=0.8,N,,2025-04-17 14:56:41.401124

Problems at the facility have caused toxic chemical releases and a record air quality fine.

Its closure would mean Benicia would lose millions of dollars a year and hundreds of jobs.

It could also mean the price you pay for gas may rise dramatically.

RELATED: Valero may close Benicia refinery by next year, citing CA regulations and high costs

Valero has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to ""idle, restructure, or cease refining operations"" at the Benicia Refinery, drawing strong reactions across the state. UC Berkeley's Severin Borenstein is an expert in this field and has testified in front of lawmakers on refinery matters.

""It's quite disturbing that the refinery produces about 9% of the gasoline in California,"" Borenstein said.

According to a statement from the company, the refinery is seeking closure because of the high costs and strict environmental regulations in California.

""Certainly, one has to wonder how much this is a negotiating stance because they have recently seen a lot of pressure from the city of Benicia to change their operations,"" Borenstein said.

Denton Cinquegrana, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service, gave his perspective on the future of the refinery.

""Closing the refinery is one of the options; they could also decide to reconfigure it to make it a facility to make something like renewable diesel or sustainable aviation fuel,"" he said.

The real question here is if this refinery closes, will California gas prices rise?

""So yeah, it's gonna be a tight-rope and has the potential to swing prices potentially higher,"" Cinquegrana said.

Borenstein and Cinquegrana both point to the closure of the Phillips 66 Refinery in Southern California. They say that with another possible closure, the state must plan to import more gas to keep prices from rising too drastically.

""We just need to do it in a way that's not going to disrupt the supply-demand balance,"" Borenstein said. ""If we lose too many refineries too quickly, we're going to end up with a shortage, but we could very well see a 25 to 30 cent increase as a possibility.""

""The refinery is not scheduled to close for another year, so a lot can change in another year,"" Cinquegrana said.

There is a hope that the state and company work together on the matter, so drivers aren't impacted too much at the pump come next year.

Valery released this statement from Chairman, CEO and President Lane Riggs:

""Valero Energy Corporation announced today that its subsidiary, Valero Refining Company-California, has submitted notice to the California Energy Commission of its current intent to idle, restructure, or cease refining operations at Valero's Benicia Refinery by the end of April 2026.

An old plane for a greener future

The original idea was to rehabilitate a light and reliable aircraft, suitable for an aeroclub's needs, while making it sustainable and environmentally friendly. This is how the Phoenix project was born. The team recently received the plane, a Jodel D119, a two-seat taildragger aircraft dating from 1958. It is a homebuilt aircraft, maintained by its previous pilot, accumulating about 2,000 flight hours. The purchase of the aircraft was made possible thanks to a $60,000 donation from the Howmet Aerospace Foundation. The original gasoline engine will be replaced by a Citroën C4 Picasso Diesel engine, modified to use SAF, a more ecological alternative to the typical fuel used for light aviation, Avgas 100LL.

Mathis Blanchard, co-leader of the project, explains: ""The challenge today for aviation is learning to fly cleanly. Through this project, we are exploring solutions on our scale.""

The project aims to meet the local demand expected for this type of green fuel over the next few years. It also opens new horizons for export to foreign markets, capitalizing on the growing global demand, especially with the petroleum sector having the technical and logistical components needed for success.

Notably, the project is part of a broader package of green initiatives adopted by the ministry through ECHEM to provide green, environmentally friendly products and reduce carbon emissions.

Badawi said that the meeting reinforces the ministries’ joint efforts and demonstrates the government’s keenness on executing projects with significant economic and environmental value.

For her part, Minister Fouad said that this cooperation for SAF reflects the state’s commitment to a seamless transition toward a green economy. She added that in coordination with the Ministries of Petroleum and Civil Aviation, her ministry is working to develop a clear roadmap that supports this project, with stimulating investments and building partnerships with the private sector as its main pillars. She noted that this type of biofuel is a clean, safe alternative that meets international environmental standards.

She pointed out that selling or trading carbon certificates is not permitted except in accordance with specific controls and standards. Moreover, the Ministry of Petroleum has set emission reduction rates within the national contributions plan for several high-priority projects.

Discussing waste management, Fouad said that it is an area with plenty of green incentives and privileges available for investors under the investment law. Four areas where opportunities for effective private sector participation in investment are especially vast are: green hydrogen, electric transportation, waste management, and alternatives to single-use plastic bags.

Fouad revealed that the Waste Management Regulatory Agency will soon present a business model for using biofuel production inputs from used cooking oils, agricultural waste, and other sources. The model will determine economic feasibility and cost to ensure the sustainability of the field, and its long-term ability to attract investments, she said.

For his part, Minister El-Hefny underlined the importance of localizing SAF production in Egypt following international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

He added that establishing the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company is a major milestone in the journey towards leading this promising industry in Africa.

El-Hefny praised the pivotal role played by the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources with its advanced expertise in the fields of refining and energy. It is greatly contributing to supporting local and international high-quality production. He also said that a comprehensive feasibility study is crucial. It should include technical, economic, and operational aspects, and be approved by the concerned authorities.

Equally important is the development of effective logistical mechanisms to ensure the efficiency of the supply and distribution chain, both within Egyptian airports and internationally. This would guarantee high performance and sustainability.

During the meeting, Chairman of ECHEM, Ibrahim Mekki, noted that ESAF, a first-of-its-kind project in Africa and the Middle East, relies on a modern, internationally-approved technology to produce SAF from used cooking oil.

He noted that creating a joint follow-up team from the three concerned ministries is a catalyst for the project’s implementation and the maximization of its economic and environmental returns.

During the meeting, Tamer Heakal, Chairman of ESAF, reviewed the project’s business plan, objectives, and implementation procedures.

ESAF, a $530 million investment project, is expected to produce 120,000 tons of SAF annually, utilizing advanced hydrotreatment technologies for conversion. Production is planned to meet local demand and support exports to global markets. The project spans an area of 100,000 square meters near the Dekheila Port, Heakal noted.

He revealed that selecting a manufacturing license and an engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor is still in progress. Additionally, the selection process of international financing agencies is underway and is seeing notable progress. Similarly, efforts to market the project’s output to global companies and secure input from used cooking oil are advancing steadily, according to Haekal.

But with the challenges of geopolitics, ever-changing regulations, and the need to adapt to disruptions, supply chain leaders are rethinking operations on many levels.

At Microsoft, prioritizing sustainable practices with suppliers has also helped us uncover new opportunities for innovation and cost optimization.

Our new guide, Reduce Risk, Create Resilience: Advancing Supply Chain Sustainability, outlines how data intelligence and collaboration can transform supply chains to be more agile, sustainable, and resilient. We offer lessons from our own experience as we strive to meet our ambitions to be carbon negative, water positive, and zero waste by 2030, all while protecting ecosystems. And we provide actionable insights and practical steps to help customers address reporting pressures, mitigate risks, and seize opportunities for innovation, ultimately driving resilience and long-term value.

Aligning data and systems for the road ahead

Organizations are facing growing regulations and customer expectations to prioritize sustainable practices. To make meaningful change, organizations and their suppliers must share data and work together to address challenges across the ecosystem.

Advanced analytics and AI are transforming supply chain sustainability at Microsoft. By leveraging these technologies, we accelerate day-to-day work, gain real-time insights, and drive co-innovation to meet sustainability reporting requirements as well as business continuity needs.

For instance, our procurement team used Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability to centralize supplier emissions data and streamline processes. By integrating AI-powered automation, such as automated review of supplier assurance letters, we reduced survey processing time by 92%.

Eckes-Granini, a European producer of name-brand fruit juices, is committed to ensuring that all its raw ingredients are sustainably sourced by 2030. The company used Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform including Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Power BI to connect to essential data sources and create precise visualizations of suppliers’ progress. This enables Eckes-Granini to track risks and follow up with suppliers accordingly. Now almost 70% of Eckes-Granini’s juice ingredients meet sustainability standards, and the company is better prepared to respond to Germany’s Supply Chain Due Diligence Act.

Choosing carbon-free electricity solutions

Carbon-free electricity (CFE), such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, can be a powerful lever for decarbonization, helping companies achieve up to 50% of their decarbonization goals through improved fuel efficiency and reduce exposure to varying fuel prices.1 2 Organizations can help scale the benefits of CFE in supply chains by launching supplier enablement programs.

To help meet our own carbon reduction targets, Microsoft now requires suppliers to transition to 100% carbon-free electricity for the goods and services delivered to Microsoft by 2030. We’re making this easier for suppliers through our Supplier REach Portal, co-created with 3Degrees, to streamline access and procurement of CFE; and Zettawatts’ Supplier CFE Program, to provide assistance for reaching our CFE requirement, from understanding CFE procurement to discussing goals, developing plans and budgets, and reviewing agreements.

Turkish energy company Enerjisa Üretim established a round-the-clock remote operation center that receives more than 50,000 signals per second from its large network of hydropower, wind, and solar plants. It processes the data using an Azure-based solution including Azure IoT Hub, Azure Digital Twins, and Azure Machine Learning. The solution delivers real-time monitoring and data analytics on power plant performance—all in one centralized location. It also uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service to forecast future outcomes, predicting average daily production for turbines for up to two months.

Creating new value from resource optimization

The World Economic Forum estimates that adopting circular business models could unlock up to USD4.5 trillion in value by 2030.3 By adopting circularity, companies can not only help meet regulatory requirements but also drive new innovation, enhance their brand reputation, and differentiate their business.

With a focus on the long-term value of resources, companies can uncover ways to reduce environmental impact while also increasing value for the business. Supply chains are central to this opportunity.

To help meet our goal of becoming a zero waste company by 2030, Microsoft set a target of reusing or recycling 90% of our cloud hardware by 2025. We not only reached that target a year early—we exceeded it. In 2024, we reached a 90.9% reuse and recycling rate of our cloud servers and components.

Within our global datacenters, Microsoft Circular Centers are foundational to this work, enabling us to process and route decommissioned servers and hardware components to their next useful lives, such as internal reuse, other electronic supply chains, or academies that train datacenter technicians.

Reinventing supply chain logistics

Supply chain logistics challenges are bigger than any one company. To meet growing regulatory and market pressures, organizations need to leverage data and AI technology across their ecosystems and industries. Sharing data at a more granular level, they can identify opportunities to improve infrastructure and boost sustainability across whole logistics networks.

Applying this principle, Microsoft has moved our cloud supply chain to renewable diesel in our road freight operations in Europe and California while keeping existing equipment in use.

We’re also advancing aviation decarbonization by integrating sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) into shipments of cloud hardware. Through multi-year agreements, we’re working to reduce air freight emissions and help scale the adoption of SAF across the industry.3

Results so far include:

50% lower emissions for road freight operations in Europe and California, using renewable diesel.

17,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents (mtCO2e) saved through SAF, compared to conventional transportation fuels.

73% lower relative carbon intensity of our cloud logistics supply chain since 2022 through lower-carbon transportation and logistics consolidation.

(Jet Zero) has moved into the front-end engineering and design (FEED) phase for its planned Project Ulysses, a grassroots development involving construction of a renewable fuels plant in the Townsville State Development Area of North Queensland, Australia (OGJ Online, Dec. 23, 2024).

Following preliminary agreements in December 2024, Jet Zero in April finalized award of a contract to Technip Energies (T.EN) for delivery of FEED services on the project that, if completed, will be equipped to produce 102 million l./year of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and 11 million l./year of renewable diesel from a feedstock of Australian bioethanol, Jet Zero and T.EN said in separate releases.

T.EN’s scope of work under the contract covers an extensive package of engineering activities, documentation, and planning, all aimed at refining a cost estimate and detailed timelines for the project, the service provider said on Apr. 16.

Alongside the FEED contract award, Jet Zero also confirmed continuance of an engineering services contract with Melbourne-based Long Energy and Resources (Aust) Pty. Ltd. (LERA), which will provide specialist project management and owner engineering services to assure FEED engineering is delivered to Jet Zero’s design philosophy and in compliance with the FEED contract.

Award of the T.EN and LERA contracts—each of which are anticipated to run for several months—to complete Project Ulysses’ estimated $36.8-million (Aus.; $22.1-million) FEED program was made possible through crucial funding support from Jet Zero’s investors and industry partners, the operator said.

External partners supporting the project include aviation affiliates Airbus SE and Qantas Airways Ltd., as well as Japanese petroleum producer and refiner Idemitsu Kosan Co. Ltd.

Financial support for Project Ulysses also came from the government of Australia via Australian Renewable Energy Agency’s (ARENA) Advancing Renewables Program and the Queensland government’s Department of State Development, Infrastructure and Planning, which together awarded Jet Zero a combined $14 million (Aus.) in late 2024 to help take project development through the FEED stage into final investment decision (FID), Jet Zero said in a release dated Oct. 9, 2024.

Additional project details

Slated to become Australia’s first alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) low-carbon liquid fuels production (LCLF) plant by its targeted startup in late 2027 or early 2028, Project Ulysses will use LanzaJet Inc.’s proprietary ATJ technology that incorporates T.EN’s patented Hummingbird technology for converting a feedstock of Australian bioethanol to ethylene, the latter of which will subsequently be transformed—using LanzaJet’s oligomerization and hydrogenation technology—into SAF and renewable diesel, according to Jet Zero and ARENA.

An official project description from ARENA indicated the FEED study for Project Ulysses is due for completion by Jan. 1, 2026.

In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.
Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.
And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.
Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now.","Minnesota’s electric grid is cleaner than ever, and the state is well positioned to take advantage of emerging energy industries, Clean Energy Economy Minnesota said Thursday.

But federal policy chaos — driven by President Donald Trump’s tariffs and general preference for fossil fuels — as well as shifting consumer behavior and lagging implementation of environmentally friendly technologies hint at bigger challenges ahead for one of the fastest-growing sectors of the state’s economy, analysts and industry representatives said at a Monday press briefing.

“Certainly there’s a lot going on right now…that makes predicting the future and [even] predicting today a little bit unsteady,” said Becky Wacker, director of energy services sales in North America for Trane Technologies.

The U.S. power sector saw a “dramatic transformation” in recent years thanks to falling costs for wind and solar power, state clean energy policies and long-term clean power purchase commitments by tech giants like Amazon and Google, said Derrick Flakoll, Bloomberg NEF senior policy associate. In Minnesota, carbon emissions from power generation fell 52% between 2005 and 2024 as cheaper, lower-emitting sources edged coal off the grid, according to CEEM’s 2025 energy factsheet.

More recently, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 spurred investment in nascent clean-tech industries like low-emissions hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel, which airlines and jet manufacturers see as key to their long-term sustainability goals. CEEM’s factsheet touted the Minnesota Sustainable Aviation Fuel Tax Credit, which pays $1.50 per gallon of sustainable aviation fuel produced and sold in Minnesota through June 2030, and a biofuels startup’s plan to build a $5 billion sustainable aviation fuel plant in Moorhead that could eventually produce nearly 200 million gallons of fuel each year.

These investments “now face significant market risk” due to the Trump administration’s hefty — and self-contradictory — import tariffs, and the very real possibility that Congress narrows or repeals key IRA tax credits later this year.

“The fate of this is hanging in the balance (due to) a lot of political and economic factors,” Flakoll said.

State-level policy looks steadier in the near term, Wacker said. That could be a silver lining for HVAC and refrigeration businesses like Trane, which has rebranded itself as a leader in building efficiency and decarbonization.

“A number of states are staying pretty consistent in how they’re approaching things,” she said.

Minnesota is 10th in the nation for “overall energy efficiency,” according to the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. A 2021 law that boosted utility-led efficiency programs saved residents and businesses more than $307 million over two years, CEEM said.

But Minnesota’s ambitious efficiency and sustainability policies haven’t translated into action to the extent seen in nation-leading states and cities, Wacker said. She nodded to Washington state, which will begin holding larger buildings to strict sustainability standards next year; and New York City, where Local Law 97 encourages landlords to swap out creaky boilers for efficient heat pumps.

On electric vehicle uptake, Minnesota lags the national trendline. New registrations fell 44% from 2023 to 2024, slipping below 10,000, as EV sales grew 6.5% nationally, CEEM found. Minnesota had 65,679 plug-in EVs on its roads in November 2024, according to CEEM — less than 2% of total light-duty vehicle registrations. Plug-in vehicles accounted for 1 in 4 vehicle registrations last year in California, the top U.S. EV market, though the total share of EV registrations there remains far lower.

And while it’s not yet clear whether it’s a blip or part of a longer-term trend, Minnesota’s wind power industry stalled out last year.

“That’s a little different from past years, when we had a combination of wind and solar [added to the grid],” said Cathy Liebowitz, director of member engagement for CEEM.

Flakoll said wind power has several factors working against it right now. Most of the windiest areas already have working turbines; solar farm construction costs are rapidly declining; and the massive scale of the typical wind project can complicate projects, he said.

State lawmakers passed a major energy permitting reform bill last year that could accelerate approvals for large-scale wind and solar installations, but the law won’t take effect until July.

Despite the wind slowdown, CEEM’s latest factsheet had some qualified good news for Minnesota utility customers. The average consumer paid 12.36 cents per kilowatt-hour in 2024, up 1.2% from 2023 and 30% from 2015, CEEM said. But that’s lower than the 2024 national average of 12.99 cents per kilowatt-hour — up 2.4% from 2023.

Minnesotans should blame the aging electric grid and volatile natural gas prices for steadily rising electricity rates, rather than wind and solar farms, Liebowitz and Flakoll said.

Transmission and distribution grid infrastructure account for 63% of the $45 billion Xcel Energy plans to invest through 2029, compared with 11% for renewable power, the utility said in November.

“The grid is old in general, so updating it regardless of whether it’s clean or not is something states are working on,” Liebowitz said.

Meanwhile, the actual cost of generating power is closely correlated with natural gas prices because gas-fired power plants tend to be the “last” units called on to meet demand, Flakoll said.

“If you rely on natural gas at the margin, you are going to affect bills,” he said. “To say renewables are the driving force behind these electricity rate increases would be overly simplistic and probably not true.”

With more than 1,900 delegates in attendance, this year’s edition drilled into the industry's top priorities: digital transformation, sustainability, and resilience.

From geopolitical disruptions to supply chain pressure and green targets, the air cargo sector is being reshaped—and WCS Dubai served as a platform to align ambition with action.

Brendan Sullivan, IATA’s Global Head of Cargo, set a serious tone, emphasising that “civil aviation must never be used as a pawn in geopolitical disputes,” while underlining the need for compliance and accountability in handling dangerous goods like lithium batteries. Safety, he stressed, cannot be compromised.

UAE Minister of Economy Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, welcoming delegates to Dubai, pointed to the aviation sector's central role in the country’s economic growth, contributing 13% to the national GDP, and highlighted the UAE’s bold push for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and other clean energy solutions.

There was no shortage of ambition on display. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, called data the most transformative force in air cargo today. “Because of digitalisation, we’re able to secure critical shipments and push the industry toward full automation,” he said. Still, he voiced concern over the high costs of e-SAF and the challenges ahead for net-zero goals.

Executives from dnata, Emirates SkyCargo, Cathay Cargo, and Kuehne+Nagel shared a candid look at how the industry is navigating its digital shift. Badr Abbas, Emirates’ new Divisional SVP for Cargo, and Clive Sauvé-Hopkins, CEO Airport Operations at dnata, emphasised Dubai’s growing influence as a logistics hub—powered by advanced cargo infrastructure and investments in sustainability.

From predictive AI in inventory management to the adoption of IATA ONE Record, digitalisation took centre stage. Speakers urged that tech-led transformation needs to extend beyond airlines and reach every node in the cargo chain—from ground handlers to freight forwarders.

Alina Fetisova, from the International Trade Centre, raised an important warning: “40% of young professionals are leaving the industry because of outdated systems.” Attracting and retaining talent, she noted, must be part of any digital strategy.

On the economic front, Maja Marciniak, Senior Economist at IATA, forecast a 6% growth in cargo demand for 2025. While yields remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, she cautioned that the net-zero transition is straining financial performance, and called for greater support from regulators and the value chain.

As the symposium concluded, one thing was clear: air cargo is no longer just about moving goods. It’s about moving faster, smarter, and greener. With global trade dynamics shifting and pressure for transparency growing, the industry is preparing for the future—with innovation at its core.

Looking ahead, IATA announced that WCS 2026 will take place in Lima, Peru, marking the event’s first appearance in South America—a nod to the growing global footprint of air cargo.",https://www.stattimes.com/h-upload/2025/04/17/81119-1500-x-900-39.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 12:57:26.415018

The project could see 10,0000tpa of aviation fuel produced, but Holcim will still need to permanently store any remaining captured CO2 in geological repositories.
It is expected that the first decade of the ECO2Fly project will reduce CO2 emissions by 6.5Mt.
Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene.
Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.","This week the ECO2Fly project offered an insight into how captured CO2 emissions from a cement plant could be reused in the production of synthetic aviation fuel (e-SAF). Holcim's Villaluenga de la Sagra plant is capturing CO2 for this project. Meanwhile, Europe is leading the way in pioneering this type of project with further trials being carried out at the Ruedersdorf and Schwenk plants in Germany as well as methane generation at Finnsementti Oy.

ECO2Fly involves a partnership of Holcim, IGNIS P2X and Exolum. The Villaluenga de la Sagra plant in Toledo, Spain, is aiming to capture 0.7Mta of CO2 and it will combine this with green hydrogen developed from renewable energy, which can then be converted into sustainable aviation fuel. The project could see 10,0000tpa of aviation fuel produced, but Holcim will still need to permanently store any remaining captured CO2 in geological repositories. It is expected that the first decade of the ECO2Fly project will reduce CO2 emissions by 6.5Mt. However, the company is still waiting to submit a request for the European Union Innovation Funding in the next call-out, but global investment firm KKR has injected EUR400m to extend the timeline and scope of ECO2Fly and the green initiatives of Ignis P2X.

Ricardo de Pablos, CEO of Holcim España, said, “This strategic alliance between IGNIS P2X and Exolum represents a decisive step forward as part of our commitment to the transformation and decarbonisation of the industry. Not only are we making progress on reducing the carbon emissions of our own processes, but we are also driving a key innovation for construction in the form of cement with a total carbon reduction.”

Additional carbon utilisation projects with cement industry input

There are further e-SAF projects under development that will involve the cement sector. The European Commission has granted a EUR350m grant to the company, Concrete Chemicals, to produce 30,000t e-SAF annually from 2028. Cemex's Rüdersdorf cement plant will supply the CO2 which will be combined with hydrogen at the Rüdesdorf site to produce e-kerosene. Initially, the project has targeted 100t of captured CO2 to combine with 12t of hydrogen produced at Rüdersdorf. In the second stage, larger quantities of hydrogen will be supplied by pipeline. The green hydrogen production is part of the ENERTRAG-IPCEI 'Electrolysis Corridor East Germany' project, which will have an electrolysis capacity of 210MW and 35,000t of e-Kerosene annually.

Meanwhile, Schwenk Zement, Stuttgart Airport and SkyNRG have teamed up in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, to aid the STRzero climate strategy. Stuttgart Airport is aiming to reach net zero emissions by 2040 and its STRzero plan involves working with Schwenk Zement’s Heidenheim-Mergelstetten plant and SkyNRG to produce 50,000tpa of e-SAF. The three partners are contributing EUR1m to the project which is targeting e-fuel production in 2028.

“For the cement industry, the project is of enormous importance, because the meaningful use of carbon dioxide from the exhaust air of cement plants as a raw material is a major contribution to climate protection,” said Thomas Spannagl, CEO of Schwenk Zement.

A third project is participated in by Finnsementti Oy’s plant in Lappeennranta, Finland. Started in 2019, the collaboration with the Kemira chemical plant in Joutseno aimed to produce 270,000tpa of synthetic methanol. Methanol can be used to create petrol, kerosence or diesel. Again, it is reliant on renewable energy to make electricity, hydrogen as a byproduct from the Kemira chemical plant and captured CO2 from the Lappeennranta cement plant.",https://www.cemnet.com/images/opengraph.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 09:58:37.587413

These elements will support the refinement of the project’s cost estimates and establish clear timelines for implementation. The engineering work will serve as the foundation for final investment decisions and the eventual execution of the facility.

Project Ulysses is designed to produce 102 million litres of sustainable aviation fuel and 11 million litres of renewable diesel each year, with production targeted to begin by 2028. The plant will use bioethanol sourced from Australia as its primary feedstock, transforming it into SAF through a collaborative technological effort between Technip Energies and LanzaJet.

Technip Energies will provide its proprietary Hummingbird® technology, which converts bioethanol into sustainable ethylene. This ethylene is then processed using LanzaJet’s cutting-edge alcohol-to-jet technology to create aviation-grade fuel. The integrated solution not only enhances fuel security for the aviation sector but also significantly reduces emissions—potentially cutting greenhouse gas output by up to 70% compared to conventional jet fuels.

Sylvain Cabalery, Senior Vice President of Sustainable Fuels, Chemicals & Circularity at Technip Energies, expressed his enthusiasm for the project’s progress. “We are excited to support the advancement of Project Ulysses, which will be Australia’s first alcohol-to-jet SAF plant. With the aviation industry worldwide seeking ways to secure fuel supplies while lowering carbon emissions, this project offers a smart, scalable solution. The combination of our Hummingbird® technology and LanzaJet’s process delivers not just energy resilience, but also a substantial environmental benefit.”

As momentum builds for cleaner aviation alternatives, Project Ulysses stands as a flagship effort in demonstrating how innovation and collaboration can shape a more sustainable future for global air travel.

Technip Energies is a leading global player in technology and engineering, recognized for its strong presence in key sectors such as LNG, hydrogen, ethylene, sustainable chemistry, and carbon management. The company plays a vital role in advancing critical markets, including energy, low-carbon energy solutions, decarbonization, and circular economy initiatives.

FincoEnergies joins FuelEU compliance market

London, 16 April (Argus) — Netherlands-based fuel supplier FincoEnergies has launched a pooling service to help shipowners comply with FuelEU Maritime requirements. The service will enable undercompliant ships to meet their FuelEU requirements by pooling them with vessels that run on marine biodiesel supplied by FincoEnergies' own GoodFuels brand. The pooling service is also based on a partnership with maritime classification organisation Lloyd's Register, the company said. FincoEnergies said it will take the role of ""pool organiser"". The FuelEU Maritime regulation, which came into effect this year, sets greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets of 2pc for vessels travelling in or out of Europe. The reduction jumps to 6pc from 2030 and gradually reaches 80pc by 2050. The pooling mechanism built into FuelEU Maritime allows shipowners to combine vessels to achieve overall compliance across the pool, enabling a system by which compliance can be traded. Argus assessed the values of FuelEU Ucome-MGO abatement and Ucome-VLSFO abatement, prices which can be used as a metric to value compliance, at an average of $302.56/t of CO2 equivalent (CO2e) and $337.46/tCO2e, respectively, so far this year.

Funding cuts could delay US river lock work: Correction

Corrects lock locations in paragraph 5. Houston, 14 April (Argus) — The US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) will have to choose between various lock reconstruction and waterway projects for its annual construction plan after its funding was cut earlier this year. Last year Congress allowed the Corps to use $800mn from unspent infrastructure funds for other waterways projects. But when Congress passed a continuing resolutions for this year's budget they effectively removed that $800mn from what was a $2.6bn annual budget for lock reconstruction and waterways projects. This means a construction plan that must be sent to Congress by 14 May can only include $1.8bn in spending. No specific projects were allocated funding by Congress, allowing the Corps the final say on what projects it pursues under the new budget. River industry trade group Waterways Council said its top priority is for the Corps to provide a combined $205mn for work at the Montgomery lock in Pennsylvania on the Ohio River and Chickamauga lock in Tennessee on the Tennessee River since they are the nearest to completion and could become more expensive if further delayed. There are seven active navigation construction projects expected to take precedent, including the following: the Chickamauga and Kentucky Locks on the Tennessee River; Locks 2-4 on the Monongahela River; the Three Rivers project on the Arkansas River; the LaGrange Lock on the Illinois River; Lock 25 on the Mississippi River; and the Montgomery Lock on the Ohio River. There are three other locks in Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois that are in the active design phase (see map) .

IMO GHG pricing not yet Paris deal-aligned: EU

Brussels, 14 April (Argus) — The International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) global greenhouse gas (GHG) pricing mechanism ""does not yet ensure the sector's full contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals"", the European Commission has said. ""Does it have everything for everybody? For sure, it doesn't,"" said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, the commission's climate and energy spokesperson said. ""This is often the case as an outcome from international negotiations, that not everybody gets the most optimal outcome."" The IMO agreement reached last week will need to be confirmed by the organisation in October, the EU noted, even if it is a ""strong foundation"" and ""meaningful step"" towards net zero GHG emissions in global shipping by 2050. The commission will have 18 months following the IMO mechanism's formal approval to review the directive governing the bloc's emissions trading system (ETS), which currently includes maritime emissions for intra-EU voyages and those entering or leaving the bloc. By EU law, the commission will also have to report on possible ""articulation or alignment"" of the bloc's FuelEU Maritime regulation with the IMO, including the need to ""avoid duplicating regulation of GHG emissions from maritime transport"" at EU and international levels. That report should be presented, ""without delay"", following formal adoption of an IMO global GHG fuel standard or global GHG intensity limit. Finland's head representative at the IMO delegation talks, Anita Irmeli, told Argus that the EU's consideration of whether the approved Marpol amendments are ambitious enough won't be until ""well after October"". Commenting on the IMO agreement, the European Biodiesel Board (EBB) pointed to the ""neutral"" approach to feedstocks, including first generation biofuels. ""The EBB welcomes this agreement, where all feedstocks and pathways have a role to play,"" EBB secretary general Xavier Noyon said. Faig Abbasov, shipping director at non-governmental organisation Transport and Environment, called for better incentives for green hydrogen. ""The IMO deal creates a momentum for alternative marine fuels. But unfortunately it is the forest-destroying first generation biofuels that will get the biggest push for the next decade,"" he said.

Malaysian Fathopes to reach SAF plant FID by 1Q 2026

Singapore, 14 April (Argus) — Malaysian biofuel feedstock supplier Fathopes Energy's planned sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) plant will reach a final investment decision (FID) in the first quarter of 2026, it said. Intital engineering design will be done from July to December 2025, Fathopes' director Eddy Leong said at an event on 10 April, speaking on behalf of the company's chief executive Vinesh Sinha. The plant's capacity is unconfirmed. Fathopes signed an initial agreement at the event with testing, inspection and certification company AmSpec Group. They aim to identify, assess and document feedstocks across Asia-Pacific, Australia and New Zealand that can be used at the planned plant. The agreement will take effect from 1 June. Besides used cooking oil (UCO), other waste feedstocks such as palm oil mill effluent (Pome) oil and spent bleaching earth oil (SBEO) will be explored. Fathopes will take the lead in collecting feedstock samples, while AmSpec will analyse their suitability for SAF production. Amspec will help develop an on-site SAF laboratory at the plant to ensure compliance with industry standards and environmental regulations. Fathopes had signed an initial agreement with Danish technology firm Topsoe in February, in which Topsoe agreed to provide catalysts and engineering expertise to assess feasibility of building the refinery.

Earth Day 2025 serves as a global call to action, highlighting the urgent need to transition towards renewable energy solutions. The theme, “Our Power, Our Planet,” reinforces the connection between clean energy and a sustainable future, urging industries worldwide to accelerate their decarbonisation efforts.

Aviation and corporate travel remain essential for global business and connectivity, yet they contribute significantly to carbon emissions. While reducing travel altogether would be the most sustainable option, for many businesses and industries, flying remains a necessity. This is particularly true for sectors like marine, energy, and sports, where travel is critical to operations.

To address this challenge, the aviation industry must look beyond carbon measurement tools—which report on emissions but do not mitigate them—and focus on practical solutions for emissions reduction, such as Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). SAF represents a key pathway to reducing the carbon footprint of air travel while ensuring essential mobility continues.

Why Aviation Needs Alternative Energy Solutions

Aviation accounts for 2-3% of global CO₂ emissions, making it a priority sector for decarbonisation. While emerging technologies such as hydrogen and electric aircraft hold long-term promise, SAF is the most viable and scalable solution available today to reduce aviation emissions.

SAF is produced from 100% renewable waste and residue raw materials, such as used cooking oil and animal fat waste, and can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 80% over its lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel. Crucially, SAF is a drop-in fuel, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft without requiring infrastructure modifications.

Despite its benefits, widespread adoption of SAF faces challenges related to availability, production scaling, and cost. Greater industry commitment and corporate action are essential to drive demand and investment in SAF production, just as policy support.

The Role of SAF in Sustainable Corporate Travel

For businesses committed to reducing Scope 3 emissions—which include travel-related emissions—SAF presents an immediate opportunity to make meaningful reductions. Corporate travel policies can integrate SAF procurement alongside other sustainability initiatives, such as optimising travel schedules, reducing unnecessary trips and investing in verified offset programmes.

Neste is the world’s leading producer of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and has partnered with ATPI to help businesses reduce their travel-related emissions. Neste MY Sustainable Aviation Fuel is in commercial use today and available at a growing number of key airports worldwide, and can also be accessed via the ATPI x Neste partnership.

Key benefits of SAF:

Immediate carbon reductions – Up to 80% lower GHG emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle compared to fossil jet fuel.

Ready to be used – SAF can be used in existing aircraft and refuelling systems.

Scalable for corporate travel – Businesses can incorporate SAF procurement into travel policies.

Driving Corporate Action: Business Travel & SAF

While airlines and governments play a role in scaling SAF, corporate buyers also have the power to accelerate adoption by integrating SAF into their travel programmes. ATPI and Neste provide solutions such as Neste Impact, a book-and-claim system aligned with Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) standards. This allows businesses to purchase SAF and claim emissions reductions even if the fuel is not available at their departure airports.

How Businesses Can Take Action Today:

Set concrete emissions reduction targets to track and reduce the impact of business travel.

Incorporate SAF into travel programmes to enable immediate, credible emissions reductions.

Use carbon measurement tools to monitor travel activity and inform sustainability decisions.

ATPI x Neste: A Shared Commitment to Decarbonisation

Through their partnership, ATPI and Neste are working to empower businesses to make low-carbon travel choices and support the shift towards renewable energy in aviation.

UK LCC easyJet Director General Javier Gándara, TUI director of communications for airlines, hotels and cruises, Aage Dünhaupt, and Aena head of environmental sustainability, Susana Gallart Peñas, discussed aviation sustainability last week during a conference panel at Routes Europe 2025 in Seville.

All were asked how confident they were in the air transport industry being able to achieve the self-imposed net zero goal after IATA Director General Willie Walsh acknowledged earlier this year that the 2050 target may slip because of government policies and the lack of SAF.

But the panelists remained optimistic.

“I think it will still be possible. Thirty years ago, people were saying flying would not be affordable and now it is. We have a clear roadmap,” easyJet’s Gándara said. “SAF is something that will be important in the short, medium and long term. At easyJet, we are working with Airbus on developing a hydrogen-powered, zero-emissions aircraft. The problem is with regulators. They have to have political courage. They have to work to get SAF production scaled up and to address issues like action on the [European Union air traffic management modernization] Single European Sky.”

Aena’s Gallart Peñas, whose company manages 46 airports and two heliports in Spain and participates directly and indirectly in the management of some 16 airports in Europe and the U.S., agreed—but she also stressed the time to move the dial on aviation sustainability is running short.

“2050 must be possible, but the next five years will be critical for us,” she said. “I think we have just five years to change things.”

TUI’s Dünhaupt added: “You have to be ambitious, and when you have targets, they should be ambitious. But we don’t want to change the behavior of flying. We need politicians’ support for things to happen, and SAF is a big part of the solution. But we also need to do some honest stock-taking, and if there’s not enough SAF, we need to move the [net zero] target to the right.”

Dünhaupt also said that North American sustainability policy would be different under U.S. President Donald Trump and that it is important that competitive playing fields remain level across the air transport industry, which is global, as sustainability rules and mandates come into effect.

Gándara agreed. “The biggest challenge is that sustainability doesn’t affect air travel affordability,” he said. Gándara also emphasized that European regulators are missing “a huge opportunity for Europe to become energy self-sufficient” if they do not take action on scaling up SAF production.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-04-17 06:56:07.952261

Where SAF Stands SAF has emerged as the only viable short-term lever for reducing aviation emissions.
“If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express.
According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%.
For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.","India, now the world’s third-largest aviation market, is responsible for 2.5% of global emissions but contributes just about 1% of national carbon emissions—below the global average. Yet, this relatively benign share masks a fast-growing challenge. With air travel demand projected to grow exponentially, emissions are set to rise in tandem.

Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of SpiceJet, put it bluntly at a panel discussion hosted by MakeMyTrip Foundation's India Travel and Tourism Sustainability Conclave 2025: “Sustainability clearly was not on [the airlines’] minds” during the COVID-19 pandemic, when survival was paramount. But as recovery takes hold, Singh adds, “Sustainability will again be front and centre... but it has to make economic sense.” The cost of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is 2.5 times the cost of conventional fuel, is simply unaffordable for most carriers. “You can’t pass that on to consumers... they will not pay that kind of money,” says Singh.

Experts at the panel also feared that with the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) set to become mandatory in 2027, airlines will face additional cost burdens if SAF production doesn’t ramp up. Yet, there is no mature carbon offset market in India today. “We’re doing nothing,” Aditya Ghosh, co-founder of Akasa Air admitted candidly while other panellists agreed. “And we’re just two years away from CORSIA kicking in.”

CORSIA is a global initiative led by the UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Starting in 2027, it enters a mandatory phase for most major aviation nations. Under the scheme, airlines will need to offset any carbon emissions that go beyond their 2020 levels by buying approved carbon credits.

“CORSIA has set impossible targets. It tries to limit countries to the emission levels of the number of aircraft that they had in 2020. That has to be opposed,” said Singh.

“The 2027 CORSIA targets are unrealistic and unfair for countries like India. We will continue to work with ICAO and see that these norms are not unfair to developing countries and not biased towards developed countries,” he added.

In tune, Aloke Singh, managing director of Air India Express, said that CORSIA will pose a significant burden on airlines. “If the SAF production gets further delayed, the burdens of carbon offset, due to CORSIA, will rise further.”

CAPA’s CEO Kapil Kaul, who moderated the session, opined that given that none of the Indian carriers are ready to meet the targets set under CORSIA, it’s possible the target could be deferred.

Where SAF Stands

SAF has emerged as the only viable short-term lever for reducing aviation emissions. The good news is that India has shown technical capability. SpiceJet, for instance, flew India’s first SAF-powered flight in 2018—from Dehradun to Delhi—using fuel made in a laboratory at the Indian Institute of Petroleum. “The engines don’t need to be modified. It works just really well,” Singh emphasised.

Trending Stories

But the barriers to commercial scaling are immense. Current SAF production is just 0.53% of total fuel consumption globally, and even in Europe—the leader in SAF adoption—KLM and Air France clock just 0.84% and 0.42% respectively. According to CAPA India’s internal assessment, the world is more than 5 million tonnes short annually of the SAF needed to hit 2030 targets.

Ghosh argued that India actually has a unique opportunity: “India now has about 160 million tonnes of feedstock... which can be used for SAF production. Ironically, we have a chance to become a net SAF exporter.” But for that to happen, “you have to identify the feedstock, build manufacturing, logistics and treat this as an export-focused sector.”

The challenge, then, is not technical feasibility but economic and logistical scale. Singh noted that the cost of building even one SAF unit—like the pilot project at Panipat with IOCL—was just ₹150 crore. “These are not large sums of money,” he said, “but the political will is missing.” According to Ghosh, government support in the form of viability gap funding could kickstart production, just as it did for electric bus infrastructure in India.

Targets and the Reality Check

India’s SAF blending target—1% by 2025, increasing to 2% by 2027 and 5% by 2030—is far too modest, the panellists unanimously agreed. “If airlines are committing to net-zero by 2050, policymakers have to take sharper targets,” said Singh of Air India Express. He added, “The sum of money required isn’t humongous. Just let them blend more.”

Yet, scaling SAF isn't only about blending targets. There's also a technological bottleneck. Of the 13 ASTM-approved pathways for SAF production, only a few have been commercialised. “80% of SAF facilities globally are using hydrotreatment technology,” pointed out Kaul. “Other technologies are not getting clearances or are still in the research phase.”

Economics Over Environment

One of the core dilemmas underscored was that while sustainability measures tend to align with cost savings in areas like engine efficiency and operational performance, they become a burden when it comes to SAF.

“There’s no free lunch,” said Singh of Air India Express. “If we don’t pay as industry, the taxpayer will pay. If the consumer doesn’t pay, someone has to pay.” Today, sustainable alternatives drive up costs rather than bringing them down, which reverses the economics that previously spurred efficiency in aviation.

The industry is currently relying on gradual efficiency gains—about 2 to 2.5% annually over the last few decades—through better engines, newer aircraft, and improved operational techniques. “Per passenger emissions have halved since I joined the industry,” shared Singh, “and that was when sustainability wasn’t even a buzzword—it was driven purely by economics.”

Small Gains Matter, But Are They Enough?

Several small but significant practices—like continuous descent operations, better climb optimisation (OptiClimb), single-engine taxiing, and cleaner aircraft surfaces—offer immediate gains. According to Air India Express’ internal estimates, about 30 such initiatives can improve efficiency by 4-5%. But implementation remains erratic.

“There’s been talk of continuous descent and shorter air routes for years,” Kaul pointed out. “Yet Delhi-Bombay block time is now 2 hours 10 minutes, and congestion is only increasing.” The larger question, he added, is “Who takes leadership and who takes ownership?”

The answer, the panel seemed to agree, lies at the highest levels of government. “Flexible use of airspace is possible. Better routing is possible. But unless the top political leadership is sensitised, it won’t happen,” Singh asserted.

Even if airlines adopt best practices and strive for fleet modernisation, without meaningful SAF production or an offset market, the industry will struggle to comply with global frameworks.

What the Future Looks Like

Despite the odds, there are reasons for cautious optimism. Indian carriers are already investing heavily in next-gen aircraft. “In five years, we will be flying the youngest fleet in the sky,” Ghosh said. “Which basically means, by math, we will be emitting the least.”

Air India Express, for example, moved from just 10% of its fleet being new-gen aircraft to 50% in a year. “By next year, two-thirds will be new-gen,” confirmed Singh. But he also noted that sustainability should not be limited to fuel and emissions—it must encompass water, circular economy practices, and broader social impact.

The panel agreed that while the airline industry can and should do more, it cannot go it alone. As Singh summarised, “You cannot expect airlines to bear an additional 15-20% cost to make this happen. For petroleum companies, it’s marginal. For us, it’s existential.” To meet net-zero targets, experts feel India needs to treat aviation sustainability as a national priority, not just an airline issue.",https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india%2F2025-04-17%2F980cxqer%2F1000279020.jpg?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-04-17 04:56:06.801673

That is according to a report from South Pole, which surveyed 350 institutions worldwide.

The report from the climate-focused consultancy firm found a clear trend among financial institutions to continue fossil fuel investments despite the general understanding that they will eventually be compelled to fully divest. Paradoxically, this trend persists even as these financial companies pursue net-zero goals.

In fact, around half (52%) of respondents see themselves as on track to meet their climate goals, while a much larger 86% said they are either on track or at least ‘partially on track’. Organizations in the Americas were generally the most on track with climate goals – more than those in Europe or Asia Pacific.

“The survey results demonstrate that financial institutions continue to back investments in green infrastructure and are willing to increase their exposure to climate-resilient assets and portfolio companies,” said Daniel Klier, CEO of South Pole.

“However, it is also clear that the sector is no longer taking an active role in shifting the balance and will continue to finance fossil fuels. Financial institutions want to have their cake and eat it too.”

Source: South Pole

When asked what they feel is holding financial institutions back, more than half (55%) pointed to a lack of clear industry-specific guidelines and 47% cited a lack of progress from organizations they provide financing to. Another 42% cited a lack of support from government policy.

Climate transition plans

Another important part of making progress on net-zero goals is having a climate transition plan. Exactly half of the financial institutions surveyed reported having an ‘extensive and credible’ climate transition plan in place already. The vast majority of respondents (88%) said they currently have at least some form of plan in place.

The report found that larger institutions have made more significant strides in their climate transition plans when compared with their smaller counterparts. That may come as no surprise, considering that the smaller organizations are far less likely to have extensive funding available for climate initiatives.

Financial institutions in major hubs like the UK, Singapore, and the US overwhelmingly favor investing in companies with climate transition plans, finding them more attractive. This preference stems from financial organizations seeking climate-prepared entities with ambitious net-zero goals, as many struggle to meet their own climate targets due to insufficient progress from their financed companies.

Carbon credits

Many financial institutions also have carbon credit strategies in place. Carbon credits serve two main purposes: To go beyond the immediate value chain in mitigating climate change and to neutralize remaining emissions on an institution’s path to achieving net zero.

Many investors see carbon markets and projects as a potential new asset class, recognizing the increasing demand for high-quality carbon removal credits. This has been driving investment in this sector.

Financial institutions have also been pushing their portfolio companies towards using carbon credits in their net-zero strategies. The growing significance of compliance carbon markets is expected to further increase demand and prices, presenting a notable opportunity for the financial sector.

Delaying climate action means more risk

Put simply, financial institutions are increasingly looking to reduce their exposure to risk, which is seen as a crucial part of future-proofing a business. Organizations that have ESG initiatives in place are seen as far less exposed to climate-related risks, which have clearly been on the rise in recent years around the world.

“While the financiers surveyed continue to drive climate-related engagement with their clients, it also becomes clear that financial institutions have to walk a tightrope, balancing the long-term resilience and efficiency of their business against returns for investors in the short term,” said Klier.

“It is important to embrace the positive tipping points created by new, cleaner, and more competitive technologies; but the sector is running major transition and physical risks when it delays its response to obvious climate tipping points.”",https://www.consultancy.eu/illustrations/news/spotlight/2025-04-16-024336793-Most_financial_institutions_still_see_fossil_fuels_as_a_key_part_of_the_investment_mix_spot.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 07:56:25.189570

SAF that decreases GHG emissions by 50% is eligible for the $1.25 credit per gallon amount and SAF that decreases GHG emissions by more than 50% is eligible for an additional $0.01 per gallon for each percentage point the reduction exceeds 50%, up to $0.50 per gallon.

Numerous fuels will qualify for the credit, including valid biomass-based diesel, advanced biofuels, cellulosic biofuel, or cellulosic diesel that has been approved by the EPA under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).

Fuels that achieve a 50% or greater reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions under the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) standard will continue to qualify under today’s guidance.",https://www.smartenergydecisions.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ss_green_airplane.jpg,N,,2025-04-17 05:56:17.623008

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world’s largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy’s novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy’s novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy’s revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

“Syzygy’s groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy’s first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.”– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Syzygy will continuously enhance performance and test various feedstocks to support further project development opportunities, customer testing and validation of the GHG e-Reforming ™ unit capabilities.

Gevo Inc. and Future Energy Global are pleased to announce that they have signed a pioneering offtake agreement for carbon abatement attributes, to enable airlines and other companies to reduce their CO2 emissions through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Under the multi-year agreement, FEG will acquire from Gevo the Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions credits from 10 million gallons per year of fuel to be produced at Gevo’s alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) SAF production facility, Gevo ATJ-60, to meet demand from FEG customers, both airlines and corporates, seeking to decarbonize their operations. The agreement also includes an option for FEG to increase the off-take at a later date.

This agreement is expected to help enable Gevo’s financing of the construction of its ATJ-60 facility. Gevo has secured a loan guarantee conditional commitment of $1.63 billion (including capitalized interest during construction) from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO) and is originating equity from project level capital providers. Under development in Lake Preston, South Dakota, ATJ-60 is designed to address the market need for cost-effective jet fuel while abating carbon and to respond to growing worldwide demand for SAF. Gevo's proprietary plant design is expected to be able to produce 60 million gallons of SAF per year at similar production costs to conventional jet fuel, but with far lower carbon emissions.

The aviation industry has targeted net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, and SAF is expected to contribute around two thirds of the necessary emissions reduction, but to achieve this, its production quantities need to scale more than 400-fold. SAF is not yet available at all major airports worldwide so FEG provides SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines who wish to buy additional SAF but who cannot easily source the physical fuel at their own airports. Similarly, when companies purchase and retire SAF-derived Scope 3 credits to compensate for their business travel emissions, they mitigate the added cost of SAF to airlines and thus enable the faster scale-up of SAF production.

The Greenhouse Gas Protocol defines different “scopes” of responsibility for emissions. The emissions from a flight fall under an airline’s direct responsibility (i.e., Scope 1), but a company with staff flying for business on that flight is responsible for its staff’s share of the flight’s emissions (i.e., Scope 3 or indirect emissions). Separating the Scope 1 and Scope 3 attributes from the physical fuel, an approach known as “Book and Claim,” reduces fuel transportation and storage costs and carbon emissions, and unlocks a global SAF market both for airlines and for indirect aviation fuel customers around the world who are seeking to mitigate their emissions.

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster,” says Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo. “Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors and our corporate customers,” says Natasha Mann, CEO and co-founder of FEG. “It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

FEG’s unique business model brings together investors, suppliers, and buyers to help accelerate and scale SAF production globally. FEG generates additional revenue streams by commercializing the carbon credits which SAF provides, enhancing the business case for faster production scale-up. FEG’s offtake agreement with Gevo is expected to fulfill a market need by giving buyers access to SAF credits at predictable prices, while providing financial commitments and revenue certainty that are expected to allow suppliers like Gevo to expand. FEG’s initial focus has been on aviation, though its sustainable-fuel credit solutions span the transport spectrum, including marine and land transport.

Attendees and presenters also engaged in guided discussions on key topics, such as Indirect Land-Use Change (ILUC), Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA) practices and the differences between the GREET and CORSIA models.

Attendance offered insights and engagement in discussions on issues directly impacting Illinois farmers and biodiesel producers. Arnold offered a health-focused perspective on the production and consumption of biomass-based diesel fuels—a viewpoint not often presented by other voluntary public health organizations or NGOs. He also participated in an invite-only debriefing session with members of the Environmental Science Working Group (ESWG), representing a diverse set of experts from across the industry, including producers, end-users, scientists, and more. The efforts of the ESWG play a crucial role in guiding Clean Fuels Alliance America as the industry continues to assess the environmental footprint of these fuels, helping to inform policy and ensure a place for locally grown fuels for years to come.",https://www.ilsoy.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Bean-There-1.png,N,,2025-04-16 20:56:41.169890

“The next phase of our Cornell Engineering 2030 plan calls for strategic investments in people, programs and infrastructure that position the college for meaningful societal impact in priority research areas,” said Lynden Archer, the Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering.
He hopes to prepare students for the evolving energy landscape by introducing new courses on energy policy and regulations, and by building new design studios for Master of Engineering students working directly with industry partners on research and development challenges.

So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.” John Carberry is a freelance writer for Cornell Engineering.","With a dedication to transforming scientific discovery into real-world impact, Tobias Hanrath, a Cornell Engineering nanomaterials and energy researcher, has been appointed Croll Professor of Sustainable Energy Systems and lead for the college’s research pillar in Engineering Energy Transitions.

As the designated point person for one of the college’s strategic research priorities, Hanrath will provide strategic advice about new research initiatives, facilitate collaborations with the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability and others, and shape academic programs that equip students and faculty to advance the future of clean energy technologies.

“The next phase of our Cornell Engineering 2030 plan calls for strategic investments in people, programs and infrastructure that position the college for meaningful societal impact in priority research areas,” said Lynden Archer, the Joseph Silbert Dean of Engineering. “I see value in identifying faculty champions who can help focus these investments, inspire students and advise their dean. Piloting this approach with Tobias was a natural decision given his reputation as an innovator and leader in the energy systems area.”

By his own admission, the mission suits Hanrath, who is based in in the R.F. Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and is a longtime fellow in the Atkinson Center.

“One of our unique advantages is that, at a place like Cornell, which is big and has a wide range of fields and disciplines, there are a lot of great minds,” Hanrath said, citing the pioneering research of peers in everything from chemistry, artificial intelligence and energy storage to innovations at the interface of agriculture and engineering. “There are real opportunities at the intersections. My approach is to ask: What are people passionate about on campus? What is the collective skill set that we have?”

An illustrative example of this approach in action is Hanrath’s earlier work co-founding Dimensional Energy, a startup company that emerged from a collaboration between his research lab and that of David Erickson, director of the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. By leveraging breakthroughs in catalysis and materials science, Dimensional Energy is developing technology to transform carbon dioxide emissions into sustainable aviation fuel.

The company’s success reflects Hanrath’s commitment to bridging academic research and commercial viability. In a major step toward industry adoption, Dimensional Energy announced in 2022 a partnership with United Airlines in which the aviation company would purchase at least 300 million gallons of fuel and invest into further research and development.

In addition to entrepreneurship, Hanrath also sees opportunity to bridge research and education. He hopes to prepare students for the evolving energy landscape by introducing new courses on energy policy and regulations, and by building new design studios for Master of Engineering students working directly with industry partners on research and development challenges.

Hanrath said he sees his role as facilitating an evolution rather than a revolution. Helping Cornell Engineering leap forward in energy transitions is not about changing what students and faculty are doing around energy and sustainability, he stressed, but instead taking a “systems-level approach” to increasing awareness of academic and research efforts across campus, and finding mechanisms to translate that work into close partnerships with other institutions and energy industry leaders.

This systems-level approach is exemplified by the establishment of the Cornell Advanced Platform for Testing, Utilization, and Research in CO2 Capture and Conversion Technologies, also known as the CAPTURE-Lab, in which nine faculty members from across campus will establish an experimental facility at Cornell’s Combined Heat and Power Plant.

The project is led by Hanrath; Phillip Milner, assistant professor of chemistry and chemical biology in the College of Arts and Sciences; and Greeshma Gadikota, associate professor in the School of Civil and Environmental Engineering. The team plans to establish a mobile lab adjacent to the plant that will analyze gas emissions and provide real-time information about its composition. They will then examine and test materials for carbon capture and conversion, supporting interdisciplinary research on both basic science and lab-to-market feasibility.

By finding the paths and the collaborations that promise the greatest real-world success, Hanrath hopes to build at Cornell Engineering a “center of gravity” in which talent and partners from across campus – and around the world – will organically convene.

Creating that center of gravity requires internal and external awareness, and Hanrath said he plans to invest a significant portion of his new position into communicating broadly about Cornell Engineering’s energy research and its impact.

“Part of what we need to establish here is, if you want to have impactful work in energy and translate ideas into impacts, Cornell should be on your radar,” Hanrath said. “In the future, we all want to have a world that is better than what it is now. So that's a perspective, irrespective of what your favorite technology is, where there's a common point.”

The industry has tough net zero emissions-related SAF adoption targets to meet and working collaboratively on fuel procurement and investment is crucial to increase SAF usage, agreed a sustainability panel duringt IATA's 2025 World Cargo Symposium (WCS).

Helene Goury, sustainability manager at Air France KLM Martinair Cargo said that AFKLM aims to reach 10% of SAF in its fuel usage by 2030.

The business currently has around 1.5% SAF fuel usage, which is three times the industry average.

Partnerships aided this SAF adoption and other sustainability initiatives within the airline, said Goury. In fact, the group has major partnerships with DG Fuels, Neste and TotalEnergies.

“It’s collaboration. Air France KLM has looked into investments since 2023. For example, we invested $4.7bn into DG Fuels (into its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production plant in the US).”

She added: “We also did a partnership with Neste to try 100% of SAF into (aircraft) engines. That was successfully demonstrating the positive use of SAF.

“More recently we collaborated with TotalEnergies, which will supply up to 1.5m tons of SAF over a 10-year period.”

Additionally, she added that Air France KLM was working with partners to invest in an e-SAF plant.

Finnair Cargo has also been partnering with Neste since 2020 and Janike Heimonen, sales and sustainability manager at Finnair Cargo simply stressed: “Partnerships are important for SAF.”

She said that collaboration is also important in ascertaining cutomers’ awareness of SAF and its value to them and further, how to support them in uptake of the fuel.

“It’s all about the collaboration between the whole value chain,” she said.

From the perspective of a customer, Kintesu World Express is focused on robust relationships with airlines, credibility and transparency of SAF, price and information sharing.

In alignment with this, shippers are more interested in SAF, declared Frederik van de Ven, director of sustainability (EMEA) and lead supply chain sustainability (Global) at Kintesu.

“Shippers are more committed to SAF you see that SAF price per kilo is being asked about in RFQs,"" he commented.

This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.

In addition, another alternative fuel that also promises to grow U.S.-grown crop demand as a feedstock source is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

By its basic definition, SAF is a biofuel used to power aircraft. It is made from non-petroleum feedstocks (derived from such crops as corn and soybeans) and is a “drop-in” fuel. This means SAF can be blended with regular jet fuel without requiring modifications to aircraft or infrastructure.

According to Michael Reginelli, Risk Management Consultant at Advance Trading, Inc., SAF could be “a very big deal” when it comes to ethanol demand.

“The aviation industry is definitely looking at this,” said Reginelli, speaking at the 2025 Ohio Agribusiness Association annual meeting in late January. “As environmental regulations change – not only in the U.S. but in other countries as well – aviation companies are going to increasingly look for alternatives.”

And given the facts, it’s easy to understand why SAF is an attractive alternative to traditional aviation fuel. According to the data, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared to fossil-based jet fuel. As Reginelli summed up: “The carbon reduction with SAF is massive.”

Right now, reported Reginelli, the U.S. has a mandate in place to have the country’s aviation industry reduce its carbon emissions by 20% by the end of this decade. Some individual airline companies have set their own emission reduction numbers as well.

“Southwest Airlines wants to be a net carbon zero company by 2030,” he said.

HOUSTON, April 16, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Syzygy Plasmonics has successfully completed performance testing of the world's largest all-electric GHG e-Reforming™ demonstration unit in Houston. After over 3000 hours of rigorous trials in Houston and Ulsan, South Korea with its cutting-edge Rigel™ Reactor, the unit demonstrates a critical breakthrough in low-cost, high-yield sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production.

Current approaches to SAF require expensive credits or a high price to cover production costs. Syzygy's novel approach uses inexpensive biogas that would otherwise be flared or sold at commodity prices into reasonably priced SAF. This monetizes stranded, valuable feedstock assets, fulfilling critical demand for low carbon aviation fuels. Biogas projects require expensive technologies to produce renewable natural gas (RNG) via CO2 separation. Syzygy's novel approach uses biogas directly from an anaerobic digester or landfills with minimal preparation to produce syngas for SAF or other industry standard renewable transportation fuels.

Syzygy's revolutionary biogas-to-SAF method is unlocking new possibilities. Its modular design monetizes valuable biogas sources from dairy farms, landfills, and wastewater sites into valuable biogas sources, without the need for pipelines or costly infrastructure.

""Syzygy's groundbreaking biogas-to-SAF technology is reshaping sustainable aviation fuel production. This demonstration plant achieves Syzygy's first major step in our mission to expand SAF production and transform energy. We will build on this milestone by continuing to enhance performance in Houston while developing biogas to SAF projects built around our technology globally.""– Trevor Best, CEO of Syzygy Plasmonics.

Syzygy will continuously enhance performance and test various feedstocks to support further project development opportunities, customer testing and validation of the GHG e-Reforming ™ unit capabilities.

Latest insights and contractors at Project Ulysses

Currently, Project Ulysses has completed feasibility studies, and has also secured a good line-up of financiers. It is now in the FEED study phase. This is overseen by global fuels technology player, Lazajet, and construction contractor, Technip, after the latest press release on Project Ulysses. Technip and Lanzajet join LERA who serves as a project manager, as contractors for Project Ulysses.

Named after North Queensland butterfly, Papilio ulysses, the project in Australia’s Townsville State Development Area seeks to produce renewable diesel and SAF from bioethanol. The two renewable fuels to be pumped into the aviation market are sourced from agricultural by-products. Set to deliver 11 million liters of renewable diesel and 102 million liters of SAF annually, Project Ulysses will utilize Lanzajet’s Alcohol-to-Jet (AtJ) technology.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses targets completion and commissioning by 2028. This will set precedence for the achievement of sustainability goals. At its core is the reduction of jet aircraft CO2 emissions. This is an estimated reduction of around 65% when compared to traditional fossil fuel, like jet kerosene, used in the aviation industry.

Janelle Poole MP, an Assistant Minister in Queensland termed Project Ulysses as a means for the exploration of “new industries across Queensland, particularly focusing on economic growth in the regions.”

Sustainability at Forefront of Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses

According to the International Energy Association (IEA), aviation accounts for up to 2.5% of global CO2 emissions. The number stood at 940.6 metric tons (Mt) of CO2 as of 2023. According to IEA, this number will surpass 1000 Mt of CO2 by 2030 if the aviation industry lags in change. This also sets the aviation industry’s emission growth rate in the two previous decade, higher than other means of transport like road and rail.

To achieve the global, and International Civil Aviation Organization’s, Net Zero by 2050 goal, several mechanisms have been put in place in the aviation sector. These include use of low carbon fuel like SAF and renewable diesel from bioethanol from Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses. These are also coupled by engineering and design changes to aircraft, like improving airframe and engine designs. Also proposed are technologies like electric or hydrogen-powered aircraft in place of kerosene-powered aircraft.

Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses and the local economy’s long-term outlook

Also in Project Ulysses’ long term development goals is the expansion Townsville economy. Jet Zero’s SAF and renewable diesel project in Townsville will create more than 100 operational jobs at the facility once its commissioned. This will also be superposed by the 1,000 construction jobs to be delivered once Project Ulysses starts construction. The project will also supply renewable diesel to the local Australian energy market, ramping up renewable energy use in sectors like mining, transport, and tourism.

In the rather, grand scheme of things, Project Ulysses also aims to make Townsville in Australia’s Northern Queensland a renewable energy hub. Also in Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses mission is to make Queensland a global leader in the low-emissions biofuels industry.

Other SAF project in Australia include Project Mandala. A partnership project steered by Jet Zero and Apeiron Bioenergy.

Chuah et al. report that solid sorbents, particularly amine-appended adsorbents, are crucial for Direct Air Capture (DAC) due to their strong affinity for CO2 at low partial pressures, showing the potential of solid sorbents in advancing DAC technology and contributing to reaching net-zero CO2 emissions. (1) The review by Low et al. highlights recent advancements in electrochemical CO2 capture technologies, focusing on membrane-based reactors. The Review suggests areas for improvement and future research directions to enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of these technologies for practical applications. (2) Another contribution on the topic of carbon capture from Yi et al. reports on the potential of chemical looping combustion for CO2 capture and utilization. The work provides theoretical insights into the feasibility of integrating CO2 capture and utilization within industrial processes. (3)

The work of Zhang et al. investigates the impact of different traceability methods (chain of custody models) on decision-making in expanding low-carbon ammonia supply chains. The study sets the stage for future research on the broader application of such models in sustainable supply chains. (4) Fu et al. report on the use of plasma technology to enhance propane dehydrogenation (PDH), a process limited by thermodynamics. Their findings aim to guide the design of efficient plasma-assisted PDH systems for sustainable catalysis. (5)

Direct applications to fuels are also reported. The study of Dowling et al. concludes that bio jet fuel from sugar cane, using alcohol-to-jet technologies, is a viable option to reduce aviation greenhouse gas emissions. Understanding the optimal operation of integrated sugar cane mills helps in developing effective bio jet fuel policies and technologies. (6) Zhang et al. review the development of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) through the CO2AF process, which converts CO2 into kerosene in a single step. By comparing this approach with other research efforts, the Review aims to bridge the gap between fundamental science and industrial-scale SAF production, and accelerate the development of SAF technologies. (7) Morais et al. conclude that producing jet fuel-range alkanes from lignocellulosic biomass is essential for achieving carbon neutrality in aviation. These results indicate that fine-tuned acidic zeolites are effective for catalyzing HAA reactions to produce jet fuel precursors. (8)

In the materials realm, Zhang et al. investigate the structure–activity relationships of PtFe@S-1&ZSM-5 tandem catalysts in the propane dehydro-aromatization (PDA) reaction. (9) Ramdim et al. quantify the stability and performance of Ag-based gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs) for electrochemical CO2 reduction to CO in alkaline media, focusing on the impact of binding materials. The performance loss is attributed to flooding, bi(carbonate) precipitation, and catalyst agglomeration. These findings enhance the understanding of stability issues in GDE-based CO2 electrolyzers. (10) Meanwhile, the contribution from Sarazen et al. focuses on the chemisorption of adsorbents on silica-supported Pd nanoparticle catalysts during benzyl alcohol oxidation. Their results show that titrant adsorption–desorption dynamics, binding energies, and solvent stabilization significantly influence titration efficiency in the liquid phase. (11) In a Review, Peng et al. discuss advances in enhancing CO2 conversion using copper-based catalysts. The Review emphasizes the importance of mass transfer, electrolyte optimization, and electrode structure modification. (12) Cui et al. introduce ZU-301a, an oxalate-functionalized metal–organic framework, for efficient CO2/CH4 separation. The strong CO2 binding is due to electrostatic interactions, making ZU-301a promising for natural gas and biogas upgrading. (13) The study of Zhou et al. explores plasma-assisted dry reforming (DRM) of methane using a Ti–Ni catalyst to produce syngas, which can significantly reduce carbon emissions. The study attributes the catalyst’s excellent performance to the enhanced capacitance of the discharging area and highlights the potential of Ti–Ni catalysts in industrial plasma-catalyst hybrid DRM systems. (14)

Li et al. have successfully synthesized lightweight, strong nanocellular polymer foams using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and defective UiO-66 nanoparticles. The resulting foams have high cell density and improve thermal insulation, making them suitable for multiple applications. (15) The investigation from Yang et al. reports on the impact of surface properties of cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) on their orientation during the wet-spinning process. It is found that CNF surface properties influence rheological behavior during extrusion, affinity with antisolvents during coagulation, and capillary forces during drying. These factors collectively determine the mechanical properties of CNF-based fibers, providing insights for developing high-performance man-made fibers. (16)

A numerical framework to predict and analyze the flammable range of ammonia and ammonia-hydrogen mixtures is presented by Stagni et al. (17) They find that ammonia-related radiation significantly influences the rich extinction limit, especially at high initial temperatures, and that the upper flammability limit is sensitive to third-body reactions. The results recommend incorporating ammonia collision efficiency into kinetic models to improve the predictive accuracy of numerical tools for safe storage conditions. Another predictive study is reported by Wang et al., (18) who model the heat capacity (Cp) of molecular liquids using machine learning (ML) methodologies.",https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/iecred.2025.64.issue-15/asset/iecred.2025.64.issue-15.cover.social.jpeg_v03,N,,2025-04-16 16:56:29.659830

✈️ SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUELS ARE A GREENWASH SCAM 🌍💸

Now Drax want to pivot to “SAF” – but don’t be fooled. This isn’t about recycled chip fat. It’s about burning 20,000–40,000 acres of trees. Every. Single. Year. 🌳🔥

SAF won’t cut emissions. It won’t solve the climate crisis. It’s a massively subsidised distraction to keep planes in the sky and profits rolling in.

Drax are the UK’s biggest carbon emitter. This is their next scam.
Don’t fall for it.

Currently, projects must have all required planning consents in place before they can bid for a CfD. However, due to considerable lead-in times for obtaining Development Consent Orders, fixed-bottom offshore wind projects have been under-represented in previous allocation rounds. The government believes that removing the requirement to secure planning consent prior to bidding in AR7 will attract more project bidders, who may then be able to deliver more quickly without a gap between obtaining consent and making a CfD application. It is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, and means developers will be ""at risk"" for a shorter period of time, hopefully reducing project costs.

The government does recognise the risk of early-stage projects failing to deliver as a result of being refused planning consent or submitting bids that are proved to be too low. Conversely, they may incorporate a risk premium into their bids in order to combat project cost uncertainty, which will result in increased costs to consumers. However, the government believes such risks do not outweigh the benefits.

The government has asked industry for its opinion on the proposed change, as well as a host of resultant amendments; for example, unconsented projects won't be able to commit to existing time and cost restricted milestones. The government suggests that such milestones be deferred until the developer receives the planning decision. Moreover, while the government believes unconsented projects should still be subject to NDD (the Non-Delivery Disincentive that prevents projects that fail to sign a CfD with LCCC within 10 working days of offer from participating in the next two allocation rounds for which they are eligible), it suggests that NDD may be waived in certain circumstances. If approved, this would greatly accelerate many fixed bottom wind projects, which are key to delivering clean power by 2030.

Publishing a capacity ambition in place of a budget and allowing the Secretary of State greater visibility of auction information

The sixth auction round, in 2024, resulted in unspent budget for fixed-bottom offshore wind. This was due to project owners having to bid in a later round because their bid prices came in over budget. The government looks to amend auction processes in AR7 to create greater certainty of outcome by announcing a capacity ambition rather than budget, with the aim of procuring more fixed-bottom offshore wind projects. The government also plans to publish the budget after the allocation round has run (rather than prior to bidding opening, as is currently the case) in the hopes that this will encourage projects to bid at their minimum viable price.

The government is also considering allowing DESNZ to use anonymised bid information for fixed-bottom offshore wind in making its final budget decision, on the basis that the government has a greater chance of purchasing the correct volume of offshore wind. However, the Consultation does acknowledge the risk of gaming and inflated bids. While the government hopes that this regulatory change will in time apply to all technologies, for AR7 it will apply to fixed-bottom offshore wind only. Commentators have said that this is likely to be to push up prices for offshore wind, as potential auction participants will have visibility of their competitors and be able to identify where the likely breakeven points for projects are. Given that the budget could be unconstrained, this incentivises projects to bid at what they estimate will be the highest price they could reasonably receive.

Increasing contract term for future projects

Contracts with LCCC currently have a 15-year term. However, longer contracts may reduce the exposure of renewable assets to ""price cannibalisation"" (where renewable sources generate an oversupply of electricity, causing a drop in market prices) post-CFD, thereby reducing project risk and cost. Longer contracts would also align with increased lifespans of modern technology. The Consultation, however, does not give any indication of what this increase will look like, as the government intends to first assess how such changes will affect consumer interest. Depending on the outcome of further review, it may be that this amendment will apply only to certain technologies. Increasing the 15 year term is a policy proposed in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan. If the 15-year term is extended, there will likely be advocacy to increase the tenor of other CfD-style support mechanics, e.g. the guaranteed strike price for sustainable aviation fuel currently being designed.

Increase Target Commissioning Window (TCW) for solar projects

Generators have a fixed TCW in which to commission their projects, after which the 15-year payment term begins, regardless of whether the project is live. While most technologies' TCW is 12 months, Solar PV has only three months (given its faster build time). The solar industry has expressed concerns that the TCW does not allow for the increasing size, and associated risk, of solar projects and requested that solar be brought in line with other technologies. The government has proposed increasing the TCW, as mentioned in the Clean Power 2030 Action Plan, but only to six months at this time.

Temporarily restricting the entry of surrendered CfD capacity into AR7

Currently, developers may reduce their contracted capacity prior to commissioning the construction of their power stations (i) by 25% before the Milestone Delivery Date; and/or (ii) by meeting only 85% (for offshore wind) or 95% (for all other technologies) of their Installed Capacity Estimate by the Longstop Date. Under existing rules, developers can then enter any surrendered contracted capacity in future allocation rounds.

However, such opportunity for capacity re-bidding may encourage generators to increase their income under CfD beyond that agreed in their original contract, with consumers ultimately bearing the additional cost. The government therefore proposes to prevent generators from bidding for previously reduced capacity in AR7, while the government reviews and clarifies its policy in time for AR8. Participants in AR7 will therefore have to confirm that their applications do not include any capacity that was previously subject to a CfD awarded in ARs 1-6.

Allowing repowered onshore wind projects to participate in AR7

The government's October 2024 response to a previous consultation confirmed that repowered wind projects (i.e. old wind farms that have their old turbines replaced with new) would be able to participate in AR7. The Consultation looks to set out eligibility criteria for such projects: for example, developers must demonstrate that the project commenced commercial operations at least 25 years before the Target Commissioning Date set out in their CfD application (thereby evidencing that the project has reached end-of-life). Developers must confirm they will not use any pre-existing assets other than refurbished foundations and show separation between existing and repowered facilities. This ensures that the projects are genuinely being repowered, rather than simply undergoing a life-extension. The key will be designing a process where repowered and new projects compete on an even playing field, so that repowered projects with potentially lower costs for some items do not crowd out new projects. If there are material differences (which may depend on the technology type), one way to solve this will be to have a separate pot for repowered projects.

Allowing floating offshore wind projects (FLOW) participating in AR7 to build in phases

Currently, only fixed offshore wind CfD participants are allowed to build in several stages, with FLOW historically being deemed too small to justify inclusion. However, the government is keen to increase the UK's offshore wind capacity by 2030 and FLOW, being situated in deeper waters further from shore, can gain access to higher, more consistent wind speeds. In a positive change for FLOW developers (and as is the case with fixed offshore wind projects), they will be able build in up to three phases, subject to a 1,500MW total maximum capacity.",https://www.addleshawgoddard.com/globalassets/insights/white/energy-wind-renewable-teaser.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 14:56:07.507956

Green-hydrogen power, produced from renewable-energy sources such as wind and solar, has emerged as a promising solution in the global shift away from fossil fuels, and Spain’s strategic location on the Iberian Peninsula makes it a strong contender to lead this transition.

Nature Spotlight: Spain

The region experiences the highest number of sunshine hours and some of the highest wind speeds in Europe, making it an ideal base for the renewable-energy production needed to generate hydrogen power. For these reasons, the nation’s leaders have set ambitious targets for renewable hydrogen deployment, aiming to use their network of green hydrogen valleys — several initiatives focused on producing, storing and transporting hydrogen — to reach an electrolyser capacity of 4 gigawatts by 2030.

Lluís Soler Turu, deputy director of the Specific Center for Hydrogen at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain, thinks that this can be done. His work, which involves investigating the production and transformation of hydrogen as a sustainable-energy option, has given him insight into its future, and he describes the opportunities and challenges in the industry.

Why is hydrogen technology important for Spain?

There’s no doubt that climate change is already causing higher temperatures and extreme weather in this region: last year, Catalonia experienced its worst drought on record. The country’s leaders know that they must switch from fossil fuels to green technologies such as hydrogen power. The cost of climate-change impacts is mounting, but it’s still possible to change the trajectory.

Hydrogen power is made by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using electricity, a process called electrolysis. ‘Green’ hydrogen is produced from renewable sources, such as solar or wind power, without producing pollution or carbon emissions, and unlike solar or wind, it can be stored easily. It is a clean alternative to gas, coal and diesel, and is versatile: you can use it to generate electricity, as a raw material or even burn it to heat homes. But green hydrogen is an energy carrier, not a source — expanding hydrogen’s production will require more renewable-energy infrastructure, which will include building more solar panels and wind turbines on the Iberian Peninsula.

What work are you doing with the UPC Hydrogen Laboratory?

In 2021, my research group received funding to develop a ‘living laboratory’ — integrating research and practical, real-world innovations between academia and industry — for research into the production, storage and use of hydrogen. The hydrogen and electricity used in the lab for experiments such as fuel-cell testing is produced sustainably, on the roof of our building: we have our very own microgrid, consisting of 24 solar panels and 6 electrolysers, which allows us to produce 6 kilograms of hydrogen per day. We can also store up to 16 kg at any one time, which is enough to power our research all day, as well as the training activities and industry collaborations that we host on-site.

The lab also has a 3-square-metre environmental-testing chamber, in which we can tune the relative humidity and temperature to test things such as fuel cells. These are devices that convert hydrogen gas into electricity to power an electric motor, and they can be used for larger vehicles, such as a bus or a truck. The testing chamber is capable of mimicking extreme temperatures (40–80 °C), with a maximum power of 100 kilowatts, which means that the device will be safe and efficient in real-world conditions — even during a Finnish winter or a Moroccan summer.

One of our most exciting projects is with the Catalan government to turn one of the region’s airports, Lleida–Alguaire, into a self-sustaining hub for hydrogen production and research. The airport, which is located around 150 kilometres from Barcelona and serves around 40,000 passengers annually, has been open for 15 years, but it will soon start to produce its own green hydrogen, using 1,768 solar panels and a 100-kW electrolyser, with the aim of generating 5–6 tonnes of hydrogen annually (enough to power a car for up to 600,000 km), supporting local industries and sustainable aviation-fuel development.

What needs to happen for hydrogen to become widely used?

At the UPC, we produce green hydrogen through electrolysis using renewable electricity, which means that no carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere. We also investigate catalysts for producing blue hydrogen from methane or bioalcohol steam, in which the CO2 is captured, not released — because the CO2 can be used in many ways in research. For this reason, I prefer the term defossilization rather than decarbonization when we talk about the green-energy transition.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-01025-y/d41586-025-01025-y_50850450.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 11:56:33.320966

Kamil Al-Awadhi, Regional Vice President for Africa and the Middle East at International Air Transport Association (IATA), described the UAE as a ""global role model"" for aviation development, pointing to the speed of progress, quality of infrastructure, and efficient operations in the country.

In statements to the Emirates News Agency (WAM) on the sidelines of the IATA World Cargo Symposium 2025 in Dubai, Kamil Al-Awadhi praised the UAE for its outstanding achievements in the aviation sector.

He noted that the country has established itself as a role model—even for developed nations—due to its integrated and well-coordinated aviation ecosystem.

He highlighted that this system includes airlines, airports, ground services, security, and safety, all functioning at high levels of efficiency.

Additionally, he pointed to the UAE’s streamlined visa procedures and the exceptional treatment of passengers at its airports, which reflect the nation’s commitment to quality and world-class service standards.

He confirmed that the UAE is taking a leading role on the global stage in developing Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF), which, unlike Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), is derived from conventional sources but has lower carbon emissions. It remains under study and development.

‘’The UAE is a leader in the development of LCAF,’’ he noted.

On IATA's forecast for air traffic in 2025, he said that IATA expects air traffic growth in the Gulf and Middle East to reach approximately 9%, which is higher than the expected global rate of around 5.6%.

He emphasised that UAE airlines in particular will be among the fastest growing, and may even exceed this rate, due to their modern infrastructure and ambitious expansion strategies. He noted that this growth includes both passenger and air cargo traffic.",https://mastercms.alhilalgroup.com/source/TA/2025/04/16/TA_20250416172554.jpg,N,,2025-04-16 11:56:47.205275

Firefly aims to build a First-of-a-Kind SAF production facility in the UK to be operational by 2029. Like all FOAK SAF facilities, scaling up production and at pace is very challenging. As this pathway utilises a readily available feedstock, there is real potential to scale the production globally. Securing new partnerships around the world will therefore be critical to the success of that objective.

As this production route is a new fuel pathway (Sewage Biosolids to Jet, SBtJ), obtaining fuel qualification through ASTM is a critical milestone to commercialisation and can take several months or years to approve a new fuel.

Solution

Innovate UK Business Connect was instrumental in supporting the early development of Firefly Green Fuels, facilitating access to key services and expertise. This included working with Firefly to secure their first offtake agreement with Wizz Air, Europe’s fastest growing airline, and will be the first European airline to fly on UK-produced SAF.

As Firefly Green Fuels is developing a new fuel pathway, Innovate UK Business Connect recognised the need for Firefly to engage with the right experts to start the fuel testing and approval process. They connected Firefly to the UK SAF Clearing House, a Department for Transport funded facility to support companies access jet fuel testing. Firefly is now making positive progress on the fuel testing.

However, this represented only 0.5% of the aviation industry’s fuel demand, highlighting the steep challenge of scaling up supply.
In Brazil, Vibra recently took a first step by importing 550,000 liters of SAF.
“Our goal is to bring the product to market at commercial scale in the first half of 2025,” it said.
“In Brazil, the infrastructure for SAF production and distribution is still under development and requires significant investment,” she said.","Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is beginning to establish a foothold in Brazil’s market. On one front, distributing company Vibra has started importing the product at a commercial scale. At the same time, domestic production is nearing launch, with Petrobras forecasting deliveries as early as June.

SAF is a key pillar in the aviation sector’s strategy to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Brazil is viewed as a promising player in the global supply of this renewable fuel, which can be produced through various methods—the most advanced being HEFA, which uses waste oils. While Brazilian regulations have progressed, companies warn that regulatory gaps and high costs are still major barriers to further investment.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global SAF production reached 1.9 billion liters in 2024, triple the volume from the previous year. However, this represented only 0.5% of the aviation industry’s fuel demand, highlighting the steep challenge of scaling up supply.

In Brazil, Vibra recently took a first step by importing 550,000 liters of SAF. According to Marcelo Bragança, Vibra’s executive vice president of operations, logistics, and sourcing, that amount could fuel 1,000 flights based on a 10% blend.

“We’re in talks with clients about supplying certain routes with this product. We intend to bring in more shipments to Galeão and potentially other airports,” Mr. Bragança said. Vibra is expected to announce its first domestic customers shortly. Currently, SAF imported by the company is about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel—one of the main obstacles to broader adoption.

The company has been studying sustainable fuels since 2004 through its vegetable oil co-processing route—blending renewable oils during the refining process. However, under Brazilian law, only 5% of the final SAF product can come from co-processing.

“We’re currently developing projects for SAF production through co-processing, much like we already produce renewable-content diesel (Diesel R),” the company said in a statement. Petrobras noted it has completed production tests at its Reduc and Regap refineries and plans further testing at Revap.

A final decision on production capacity is still pending. “Our goal is to bring the product to market at commercial scale in the first half of 2025,” it said.

Even Petrobras faces uncertainties. SAF produced through co-processing is already used in international aviation under International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) rules, particularly for compliance with the global emissions reduction program CORSIA. However, Brazilian law does not yet recognize co-processed fuel as SAF—an issue under active debate. The industry is betting that approval will eventually come.

Another company exploring SAF is Be8, based in Rio Grande do Sul. For competitiveness reasons, Be8 chose to launch its SAF initiative with a HEFA-based plant in Paraguay, scheduled to start sales in 2028. The project represents a $1 billion investment.

“Public policy in Latin America should be more advanced. Brazil was way behind, but caught up last year with the Future Fuel law. Now it needs proper regulation,” said Erasmo Carlos Battistella, Be8’s president. The company is also exploring SAF plants in Brazil but is awaiting regulatory clarity. Among the technologies on its radar are alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) conversion and synthetic fuels.

Milena Fajardo, fuel and sustainability director at the Latin American and Caribbean Air Transport Association (ALTA), said the region is well-positioned for SAF production thanks to its diverse biomass sources, which allow for multiple technological pathways. However, she cautioned that insufficient public policy is holding back development. “In Brazil, the infrastructure for SAF production and distribution is still under development and requires significant investment,” she said.

Brazil adopted emission reduction targets under the Future Fuel law in 2024. Under the rule, airlines operating domestic flights must cut emissions by 1% in 2027 using SAF. The requirement will rise incrementally to 10% by 2037. The National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) and the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) have signed a technical cooperation agreement to develop the regulatory framework for the law.

Despite progress, companies still face uncertainty. Questions remain over whether minimum SAF blending requirements will apply to all airports or just select terminals, whether SAF can be sold directly without distributors, and how the fuel will be taxed.

ANP told Valor that the regulatory agenda has completed a public consultation phase and is now being finalized. The timeline for implementation is set for 2025–2026. Some legal definitions are still pending executive orders.

While some jurisdictions have set minimum SAF blending mandates, Brazil chose a feedstock-based approach, according to Marcela Anselmi, ANAC’s manager for environment and energy transition.

Technologies like HEFA are more advanced and less costly, but offer lower carbon reduction potential than, for instance, ethanol-to-jet conversion. By focusing on volume rather than emission impact, Brazil may be favoring the cheaper option.

Ms. Anselmi also expressed concern about the direction of international policies. “We’re seeing protectionist measures shaping the SAF market,” she said, citing the European Union’s restrictions on biomass feedstocks—only allowing second-generation or waste-based inputs—arguing that SAF should not compete with food production.

However, Brazil, with its fertile soil and tropical climate, could supply SAF without jeopardizing food security. “There is real concern that this market could be stifled by international restrictions framed as technical requirements but essentially serving as trade barriers,” she said.

Airlines are among the most eager for SAF availability. Latam has set a target for SAF to account for 5% of its global fuel consumption by 2030, aiming to spur production through early demand signals.

Latam told Valor that the high cost of SAF—up to five times more expensive than conventional fuel—is a key concern. “Without appropriate public policies, SAF could drive up travel costs, impacting flight demand and regional connectivity.”

Filipe Alvarez, Azul’s sustainability manager, said the industry is serious about meeting its targets. Azul has committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045. “However, without a structured and growing SAF supply, no airline in the world will be able to meet its decarbonization goals,” he pointed out.

Aircraft manufacturers are also making moves. Landon Loomis, Boeing’s president for Latin America and the Caribbean, noted that all aircraft in operation today can run on up to 50% SAF blends. “Boeing remains committed to ensuring our aircraft are fully compatible with 100% SAF by 2030,” he said.

The agreement outlines the airline’s plan to purchase up to 7.5 million litres of SAF between 2025 and 2029, which will help Volotea reduce the carbon emissions of its operations in France.

According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), pure SAF can lower CO₂ emissions by up to 90% over its entire lifecycle when compared to conventional fossil-based jet fuel. SAF is usually blended with standard kerosene before being used in aircraft and is compatible with existing infrastructure and engines.

The fuel supplied under this agreement will be made from waste products, including used cooking oils and animal fats, making it a cleaner alternative that doesn’t require changes to aircraft systems.

Carlos Muñoz, Founder and CEO of Volotea, said the partnership marks a meaningful step in the airline’s sustainability efforts. “This agreement with TotalEnergies strengthens our commitment to more sustainable aviation and supports the goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050,” he said.

He also highlighted the importance of government incentives to support greater use of SAF. “France is progressing in SAF infrastructure, but we need a system that encourages all players in the industry to invest in sustainable fuel, research, and large-scale production,” Muñoz added.

Volotea has launched several initiatives in recent years to reduce its environmental footprint. In 2024, the airline reported a 47% reduction in direct CO₂ emissions per passenger-kilometer compared to 2012 levels—bringing it close to its target of a 50% reduction by 2030, which it may reach as early as 2025.

Louise Tricoire, Senior Vice President of Aviation & Marine Fuels at TotalEnergies, said the company is proud to support Volotea’s sustainability goals. “This agreement shows how we can help our partners transition to cleaner energy and contribute to a more sustainable aviation industry,” she said.

In this episode of SAF Talks, we dive deep into the world of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with Carlos Ayuso, Director of Projects and Innovation Processes at Moeve. Carlos Ayuso begins by talking about Moeve's longstanding presence in the jet fuel market and the company's recent strides in sustainable aviation. Last year, Moeve made headlines by introducing sustainable aviation fuels across Spain's main airports.

Innovation at the core

As the Director of Projects and Innovation Processes at Moeve, Carlos plays a crucial role in overcoming the technical challenges associated with SAF. From dealing with contaminants like lithium and phosphor to finding solutions for corrosion issues, Moeve's innovation team is at the forefront of developing and implementing new technologies. They often collaborate with research centers and technology companies, including Topsoe.

Pathways to 2030 and beyond

Carlos provides a clear roadmap for SAF production leading up to 2030 and beyond. One of the biggest hurdles in SAF production is feedstock availability. Moeve has secured a long-term agreement with Apical, a global leader in vegetable oil production, ensuring a steady supply for their initial units. Additionally, Moeve is fostering alliances with small producers in Spain and collaborating to develop cover crops with an investment of 1.2 billion euros, Moeve is building a bios plant that will make it second-generation biofuel energy park the largest in southern Europe, with a flexible production capacity of 500,000 tons per year of SAF and HVO. In this way, the company aims to reach an annual SAF production of 800,000 toons by 2030.

To achieve this, Moeve has secured a long-term agreement with strategic partners to ensure a steady supply and is exploring ways to diversify its feedstock sources while also promoting a circular economy.

A vision for the future

When asked about the most transformative change needed to accelerate SAF adoption, Carlos highlights the importance of technology, regulation, and feedstock availability. While technology is crucial, he acknowledges that a holistic approach involving regulatory support and sample feedstock is essential for scaling up SAF production.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/What%20awaits%20SAF%20in%20the%20months%20ahead%20%282%29.png,N,,2025-04-16 09:56:37.419754

As Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, “Denmark has the skills, India has the scale, and the world has the need for new technologies.” This sentiment was expanded upon by Pooja Kapur, the former Indian Ambassador in Copenhagen: “India has the scale as well as the skills and we are cooperating with Denmark to acquire even more skills and technologies for the green transition. There is a beautiful synergy between Denmark’s skills and technologies and India’s requirements.”

India: a market poised for transformation

India’s energy needs are vast and diverse. Currently, 88% of the country’s primary energy requirements are met by coal and oil. However, this dominance is gradually diversifying to renewable energy sources, which now account for 3.4% of the primary energy supply. With over 203 GW of installed renewable energy capacity as of October 2024, India ranks fourth globally in renewable energy deployment. Solar power leads the way, followed by wind and hydroelectric power.

Despite these advancements, the industrial, transportation and power sectors remain heavily reliant on fossil fuels. This is where clean fuels, such as biofuels, synthetic fuels (e-fuels), green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), come into play. These fuels offer transformative solutions to decarbonize hard-to-abate sectors like aviation, shipping, heavy transport and steel production.

India’s strategic focus on these fuels is evident in its policies, including the National Green Hydrogen Mission, the Methanol Economy Program and the National Policy on Biofuels. These initiatives aim to reduce fossil fuel dependency, promote renewable energy adoption and foster innovation in clean fuel technologies.

India’s Green Fuels report zeroes in on five key fuels: second-generation (2G) bioethanol, low-carbon and green hydrogen, low-carbon and green ammonia, methanol and SAF. Each of these fuels holds significant potential to drive India’s decarbonization efforts. For instance, India’s abundant agricultural residues and municipal solid waste provide a robust feedstock base for biofuels. Similarly, the country’s growing chemical and transportation sectors create a strong demand for low-carbon methanol and SAF. However, challenges such as infrastructure gaps, high production costs and regulatory hurdles must be addressed to unlock the full potential of these fuels.

Topsoe’s role in India’s Roadmap

At Topsoe, we are well positioned to contribute to India’s clean energy transition. With decades of experience in fuel production technologies, we are at the forefront of developing solutions for renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), green and low-carbon hydrogen, green and low-carbon ammonia and methanol.

For instance, Topsoe currently provides the technology behind 30% of global SAF production. As global aviation and transport sectors face mounting pressure to reduce emissions, SAF and renewable diesel have emerged as critical solutions. Topsoe’s innovative technologies and catalysts enable the production of these fuels from renewable feedstocks, offering a viable pathway to decarbonize these sectors.

Green and low-carbon hydrogen are other key areas from Topsoe. Hydrogen is a cornerstone of the energy transition. Topsoe is expected to begin production of SOEC electrolyzer cells this year for green hydrogen using renewable electricity, with our SynCOR™ technology is a leading solution for low-carbon hydrogen production. Topsoe’s technologies are designed to optimize efficiency and reduce costs in low-carbon ammonia production, enabling production of fertilizers and progressing the future role of ammonia as a shipping fuel.

Over the decades, Topsoe has been active in supporting India ammonia plants to continuously reduce energy use through revamps, for instance. This has allowed them to stay in line with the energy levels mandated by the Indian government. Now, our technology in SAF and green ammonia are finding markets in India, while late in 2024, we signed an agreement with developer Hygenco to provide our Topsoe technology for their upcoming green ammonia plant in Odisha, India.

Collaboration and challenges line the path ahead

The collaboration between India and Denmark under the Green Strategic Partnership (GSP) demonstrates the power of international cooperation in addressing global challenges. Initiatives like the Green Transition Alliance India (GTAI) bring together Danish companies with advanced technologies and Indian industries with ambitious decarbonization goals. This partnership not only accelerates the adoption of new fuels in India but also boosts economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.

However, the road ahead is not without challenges. Green hydrogen and ammonia production, for example, requires substantial renewable electricity and specialized infrastructure, such as pipelines and storage tanks. Similarly, the high costs of renewable electricity and electrolyzers make green ammonia and hydrogen production significantly more expensive than their conventional counterparts.

Infrastructure gaps, such as the lack of SAF production facilities and carbon capture systems pointed to in the report, further complicate the scaling of clean fuels. Additionally, India’s regulatory framework, while evolving, still lacks the specificity and incentives needed to support large-scale clean fuel projects.

Despite these barriers, the opportunities are immense. India’s rising energy demand, expanding chemical sector and focus on sustainability create a fertile ground for clean fuel adoption. State-level initiatives in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu for green hydrogen and ammonia and in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab for biofuels, highlight the regional potential for clean energy projects. Policies incentivizing carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) further enhance the feasibility of producing green fuels like methanol and ammonia.

A shared vision

The India’s Green Fuels: Baseline Market Study and Roadmap report is a tribute to the shared vision of India and Denmark for a sustainable future. By using Danish expertise in advanced technologies and India’s ambitious clean energy goals, we can collectively overcome challenges and make the most of opportunities in the evolving fuel sector. At Topsoe, we remain committed to driving this transformation, working together with our partners to build a more resilient energy present and future.

The journey to a low-carbon economy in India is and will be complex, but with collaboration, innovation and determination, we can turn challenges into opportunities and pave the way for a bright future.",https://www.topsoe.com/hubfs/Imported_Blog_Media/Thaioil%20will%20use%20Topsoes%20SNOX%E2%84%A2%20to%20remove%20sulfur%20and%20nitrogen%20oxides%20and%20dust%20emissions%20from%20their%20Sriracha%20Refinery%20-3-1.jpeg,N,,2025-04-16 09:56:41.848149

Certified for Defence use in 2023, the Air Force demonstrated the use of SAF with the RAAF Roulettes conducting a flying display fuelled by a SAF blend at the 2023 Newcastle-Williamtown Airshow.

This year Air Force, in collaboration with Joint Capability Group, expanded the initiative to a 12-month pilot activity at RAAF Base East Sale, making the base the first airfield in Australia routinely using a SAF blend.

HQ Aviation Command’s Director of Aviation Capability Management, Colonel Brenton Mellor, said Army’s continuing participation in the initiative ensured its aviators and support personnel understood the strategic significance of SAF and could see how the fuel functioned the same as conventional aviation turbine fuel.

“SAF will be an important element in keeping Army aircraft in the air,” Colonel Mellor said.

“Being able to increase our fuel stocks while maintaining our military capability and interoperability with allies increases our resilience, effectiveness and deterrence.

“The stopover by the Chinook at East Sale is an important milestone for the use of SAF across Defence, and Army Aviation looks forward to greater availability of synthetic aviation turbine fuels.”

The refuelling at RAAF Base East Sale reportedly demonstrates the ADF’s ability to pivot to use the fuel when it is produced domestically in coming years.

The leadership of the UAE has a strategic vision for aviation, supported by smart regulation and investment in world-class infrastructure. Supporting nearly a million jobs and 18.2% of GDP, aviation makes an enormous contribution to the UAE’s prosperity—both culturally and economically. And we can be confident that this contribution will strengthen as the UAE continues to facilitate opportunities for aviation to thrive,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General.

Key Priorities for the UAE

Building on its position as a global aviation leader, the UAE is well-placed to progress in three priority areas:

Sustainability: The UAE has been a leader in the development of Low Carbon Aviation Fuel (LCAF) and is targeting an annual production of 700 million liters of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) by 2030. IATA looks forward to the potential for even broader collaboration with the UAE, in pursuit of opportunities to advance progress towards aviation’s net zero carbon emissions by 2050 goal such as the recently launched SAF Registry (operated by CADO).

Infrastructure: As the UAE continues to invest in world class-infrastructure to meet future demand, particularly with the development of Al Maktoum International Airport (DWC) and Zayed International Airport (AUH), it is critical to work with industry to remain a cost competitive hub for airlines and passengers.

Workforce: The UAE is making significant investments in aviation training to ensure a skilled workforce to support growth opportunities. Maintaining a sustainable pipeline of aviation professionals will further strengthen the UAE's status as a global aviation hub. As part of this effort, a new IATA training center was recently opened in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

“The stopover by the Chinook at East Sale is an important milestone for the use of SAF across Defence, and Army Aviation looks forward to greater availability of synthetic aviation turbine fuels.”

Defence’s move into sustainability comes as countries and airlines continue to invest in producing more sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) for commercial carriers.

Earlier this month, for example, Qantas and Airbus pledged to invest $15 million in a climate-focused venture capital fund.

Virgin, meanwhile, has partnered with Viva Energy to trial SAF in departing flights from Whitsunday Coast Airport and Air New Zealand last year signed a deal for 9 million litres of SAF that will be blended with conventional jet fuel.

The initiatives followed strong lobbying by former Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, who in 2022 argued Australia should be beating other nations to produce large quantities of SAF itself.

“Australians are the most competitive people I’ve ever come across,” Joyce said. “We should be making it into a World Cup. I think we’d win if that were the case.”

Joyce was a long-term advocate of encouraging more production of SAFs in Australia, branding it a “huge opportunity” that would create “a huge amount of jobs”.

“It’s a shame if Qantas meets its 10 per cent sustainable aviation fuel target in 2030 by just buying it offshore. That would be terrible outrage in my mind, and it’s a terrible dropping of the ball in Australia.”",https://res.cloudinary.com/momentum-media-group-pty-ltd/images/f_auto/v1744781367/An_Australian_Army_CH-47F_Chinook_was_refuelled_with_sustainable_aviation_fuel_Defence_annasr/An_Australian_Army_CH-47F_Chinook_was_refuelled_with_sustainable_aviation_fuel_Defence_annasr.jpg?_i=AA,N,,2025-04-16 05:56:14.305461

The U.S. sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market is gaining momentum, driven by a combination of environmental concerns, policy support, and industry adoption. Growing awareness of carbon emissions has accelerated the shift away from traditional fossil fuels toward cleaner alternatives in both commercial and military aviation. Federal initiatives, including tax credits and incentives, have been instrumental in promoting the production and use of SAF. Major airlines such as United Airlines, KLM, and JetBlue have already begun blending SAF with conventional jet fuel—some up to 50%—highlighting its practical application. A key milestone was United Airlines’ successful operation of the first commercial flight powered entirely by SAF, underscoring the fuel’s reliability and potential. Looking ahead, the U.S. government's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 and ongoing support for sustainable energy solutions are expected to drive down costs and stimulate broader adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the industry.

Participants were introduced to their growing leadership role in their local innovation communities and were provided with direction and insight into the opportunities ahead as Air Force innovation continues to target capability in 2025.

“Providing opportunities for our EDGY leaders to network, learn from each other and readily recognise and support Defence innovation, is at the crux of our work,” EDGY Program Director Wing Commander Kylie Cimen said.

The week-long course involved representatives from eight Air Force bases Australia-wide gaining insights into lab management, induction and reporting processes, work health and safety, and rapid-innovation protocols.

Ambassadors were also introduced to communications and event planning, to better engage with their local base communities and promote the EDGY Program.

“Around 90 per cent of innovation that takes place in Air Force is focused on continuous improvement and next-generation advances to existing capabilities,” Wing Commander Cimen said.

“Our EDGY communities fit in these critical zones and their stewardship of ground-up innovation is essential.

“Our focus for the year ahead is to support our EDGY leadership team to support local innovators, or prospective innovators, to rapidly translate great ideas into practical capability.”

Flight Lieutenant Loretta Jolly, an ambassador and lab manager from RAAF Base Williamtown, said she found the leadership aspects of the training invaluable.

“I also found the networking to be extremely beneficial. I now have a support network around me and know who to contact across the broader EDGY network for help or advice,” Flight Lieutenant Jolly said.

She said she couldn’t wait to get back to Williamtown and to start implementing some of her learnings from the week.

“We had plenty of to do items to get started on when we returned, with new focus thanks to the training we’d received,” Flight Lieutenant Jolly said.

(""Mitsui"", Head Office: Tokyo, President and CEO: Kenichi Hori) has invested in Infinium Holdings, Inc. (""Infinium"") Series C funding round. Infinium is a US based leading provider of gas conversion solutions and developer of eFuels technology and projects. This is Mitsui's second initiative in the synthetic fuel area, following the investment in Twelve Benefit Corporation announced on February 13, 2025.

Synthetic eFuels are liquid fuels produced through the catalytic chemical reactions that occur between green hydrogen (produced by electrolyzing water using clean energy) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These fuels are expected to play an increasingly important part in efforts to reduce GHG emissions, especially in the transportation and industrial sectors. They offer a number of specific advantages. For example, GHG emissions are over 90% lower compared with fossil fuel-derived products. Synthetic eFuels can also be used as drop-in fuels without the need to modify engines, including aircraft engines, or transportation and storage infrastructure. In addition, they are suitable for applications for which electrification is not viable, such as aviation, shipping, and long-distance land surface transportation.

Infinium is a leader in this industry and was the first in the world to start up a synthetic eFuel production operation using their proprietary reverse water gas shift (RWGS) and Liquid Fuel Production* processes. Its first production plant in Corpus Christi, Texas commenced production in late 2023. Customers include Amazon who uses the eDiesel produced at the plant to fuel its delivery trucks, and Borealis who take the eNaphtha to produce low-carbon plastics. Infinium's second facility is in development in West Texas with a focus on sustainable aviation fuel (eSAF) production. Canadian asset management firm Brookfield, which has invested in a wide range of next-generation fuel-related business, and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, a clean energy investment program, have invested directly into the project. Customers include the International Airlines Group (IAG) and American Airlines who have committed to buy eSAF produced at the new plant.

Mitsui is accelerating its initiatives across the entire carbon value chain, ranging from the recovery of CO2 through direct air capture (DAC) and other methods, to carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the use of CO2 to produce synthetic fuels, as well as the creation and sale of carbon credits. By deepening collaboration across its e-Fuel portfolio companies, Mitsui aims to expand its carbon-neutral fuel manufacturing and sales business, and link clean energy development and various CO2 materials from biomass, DAC, and other sources, with a variety of fuel needs, thereby maximizing the value of its value chain. Mitsui will contribute to the creation of the carbon management industry through the global development of a decarbonized fuel business on a significant scale.

For travel companies wanting to help - and also demonstrate to climate conscious travelers that they’re doing their part to help - incorporating a solution that helps reduce and clean up the emissions from air travel into their climate action plans is desirable.

Flight Emissions Basics

Carbon dioxide makes up 70% of all air travel emissions, while the other 30% is water vapor. Water vapor forms condensation trails in the atmosphere, trapping heat and acting as artificial clouds, which leads to a warming effect that is potentially greater than the direct impact of carbon dioxide emissions from flight. Did you know that of all the CO2 emissions a plane releases into the atmosphere, most of it will not dissipate until at least 100 years have passed? (Environmental Energy and Study Institute). This, and many other aspects of air travel emissions and efforts to curb it can be found in A Deep Dive on Aviation and Climate for the Climate Conscious Traveler.

Facing the realities of air travel’s impact on climate are at the heart of why Tomorrow’s Air exists: to make it easy for travel companies to contribute to innovative solutions that can reduce carbon dioxide emissions in our atmosphere - sustainable aviation fuel- and solutions that can clean up carbon dioxide emissions and store them permanently such as

Brave Travel Companies are Coming Forward to Help

It was February 2022 when kimkim joined Tomorrow’s Air, becoming the first travel business to incorporate funding support through Tomorrow’s Air for solutions that provide carbon removal with permanent storage in its booking process.

Kimkim’s approach called for sharing the cost of their climate initiative with local travel specialists and customers. As the company notes on its website, “each contribution is small - but cumulatively, they have a large and lasting impact.”

When Tomorrow’s Air introduced sustainable aviation fuel in September 2023, kimkim was again at the front of the line, becoming the first partner to incorporate sustainable aviation fuel investment directly into traveler bookings.

Kimkim says that “independent travel can and should be a force for social impact.” The company’s trips “support economic growth in our destinations, promote cross-cultural exchange and understanding, and embrace sustainable tourism principles.” They favor partnerships with small, local specialists and suppliers, and help them grow their businesses and improve the sustainability of their trips. And, kimkim understands “that the impact on the climate is one of the biggest challenges resulting from travel.”

They’ve been at the forefront of climate action in the travel industry, doing their part not only to address their own emissions, but through their support via Tomorrow’s Air, to help educate and inspire others to follow in their footsteps.

While conventional sellers of carbon offsets focus purely on generating as many offset transactions as possible, Tomorrow’s Air has a deeper mission at its core, striving not only to send much-needed funding to climate solutions, but also to help build awareness and galvanize broader support from the travel industry.

What makes hemp ideal for carbon removal in aviation?

Industrial hemp is one of the fastest-growing and most carbon-hungry plants on Earth. It captures CO₂ efficiently, and when turned into hempcrete or carbon fibre, it locks that carbon away for decades. It can also produce bio-based jet fuel. Hemp offers multiple sustainability benefits from one crop.

How are carbon removal credits from hemp verified?

Tao Climate’s MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) platform uses satellite imaging, AI, and field data to ensure every Hemp Carbon Removal Credit is real, traceable, and transparent. This is a leap forward in trust and integrity for the carbon removal market.

What is Tao CX and how does it help airlines?

Tao CX is our Customer Experience product. It integrates carbon removal options into the flight booking and loyalty journey, enabling passengers to contribute to real-time climate action. Airlines benefit from increased revenue, sustainability engagement, and brand trust.

What is Tao OPS?

Tao SAF helps aviation stakeholders access and scale sustainable aviation fuel. We focus on hemp seed oil as a high-potential feedstock and support the development of local, circular SAF supply chains to reduce emissions and increase resilience.

Is SAF made from hemp as effective as traditional jet fuel?

Yes. Hemp-derived SAF has a high energy density, performs well in jet engines, and significantly lowers lifecycle carbon emissions. It’s one of the most promising and sustainable SAF options available today.

How can airports use their land to remove carbon?

Airports can grow hemp on underutilised land, transforming their surroundings into green carbon sinks. This not only removes CO₂ but also enables local SAF production and sustainable material manufacturing—all measurable with Tao Climate’s MRV platform.

What are the main benefits of hempcrete for aviation infrastructure?

Hempcrete is a carbon-negative building material made from hemp stalks and lime. It continues absorbing CO₂ after construction, making airport terminals and hangars active carbon removers. It’s strong, sustainable, and perfect for aviation facilities.

What role does Tao Climate play in the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?

Tao Climate directly supports SDGs like Climate Action (13), Affordable Clean Energy (7), Sustainable Cities (11), Responsible Consumption (12), and Partnerships for the Goals (17) by enabling sustainable farming, construction, and aviation practices.

What is the Ukraine pilot project?

In Ukraine, Tao Climate is helping rebuild communities with hemp. We support a local company that grows hemp, captures CO₂, and uses the hemp fibre to build hempcrete housing for people affected by war. This project combines carbon removal with humanitarian impact.

Who are Tao Climate’s strategic partners?

We work with Google, the European Space Agency (ESA BIC Ireland), and we’re in Elon Musk’s XPRIZE Carbon Removal Top 100. We’re supported by Enterprise Ireland, and Startupbootcamp’s AI accelerator programme. Our technology is being built to deliver the highest standards of climate impact and verification.

How can airlines generate revenue from sustainability?

By integrating carbon removal into booking and loyalty flows through Tao CX, airlines can offer passengers a meaningful sustainability option and earn revenue from each carbon credit sale. It’s an easy win-win.

What is the aviation industry’s timeline for SAF adoption?

The EU ReFuel mandate requires 2% SAF by 2025, scaling up to 63% by 2050. Tao Climate helps you meet and exceed those targets by developing local hemp-based SAF supply chains and verifying emissions savings.

How does hemp support biodiversity and pollinators?

Hemp is naturally pest-resistant and requires minimal chemicals. It flowers and provides habitat and nourishment for pollinators, helping to restore biodiversity around airports and farmlands.

Is hemp legal to grow in Europe and globally?

Yes. Industrial hemp is legal across the EU, US, and most other jurisdictions, provided it contains less than 0.3% THC. We work with licensed growers to ensure full legal compliance and traceability.

What is Tao Climate’s MRV platform?

Our MRV system (Monitoring, Reporting, Verification) uses AI, satellite imagery, and on-the-ground data to create real-time, verifiable carbon removal credits.

As such, ""the design and structure of regulation is what drives investment and, by extension, the trading and optimization strategies that develop around them,"" he said.
There is ""a lot of synergy"" in managing the trade lifecycle and supply chain for fossil and renewable fuels in a single system, especially since the blending of fossil fuels and renewable fuels will remain common for a long time, Jaeger said.
However, renewable energy sources continue to be traded.
They are managing biogas alongside their existing gas activities and are scaling up their tracking of sustainability credentials through ION's energy trading and risk management solutions, he said.","Regulation design and the potential to optimize trades are driving biofuels and decarbonization strategies, according to commodities trading software firm ION Commodities.

With many production pathways for biofuels production available, regulations are emerging in different jurisdictions to establish clear standards and incentivize the development of new technologies such as synthetic fuels, and to promote market efficiency.

""A lot of biofuels simply aren't competitive without some form of carbon or sustainability incentive,"" Andre Jaeger, senior vice president at ION Commodities, told Platts, part of S&P Global Commodity Insights. As such, ""the design and structure of regulation is what drives investment and, by extension, the trading and optimization strategies that develop around them,"" he said.

Recent regulations include biofuels mandates in the EU, which stipulate that 2% of aviation fuel supplied at the wing at EU airports is sustainable aviation fuel and that from 2030 1.2% of all aviation fuel supplied is synthetic fuel or eSAF. Across the Atlantic, the US has chosen to prioritize subsidy and tax credit mechanisms.

Many of ION's clients incorporate their biofuels activity into their existing commodity trading activity. There is ""a lot of synergy"" in managing the trade lifecycle and supply chain for fossil and renewable fuels in a single system, especially since the blending of fossil fuels and renewable fuels will remain common for a long time, Jaeger said.

""To manage and report business performance of the biofuel portion of their portfolio, it's crucial for clients to be able to track both the physical fuel and its associated sustainability credentials via certificates,"" he said. ""Depending on the market, the value of these sustainability certificates can be what makes the business case for biofuels viable.""

Companies in certain member states such as the Netherlands can optimize the blending of physical fuel depending on market conditions but have the option to meet obligations through the purchase of biofuel compliance credits.

Platts last assessed Dutch renewable energy units (HBE-A) for advanced fuel at Eur11.54/Gj ($13.05/Gj) on April 14, up from Eur8.40/Gj when it launched in January 2024, via some volatility resulting from the limited supply of renewable diesel coinciding with a fire at a production unit. The assessment reflects the value of an HBE needed to comply with the Dutch annual obligation through advanced biofuel or bio-gas in the transport sector for the current year.

A shifting regulatory landscape

Biofuel markets and certification societies have come under fire in recent years over their environmental credentials. European biofuel producers have accused Asian biofuel imports of being fraudulently certified and this has resulted in tariffs from Brussels on biodiesel and renewable diesel imports.

It has also resulted in attention on International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, which certified the imports and which is reportedly under pressure from the European Commission recognition of its certification for waste-based biofuels, following a row over imports.

A spokesperson for the commission said it had discussed issues related to sustainable certification, promotion of biofuels, and avoidance of double-counting but had not made a decision.

In carbon markets, the Guardian newspaper published a report in January 2023 alleging that REDD+ carbon credits issued by Verra were largely ""worthless"" and did not represent genuine carbon reductions.

Energy transition versus other priorities

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, shortages of gas and concerns about heating have raised the profile of energy security and blunted appetites for reducing carbon emissions. Adding to this trend are current concerns in Europe about defense, which are further complicating budget-keepers' decisions.

However, renewable energy sources continue to be traded. ""There is stable and ongoing interest from clients looking to support renewable power adoption, especially around PPAs (Power Purchase Agreements), intraday trading, and life cycle management of energy certificates,"" Jaeger said.

In addition, a couple of ION's European clients have recently started projects aimed at integrating biogas into their trading portfolios. They are managing biogas alongside their existing gas activities and are scaling up their tracking of sustainability credentials through ION's energy trading and risk management solutions, he said.",https://www.spglobal.com/content/dam/spglobal/ci/en/images/platts/general/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-15 23:56:12.016234
