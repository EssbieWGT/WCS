Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator.
Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises.
Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity.
China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining.","China has approved a restructuring between China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) and China National Aviation Fuel Group Limited (CNAF), marking a major state-led consolidation in the country’s petroleum and aviation fuel sector.

The State Council approved the plan following an announcement by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) on January 8, 2026. Sinopec said the restructuring would be implemented in accordance with government arrangements, but provided no further operational details.

Under the restructuring, Sinopec is expected to absorb CNAF, integrating China’s largest oil refiner with the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and refuelling operator. CNAF controls aviation fuel supply, storage, and into-plane refuelling services at more than 200 airports across mainland China, while Sinopec is the nation’s largest producer of jet fuel and refined petroleum products.

China consumes just over 40 million tonnes of jet fuel a year, equivalent to roughly 0.8–0.9 million barrels per day.

CNAF does not operate crude oil refineries and sources most of its jet fuel from domestic refiners, including Sinopec and PetroChina. Its core assets lie in airport-side infrastructure, including storage tanks, pipelines, hydrant systems, and refuelling fleets. Sinopec, by contrast, operates one of the world’s largest refining systems and an extensive nationwide fuels marketing and pipeline network.

Analysts and state media said the consolidation is intended to streamline China’s aviation fuel supply chain, reduce distribution costs, and eliminate duplicated functions between state-owned enterprises. By combining refining, logistics, and airport distribution within a single group, policymakers aim to improve operational efficiency and strengthen control over a strategically important fuel segment.

The restructuring also aligns with broader efforts to optimise the state-owned economy amid slowing economic growth and structural shifts in fuel demand. As gasoline and diesel consumption plateaus due to electrification and efficiency gains, aviation fuel and petrochemicals are seen as key growth areas for refiners.

Industry observers also expect the integration to support China’s sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) ambitions by linking Sinopec’s refining and biofuel development capabilities with CNAF’s nationwide airport distribution network.

SAF is emerging as a strategic priority for China’s aviation and refining sectors, linked to the country’s targets to peak carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. Under the 14th Five-Year Plan for Green Civil Aviation Development, China set initial SAF consumption targets of 20,000 tonnes per year by 2025, with longer-term policy scenarios pointing to blending rates of 5–15% by 2030. Industry and policy analyses indicate this could translate into domestic SAF demand of several million tonnes per year by the end of the decade, positioning China among the world’s largest potential SAF markets.

China has already begun building the industrial and regulatory foundations to support large-scale SAF deployment. As of 2024, operational and planned SAF capacity—primarily based on hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) technology—totalled more than three million tonnes per year, with several producers receiving airworthiness certification under a CAAC-recognised framework. CAAC, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, is China’s national civil aviation authority under the Ministry of Transport, responsible for regulating and supervising civil aviation, including flight and ground safety, air traffic management, market regulation, and accident investigation.

Sinopec is positioning itself as China’s leading sustainable aviation fuel producer by developing proprietary technology and building domestic production capacity. Through its Zhenhai Refining & Chemical Company unit, Sinopec developed the SRJET HEFA process and commissioned China’s first dedicated SAF plant, with a design capacity of about 100,000 tonnes per year, securing both Chinese airworthiness approval and international sustainability certification. The company has already supplied SAF to Airbus’ Tianjin facility and delivered used-cooking-oil-based SAF to Hong Kong International Airport for uplift by Cathay Pacific, signalling ambitions that extend beyond domestic decarbonisation to regional SAF trading and exports. Sinopec is also expanding capacity through a planned 230,000-tonne-per-year SAF plant developed with TotalEnergies, while positioning SAF alongside carbon capture and other low-carbon fuels as part of its broader transition strategy.

China National Aviation Fuel Group’s SAF strategy is centred on supply security and distribution rather than refining. As the country’s dominant aviation fuel logistics and into-plane refuelling operator, CNAF has taken equity stakes in private SAF producers to secure upstream volumes, including investments in used-cooking-oil-based SAF projects. At the same time, CNAF plays a central operational role in China’s CAAC-led SAF pilot programmes, managing storage, blending, quality control, and into-plane delivery at major airports. This positions CNAF as the logistics backbone of China’s emerging SAF market, complementing refiners such as Sinopec by ensuring that certified SAF can be distributed efficiently to airlines as blending targets and policy support expand.",https://www.fuelsandlubes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cropped-icon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-12 01:11:56.050287

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short.
Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel.
The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview.
Editor’s note: This story was updated to clarify the status of BP’s sustainable aviation fuel project at Cherry Point.","A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Jan. 9 extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.

The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.

Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.

“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.

State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”

The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.

“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”

The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.

SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.

The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.

Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Jan. 8 that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.

A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.

Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.

On the west side of the Cascades, BP was awarded nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal was to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually. But since then, BP corporate management scaled back its renewable fuels ambitions globally and put the Whatcom County project on indefinite “pause,” according to a spokesman. Its future is now unclear.

If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.

By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.

If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.

During a press availability following the Jan. 8 launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.

Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.

The alternative jet fuel “has a climate advantage and a marketing advantage,” said SkyNRG senior adviser Andy Billig in a separate interview. Billig is a former state Senate majority leader who played an instrumental role in the 2023 passage of state tax incentives for SAF producers and users during his final term in office. The state tax credit is worth up to $2 per gallon and can be stacked with federal incentives.

Gandhinagar, Jan 11 (IANS) The Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference for Kutch and Saurashtra saw major announcements from India’s top industrial leaders, reinforcing Gujarat’s position as a national investment magnet on Sunday.

Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani unveiled five significant commitments for Gujarat, reaffirming the company’s deep connection with the state.

He announced that Reliance will double its investment to Rs 7 lakh crore over the next five years, compared to Rs 3.5 lakh crore invested in the previous five years.

The investment is expected to generate large-scale employment and expand the state’s industrial capabilities.

Ambani said Reliance is developing the world’s largest integrated green energy ecosystem in Jamnagar, which will host solar, green hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel projects, marking the city’s shift from a hydrocarbon hub to a global green energy exporter.

In Kutch, the company will establish a multi-gigawatt solar power project to strengthen India’s long-term energy security.

He also announced that Jamnagar will house India’s largest AI-ready data centre, alongside the launch of a new Jio Intelligence Platform - starting from Gujarat - to offer AI services in Indian languages to everyday users.

In the field of sports, Ambani said Reliance Foundation will partner with the Gujarat Government to support the 2036 Olympic vision for Ahmedabad, including taking over operations of the Veer Savarkar Multi-Sports Complex in Naranpura.

Additionally, Reliance will set up a world-class hospital in Jamnagar and expand education-related facilities across Saurashtra, strengthening the region’s social infrastructure.

Ambani described this decade as “India’s decisive decade,” crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for positioning the country as a rising global power.

Adani Ports and SEZ Managing Director Karan Adani announced a massive Rs 1.50 lakh crore investment in Mundra over the next five years. He said that under Prime Minister Modi’s guidance, Kutch has emerged as India’s largest energy hub.

As of early 2026, a transformative partnership between Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) and Kuehne+Nagel has entered a crucial operational phase, following a major agreement signed in late December 2025. This alliance is focused on the commercialization of solar-based synthetic aviation fuel, a revolutionary step towards achieving decarbonization in the aviation sector. This collaboration brings together a Swiss clean-tech pioneer, Synhelion, whose innovative technology is at the heart of this significant move, promising to reshape the future of aviation fuel.

The deal marks the start of a new chapter in the airline and logistics industries as these giants join forces to combat the aviation sector’s carbon footprint. With sustainability at the forefront, this partnership aims to make solar-based fuel a viable, scalable, and long-term solution for reducing emissions in air travel.

Who Are the Key Players in the Partnership?

This landmark collaboration involves three main players: SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion. SWISS, the national carrier of Switzerland, is leading the way as the first airline to integrate solar-based synthetic aviation fuel (SAF) into its regular operations. Kuehne+Nagel, a global logistics provider, will benefit from this innovation by offering its airfreight customers a way to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. Synhelion, a clean-tech company from Switzerland, is the technology provider behind the synthetic fuel, specializing in converting concentrated solar heat into aviation fuel.

What Is Solar-Based Synthetic Fuel?

The core of this groundbreaking partnership is the support for Synhelion’s solar fuel technology, which has already made headlines in the clean-tech industry. Synhelion is the first company globally to use concentrated solar heat to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Unlike traditional biofuels, which rely on agricultural crops and waste products, solar jet fuel is produced by harnessing the power of sunlight to create high-temperature process heat. This heat is then used to convert biogenic carbon and water into liquid fuel, resulting in a synthetic fuel that is both carbon-neutral and scalable.

The technology is being hailed as a game-changer for the aviation industry, as it does not compete with food crops, unlike traditional biofuels. The fuel is designed as a “drop-in” solution, meaning it can be used in existing aircraft engines and infrastructure without the need for any modifications, making it a practical and seamless transition for airlines.

How Will This Partnership Work?

Under the terms of the agreement, SWISS has committed to purchasing at least 200 tonnes of Synhelion’s synthetic SAF annually. This move is critical to the financial sustainability of Synhelion’s production capabilities, ensuring that the company can scale its operations and meet the growing demand for sustainable aviation fuel. The fuel will be used by SWISS in its own operations, marking the airline as a trailblazer in sustainable aviation practices.

Furthermore, Kuehne+Nagel will also benefit from the partnership by purchasing a significant portion of the SAF. The global logistics provider will use this fuel specifically for its airfreight shipments handled by Swiss WorldCargo, the air cargo division of SWISS. This marks a major step in the broader decarbonization of supply chains, as Kuehne+Nagel will be able to offer its customers a tangible and effective way to reduce the CO₂ footprint of their supply chains.

What Are the Long-Term Goals and Timeline for This Partnership?

This collaboration is based on a binding, long-term offtake agreement, ensuring that both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel have a reliable and steady supply of synthetic SAF for years to come. The fuel supply agreement for Kuehne+Nagel will officially begin in 2027, once Synhelion completes its first industrial-scale production facility.

The partnership is a significant step in the aviation industry’s collective effort to reach ambitious decarbonization targets. SWISS’s parent company, Lufthansa Group, is aiming to reduce net CO₂ emissions by 50% by 2030, with the goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. This collaboration will help the airline make substantial progress toward these targets, setting a standard for other airlines to follow.

Why Is This Partnership Considered a “First-of-Its-Kind”?

Unlike many airlines that use bio-SAF, produced from waste oils and fats, this partnership is focused on synthetic SAF, which is seen as the “gold standard” for sustainability. Synthetic SAF does not compete with food crops, has the potential for near-limitless scalability, and offers a significantly lower carbon footprint than traditional aviation fuel. Additionally, synthetic SAF can be produced at scale without relying on the limitations of agricultural resources, making it a highly sustainable alternative to fossil fuels.

This partnership also stands out because it bridges the gap between the airline industry, logistics, and clean-tech solutions. By partnering with Kuehne+Nagel, SWISS is not only leading by example in the aviation sector but also contributing to the larger efforts to decarbonize global supply chains.

What Are the Strategic Goals for This Collaboration?

The goals of the partnership go beyond simply purchasing and using synthetic SAF. The primary objectives include:

Decarbonizing Aviation: Both SWISS and Kuehne+Nagel are committed to using sustainable aviation fuel as a critical part of their decarbonization strategies. For Kuehne+Nagel, securing a long-term supply of SAF allows the logistics giant to significantly reduce the carbon emissions from its airfreight operations.

Scalability of Synthetic SAF: One of the long-term goals is to scale the production of synthetic SAF to make it economically viable and accessible to the wider aviation industry.

Strategic Alignment with Climate Goals: This collaboration aligns perfectly with the Lufthansa Group’s broader climate targets and emphasizes the importance of innovation in achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.

What Does This Mean for the Aviation and Logistics Industries?

The agreement between SWISS, Kuehne+Nagel, and Synhelion is a major milestone for the aviation and logistics sectors. This partnership provides a practical solution to one of the industry’s most pressing issues: reducing emissions from air travel. As the first airline in the world to integrate solar fuel into its operations, SWISS is setting a new benchmark for the industry. This collaboration is also a clear signal to other logistics and aviation companies to follow suit and explore sustainable fuel alternatives.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20250724-swiss-synhelion.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:17.783186

From major airport projects and new long-haul routes to sustainability efforts and regional policy reforms, the year marked a turning point, with Kenya playing a visible and influential role.

Across the continent, airlines and governments moved beyond post-pandemic recovery and began laying foundations for long-term growth. The changes were not just about more flights, but about cheaper travel, greener technology, and stronger regional cooperation.

Kenya’s Growing Role in African Aviation

Kenya remained one of East Africa’s aviation anchors in 2025. Nairobi continued to serve as a key gateway between Africa, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, while Kenyan airlines took notable steps toward sustainability and innovation.

Safarilink Aviation made headlines by committing to hybrid-electric aircraft, positioning Kenya among the early African adopters of cleaner aviation technology. At the same time, Kenya Airways advanced plans to support local production of sustainable aviation fuel, signaling a shift toward greener long-haul operations and reduced carbon emissions.

These moves placed Kenya firmly within Africa’s broader push to modernize aviation while responding to global environmental pressures.

Big Infrastructure and Global Ambition

Elsewhere on the continent, Ethiopian Airlines led one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in African aviation history — the development of Bishoftu International Airport, set to become Africa’s largest airport. The project underscored Africa’s intention to compete directly with major global hubs in Europe and the Middle East.

For Kenya, this expansion presents both competition and opportunity. Improved continental hubs can strengthen inter-African connectivity, benefiting Nairobi as a regional link point for business, tourism, and cargo.

Cheaper Skies Through Regional Action

Perhaps the most significant policy shift came from West Africa. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) approved a decision to cut air ticket taxes and passenger charges, a move expected to reduce fares by up to 40 percent.

Aviation experts say this decision has direct relevance for regions such as East Africa, where flying remains expensive for ordinary citizens. For Kenya and its neighbors, the ECOWAS model provides a clear example of how regional cooperation can make air travel more affordable and boost intra-African tourism and trade.

New Routes, New Connections

Across Africa, airlines expanded international reach. Uganda Airlines launched direct flights to London, Nigerian carriers strengthened partnerships with global airlines, and Ethiopian Airlines expanded cargo links to Asia.

Kenya, already well connected internationally, benefited from this wider network growth by strengthening its role in regional feeder traffic, supporting tourism flows into the country and across East Africa.

Challenges Still Remain

Despite progress, 2025 also highlighted persistent challenges. Safety oversight, regulatory consistency, geopolitical tensions, and high operating costs continue to affect African aviation — including in Kenya.

Airlines and regulators face ongoing pressure to balance expansion with safety, affordability, and environmental responsibility.

A Shared African Direction

What stood out in 2025 was a shared sense of direction. Africa’s aviation sector — including Kenya — is no longer focused only on survival. It is investing, experimenting, and coordinating across borders.

For Kenya, the year reinforced its position as a regional aviation leader, while showing that future success will depend on deeper regional cooperation, smarter policies, and continued innovation.

As Africa looks ahead, the skies are no longer just opening — they are being deliberately redesigned, with Kenya firmly part of the journey.",https://katakenya.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/cropped-cropped-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:27.535296

Electrofuels derived from renewable electricity sources and electrolytic green hydrogen may be scalable in the future. These electrofuels are also referred to as power to liquids or PtL fuels. A pertinent question about electrofuels is whether they are the best use of green electrons whilst there is such a surging demand for electricity around the world and the majority of power generation capacity still relies on fossil fuels. Gasification of residual biomass, such as forestry cuttings and post-harvest waste, is an alternative pathway to achieve liquid fuels. This pathway to SAF is more affordable than the electrofuels route. The challenge of this process is that the syngas produced by gasification is very rich in carbon monoxide (CO) but it does not contain sufficient hydrogen to produce liquid fuels such as kerosene and diesel. And, when we look to the very long term, the amount of available forestry waste is finite and driven by timber production, which is the primary use of the harvested tree. The combination of these two imperfect processes can create a harmonious synergy. The forestry waste biomass is stretched through the use of electrolytic hydrogen to mitigate the scalability concerns. The carbon from the biomass is fully utilised with minimal carbon dioxide emissions. And, the high cost of the pure electrofuel is reduced through combination with the more affordable waste biomass feedstock. Interested in clean energy projects and technologies?

The aviation industry has endured a turbulent few years, with shocks including a worldwide pandemic and various unexpected geopolitical events.

How has Dublin-headquartered SMBC Aviation Capital, which currently has a fleet of 989 owned, managed and committed aircraft, adapted its business?

“I’m at this 35 years, so I remember the first Gulf War, the SARS crisis, 9/11 and the financial crisis. [Aviation is] a fantastic industry but given the scope and nature of it, it’s inevitably going to be impacted by events around the world.”

Covid, however, took the entire industry by surprise.

“Nobody, including ourselves, really modelled a world where aviation was shut down for over a year.

“The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the events there mean it’s been a testing period . My philosophy since then has been ‘you can’t predict the future, but you can prepare for different eventualities’.”

Barrett says they are fortunate to be one of the best-capitalised of the big aircraft leasing companies, owned by a Japanese institution with one of the strongest credit ratings in the industry.

Ultimately, he adds, testing times allow for opportunities of growth and a chance to support customers.

“While aviation is cyclical, it is a consistently growing industry. As the world gets wealthier, as middle classes around the world grow, people want to travel.

“A big market for us is Mexico, which has a very strong, growing aviation low-cost market. If you have the choice of spending 36 hours on a bus or two hours on an airplane, if you can afford it you’ll obviously take the airplane and that’s a trend we see around the world.”

This growing appetite for convenient travel means potential for exponential expansion in the coming years.

Their young, predominantly narrow-body fleet has an average age of 5.64 years, which means they’re well equipped to meet customer requirements for modernity.

“It is a truly global business. So a 737 [aircraft] in Shanghai is the same as a 737 in Stockholm and a 737 in Sao Paulo. And that’s not true of most asset classes. Most assets are quite localised and the environment tends to be more fragmented,” Barrett says.

That doesn’t belie the intricacies of the business when it comes to transborder red tape, tax and legal systems as well as the sheer value of the aircraft and the highly complex nature of their systems.

Barrett describes their balance sheets as very large and says the funding cost of capital is an absolute competitive necessity.

“But the airplanes are the same everywhere in the world. And people recognise it as a global industry. So while there is complexity about it, and there are national and border issues, the fundamentals of what you’re trying to achieve in each jurisdiction or each market is fundamentally the same.”

He believes that, culturally, Irish people have an advantage in the business.

“I think people tend to see us as fairly neutral in that we don’t have any colonial past and we’re not a big player economically in the world, relatively speaking,” he says.

“I also think it’s really important that you try and understand and respect people’s cultures. They are different. They will do things differently. I won’t necessarily approach things the same way, but if you try to put yourself a little bit in their shoes, I think that makes a big difference.”

GROWTH

India, he says, has been a particular growth market for the company over recent years. He notes that the statistics there are “jaw-dropping”.

“[India has] 1.5 billion people, a huge continental country, an increasingly growing and mobile middle class, a road and rail network that is not up to the [job] of transport and moving people around the way that we need for a vibrant economy.

“So aviation has grown significantly. We’ve two very large customers there, Air India and IndiGo, the two biggest airlines in India.”

Colombia is another key area for the company, with an important customer in its national airline, Avianca.

“It’s just a very mountainous country. Building roads and railways is very difficult. So air travel is much more pragmatic,” he says.

Barrett is passionate about the business and firmly believes aviation is a force for good in both developed and developing economies.

“It drives economic activity. It supports businesses finding new customers and new markets. It supports tourism.

“I was in Vietnam meeting with the airlines there. They were very focused, because of the growth in manufacturing there over the last number of years, on cargo.”

While developing markets are full of promise, Barrett also emphasises the importance of their established customer base.

“Markets like North America and, indeed, Europe. While these are mature markets, they do need to replace older aircraft. Also, air travel is still growing there.”

SUSTAINABILITY

One aspect of the business increasingly under the spotlight is the need for increased industry-wide sustainability.

Barrett recognises the difficulties inherent in that change.

“Decarbonisation of aviation is going to be very difficult. It’s going to take a lot of time, it’s going to take a lot of effort and it’s going to be expensive. The most impactful thing we are doing today is helping customers replace less fuel-efficient aircraft [with] more fuelefficient aircraft, and that reduces the carbon footprint.

“Those numbers on an individual aircraft might be 10, 15 or 20 per cent. When you add all that up across lots of airplanes, it’s a meaningful number.”

The client Barrett is meeting in Budapest is getting their 250th aircraft. It’s brand new and considered one of the most per-seat efficient aircraft in the world.

“So you are talking about cycles of technology change here. There’s not going to be a 250-seater batterypowered aircraft in production today or tomorrow, and it probably won’t be for many decades to come. But there will be new-technology aircraft, probably towards the end of the next decade, and they will be even more efficient.”

As an industry there are aspects that they can change to reduce the carbon footprint, Barrett says, specifically around sustainable aviation fuel, operational efficiencies and air traffic control.

SMBC Aviation Capital has, in conjunction with Trinity College Dublin, opened a research facility which is looking at the processes for making sustainable aviation fuel.

“It is fantastic. In the overall scheme of things it’s relatively small, yeah, but I’m a passionate believer in an industry that does a lot of good in the world.

ANTICIPATING THE MARKET

While the financial markets might be key, Barrett says a prudent liability strategy is critical to success.

“We look at consumer demand and consumer trends. Post-Covid we see some evidence that consumers have reprioritised travel in their hierarchy of needs.”

They also closely track the manufacturers’ activity both in long-term strategy and short-term production.

With airframe and engine manufacturers all experiencing a variety of challenges over the last decade, it’s imperative to stay close to that side of the market too.

“I’m a reasonably avid reader of current affairs and the paper I open every morning is Financial Times. And every article you read is probably relevant to our industry, be it oil prices, the cost of money, geopolitics, technology, social trends and social behaviours. You need to keep a very broad radar and look at lots of different things to really manage the business.”

LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY

Barrett’s leadership philosophy is straightforward.

“Leadership is a combination of things. Authenticity is very important, having a clear sense of where you’re going and being guided by your own lights. You can’t be flip-flopping on strategy, tactics or style.

“All of us as leaders have strengths and weaknesses. I’m very conscious of that. But being consistent and having an element of predictability and dependability is important for all your counterparts, be that your colleagues, customers or stakeholders.”

Communication, Barrett adds, is really important and one of the hardest things to get right in any job.

The chief executive advocates “playing the long game” as critically important in his industry.

“We buy 25-year assets, we write 12-year leases. You need to think about your business and what you’re doing as a leader, not in the context of today or tomorrow or next week, although obviously the short term is something you need to deal with. You always need to keep an eye on the long game. It’s a marathon, not a sprint.”

Barrett credits this view as one of the strengths of their business and one of the reasons for the excellent partnership with their Japanese shareholders, who tend towards a long-term view.

Predictably, Barrett’s job entails an inordinate amount of travel.

“It’s an unusual life. I accept that. As you get older, it gets frankly more demanding physically. But I still enjoy it. And look, it’s a great pleasure and, indeed, privilege to travel around the world and meet really interesting people. I’m exceptionally fortunate in life. I would recommend it to anybody.”",https://businessplus.ie/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/flying-high-LI.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 15:57:42.188599

Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.
Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.
Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.
This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.","After a $29.7 billion real-estate and tourism deal on the North Coast and a $200 million agreement to produce sustainable aviation fuel in the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), Qatar has finalised an agreement to supply Egypt with liquefied natural gas (LNG) during the summer months.

This is the most recent form of cooperation between the two countries after a year in which many important agreements were signed. Qatar announced in 2025 that it would dedicate a $7.5 billion investment package to Egypt, and in late 2025 Qatari investments in Egypt totalled around $3.2 billion across 266 companies.

Recent months have witnessed a noticeable strengthening of economic relations between Egypt and the Gulf states, particularly Qatar, which has begun diversifying its investment destinations across various countries worldwide, Farag Abdallah, an economist and member of the Egyptian Association for Political Economy, told Al-Ahram Weekly.

He noted that the global economy is experiencing imbalances due to rapid political developments, which in turn affect the movement of capital seeking to minimise risks and contribute to reshaping the global investment landscape.

Abdallah explained that escalating concerns resulting from political tensions have pushed investments towards partnerships with governments, a trend reflected in Gulf investments, including Qatari investments in the Al-Alam Al-Roum deal in Egypt.

In December 2025, Egypt received $3.5 billion from Qatari Diar, the real-estate arm of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, as part of an investment agreement for the development and expansion of the Samla and Al-Alam Al-Roum Project on the northwestern coast of Matrouh governorate, with total investments amounting to $29.7 billion.

Of this sum, Egypt received $3.2 billion representing the value of the land last week.

Qatar has recently been moving towards diversifying its investment portfolio, even if returns are lower than oil revenues, in anticipation of potential changes in the global economic system, Abdallah said. This has prompted it to invest in assets and minerals instead of retaining its oil revenues in US and European banks.

Abdallah said that Qatar had injected around $55 billion of investments into Turkey following the earthquake that struck the country a year and a half ago in an example of its trend to invest in assets. He noted that Egypt’s stable political and economic environment makes it well positioned to attract further investments.

Abdallah noted that Egypt offers attractive incentives for foreign investment, from which Qatari investments also benefit, given the Egyptian market’s high profitability rates and lower tax levels compared to Europe and North America.

He highlighted Egypt’s role in establishing the Eastern Mediterranean Gas Forum and transforming it into an intergovernmental organisation headquartered in Cairo, a development that has strengthened Egypt’s position as a gas trading hub and contributed to attracting major deals in gas liquefaction and re-export.

Qatar Energy announced that it will supply Egypt with up to 24 shipments of LNG during the summer of 2026, under an agreement signed between the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and the Qatari company.

The agreement comes as a continuation of the success of bilateral cooperation between the two countries, particularly in the supply of LNG.

Karim Adel, president of the Al-Adl Centre for Economic and Strategic Studies, a think tank, told the Weekly that Egypt has a strong track record in attracting foreign direct investment (FDI), relying on a system of tax exemptions, the availability of advanced basic and technological infrastructure, and efforts to remove obstacles facing the establishment of diverse business activities.

He explained that Egypt has become both a regional and a global hub due to its strength in key sectors, most notably agriculture and energy, supported by its unique geographical location and its role as the main gateway for business and investment in Africa.

Adel said that the recent Qatari investments are the result of important relations and partnerships that strengthen ties between Egypt and Qatar at the political, strategic, economic, commercial, and industrial levels.

He expects the coming period to see the implementation of a number of joint projects between the two sides, particularly in infrastructure development, energy, and transport, alongside the review of opportunities related to infrastructure and technology development.

Egypt and Qatar aim to achieve sustainable development and build a smart environment by focusing on mechanisms to realise sustainability and protect the environment in the light of global environmental challenges, he added.

The contribution of real-estate activities to Egypt’s economy has increased over recent years, reaching around 20 per cent of GDP. This makes real-estate investment, including tourism-related real estate, a store of value for individuals, companies, and states alike, Adel said.

He said that maximising the economic returns from these investments depends on the speed with which agreed-upon real estate, tourism, and hotel projects can be implemented, given their role as a key driver for various economic sectors in Egypt, including transport and logistics, communications and technology, construction, tourism, and housing.",https://english.ahram.org.eg/Media/News/2026/1/11/41_2026-639037467040427814-42.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:57:49.220964

Speaking at the Vibrant Gujarat Regional Conference in Rajkot on Sunday (January 11), Ambani told the conference about Reliance’s plans to spread the investment amount across 5 key commitments that have been listed as follows.

Investment and employment creation

Ambani hailed Reliance as the biggest private investor in Gujarat, having invested over ₹3.5 lakh crore in the state over the past five years. Ambani laid out employment creation as the company’s first commitment to the state through its ongoing and upcoming projects.

“We will double our precious investment of ₹3.5 lakh crore to ₹7 lakh crore over the next five years. This will create exponential employment, livelihoods, and prosperity for every Gujarati and every Indian,” he said at the conference. “For Reliance, Gujarat is our body, heart, and soul. We are a Gujarati company,” he added.

Global leadership in green energy

As a part of Reliance’s second commitment to the state, Ambani intends to establish Indian leadership in clean energy and green materials with Gujarat’s Jamnagar at the heart of his plans.

At Jamnagar, Reliance is building the world’s largest integrated clean energy ecosystem which includes manufacturing of solar power, battery energy storage, green hydrogen, green fertilisers, sustainable aviation fuel, maritime fuels, and advanced materials.

“Jamnagar, once the world’s largest exporter of hydrocarbon fuels, will in the coming years become India’s largest exporter of green energy and green materials,” Ambani proclaimed at the event.

Powering India’s growth story

Promising to produce a large amount of electric energy, Ambani said that Reliance’s multi-gigawatt, utility-scale solar project, among the largest in the world, will deliver round-the-clock clean power through advanced storage and modern grid integration aimed at powering India’s growth story.

Artificial intelligence

The fourth commitment is to make Gujarat India’s artificial intelligence pioneer. Speaking at the conference that was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Ambani said Jio is building India’s largest AI-ready data centre in Jamnagar with the goal of making AI affordable and accessible to every Indian.

“Jio will launch India’s first people-centric AI platform, built in India for India and the world. It will enable every citizen, starting from Gujarat, to access AI services in their own language, on their own devices, every day, making them more efficient and productive,” he declared.

Preparing for 2036 Olympics

Reliance’s fifth commitment engages the company in a partnership with the Gujarat government’s Olympic ambitions and social initiatives. At the conference, Ambani said the Reliance Foundation fully supports the Prime Minister’s vision of bringing the 2036 Olympic Games to Ahmedabad.

“As part of this effort, Reliance will partner with the Gujarat government to manage the Veer Savarkar Multisports Complex in Naranpura, which will serve as a hub for national and international sporting events and for training future champions,” he said.

Ambani also announced the establishment of a world-class hospital in Jamnagar in the Saurashtra region and the expansion of Reliance’s educational institutions. “The development of Gujarat is central to everything we do,” he added.

Towards the end of his address, Ambani noted the recent changes in the world’s geopolitical order and said that India remained resilient. “The world is changing rapidly and geopolitical developments are creating new challenges and uncertainties.

This appointment marks a key moment in the global push for decarbonisation, with Griffiths bringing his vast industry experience to lead the effort to scale SAF adoption worldwide.

Paul Griffiths at the Forefront of SAF Adoption

As the aviation sector continues to face increasing pressure to tackle its climate impact, SAF is recognised as one of the most viable near-term solutions to reduce flight emissions. SAF has the potential to cut emissions by up to 80%, offering a clear pathway for the aviation industry to meet its ambitious net-zero goals. However, despite its potential, SAF currently accounts for less than 1% of the global jet fuel supply. This gap underscores the need for concerted action to accelerate its production and adoption, which Griffiths will now champion through the SMI’s SAF Pathfinder Initiative.

The SAF Pathfinder Initiative, which Griffiths now leads, unites key stakeholders from across the aviation, energy, finance and policy sectors. Its primary focus is on mobilising investment, driving demand and advocating for harmonised global policies that support the production and adoption of SAF. Additionally, the initiative aims to facilitate the necessary infrastructure upgrades and foster collaboration across the supply chain to overcome the production and cost barriers that have hindered SAF’s widespread use.

Dubai Airports’ Proven Commitment to Sustainability

Paul Griffiths’ leadership in this initiative is backed by his strong track record in sustainability. Under his guidance, Dubai Airports has already made significant strides in reducing its environmental impact. The airport operator has achieved Level 4 “Transformation” accreditation from Airports Council International (ACI), a distinction that places Dubai Airports among the top 5% of airports globally for its sustainability efforts. This recognition highlights the effectiveness of Griffiths’ leadership in promoting sustainability and fostering collaborations with partners.

Dubai Airports has also been at the forefront of several initiatives to reduce emissions, including the implementation of biodiesel-powered ground fleets and the development of green infrastructure projects at both Dubai International (DXB) and Dubai World Central – Al Maktoum International (DWC). These initiatives align with the broader goals of the SAF Pathfinder Initiative, reinforcing Griffiths’ commitment to driving decarbonisation within the aviation sector.

Accelerating Global SAF Adoption

With the aviation industry’s 2050 net-zero target approaching, the need to scale up SAF production and usage has never been more urgent. Griffiths, alongside the SMI, is focused on creating the necessary conditions for SAF to play a central role in decarbonising aviation. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative will seek to unlock investment, overcome regulatory barriers and build a strong global network of stakeholders committed to SAF adoption.

Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, CEO of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, emphasised the importance of SAF as a catalyst for decarbonisation not only within aviation but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investments. With Griffiths’ proven leadership in the sustainability space, the SMI is poised to make significant strides in accelerating SAF adoption and driving the industry closer to a sustainable future.

As the global aviation sector looks ahead, the appointment of Paul Griffiths to lead the SAF Pathfinder Initiative signals a renewed commitment to sustainable aviation practices. Under his guidance, SAF is set to become a cornerstone of the aviation industry’s journey toward a low-carbon future, contributing to the global fight against climate change while helping to ensure the continued growth and success of the aviation sector.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Sustainable-Aviation.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:00.328929

Additionally, the airport achieved ‘Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA)’ Level 1 from Airports Council International, marking an important milestone in its structured approach to monitoring and reducing carbon emissions.

In line with its commitment to advancing workforce localization and developing national capabilities, Red Sea International Airport increased the proportion of Saudi talent this year to 70% of its total workforce. This milestone reflects the airport’s dedication to investing in human capital and empowering local professionals.

This year has also been a defining moment in its journey toward building a workforce that is not only strong but truly diverse. Receiving the Global Women Empowerment Award stands as a powerful testament to its unwavering commitment to championing equality and opening doors for women to thrive in aviation. In this sector, their voices and leadership are shaping the future.

Reflecting on the year’s achievements, Andrew Tyler‑Smith, Chief Executive Officer of Red Sea International Airport, said: “This has been a year dedicated to building solid foundations. Our focus has been on responsible organizational growth, investing in our people, the nation and embedding safety and sustainability at the center of everything we do. These milestones demonstrate the direction we are heading as we prepare for the next phase of expansion.”

This year’s achievements also build on Red Sea International Airport’s pioneering milestones. After becoming the first airport in Saudi Arabia to supply Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the airport expanded its impact this year by supporting two airlines with SAF-powered operations, further reinforcing its leadership in advancing aviation decarbonization and guiding the industry toward lower‑emission travel.

In terms of air service development, Red Sea International Airport currently operates 20 weekly flights. It aims to expand to 60 weekly flights by 2030, in line with projected demand growth and regional connectivity goals.

As Red Sea International Airport moves into the new year, it remains committed to strengthening its operational foundations, enhancing connectivity, and advancing sustainability initiatives that support Saudi Vision 2030 and the Kingdom’s evolving aviation landscape.

Under the partnership, NCC Bank will reduce emissions linked to its shipments by 30 per cent by using the GoGreen Plus service, which targets Scope 3 emissions.
The service uses an “insetting” approach that allows DHL to replace fossil fuels with Sustainable Aviation Fuel across its global network.
Md Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said: “We are thrilled to welcome NCC Bank to our GoGreen Plus initiative.

Under the partnership, NCC Bank will reduce emissions linked to its shipments by 30 per cent by using the GoGreen Plus service, which targets Scope 3 emissions. These are indirect emissions generated across a company’s value chain, including transportation and distribution.

The service uses an “insetting” approach that allows DHL to replace fossil fuels with Sustainable Aviation Fuel across its global network. Through a book-and-claim system, the resulting environmental benefits are allocated to customers investing in the solution, even if their individual shipments are not physically transported using aircraft powered by sustainable fuel.

GoGreen Plus is currently the only solution in the global express logistics sector that enables customers to use Sustainable Aviation Fuel to reduce emissions associated with their shipments.

Md Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said:

“We are thrilled to welcome NCC Bank to our GoGreen Plus initiative. By adopting sustainable aviation fuel, NCC Bank is taking a meaningful step toward reducing the environmental footprint of its shipments. Together, we can accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel across the air transport industry.”

DHL Express launched the GoGreen Plus service in 2023 to help customers reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from air freight through the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel. The initiative is supported by long-term supply agreements with BP, Neste, Cosmo Energy and the Cathay Group.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel is produced from alternative raw materials such as used cooking oil, waste and hydrogen, which have a lower-emission energy profile compared with conventional jet fuel derived from mineral oil.

The GoGreen Plus service supports DHL Group’s commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with a focus on decarbonising air transportation, which accounts for the largest share of the group’s carbon footprint.",https://www.thedailystar.net/sites/default/files/styles/social_share/public/2026-01/dhl.jpeg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:49.362856

Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience.
Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.","Moving from fossil assets to green assets will bring local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi.

Hawai‘i is the most petroleum-dependent state in the nation. We rely on oil for about 65% of our electricity and spend billions of dollars annually on it.

This dependence has resulted in high electricity and transportation costs and exposure to supply and price volatility. This vulnerability underscores why clean energy should be framed as a fight for energy independence. Emissions do matter, but the way to speed up the transition is to focus on economic outcomes: lower, more stable energy costs and local ownership of our energy assets.

Political scientist Jessica Green argues that climate politics is really a competition with trillions of dollars at stake. Fossil fuel asset owners are incentivized to delay the transition to protect their investments. Vulnerable asset owners face the consequences of climate change, e.g., property losses and higher insurance costs. Green asset owners are stakeholders whose assets gain value as the transition accelerates. We must consider these dynamics to accelerate progress.

Hawaiʻi already has many green asset owners. We have thousands of households with rooftop solar benefiting from reduced energy costs, owners of over 40,000 EVs on our roads converting gas to local electricity spending, and electric grids with 36% to 50% renewable energy. Importantly, electricians, installers, auditors, mechanics, engineers, and operators are also asset owners.

Our main fossil asset owner is Par Pacific, through its refinery and fuel distribution network. But it is already evolving, with part of the Kapolei refinery being converted to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel for Hawaiian and Alaska Airlines in 2026. This is what a practical transition looks like and an example of how fossil fuel assets can be repurposed while protecting our workforce and economic capacity and increasing energy independence.

Clearly, much more must be done to achieve our energy future. Several solutions focused on transforming our fossil assets to locally owned renewable energy assets will expedite our energy independence and resilience. Each solution must perform its specific job well, prevent undesired consequences, and work with others so that the transition becomes self-reinforcing.

Here are a few priorities for our government and business leaders to consider in 2026:

Priority 1: Standardize and streamline permitting and modernize interconnection. This will speed up deployment of common projects (e.g., rooftop solar, EV chargers, batteries), prevent yearslong project delays for large grid-scale projects, and enable innovation in clean, firm power.

Priority 2: Scale green loans, rebates, and tax credits for energy efficiency, renewable energy, and clean transportation. Incentivize the transition with close attention to our low- and moderate-income households and small businesses.

Priority 3: Accelerate fleet electrification by deploying EV charging infrastructure and basing procurement on total cost of ownership, not just purchase price. This will ensure that our transportation goals are met and build general momentum for the transformation of our ground transportation system.

Priority 4: Fund workforce development programs to avoid worker capacity bottlenecks in clean tech, create career opportunities for our youth, and build economic resilience.

Priority 5: Create a carbon dividend program using our barrel tax. This would direct revenue to households, with additional support to those most exposed to energy price increases. This would protect households, provide businesses with certainty, and encourage investment in energy efficiency and clean transportation.

Priority 6: Publish a quarterly scorecard (with state, county, and utility inputs) to track progress on relevant metrics, e.g., rebate utilization, permit processing times, interconnection queue metrics, fleet and charger deployment, and household energy and fuel cost index.

Many of these changes can leverage federal grants, bonds and service-based delivery arrangements that don’t require upfront capital. Households and businesses can use PACE financing, solar leases, and community solar to convert capital expenditures into monthly energy and transportation costs at or below what they already pay.

We have a choice: the fossil asset corner, which means reliance on energy imports and vulnerability. Or we can move into the green asset corner, which means local energy production and local wealth creation, affordable energy, lower carbon pollution, and a self-sustaining, resilient Hawaiʻi. The choice is clear.",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2022/02/25135544/east-maui-windmills-renewable-energy.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 10:58:06.095040

“We will double this investment to ₹7 lakh crore over the next five years. This will create exponential employment, livelihoods, and prosperity for every Gujarati and every Indian,” he said.

The second commitment, he said, is to establish global leadership in clean energy and green materials. At Jamnagar, Reliance is building the world’s largest integrated clean energy ecosystem, covering solar power, battery energy storage, green hydrogen, green fertilisers, sustainable aviation fuel, maritime fuels, and advanced materials.

“Jamnagar, once the world’s largest exporter of hydrocarbon fuels, will in the coming years become India’s largest exporter of green energy and green materials,” Mr. Ambani said.

He said Reliance’s multi-gigawatt, utility-scale solar project, among the largest in the world, will deliver round-the-clock clean power through advanced storage and modern grid integration, powering India’s growth and reinforcing Gujarat’s leadership in renewable energy.

The fourth commitment is to make Gujarat India’s artificial intelligence pioneer. Mr. Ambani said Jio is building India’s largest AI-ready data centre in Jamnagar with the goal of making AI affordable and accessible to every Indian.

“Jio will launch India’s first people-centric AI platform, built in India for India and the world. It will enable every citizen, starting from Gujarat, to access AI services in their own language, on their own devices, every day, making them more efficient and productive,” he said.

The fifth commitment is partnering with the Gujarat government’s Olympic ambitions and social initiatives. Mr. Ambani said the Reliance Foundation fully supports the Prime Minister’s vision of bringing the 2036 Olympic Games to Ahmedabad.

“As part of this effort, Reliance will partner with the Gujarat government to manage the Veer Savarkar Multisports Complex in Naranpura, which will serve as a hub for national and international sporting events and for training future champions,” he said.

He also announced the establishment of a world-class hospital in Jamnagar in the Saurashtra region and the expansion of Reliance’s educational institutions. “The development of Gujarat is central to everything we do,” he said.

Mr. Ambani further said the world is changing rapidly and geopolitical developments are creating new challenges and uncertainties. However, he said India remains resilient.

“What is reassuring is that these challenges cannot disrupt our nation or its people. India today stands protected by an invincible protective wall called Narendrabhai Modi.”

Gujarat is our foundation, says Karan Adani

Karan Adani, managing director of Adani Ports and SEZ Limited (APSEZ) said that for the Adani Group, Gujarat is not just a State of investment — it is our foundation. “Gujarat is where our journey began, and Gujarat is where our long-term commitment remains anchored.”

“Building on this foundation, the Adani Group commits to invest ₹1.5 lakh crore over the next five years in the region of Kutch. We will complete our Khavda project and commission full 37 Gigawatt of capacity by 2030, and we will also double our port capacity at Mundra in the next ten years’ time,” Mr. Adani said.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/kddi1x/article70497418.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/20251220306L.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 05:57:14.235726

Právě tento stát patří mezi přední producenty medu v Americe. Každoročně vyprodukoval zhruba 18 milionů kilogramů a přinesl včelařům zisk téměř 67 milionů dolarů (1,4 miliardy Kč).

Ráj se ovšem pomalu mění. Přirozené prostředí, na kterém život včel závisí, nahrazují plochy s kukuřicí a sójou. V Severní Dakotě se produkce kukuřice od přelomu století čtyřnásobně zvýšila na 16,5 milionu akrů (6,7 milionu hektarů). „Dříve jsme z jednoho úlu získávali 64 kilogramů medu,“ říká Miller. Jeho včelstvo však slábne, letos získal v průměru 15 kilogramů.

Za razantním úbytkem českého medu stojí i novodobí „bio-chovatelé“, říká včelař

Podle předběžné analýzy organizace Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA) v loňském roce američtí včelaři přišli o více než polovinu svých včelstev. „Naše odhady naznačují, že včelařské provozy v USA ztratily během sezony 2024–25 více včelstev než v kterémkoli jiném roce v historii záznamů,“ uvedla organizace.

Poptávka po biopalivech

Kromě nemocí a používání pesticidů experti označují za problematickou aktuální poptávku po biopalivech. Jejich výroba z kukuřice a sóji totiž vede k přeměně přírodních travnatých ploch na monokultury, což ohrožuje včelí populace a narušuje rovnováhu místních ekosystémů, napsala agentura Bloomberg.

V loňském roce vzrostla americká výrobní kapacita biopaliv z 5 000 na 30 000 barelů denně. Spotřeba biopaliv, včetně těch leteckých, se pravděpodobně bude zvyšovat, a to kvůli rostoucí poptávce po letecké dopravě, poklesu používání tradičních fosilních paliv a také politickým iniciativám a regulacím.

Udržitelné létání je chiméra. Alternativy paliv klimatu nepomohou, říká studie

Jednou z nich je iniciativa Joe Bidena z roku 2021, která měla za cíl podpořit výrobu udržitelných leteckých paliv (SAF) ve Spojených státech a která nabídla producentům biopaliv daňové úlevy na podporu produkce.

Podle analýzy vědeckého pracovníka Bradena Limba z Colorado State University je pro splnění cílů SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) do roku 2050 potřeba o 50 procent více orné půdy pro kukuřici a sóju.

„Maximální množství půdy, které jsme v jednom roce přeměnili na ornou půdu, což je přibližně 0,73 hektarů, by muselo být zčtyřnásobeno každý rok po dobu příštích 30 let,“ řekl Limb. Podle něj sója a kukuřice nejsou optimálním řešením. Limb doporučuje zaměřit se na jiné plodiny, jako je čirok nebo ozdobnice.

Letecké společnosti zkoumají různé možnosti ke snížení emisí, včetně SAF. Průmysl se zavázal k používání biopaliv a Mezinárodní organizace pro civilní letectví (ICL) přijala ambiciózní cíl dosáhnout nulových čistých emisí uhlíku do roku 2050, což by vyžadovalo značné vstupy biopaliv.

Známe recept na snížení emisí. Létejte pomaleji, radí univerzitní studie

„Obávám se, že k udržitelným leteckým palivům nepřipojíme environmentální etiku. Pokud bychom správně připojili environmentální měřítka a výsledky k platbám za daňové úlevy, mohli bychom pohnout věcí na podporu zemědělců při přijetí praktik, které zvýší rozmanitost krajiny,“ zmínila Katrina Klettová, doktorandka na minnesotské univerzitě, která studuje změny ve využívání půdy a zdraví včel medonosných.

Někteří odborníci nicméně upozorňují, že produkce udržitelných leteckých paliv může být příliš drahá.

The aviation industry is in the middle of an uncomfortable transition. Airlines need more efficient engines to survive brutal fuel costs and carbon regulations, while passengers still expect cheap tickets and on-time flights. Engine OEMs sit squarely in the crosshairs of this tension. MTU Aero Engines has quietly positioned itself as one of the most important enablers of this new era: a specialist in high-efficiency engine modules, lifecycle services, and next-generation propulsion research that airlines and airframers increasingly cannot ignore.

Unlike headline-grabbing aircraft manufacturers, MTU Aero Engines focuses on what really keeps jets in the air: high-pressure compressors, low-pressure turbines, turbine center frames, and the complex maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO) ecosystem around them. Its technology is inside some of the most widely used engines on the planet, particularly in the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan (GTF) family. As the aviation sector scrambles to cut emissions while ramping back to—and beyond—pre-pandemic traffic levels, MTU Aero Engines has become a leverage point for efficiency, reliability, and sustainability.

Inside the Flagship: MTU Aero Engines

MTU Aero Engines is not a single consumer-facing product but an integrated portfolio of propulsion technologies and services that underpin modern fleets. Its core proposition: design and manufacture mission-critical modules for commercial and military engines, then stay embedded throughout the lifecycle with high-value MRO offerings and digital services. That combination of hardware and recurring-services revenue is what makes MTU Aero Engines strategically important—and hard to dislodge.

On the hardware side, MTU Aero Engines has three standout pillars:

1. Geared Turbofan Leadership

MTU is a key partner in Pratt & Whitneys PW1000G geared turbofan family, used on aircraft like the Airbus A320neo, A220, and Embraer E-Jets E2. In this program, MTU Aero Engines is responsible for major components including the high-speed low-pressure turbine and parts of the high-pressure compressor, as well as being a risk- and revenue-sharing partner.

The GTF architecture uses a reduction gearbox between the fan and the low-pressure turbine. This allows each section to spin at its optimal speed, delivering:

Double-digit reductions in fuel burn compared with previous-generation engines.

Significantly lower noise footprints, crucial for airport community acceptance.

Substantial CO2 and NOx emissions reductions.

MTU Aero Engines engineering and manufacturing capabilities are woven into the most efficiency-critical parts of this system. When airlines choose GTF-powered aircraft for better economics and environmental performance, MTU Aero Engines indirectly wins.

2. High-Pressure Compressors and Turbines

Across multiple engine families from partners like Pratt & Whitney, General Electric, and Rolls-Royce, MTU Aero Engines contributes high-pressure compressor (HPC) and turbine modules. These components operate at extreme temperatures and pressures, and incremental gains in efficiency directly translate into lower fuel burn.

Key technical areas where MTU Aero Engines differentiates:

Advanced materials and cooling to withstand rising turbine inlet temperatures as OEMs chase better thermodynamic efficiency.

Aerodynamic optimization of compressor stages using high-fidelity simulations and digital twin concepts.

Lightweight design balancing durability and lifecycle cost with weight savings that airlines can monetize on every flight.

3. Military Propulsion and European Sovereignty

On the defense side, MTU Aero Engines is a significant player in European engine programs, including roles in the Eurofighter Typhoon and future fighter systems. This provides not just revenue diversification but also positions the company as a key asset in Europes push for technological sovereignty in defense and aerospace.

Lifecycle and MRO as a Strategic Product

In aviation, the engine is sold once but serviced for decades. MTU Aero Engines MRO network is effectively a product of its own: a bundled offering of overhaul, repair, parts management, and data-driven optimization for airlines and lessors.

Highlights include:

Global MRO footprint for narrowbody and regional jet engines, including GTF, V2500, CF34, and others.

Predictive maintenance based on engine health monitoring, using sensor data and analytics to reduce unplanned downtime.

Customized service packages that let airlines pay per flight hour, shifting capex to opex and reducing financial risk.

In a market where reliability issues and groundings can devastate airline schedules and P&L, this lifecycle capability is a core part of MTU Aero Engines value proposition.

Betting on Sustainable Aviation

Crucially, MTU Aero Engines is not just optimizing todays kerosene-based engines. The company is investing in:

SAF compatibility and combustion technologies that work with sustainable aviation fuel blends.

Water-Enhanced Turbofan (WET) concepts, aimed at further cutting fuel burn and emissions by recovering waste heat and using water injection.

Hydrogen-ready and hybrid-electrical studies in cooperation with European partners, exploring how future engines can radically reduce climate impact.

This pipeline matters because airlines and regulators are signaling that incremental efficiency gains wont be enough in the 2030s and 2040s. MTU Aero Engines long-game here is to stay indispensable as propulsion architectures evolve.

Market Rivals: MTU Aktie vs. The Competition

MTU Aero Engines operates in a tightly held club. In commercial and military jet engines, a handful of giants dominate: General Electric, Rolls-Royce, and Pratt & Whitney (Raytheon Technologies) are the best-known names. But MTU has carved out a role as a specialized partner and module supplier that competes and cooperates with these players simultaneously.

Compared directly to General Electrics LEAP program (through CFM International, the joint venture of GE Aerospace and Safran), MTU Aero Engines takes a different stance in the value chain. LEAP is a full engine family powering aircraft like the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX. GE-Safran fully control the engine product, brand, and aftermarket.

By contrast, MTU Aero Engines participates as a major risk- and revenue-sharing partner in the Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-JM and related PW1000G variants rather than owning a standalone engine franchise. The trade-off:

Lower program control than GE over the entire engine.

Lower capital intensity and more diversified exposure across different platforms and OEM partners.

Strong MRO leverage thanks to its module expertise and joint ventures.

On the narrowbody workhorse battlefield, LEAP and the PW1000G family are direct rivals. Engine selection campaigns at Airbus and Boeing become indirect competitive arenas for MTU Aero Engines versus CFM, even if MTU logos are not on the nacelles.

Compared directly to Rolls-Royce Trent engines such as the Trent XWB

Rolls-Royce plays heavily in the widebody segment with its Trent family. The Trent XWB powers the Airbus A350 and has built a strong reputation for efficiency on long-haul routes. Rolls-Royce, however, is more concentrated in widebodies and has faced well-documented earnings volatility due to that segments cyclical nature and pandemic exposure.

MTU Aero Engines exposure is more balanced, with a stronger tilt towards narrowbodies and regional jets—segments that typically recover faster and offer higher frequency usage, which in turn means more predictable MRO revenues. The company also cooperates with Rolls-Royce on some military and industrial programs, again illustrating its hybrid role as both collaborator and competitor in different niches.

Safran and the European industrial ecosystem

Safran, via CFM International, is another direct competitor in the module and MRO space. Compared to Safran, MTU Aero Engines is smaller but more focused. Safran stretches across landing gear, interiors, avionics, and more, while MTU doubles down on propulsion and services.

This specialization lets MTU Aero Engines invest deeply in compressor and turbine technology without diluting R&D over too many product lines. In an era of stricter emissions targets and complex new materials, such focus is strategically valuable.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

MTU Aero Engines doesnt dominate headlines—but it punches above its weight by being in the right places of the propulsion stack.

1. Technology where it really counts

The companys strengths in high-pressure compressors, turbines, and low-pressure turbine modules give it leverage over the single biggest cost line for airlines: fuel. Every fractional percentage of efficiency MTU Aero Engines squeezes out of those stages translates into tangible savings and lower emissions. While full-engine OEMs grab the marketing glory, MTU sits in the value-dense heart of the machine.

2. Risk-sharing rather than winner-takes-all bets

Instead of betting the entire company on one engine family, MTU Aero Engines spreads its exposure as a partner on multiple platforms. That diversification has strategic benefits:

Resilience if one engine type faces technical or regulatory setbacks.

Access to long-term service revenues across different fleets and regions.

Stable relationships with multiple global OEMs instead of dependence on a single prime contractor.

3. Recurring revenue through MRO and digital services

Aircraft engines are one of the most service-intensive components in aviation. MTU Aero Engines MRO infrastructure is a structural advantage: it locks in customers for decades, creates data flywheels (more engines serviced equals better insight into wear patterns and failure modes), and supports incremental product improvements without waiting for full engine redesigns.

As airlines adopt power-by-the-hour models and seek predictable maintenance cost envelopes, MTU Aero Engines ability to bundle hardware, services, and analytics becomes a core differentiator.

4. Future-ready innovation in sustainable propulsion

Aviations climate problem wont be solved by tweaking existing engines alone. MTU Aero Engines work on Water-Enhanced Turbofans, SAF-ready combustion, hydrogen studies, and hybrid-electric concepts positions it not just as a participant in the current generation of engines, but as an enabler of what comes next.

Compared to more diversified conglomerates, the company can aim its R&D laser directly at propulsion, rather than competing internally for capital against non-aviation divisions.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

MTU Aktie (ISIN DE000A0D9PT0) is effectively a liquid proxy on the future of high-efficiency commercial and military propulsion, plus the aviation aftermarket. As of the latest market data available from multiple financial sources, MTU Aero Engines share price reflects a combination of cyclical aviation demand, program-specific headlines (notably around the Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan), and long-term bets on sustainable propulsion.

Stock snapshot and performance context

Using real-time data from at least two major financial platforms, the most recent trading information shows MTU Aktie around its current market level with the quoted price and performance based on the last available trading session. Where markets are closed, investors rely on the last close price as the reference point. That price bakes in:

Short-term sentiment around engine reliability issues on specific fleets and how those impact MTUs MRO volumes and warranty exposure.

Medium-term expectations for narrowbody and regional jet recovery, where MTU Aero Engines has strong positioning.

Long-term optimism about the companys role in GTF evolutions, European defense programs, and next-generation sustainable propulsion.

How the product portfolio feeds into valuation

From an investor lens, MTU Aero Engines product and technology footprint translates into several key drivers for MTU Aktie:

Embeddedness in key fleets – participation in major narrowbody platforms via GTF and legacy programs provides a long runway of flight hours and, therefore, service revenue.

MRO as a stabilizer – even during downturns, engines must be maintained. That makes the aftermarket a partial hedge against new-build volatility.

Upside from sustainability – if regulators tighten emissions rules faster than expected, demand for more efficient engines and upgrades accelerates. MTU Aero Engines stands to benefit from that pressure rather than be harmed by it.

Defense diversification – military engine and service programs provide counter-cyclical ballast, smoothing the earnings profile that underpins MTU Aktie.

In other words, when investors buy MTU Aktie, they are not just buying a German industrial name; they are buying into a specific thesis: that propulsion will remain the choke point of aviation efficiency and that MTU Aero Engines will stay at the center of that bottleneck, monetizing both incremental improvements and disruptive shifts.

The bottom line

MTU Aero Engines is not the flashiest brand in aviation, but it is one of the most strategically placed. Its mix of high-value engine modules, deep MRO infrastructure, and credible R&D roadmap for sustainable propulsion gives it a competitive edge against more vertically integrated giants. For airlines, that translates into better fuel economics and lifecycle reliability. For investors in MTU Aktie, it represents a focused, technology-driven way to participate in the next chapters of global aviation.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405041_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 01:57:37.922582

Rising electricity demand, climate imperatives, and shifting global energy markets are converging at a moment when decisions taken today will shape our economic resilience, competitiveness, and energy security for decades to come.

For a country that depends on imported fuels for close to 90 per cent of its energy needs, the global energy landscape is not an abstract concern — it is felt directly in electricity bills, transportation costs, food prices, and the overall cost of living. The challenge therefore is clear: How do we secure reliable, affordable energy today while building a cleaner more sustainable system for tomorrow?

Emerging from a year marked by price volatility, geopolitical shocks, and seismic swings in global market sentiment, Jamaica’s oil and gas sector enters 2026 with cautious optimism, aided by growing confidence in emerging energy-source options and the continued rise in electricity demand.

Internationally, the oil and gas market remains volatile. Geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, and shifting trade policies continue to inject uncertainty into price forecasts. While analysts expect only modest demand growth in 2026, supply dynamics and geopolitical risks mean that price stability is far from guaranteed.

For Jamaica, this volatility matters. Our energy security is tightly linked to global markets, and we are therefore exposed to shocks beyond our control. As the country’s primary petroleum supplier, Petrojam carries a national responsibility to ensure reliable fuel supply, even in turbulent global conditions. At the same time, we are accelerating efforts to reduce carbon intensity and support the country’s long-term transition to cleaner energy.

ENERGY SOLUTIONS TO WATCH IN 2026

Renewable energy is poised to continue its growth as one of the world’s fast-growing energy sources, and Jamaica is firmly aligned with this trend. Solar and wind already play an important role in our electricity mix and further expansion is expected.

Petrojam is pursuing multiple initiatives to increase the share of renewables in the energy mix aligned to the country’s move towards cleaner, more sustainable energy. Petrojam is also playing an enabling role in facilitating the adoption and blending of low-carbon fuels, and helping to create the necessary infrastructure and regulatory alignment to accelerate this transition to cleaner energy.

While not a renewable, liquefied natural gas (LNG) is emerging as a critical transition fuel for Jamaica. It offers lower emissions than heavy fuel oil and diesel, greater price stability, and strong potential for use across electricity generation, manufacturing, and public transportation.

Petrojam is positioning itself to play a key role in LNG supply and distribution, supporting the shift of power generation and industrial users to cleaner fuels. LNG will be a key bridge between today’s petroleum-based system and tomorrow’s low-carbon energy future.

Advanced biofuels derived from sustainable biomass, agricultural residues, and solid waste are also gaining traction globally. These fuels offer real potential to reduce emissions in hard-to-abate sectors.

Of note is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can significantly lower the carbon footprint of air travel. As a major tourism destination and aviation hub, Jamaica stands to benefit strategically from early engagement in SAF development. Renewable diesel and green methanol for marine transport are also emerging opportunities as the shipping sector moves toward decarbonisation.

EMERGING FRONTIERS: NUCLEAR AND HYDROGEN

Globally, there is renewed interest in nuclear energy, particularly as a reliable, carbon-free base load power source for energy-intensive activities such as data centres supporting artificial intelligence and cloud computing. Advances in small modular reactors (SMRs) are making nuclear more accessible to smaller economies.

In Jamaica, nuclear energy remains at the exploratory stage. Petrojam has been invited to be a part of the International Centre for Environmental and Nuclear Sciences (ICENS) Working Group, which is examining the potential role of nuclear in a low-carbon energy future, including its application in electricity generation and pink hydrogen production (hydrogen generated from the electrolysis of water using nuclear energy).

Nuclear energy offers low operating costs and high reliability once online, delivering large volumes of carbon-free electricity at stable and predictable prices. By reducing exposure to fuel price volatility it has the potential to support economic development and help level the playing field between high- and low-income countries.

Meaningful consideration of nuclear must be balanced and aligned with safety standards, regulatory readiness, waste management, and public acceptance. The objective at this stage is knowledge preparedness and informed national dialogue.

ENERGY SUBSTITUTION: A GRADUAL REALITY

While the global conversation often suggests rapid substitution away from fossil fuels, the reality for small, developing economies is more complex. Infrastructure constraints, financing requirements, and the need for system reliability mean that energy transition must be carefully managed.

For Jamaica, the path forward is not abrupt replacement but strategic diversification — layering renewables, LNG, and emerging fuels alongside existing petroleum supply to ensure reliability, affordability, and resilience.

Environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance is no longer optional; it is increasingly a prerequisite for attracting capital, maintaining regulatory credibility, and building public trust.

In 2026 Petrojam will be further strengthening its ESG framework, with particular focus on reducing our carbon footprint, enhancing transparency, and improving governance systems. As Jamaica explores offshore oil potential, a strong ESG foundation will be essential to guide responsible development, environmental protection, and stakeholder confidence.

JAMAICA’S REGIONAL ROLE

Beyond domestic supply, Petrojam continues to support regional energy resilience through trade. By refining and supplying high-quality fuels to Caricom member states, we contribute to economic stability and regional integration. 2026 presents an opportunity to further define Jamaica’s role as a regional energy hub- leveraging our infrastructure, logistics capability, and strategic location to support neighbouring economies.

Jamaica’s energy future will be determined not only by technology choices, but by the value we deliver, the depth of our sustainability efforts, and the speed at which we adapt. The energy transition is not just an environmental imperative — it is an economic strategy, a competitiveness issue, and a national resilience priority.

Petrojam stands at the centre of this transition, repositioning to become Jamaica’s multi-energy innovator supporting renewables, advancing LNG, enabling biofuels and SAF, and preparing for emerging technologies. By acting early, building digital and operational resilience, forging strategic alliances, and staying ahead of global energy trends, Jamaica can secure a future that is cleaner, more affordable, and more resilient.

The decisions we take in 2026 will shape our energy security for a generation. If we get them right, Jamaica will not only meet its energy needs but will lead in building a modern, sustainable energy system for the Caribbean.",https://www.jamaicaobserver.com/jamaicaobserver/news/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2026/01/image_1-193-1024x576.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 00:56:37.048948

As the world acknowledges that reducing emissions alone will not solve climate change, carbon capture has become essential infrastructure for a sustainable future. These ten startups represent the cutting edge of technologies designed to either prevent industrial emissions from reaching the atmosphere or remove carbon dioxide that is already there.

Understanding carbon capture requires recognizing it encompasses multiple approaches. Point-source capture attaches to industrial facilities like cement plants or steel mills where emissions are concentrated. Direct air capture extracts carbon dioxide from ambient air where it exists at just over four hundred parts per million. Other methods accelerate natural mineralization processes or use biological systems to sequester carbon. Each approach has distinct advantages regarding cost, energy requirements, storage permanence, and scalability.

1. Climeworks: Direct Air Capture Pioneer

Climeworks has become synonymous with direct air capture technology, operating the world’s largest facilities for removing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere. The Swiss company’s technology uses large fans to draw air through filters containing materials that selectively bind with carbon dioxide molecules. Once saturated, the system heats these filters to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage or utilization.

The company’s Orca and Mammoth facilities in Iceland, developed in partnership with Carbfix, represent the state of the art in permanent carbon removal. They capture carbon dioxide from the air and inject it deep underground into basalt rock formations where it mineralizes into solid carbonate within a few years. This permanence addresses a critical challenge in carbon removal by ensuring captured carbon cannot leak back into the atmosphere.

Climeworks has attracted major corporate customers including Microsoft, Stripe, and Shopify who purchase carbon removal credits. While costs remain high, the company has demonstrated a clear pathway for price reductions as production scales, similar to how solar panel costs declined dramatically over decades of manufacturing improvements.

2.Carbon Engineering: Synthetic Fuels from Air

Carbon Engineering pursues direct air capture with a focus on creating useful products rather than just storing carbon underground. The Canadian company, backed by investors including Bill Gates and Occidental Petroleum, captures atmospheric carbon dioxide and combines it with hydrogen to create synthetic liquid fuels suitable for vehicles and aircraft.

This approach addresses aviation’s unique challenge. Unlike automobiles that can transition to batteries, aircraft require energy-dense liquid fuels for long-distance flight. Carbon Engineering’s fuels are essentially carbon-neutral because emissions from burning them equal the carbon captured from air to make them, creating a closed loop rather than adding new atmospheric carbon.

The company’s first commercial-scale facility in Texas aims to demonstrate that synthetic fuels can compete economically with conventional petroleum. This project represents a crucial test of whether direct air capture can move beyond niche applications into mainstream energy markets.

3. Carbfix: Permanent Mineralization Storage

Carbfix accelerates a natural geological process that ordinarily takes thousands of years. The Icelandic company injects carbon dioxide dissolved in water deep underground into basalt rock formations where it reacts with minerals to form stable carbonates. Essentially, they convert gaseous pollution into permanent stone.

The elegance of this approach lies in its security. Once mineralized, carbon cannot leak back regardless of surface conditions, unlike storage in porous reservoirs where gas might escape through geological faults. The transformation is chemical and permanent, requiring extreme heat to reverse.

While Carbfix benefits from Iceland’s unique geology and abundant geothermal energy, the company works to demonstrate that similar basalt formations exist worldwide. Partnerships with Climeworks and industrial emitters showcase the technology’s versatility for both air-captured and point-source carbon.

4. Charm Industrial: Agricultural Waste to Carbon Storage

Charm Industrial recognized that agricultural waste represents carbon recently pulled from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Rather than letting crop residues decompose and release this carbon, Charm converts them into stable bio-oil through pyrolysis, then permanently stores this liquid underground.

The company collects agricultural residues like corn stalks and forest thinnings, heats them in low-oxygen environments, and produces carbon-rich bio-oil suitable for geological storage. This approach addresses multiple challenges simultaneously by providing waste management solutions for farmers while creating carbon removal revenue streams.

Charm’s distributed model uses mobile pyrolysis units transported to biomass sources, avoiding expensive centralized infrastructure and transportation emissions. The company has delivered carbon removal credits to corporate buyers and continues expanding across agricultural regions.

5. LanzaTech: Microbes Transform Industrial Emissions

LanzaTech developed a biological carbon capture approach using engineered microorganisms that consume carbon-rich industrial waste gases and convert them into valuable chemicals and fuels. The process resembles industrial-scale fermentation where specialized bacteria metabolize carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide from steel mills or chemical plants.

The company captures gases that would otherwise be flared or vented, flowing them through bioreactors containing proprietary bacteria that produce ethanol and other chemicals. This ethanol becomes fuel or building blocks for plastics, cosmetics, and textiles. Major brands including Zara and Lululemon have incorporated LanzaTech materials into their products.

With commercial facilities operating across China, India, and Belgium, LanzaTech has proven that captured industrial carbon can genuinely compete with virgin fossil resources in global supply chains while generating economic value beyond environmental benefits.

6. Heirloom Carbon: Enhanced Mineral Weathering

Heirloom Carbon Technologies accelerates mineral weathering, a natural process where rocks absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide over geological timescales. The company speeds this from thousands of years to days using engineered limestone materials optimized for carbon uptake.

The process crushes limestone into fine powder spread across trays exposed to air. High surface area enables rapid carbon dioxide absorption. Once saturated, Heirloom heats the material using renewable energy to release concentrated carbon dioxide for storage while regenerating the limestone for reuse.

By working with abundant, well-understood materials already produced at massive scales for construction and agriculture, Heirloom taps into existing supply chains rather than building entirely new industrial ecosystems. The company has demonstrated its technology in California and attracted significant climate investment.

7. Verdox: Electrochemical Carbon Capture

Emerging from Massachusetts Institute of Technology research, Verdox developed an electrochemical approach that dramatically reduces energy requirements compared to conventional thermal processes. Instead of using heat to release captured carbon dioxide, the technology uses electricity to switch specialized materials between carbon-absorbing and carbon-releasing states.

The company’s capture cells contain electrode materials that bind carbon dioxide when voltage flows in one direction and release it when reversed. This electrochemical swing requires significantly less energy than heating materials to high temperatures and runs on renewable electricity rather than requiring heat sources.

Verdox targets industrial facilities with concentrated carbon dioxide streams in exhaust gases, focusing initially on cement plants, steel mills, and other heavy industrial sources difficult to decarbonize through other means. The company has raised substantial funding and works toward commercial-scale demonstration projects.

8. CarbonCure Technologies: Carbon-Storing Concrete

CarbonCure developed an elegantly simple approach by injecting carbon dioxide into concrete during mixing. The carbon reacts with calcium in cement to form calcium carbonate minerals that permanently embed in the concrete while improving compressive strength.

This addresses a crucial challenge since concrete production generates roughly eight percent of global emissions yet remains essential for construction. CarbonCure enables concrete producers to reduce cement content while simultaneously storing captured carbon dioxide. The mineralized carbon becomes part of building structures for their entire lifespan.

The technology retrofits onto existing concrete mixing equipment with minimal workflow changes, enabling rapid adoption across hundreds of facilities. Major projects by Microsoft and Amazon have incorporated CarbonCure concrete, demonstrating market acceptance for carbon-storing building materials.

9. Running Tide: Ocean-Based Carbon Sequestration

Running Tide enhances natural ocean carbon cycles through systems that deploy biomass into deep waters for long-term sequestration. Founded by commercial fishermen and engineers, the company grows kelp and other fast-growing biomass, then sinks it to ocean depths where extremely slow decomposition rates keep carbon stored for centuries or millennia.

The approach also incorporates alkalinity enhancement using limestone to counteract ocean acidification while enhancing carbon storage potential. Running Tide conducts extensive monitoring using autonomous vessels and sensors to verify carbon sequestration and avoid unintended ecological impacts.

Ocean-based carbon removal faces unique verification challenges since tracking deep ocean carbon is inherently difficult. Running Tide has invested heavily in developing monitoring methodologies that provide confidence to carbon credit buyers while satisfying scientific scrutiny.

10. Twelve: Electrochemical Carbon Conversion

Twelve developed an electrochemical process converting carbon dioxide and water into useful chemicals including ethylene for plastics and jet fuel components. The technology uses renewable electricity to drive chemical reactions that transform captured carbon into products replacing those currently made from fossil fuels.

The company’s reactors employ specialized catalysts and electrode designs to efficiently convert carbon dioxide into target molecules. This represents circular carbon use where the same atoms cycle through the economy multiple times rather than following a one-way path from underground reserves to the atmosphere.

Partnerships with Alaska Airlines for sustainable aviation fuel and consumer goods companies demonstrate that carbon-based products can meet quality standards of conventional fossil-derived materials while offering superior environmental profiles.

The Future of Carbon Capture

These ten companies represent diverse philosophies for addressing the same urgent challenge: removing excess atmospheric carbon dioxide and preventing new emissions. Some focus on permanent geological or mineralized storage, others pursue utilization pathways creating economic value, and still others enhance natural carbon cycling processes.

This diversity reflects reality. No single solution will address the massive scale of climate challenges. We will likely need all these technologies deployed across different contexts where each approach’s particular strengths align with local conditions and requirements. Direct air capture suits locations with abundant renewable energy and suitable geology. Point-source capture fits industries continuing emissions during energy transition. Utilization pathways create economic incentives accelerating deployment.",https://www.inventiva.co.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Just-Explore-27.jpg,N,,2026-01-11 07:57:54.153039

Jakarta, HAI SAWIT – Organisasi Penerbangan Sipil Internasional atau International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) resmi menyetujui limbah cair sawit sebagai bahan baku bahan bakar pesawat berkelanjutan pada akhir November 2025 lalu.

Keputusan besar ini menempatkan Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) sebagai instrumen kunci mitigasi emisi aviasi global. Indonesia kini memiliki peluang besar menjadi produsen utama bahan bakar pesawat rendah karbon dunia.

Dilansir dari laman Indonesia Palm Oil Strategic Studies (IPOSS), Minggu (11/01/2026), proses pengakuan ini memakan waktu satu tahun melalui pengusulan nilai ambang batas emisi karbon pada dokumen resmi Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Keunggulan Emisi POME

Data teknis menunjukkan keunggulan signifikan limbah cair sawit dalam menekan polusi udara dari sektor penerbangan. Berikut adalah fakta angka hasil perhitungan yang telah disetujui secara internasional:

Nilai emisi POME ditetapkan sebesar 18.1 gCO2e/MJ.

Angka tersebut 79,6 persen lebih rendah daripada emisi avtur fosil konvensional.

POME kini berstatus bahan bakar aviasi rendah karbon bersertifikat internasional.

Pertumbuhan penumpang pesawat global yang diprediksi menembus 8 miliar orang pada 2041 memicu lonjakan emisi luar biasa. Tanpa intervensi bahan bakar hijau, emisi sektor aviasi bisa mencapai 21,2 gigaton karbon dioksida.

Indonesia sendiri memproyeksikan jumlah penumpang mencapai 390 juta orang pada 2037. Kondisi ini menuntut penyesuaian cepat terhadap standar penerbangan berkelanjutan melalui pemanfaatan potensi industri Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) nasional secara masif.

Peran Strategis IPOSS dan Tripatra

Keberhasilan ini merupakan hasil kolaborasi teknis antara pemerintah dengan berbagai pihak pendukung. IPOSS bertindak selaku lembaga pemikir kebijakan sawit yang mengawal perhitungan nilai emisi hingga negosiasi pada tingkat teknis di markas ICAO.

Sementara itu, Tripatra berperan melakukan penghitungan nilai Life Cycle Emissions (LCA) serta menyusun rencana investasi perdana pembuatan SAF berbasis POME. Langkah ini memastikan setiap data teknis memiliki bukti akurat yang dapat diterima dunia.

Persetujuan internasional ini memberikan landasan regulasi kuat bagi implementasi mandatori SAF pada industri penerbangan domestik maupun internasional. Indonesia memiliki modal bahan baku beragam yang sudah diakui secara global saat ini.

Selain POME, bahan baku lain seperti minyak jelantah atau Used Cooking Oil (UCO) serta Palm Fatty Acid Distillate (PFAD) menjadi tumpuan. Gabungan potensi ini mampu menyuplai kebutuhan bahan bakar pesawat dalam jumlah besar.

Total potensi suplai mencapai 2 hingga 3 juta kiloliter SAF.

Pemerintah mendorong implementasi mandatori sebesar 5 persen pada tahun 2030.

Maskapai kini lebih mudah mengklaim pengurangan emisi melalui skema CORSIA.

Limbah sawit yang sebelumnya terbuang kini berubah menjadi komoditas sarat devisa bagi negara. Pemanfaatan POME sebagai bahan baku SAF secara hukum internasional kini sudah sah dan memiliki kepastian pasar jangka panjang.

Strategi ini memperkuat posisi Indonesia dalam persaingan energi hijau global di masa depan. Sertifikasi rendah karbon ini sekaligus menepis anggapan negatif mengenai keberlanjutan produk turunan kelapa sawit di mata masyarakat internasional.***

TARAKAN – Dukungan Badan Pengelola Dana Perkebunan (BPDP) unit di bawah Kementerian Keuangan yang mengelola dana perkebun terhadap sektor hilir, kembali nyata dirasakan di Bumi Benuanta.

Melalui kemitraan strategis, BPDP menyokong penuh gelaran Workshop Pengolahan Minyak dan Limbah Kelapa Sawit bagi UMKM yang dilaksanakan di Ballroom Hotel Lotus Panaya, Jumat (9/1/26).

Kegiatan ini dihadiri jajaran petinggi daerah, termasuk Kepala Dinas Pertanian dan Ketahanan Pangan Kaltara, Ir. Heri Rudiyono, M.Si, serta Kepala Disperindagkop UKM Kaltara, Dr. Hj. Hasriyani, SH., MM, bersama puluhan petani dan pelaku usaha kecil dari berbagai kabupaten/kota.

Ketua Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah (DPW) APKASINDO Kaltara, Muhammad Khoiruddin, menekankan dukungan BPDP adalah momentum emas bagi petani sawit Kaltara untuk berhenti menjadi “penonton” di tanah sendiri.

“Kami di DPW APKASINDO Kaltara melihat bahwa selama ini petani kita terlalu bergantung pada fluktuasi harga TBS (Tandan Buah Segar). Dengan dukungan BPDPKS dalam workshop ini, kita ingin mengubah pola pikir itu. Petani harus mulai melirik potensi hilirisasi. Jangan hanya menjual buah mentah, kita harus mampu mengolahnya menjadi minyak goreng atau produk turunan lainnya dalam skala UMKM,” tegas Khoiruddin.

Ia juga menambahkan Kaltara memiliki potensi CPO dan PKO yang sangat melimpah, namun belum tergarap maksimal oleh tangan-tangan lokal.

“Masalah utama kita adalah teknologi dan pengetahuan. Lewat workshop ini, kami ingin memastikan UMKM di Kaltara punya daya saing. Kita ingin di masa depan, ada merek minyak goreng lokal atau pupuk organik hasil limbah sawit asli produksi petani Kaltara yang beredar di pasar. Ini bukan sekadar pelatihan, ini adalah langkah menuju kedaulatan ekonomi petani sawit,” imbuhnya.

Senada dengan hal tersebut, Sekretaris Jenderal (Sekjen) DPP APKASINDO, Dr. Rino Afrino, ST., MM., C.APO, memberikan wawasan mengenai nilai ekonomi dari limbah yang selama ini terbuang.

“Dunia internasional kini mencari minyak jelantah atau limbah sawit untuk diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat. Jadi, tidak ada yang terbuang. Semua proses dari TBS hingga limbah memiliki peluang ekonomi yang berlipat ganda jika kita menguasai teknologinya,” jelas Dr. Rino.

Workshop yang didukung BPDP ini memiliki sembilan target utama guna memperkuat ekosistem sawit rakyat, di antaranya meningkatkan keterampilan teknis mengolah sawit menjadi produk bernilai tambah seperti kosmetik dan farmasi. Merumuskan pembangunan pabrik pupuk organik skala UMKM dari limbah sawit untuk menekan biaya produksi kebun.

Selain itu, membantu UMKM menciptakan produk inovatif yang sesuai dengan standar keberlanjutan (sustainability) agar mampu menembus pasar internasional.

Melalui sinergi antara BPDP, pemerintah daerah, dan APKASINDO, workshop ini diharapkan mampu menciptakan jejaring kerja yang kuat.

Dengan penguasaan teknologi pengolahan limbah dan minyak, petani sawit Kaltara diharapkan dapat meningkatkan pendapatan mereka sekaligus mendukung posisi Indonesia sebagai pemimpin industri sawit global yang ramah lingkungan.(*)",https://i0.wp.com/www.metrokaltara.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/IMG-20260110-WA0027.jpg?fit=1280%2C960&ssl=1,N,,2026-01-10 21:56:30.018633

Airbus predicts the commercial aircraft services market in the region to grow from $52 billion today to $129 billion by 2043. Additionally, they estimate a need for 999,000 new skilled personnel in Asia, comprising pilots, technicians, and cabin crew.

Boeing’s 2024 Commercial Market Outlook also supports this growth narrative, citing a tripling of air traffic in Southeast Asia by 2043, with a projected fleet expansion to 4,960 jets. They predict an annual passenger air traffic growth rate of 7.2%, which is significantly higher than the global average of 4.7%. This expansion in aviation will create opportunities for many, including the hiring of 234,000 new personnel to support the rising demand for air travel.

Several factors drive this rapid growth in Southeast Asia. The region’s economic landscape is characterized by a combined GDP of approximately $3 trillion, with diverse income levels among ASEAN member countries. As disposable incomes rise, particularly among the burgeoning middle class, there is increasing demand for air travel. This trend is evidenced by strategic market insights that showcase the growth rate of the middle class in Asia outpacing that of Western nations.

Countries like Vietnam and the Philippines are emerging leaders in plane orders. Vietjet has placed significant orders for A330neo aircraft, signaling its expansion into long-haul networks, while Cebu Pacific made headlines with a record-breaking order for 152 Airbus aircraft, cementing its status as a leading low-cost carrier.

The geographical challenges of Southeast Asia, with many nations being archipelagos, further emphasize the necessity of regional air connectivity. Improved airline services offer safer and faster travel options compared to traditional maritime routes, which have historically been associated with high accident rates. The rise of low-cost carriers has also enabled overseas workers to visit their families more frequently, thereby enhancing overall quality of life.

Moreover, sustainable aviation initiatives are beginning to take shape in the region, albeit at a slower pace compared to Europe and North America. Collaborations between Airbus, AirAsia, and local governments aim to develop sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production, which could significantly contribute to reducing the aviation industry’s environmental impact.",https://maritimefairtrade.org/wp-content/uploads/pwa/icon-192.png,N,,2026-01-10 19:56:38.206090

Adoption of renewable diesel as an immediate solution

This fuel, identified by its distinctive pink color, is formulated for all diesel engines and offers a reduction of up to 90% in net CO2 emissions compared to its fossil version. Repsol thus reaffirms that the decarbonization of transport by means of sustainable liquid fuels is a tangible alternative, especially in a context where 97% of the vehicle fleet in Europe still uses combustion engines.

Phillips 66 sits in the crosshairs of the energy transition. It is big enough to matter in global fuel and chemicals markets, and exposed enough to be disrupted by electrification, efficiency gains, and aggressive climate policy. The company’s namesake product platform – Phillips 66, encompassing fuels, midstream logistics, chemicals, lubricants and now low?carbon solutions – is being forced to answer a hard question: how do you run a profitable hydrocarbon business while the world is demanding less carbon?

The answer, at least for now, is not to abandon fossil molecules but to upgrade them. Phillips 66 is betting on a mix of high?complexity refining, advantaged logistics, petrochemicals via its Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) joint venture, and an expanding slate of lower?carbon offerings from renewable diesel to carbon capture and hydrogen integration. Instead of a single hero product, Phillips 66 functions more like a platform: a network of assets, technologies and proprietary processes tuned to squeeze out margin and emissions reductions from every barrel and every Btu that passes through its system.

This is not the loud, brand?forward pitch you get from an EV pioneer or a consumer?facing tech giant. It’s infrastructure?level innovation, where winning looks like quiet reliability, steady free cash flow, and decarbonization that is material on a megaton scale. Yet the stakes are huge. For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie and for policymakers trying to keep grids stable while lowering emissions, the way this product platform evolves over the next decade matters a lot.

Get all details on Phillips 66 here

Inside the Flagship: Phillips 66

The core Phillips 66 offering is a vertically integrated energy and chemicals platform spanning refining, midstream logistics, marketing, and petrochemicals. Rather than a single refinery or product line, think of Phillips 66 as a tightly choreographed system: crude and NGLs in, transportation fuels, specialty products and chemicals out, with every node optimized for cost, yield, and increasingly, carbon intensity.

On the conventional side, the Phillips 66 refining portfolio is built around complex, coastal refineries that can process discounted, heavy or opportunity crudes and upgrade them into higher?value products. That complexity is a quiet but powerful feature: coking, hydrocracking, and advanced distillation capacity let Phillips 66 pivot yields between gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and petrochemical feedstocks based on demand and crack spreads. The company has been divesting lower?margin inland refineries and doubling down on sites with export access and integration with chemicals and midstream assets.

A standout example of this evolution is the Rodeo facility in California, which Phillips 66 is converting from a traditional oil refinery into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels plants. Once fully ramped, Rodeo Renewed is designed to produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from feedstocks such as used cooking oil, animal fats, and other wastes. That’s not just a feel?good story; it’s a technical flex that combines hydrotreating expertise, hydrogen management, and feedstock optimization into a commercial?scale low?carbon product line that taps into lucrative California and federal credit markets.

In chemicals, the company’s Chevron Phillips Chemical joint venture is a second flagship pillar of the broader Phillips 66 product universe. CPChem is a major global producer of polyethylene, specialty chemicals and petrochemical intermediates. Its current and planned projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East are designed to leverage cheap natural gas liquids and export access to high?growth markets in Asia and beyond. This is the less visible but strategically crucial piece of the business, converting hydrocarbons into long?lived materials rather than fuels burned in an engine.

Layered on top of this industrial backbone is a suite of performance products and services under the Phillips 66, 76 and Kendall brands: branded transportation fuels, high?spec engine oils, industrial lubricants and specialty products. These offerings target both retail motorists and commercial and industrial customers, where performance claims (engine protection, extended drain intervals, fuel efficiency) translate directly into customer stickiness and margin.

Increasingly, the Phillips 66 product story includes low?carbon solutions. Beyond renewable diesel and SAF, the company is piloting and evaluating carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) at refinery and chemicals facilities; exploring hydrogen applications for process heat and fuels; and working on ways to lower the lifecycle emissions of its existing fuels and petrochemical products. None of these individually define the brand yet, but together they show a direction: decarbonize the barrel you have while preparing for a world that needs more molecules with fewer emissions.

Market Rivals: Phillips 66 Aktie vs. The Competition

Phillips 66 operates in one of the most competitive spaces in global industry: integrated and downstream energy. Its closest peers are U.S. and global refiners that are also trying to refit fossil?heavy product portfolios for a carbon?constrained world. Compared directly to Valero Energy’s refining and renewable diesel platform, Marathon Petroleum’s refining and MPLX midstream business, and the more globally diversified model of BP’s downstream and convenience business, the Phillips 66 product stack looks distinct in a few important ways.

Valero Energy’s flagship rivalry product is its highly optimized Gulf Coast refining network and the Diamond Green Diesel joint venture, which has become one of the world’s largest renewable diesel producers. Valero’s pitch is simple and sharp: scale, cost discipline, and aggressive capital allocation into high?return renewable diesel projects. Where Phillips 66 leans into integration with chemicals and logistics, Valero leans into pure?play refining leverage with a growing green fuels segment.

Marathon Petroleum, meanwhile, has turned its product platform into a refining?plus?midstream machine built around its MPLX partnership. After divesting Speedway, Marathon has focused on refinery optimization and midstream cash generation. Its renewable diesel product line, including the Martinez Renewable Fuels project in California, competes head?to?head with Phillips 66’s Rodeo Renewed in the West Coast low?carbon fuels market.

Then there is BP’s downstream and convenience operation, anchored by its Castrol lubricants and a global fuels marketing business. Compared directly to BP’s convenience & mobility product ecosystem – which spans retail stations, EV charging, premium fuels and lubricants – Phillips 66’s portfolio skews more industrial and North America?heavy. BP aims to turn forecourt real estate into a decarbonized mobility hub, while Phillips 66 is more focused on squeezing value from its refining, midstream, and chemicals platforms and selectively expanding lower?carbon fuels.

On the chemicals front, Chevron Phillips Chemical (part of the Phillips 66 universe) goes up against behemoths like ExxonMobil Chemical, Dow, and LyondellBasell. Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s performance polymers and chemical solutions product line, CPChem’s growth projects are more targeted and partnership?driven, emphasizing advantaged feedstock positions in the U.S. and the Middle East. The rivalry here is less about brand and more about who can bring on world?scale crackers and polyethylene plants at the lowest cost and with the most resilient demand profile.

Where Phillips 66 arguably concedes ground is in brand visibility to end consumers. BP and Shell can wrap their downstream products in a green narrative at the retail pump and on EV chargers. Valero and Marathon command outsized market share in key U.S. regions. Phillips 66, by contrast, often flies under the radar outside its core branded fuel regions, even as it quietly executes on projects that materially reshape its emissions and earning power.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

The core competitive edge of Phillips 66 is not a single breakthrough technology but the way its refining, midstream and chemicals assets are stitched together into a high?optionality product platform. In practice, that translates into a few structural advantages.

1. Integration with chemicals, not just fuels. Unlike pure?play refiners, Phillips 66 has a major stake in petrochemicals through Chevron Phillips Chemical. That means a larger share of its hydrocarbon molecules can end up in long?lived plastics and specialty chemicals rather than short?cycle fuels. In an energy transition world, that matters: fuels volumes will face structural headwinds from EVs and efficiency, while demand for many plastics and chemical intermediates continues to grow, especially in emerging markets.

2. High?complexity coastal refineries with export optionality. Phillips 66 has been pruning its refinery portfolio to emphasize complex coastal sites tied into product export lanes and petrochemical feedstock markets. That gives the company a crucial edge in product placement: it can swing barrels to higher?margin regions and adjust yields quickly as global product balances shift. In a volatile macro and regulatory environment, that flexibility is a profit multiplier.

3. Real, not rhetorical, low?carbon products. While nearly every energy major talks about net zero, fewer have deployed significant capital into commercially scaled low?carbon products that leverage their existing process knowledge. Renewable diesel and SAF at Rodeo Renewed, alongside co?processing and efficiency upgrades at other sites, give Phillips 66 a tangible entry into low?carbon liquids. These products can command premium pricing, ride policy tailwinds, and extend the life of downstream infrastructure even as carbon constraints tighten.

4. Disciplined capital and portfolio management. The company has been actively selling non?core or underperforming assets and recycling capital into higher?return projects in midstream, renewable fuels, and CPChem expansions. That helps keep the product portfolio skewed toward assets that can earn through the cycle and support shareholder returns. In a sector often criticized for value?destructive capex, that discipline is itself a competitive feature.

5. Industrial?grade resilience. Phillips 66’s product universe is built around logistics resilience: pipelines, terminals, export docks, and storage. This backbone may not be glamorous, but it keeps fuels and feedstocks flowing during disruptions and enables arbitrage across basins. As climate?related extreme weather and geopolitical shocks become more frequent, this resilience becomes a sellable attribute to customers, regulators, and investors.

Put together, these factors give Phillips 66 a nuanced but powerful USP: it is one of the few large?scale energy companies capable of generating strong free cash flow from hydrocarbons today while methodically bending the emissions curve of those same products and pivoting more barrels into chemicals and low?carbon fuels over time.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

For investors in Phillips 66 Aktie (ISIN US7185461040), the performance of this product platform is not an abstract story; it feeds directly into earnings, cash returns, and how the market values the company relative to peers.

Using live market data as of the latest trading session, Phillips 66 shares trade in a range that reflects both its cyclical refining exposure and growing confidence in its transition strategy. According to real?time quotes from major financial sources including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch, the stock’s most recently available price data show that the company is solidly in large?cap territory, with a market capitalization in the tens of billions of dollars and a valuation multiple that typically sits at a discount to the broader market but broadly in line with U.S. downstream peers. Where markets have rewarded Phillips 66 lately is in its ability to convert elevated refining margins and strong CPChem contributions into robust free cash flow, which is being directed toward dividends, share buybacks, and selective growth projects like Rodeo Renewed.

Crucially, the success of specific product initiatives is beginning to show up in analyst models. Renewable diesel and SAF volumes at Rodeo Renewed and Martinez?style peers are increasingly baked into long?term margin forecasts. CPChem’s global growth projects, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Middle East, provide visibility into non?refining earnings power. Midstream and logistics assets, once seen primarily as supporting infrastructure, are valued more like cash?generating toll roads that stabilize earnings when refining cycles turn down.

Markets also track Phillips 66’s decarbonization metrics and capital allocation closely. Demonstrable emissions reductions per barrel, growing low?carbon product volumes, and credible CCUS and hydrogen pathways reduce perceived transition risk. That, in turn, can compress the discount rate investors apply to future cash flows, supporting a stronger equity multiple than a pure?play, no?transition refiner might command.

In that sense, the Phillips 66 product platform is both a cash engine and a signaling device. Each incremental renewable diesel project, each chemicals expansion, each efficiency gain in refining and midstream sends a message that this is not a business planning to run in place until demand disappears. For Phillips 66 Aktie, that evolving narrative – from traditional refiner to integrated, lower?carbon energy and chemicals platform – is a key driver of how the stock is priced against rivals like Valero, Marathon Petroleum, and the downstream arms of the supermajors.

The transition will not be smooth, and the macro backdrop for fuels and chemicals will remain volatile. But if Phillips 66 can keep proving that its product upgrades and portfolio shifts translate into durable margins and lower carbon intensity, its stock will be less a hostage to the next down?cycle and more a geared play on a pragmatic, molecule?centric energy transition.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405029_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 17:56:42.662936

As corn producers head into another growing season, economic headwinds are intensifying — not from just one direction, but from both sides of the balance sheet.

While production costs remain stubbornly high, corn prices have sharply declined, squeezing farm margins and prompting a push for long-term demand growth.

Krista Swanson, chief economist with the U.S. National Corn Growers Association (NCGA), outlined the association’s upcoming Q1 economic outlook and what it signals for U.S. corn producers.

“Costs have been a huge focus of ours over the past six months,” she says, pointing to a plateau in production expenses that has held since 2022.

While some minor easing has occurred, the USDA projects the cost to grow an acre of corn will average $917 in 2026 — only 1 per cent lower than 2022 levels.

“Meanwhile, the market-year average price for corn is expected to be 37 per cent lower than 2022,” she adds.

Swanson noted fertilizer makes up about a third of operating costs and draws much attention, but increases in seed, pesticides, land, and machinery are also significant.

From an economist’s perspective, she warned that continued government payments, such as the USDA’s recent $44/acre “bridge” program, may also inadvertently contribute to price rigidity for those same inputs.

Beyond costs, Swanson is focused on the demand side, where new market opportunities could change the trajectory.

While year-round E15 ethanol remains a top short-term goal, she says longer-term strategies are being developed.

“Ethanol isn’t just a motor fuel … there are opportunities in maritime fuels, sustainable aviation fuel, and bioproducts,” she explained.

Diversification is another bright spot. Roughly 40 per cent of U.S. corn exports go to Mexico, but Swanson says the broader export pie is well-divided, with markets like Japan, Colombia, and South Korea contributing to feed and fuel demand.

As producers weigh planting decisions for 2026, the high cost of corn production versus soybeans looms large.

Still, futures price ratios and farmer preferences continue to favour corn. Whether that holds, Swanson says, will be a key trend to watch as the new crop year unfolds.",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/648/files/2025/09/corn-stock-9725.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 13:57:20.677289

Melalui kemitraan strategis, BPDP menyokong penuh gelaran Workshop Pengolahan Minyak dan Limbah Kelapa Sawit bagi UMKM yang dilaksanakan di Ballroom Hotel Lotus Panaya, Jumat (9/1/26).

​Kegiatan ini dihadiri jajaran petinggi daerah, termasuk Kepala Dinas Pertanian dan Ketahanan Pangan Kaltara, Ir. Heri Rudiyono, M.Si, serta Kepala Disperindagkop UKM Kaltara, Dr. Hj. Hasriyani, SH., MM, bersama puluhan petani dan pelaku usaha kecil dari berbagai kabupaten/kota.

​​Ketua Dewan Pimpinan Wilayah (DPW) APKASINDO Kaltara, Muhammad Khoiruddin, menekankan dukungan BPDP adalah momentum emas bagi petani sawit Kaltara untuk berhenti menjadi “penonton” di tanah sendiri.

​”Kami di DPW APKASINDO Kaltara melihat bahwa selama ini petani kita terlalu bergantung pada fluktuasi harga TBS (Tandan Buah Segar). Dengan dukungan BPDPKS dalam workshop ini, kita ingin mengubah pola pikir itu. Petani harus mulai melirik potensi hilirisasi. Jangan hanya menjual buah mentah, kita harus mampu mengolahnya menjadi minyak goreng atau produk turunan lainnya dalam skala UMKM,” tegas Khoiruddin.

​Ia juga menambahkan Kaltara memiliki potensi CPO dan PKO yang sangat melimpah, namun belum tergarap maksimal oleh tangan-tangan lokal.

​”Masalah utama kita adalah teknologi dan pengetahuan. Lewat workshop ini, kami ingin memastikan UMKM di Kaltara punya daya saing. Kita ingin di masa depan, ada merek minyak goreng lokal atau pupuk organik hasil limbah sawit asli produksi petani Kaltara yang beredar di pasar. Ini bukan sekadar pelatihan, ini adalah langkah menuju kedaulatan ekonomi petani sawit,” imbuhnya.

Senada dengan hal tersebut, Sekretaris Jenderal (Sekjen) DPP APKASINDO, Dr. Rino Afrino, ST., MM., C.APO, memberikan wawasan mengenai nilai ekonomi dari limbah yang selama ini terbuang.

​”Dunia internasional kini mencari minyak jelantah atau limbah sawit untuk diolah menjadi Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) atau bahan bakar pesawat. Jadi, tidak ada yang terbuang. Semua proses dari TBS hingga limbah memiliki peluang ekonomi yang berlipat ganda jika kita menguasai teknologinya,” jelas Dr. Rino.

​Workshop yang didukung BPDP ini memiliki sembilan target utama guna memperkuat ekosistem sawit rakyat, di antaranya meningkatkan keterampilan teknis mengolah sawit menjadi produk bernilai tambah seperti kosmetik dan farmasi. Merumuskan pembangunan pabrik pupuk organik skala UMKM dari limbah sawit untuk menekan biaya produksi kebun.

Selain itu, membantu UMKM menciptakan produk inovatif yang sesuai dengan standar keberlanjutan (sustainability) agar mampu menembus pasar internasional.

​​Melalui sinergi antara BPDP, pemerintah daerah, dan APKASINDO, workshop ini diharapkan mampu menciptakan jejaring kerja yang kuat.

IIFCL Prepares for Stake Dilution and IPO

India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) is preparing to dilute up to 25% of its government stake as part of its next phase of evolution, ahead of the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Financial year 2027.

Speaking with ANI, Deputy Managing Director Palash Srivastava on Saturday, said that this move is likely part of the government's strategy to raise funds for infrastructure development and to promote private-sector participation. ""There is a lot of preparation to do, and we are on course for this to happen,"" Srivastava told ANI, adding that the timing of the proposed divestment aligns with a period when IIFCL's funding strategy is increasingly integrated with global capital markets.

IIFCL DMD's remarks came in the backdrop of reports that the government is considering selling stakes in IIFCL, its long-term infrastructure lending arm, and that the ministerial panel is expected to finalise the IPO structure, which may combine fresh equity issuance and a partial government stake sale to meet public shareholding norms.

IIFCL is a wholly owned Government of India company that provides long-term financing and advisory services for viable infrastructure projects in India, covering sectors such as energy, transport, water, and digital infrastructure, with the aim of boosting national development.

Impact of Global Interest Rates

Talking on how global interest rate cycles affect infrastructure financing, Srivastava said IIFCL is ""very much linked to the global financing system"" and regularly borrows internationally on the strength of its own balance sheet. ""We have found that international market rate cuts also help our rates go down,"" he said.

He said IIFCL's borrowing rates are flexible and benchmark-linked. ""When the benchmark rates are cut, our rates also come down,"" Srivastava said, noting that this improves margins on infrastructure projects and makes IIFCL's participation in direct lending and takeout finance more competitive.

Highlighting the importance of floating-rate structures, he said, ""The floating rate regime is helping us tide over,"" adding that close to 55 per cent of IIFCL's portfolio is currently on a floating-rate basis. He said institutions funded through amortising and floating-rate loans or bonds benefit more from rate cuts, while those relying largely on fixed-rate bonds may see less impact.

Driving India's Green Transition

On India's green transition, he said development finance institutions are ""actually the main influencers"" in making infrastructure projects green. He said the transition covers multiple dimensions, starting with renewables, where India has already made significant progress. ""About 500 gigawatt of solar and wind capacity is already in place,"" he said, adding that further expansion will not only help meet national targets but also promote manufacturing through green energy.

Srivastava said DFIs are also enabling the transition of hard-to-abate sectors. Referring to sustainable aviation fuel, he said, ""We have actually financed the sustainable aviation fuel export from India into the UK,"" demonstrating how financial institutions can provide enabling finance and effective support mechanisms for green transition.

Supporting Green MSMEs

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises. ""Our MSMEs also have to turn green,"" he said, adding that IIFCL is working with NITI Aayog on a programme to aggregate MSMEs in industrial clusters or estates.

""Aggregation is going to help,"" he said, noting that green energy can be supplied through rooftop solar or open access, while overcoming RESCOs' reluctance to take individual MSME credit exposure.

He said DFIs are also contributing through blended finance and guarantee mechanisms. ""There are certain conversations about green guarantees and green insurance,"" he said, describing them as part of the broader toolkit to help the Indian industry transition to green.

Navigating Geopolitical Risks and Supply Chains

On geopolitical risks, Srivastava said geopolitics is ""a very important contributor"" to long-term infrastructure outcomes, especially in maritime infrastructure. ""Geopolitics affects trade first and foremost,"" he said, adding that trade dynamics shape the infrastructure ecosystem supporting export and import activity.

He said recent disturbances have shown how trade corridors and connectivity plans can be disrupted, underscoring the need for resilience in long-term infrastructure planning.

Turning to global supply chains, Srivastava said diversification trends have accelerated in recent years. ""Most economies don't want to put all their manufacturing in one country,"" he said, adding that manufacturing and secondary economic activities are increasingly shifting from the Global North to the Global South.

He said this presents opportunities for India, particularly in electronics manufacturing. ""We have been in conversations with bilateral partners like JBIC,"" Srivastava said, noting that long-term blended finance can help develop clusters, create value chains and strengthen shipping and logistics linkages.

Srivastava also said IIFCL has been in touch with the Sagarmala Development Finance Corporation and may partner with it under the proposed Maritime Development Fund.

Embracing Technology: AI and Blockchain

Further on technology, he said artificial intelligence should be seen as ""a smart support system"" rather than a replacement for human judgment. ""I don't see it as anything more than an iteration over the decision support systems we already have,"" he said.

He said IIFCL has begun planning a transition to AI and machine learning to flag regulatory, compliance, international mandate-specific, and technology risks when a case is uploaded. ""This will enable an appraiser to get a broad brush reference immediately,"" he said.

Srivastava also discussed blockchain and smart contracts, noting that IIFCL would like to move toward smart financing. ""This will enable just-in-time financing to flow to projects and bring down the overall cost of financing,"" he said.

Addressing Market Perceptions and Demand

On global slowdown concerns, Srivastava said the key challenge to infrastructure growth is perception. ""The risk perception definitely affects investments,"" he said, stressing that policy continuity, consistent stress asset resolution and predictability in awards are critical to sustaining private sector capital expenditure.

On infrastructure demand, he said India's requirements remain structurally strong. ""As a country of 1.45 billion people, we definitely have a lot of infrastructure to build,"" Srivastava said, adding that domestic infrastructure demand is not materially affected by international impulses.

Integrating Climate and Disaster Resilience

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable. ""These days, we are designing for climate events,"" he said, citing floods, droughts, cyclones and high-speed winds.

He said design parameters increasingly account for 1.5-degree and 2-degree temperature-rise scenarios, even though this entails additional costs. ""Together with CDRI, we have evolved a framework whereby financing for disaster-resilient infrastructure could be taken up,"" he said.

Evolving Funding and Hedging Strategies

On funding strategy, he said external commercial borrowings are becoming a structural necessity. ""If I am trying to borrow money for 15 years or 20 years, I am not getting it in the commercial market in India,"" he said.

He added that IIFCL recently raised a 15-year amortising overseas loan at a very competitive cost using structured finance and hedging. ""Hedging is not such an issue,"" he said, noting that international banks can provide all-in hedging solutions.

On currency markets, Srivastava said improved rupee-dollar hedging frameworks could support deeper and more stable derivative markets. ""If DFIs collaborate, we could create economies of scale and get better hedging solutions,"" he said.

Internal Reinvention and New Offerings

Highlighting internal developments, he said IIFCL has constituted 11 task forces to reinvent the institution. ""We are looking at a batch of new product offerings,"" he said, including bridge finance to address the 6 to 18 month delay in financial closure and subordinated debt products to support state governments in projects such as hybrid annuity models.

He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance. ""We want a common MRV protocol,"" he said, so that international green capital does not impose additional conditionalities on Indian institutions.

Srivastava added that IIFCL is strengthening engagement with India-based multilaterals such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Bioenergy Alliance as it prepares for the next phase of growth. (ANI)

Deutsche Lufthansa AG is no longer just a legacy flag carrier fighting for survival in a brutally competitive sky. It is repositioning itself as a premium, digitally driven, and increasingly climate-conscious aviation platform, spanning the Lufthansa, SWISS, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, and Discover brands. After years of pandemic shock, labor disputes, and capacity dislocations, the company is now re-architecting how a traditional network airline should look and feel for the next decade.

The core problem Deutsche Lufthansa AG is trying to solve is two-fold: make long-haul flying profitable again while convincing travelers that premium seats, flexible digital services, and greener operations justify paying more in a world that has grown used to rock-bottom fares and remote work. That challenge sits at the heart of every strategic move the group is currently making: from its multi-billion-euro cabin retrofit program to its digital self-service push and high-profile sustainability commitments.

For business travelers, the pitch is a rebuilt product experience under the ""Lufthansa Allegris"" banner. For leisure travelers, it is more choice via Eurowings and Discover. For investors, it is a story of margin repair, disciplined capacity growth, and structurally higher yields. Together, these define Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a product, not just a stock ticker.

Inside the Flagship: Deutsche Lufthansa AG

At the center of Deutsche Lufthansa AG today is an aggressive modernization of its fleet and cabins, wrapped in a broader platform strategy. The company is rolling out its new long-haul experience, marketed as Lufthansa Allegris, across the Boeing 787, Airbus A350, and the upcoming Boeing 777-9 fleet. This is not just a new seat; it is a full reset of how the airline monetizes every square meter of the cabin.

In premium cabins, Lufthansa Allegris introduces multiple business-class seat types in the same cabin — including extra-long beds, throne-style single seats with extra privacy, and seats with baby bassinets and more storage. Instead of a monolithic business class, Deutsche Lufthansa AG is essentially creating a micro-portfolio of business products within one configuration, giving the airline more levers to upsell frequent flyers and corporate travelers based on specific needs. First class, reintroduced on select A350 routes, is being reimagined as ultra-private suites with nearly floor-to-ceiling walls and large double seats that target the very top end of the market.

In premium economy and economy, the innovation is more about smart standardization and incremental comfort. Wider seats, larger IFE screens, improved cushioning, and better ergonomic design are table stakes. But Deutsche Lufthansa AG is also adding more ancillary revenue hooks: pre-selection of specific rows or comfort seats, paid extras like additional legroom, and bundled travel options that mix seat selection, baggage, and onboard services into dynamic offers.

On the ground and in the app, the company is leaning into digitalization. The Lufthansa Group app ecosystem focuses on real-time rebooking, automated disruption handling, and biometric-enabled journeys at some hubs. The goal: fewer chaotic airport lines, more self-service, and lower operational friction when weather, strikes, or crew issues hit. The airline is also investing in continuous pricing and offer management technology to shift away from traditional static fare buckets toward more agile, demand-based pricing.

Sustainability remains a major strategic pillar. Deutsche Lufthansa AG is renewing its fleet with more fuel-efficient aircraft like the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and A320neo family, and it has committed to ramping up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage in cooperation with corporate customers. The proposition to climate-conscious travelers and corporate clients is clear: fly with a network carrier that is at least trying to bend the emissions curve via newer hardware and alternative fuels.

Behind the scenes, the group structure remains a key feature of the Deutsche Lufthansa AG product. It is not a single airline, but a portfolio of brands calibrated for different markets: SWISS as the premium Swiss hub carrier, Austrian Airlines as Vienna’s connector, Brussels Airlines for Belgium and Africa, Eurowings and Discover for point-to-point European and leisure routes. This allows the group to tailor its cost structure and brand positioning while leveraging shared systems, pilots, maintenance, and loyalty via Miles & More, one of Europe’s most powerful frequent flyer programs.

Market Rivals: Lufthansa Aktie vs. The Competition

Deutsche Lufthansa AG operates in one of the most unforgiving competitive arenas: European aviation, squeezed from all sides by low-cost carriers within Europe and deep-pocketed Gulf and Asian airlines on long-haul routes. When you look at the ""product"" that Deutsche Lufthansa AG is selling — a full-service, hub-and-spoke, global network — the closest direct competitors are International Airlines Group (IAG, with British Airways and Iberia), Air France-KLM, and to some extent the Gulf giants Emirates and Qatar Airways on key intercontinental flows.

Compared directly to British Airways under the IAG umbrella, Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s new Allegris cabins are designed to close and, on some routes, surpass the product gap that had opened up in business and first class. BA’s Club Suite was an early move toward privacy-first business cabins with doors; Lufthansa’s multi-seat-type approach raises the bar by offering differentiated micro-products within the same cabin, potentially out-monetizing BA if the upsell strategy works. Where British Airways still leans heavily on London Heathrow as a single mega-hub, Deutsche Lufthansa AG plays a multi-hub game through Frankfurt, Munich, Zurich, Vienna, and Brussels, offering passengers more routing options but at the cost of additional operational complexity.

Compared directly to Air France-KLM, especially Air France’s lauded latest business-class cabins, Deutsche Lufthansa AG competes on breadth and system scale. Air France has strong brand appeal and cabin design, particularly on Paris-origin premium traffic, while KLM excels with passenger friendliness through Amsterdam Schiphol. Lufthansa Group counters with a wider brand portfolio, a larger corporate customer base in Germany and central Europe, and more diversified hub risk. Where Air France-KLM leans into a stylish, service-led French and Dutch identity, Deutsche Lufthansa AG markets a blend of German precision, reliability (when operations run smoothly), and functional premium.

Then there are the Gulf carriers. Compared directly to Emirates’ flagship long-haul product or Qatar Airways’ Qsuite, Deutsche Lufthansa AG cannot always match the glam factor on every route, especially in first class or top-tier business-class suites. The Gulf carriers benefit from lower labor cost bases, favorable geography for east–west connections, and relatively unconstrained hub expansion. Lufthansa’s counter is a strong position in Europe-originating corporate demand, shorter total journey times for many Europe-based travelers, and a more integrated relationship with Star Alliance partners like United Airlines and Singapore Airlines. For a Frankfurt-to-New York corporate traveler, the question isn’t whether Emirates has flashier cabins; it is whether Lufthansa’s schedule, loyalty program, and corporate deals offer superior end-to-end value.

On intra-European routes, Eurowings and Lufthansa’s short-haul network go head-to-head with low-cost carriers such as Ryanair and easyJet. Here, the product is less about luxury and more about schedule breadth, connectivity into the long-haul network, and reliability. Ryanair wins on price almost every time; Deutsche Lufthansa AG tries to win on network integration, allowing a passenger from a secondary German city to connect seamlessly onto an intercontinental flight through Frankfurt or Munich.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s edge is not a single killer feature. It is the combination of product modernization, network strength, and ecosystem depth that makes its proposition hard to replicate at scale.

First, the cabin strategy is tuned for monetization. Lufthansa Allegris is designed from the ground up to capture more value per seat by offering granularity: travelers can pay more for privacy, more for extra-long beds, more for seating with better views or baby-friendly layouts. This shift mirrors trends in hospitality and streaming services, where tiered offerings outperform one-size-fits-all models. Competitors like British Airways and Air France-KLM are modernizing cabins too, but Deutsche Lufthansa AG’s multi-seat-type strategy positions it to squeeze more revenue out of premium cabins on high-demand routes.

Second, the multi-brand, multi-hub architecture gives Deutsche Lufthansa AG a resilience advantage. When one hub suffers from disruptions or political issues, traffic can be rerouted through others. SWISS can pick up slack when Frankfurt is saturated; Vienna can serve as a nimble connector for eastern Europe; Brussels can deepen Africa links. This redundancy and flexibility are strengths that a single-hub carrier such as British Airways cannot easily match.

Third, the loyalty ecosystem is a powerful moat. Miles & More is deeply embedded with corporate travel programs, co-branded credit cards, and long-time status customers across Europe. In a context where travel buyers are under pressure to justify every euro spent, a rich loyalty ecosystem linked to a dense network matters. Deutsche Lufthansa AG leverages this to lock in repeat customers even when ticket prices are slightly higher than low-cost or Gulf rivals on certain segments.

Fourth, the sustainability narrative is becoming a real differentiator, especially for European corporate clients facing their own ESG disclosures. By investing in newer aircraft like the Airbus A350, Boeing 787, and A320neo families, experimenting with sustainable aviation fuels through corporate SAF agreements, and pushing efficiency initiatives, Deutsche Lufthansa AG can credibly present itself as a partner in emissions reduction — or at least emissions mitigation. While no major airline can claim to be truly green yet, being perceived as more proactive than peers can tilt RFP decisions for corporate contracts.

Finally, the digital layer — from rebooking automation to mobile-first check-in and biometrics — is critical. A full-service product loses its shine if disruption handling is a nightmare. By progressively moving recovery flows (rebookings, vouchers, seat changes) into the app and self-service kiosks, Deutsche Lufthansa AG aims to reduce moments of friction that traditionally sent customer satisfaction scores tumbling.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

From a capital markets perspective, all of this product work is more than cabin aesthetics; it is a thesis about structural profitability. As of the latest available trading session, data from major financial platforms such as Yahoo Finance and another cross-checked source like Reuters show that the Lufthansa Aktie (ISIN DE0008232125) is trading in a range that reflects a normalized, but not euphoric, recovery path after the post-pandemic rebound. The exact live quote can fluctuate intraday, but what matters for investors is the narrative priced into the stock.

In recent quarters, Deutsche Lufthansa AG has reported solid passenger volumes and improving yields, particularly in premium cabins where the new product is gradually entering service. The market is watching how quickly the Allegris rollout scales, how reliably the group can operate its schedule amid ongoing labor and air traffic control constraints, and whether cost inflation (wages, fuel, airport fees) can be offset by higher unit revenues.

The product strategy directly feeds into valuation levers. A more efficient and attractive long-haul fleet supports better margins and lower unit costs over time. Stronger premium demand and granular upselling capability in business and first class can expand revenue per available seat kilometer, a key earnings driver. Digitalization and automation should, in theory, flatten non-fuel cost growth. Sustainability initiatives, while costly upfront, can keep the group inside the acceptable ESG range for large institutional investors and corporate clients.

Investors also weigh Deutsche Lufthansa AG against its peer set. When compared with International Airlines Group or Air France-KLM on valuation metrics like EV/EBITDA or price-to-earnings, the stock tends to trade as a recovery and restructuring story rather than a high-growth tech-style equity. The success or failure of the current product upgrade cycle and network optimization will influence whether Lufthansa Aktie earns a modest legacy-carrier multiple or a premium closer to best-in-class peers.

In this context, Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a product is a primary driver of Deutsche Lufthansa AG as a stock. If the group executes on its promise — delivering a consistently premium experience, monetizing its hubs more effectively, keeping unions reasonably aligned, and proving sustainability investments can coexist with acceptable returns — then the modernized Lufthansa could justify a higher, more stable valuation. If execution falters, investors will see Allegris and fleet renewal as expensive experiments rather than profit engines.

The skies ahead remain volatile: geopolitical tensions, fuel price shocks, and macroeconomic slowdowns could all hit demand. But the direction of travel for Deutsche Lufthansa AG is clear. It is not merely surviving disruption; it is trying to transform disruption into an opportunity to rebuild what a European network carrier can be — and investors in Lufthansa Aktie are effectively betting on that reinvention at scale.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405002_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 12:56:43.175758

December: Challenges and Bold Reforms

EnComm Aviation Faces Shutdown Over BAE ATP Support Withdrawal

Kenyan humanitarian cargo operator EnComm issued a dire warning of potential loan default after BAE Systems withdrew technical support for its BAe ATP fleet — the last of its type in service. Having delivered nearly 19,000 tonnes of aid to conflict zones since 2023, the grounding disrupts vital humanitarian operations and exposes vulnerabilities in supporting legacy aircraft types.

ECOWAS Abolishes Key Aviation Taxes

In a landmark move, ECOWAS adopted reforms abolishing ticket, tourism, solidarity, and foreign travel taxes while slashing passenger service and security charges by 25%, effective January 2026. This policy, backed by a regional oversight mechanism, targets West Africa’s exorbitant airfares — often higher than long-haul routes to Europe — and aligns with ICAO standards to foster affordability, competition, and integration.

2025 was not without setbacks — conflict disruptions in Libya and Sudan, governance scandals, legacy aircraft challenges, and lingering safety gaps reminded the industry of its fragility. Yet the year’s defining theme was forward momentum: record infrastructure financing, pioneering sustainability efforts, technological firsts, a wave of national carrier revivals, and decisive regional tax reforms. As African nations increasingly assert technical and industrial sovereignty — from MROs to SAF production to aerospace manufacturing — the continent is transitioning from a late adopter to an active shaper of global aviation trends.",https://images.airlinegeeks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/11170412/Royal-Air-Maroc-Boeing-787-9-LHR-William-Derrickson.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 10:56:56.801594

“Making California more affordable is how we make families thrive. That is why this year’s budget should be all about giving people more financial breathing room without losing sight of long-term financial stability and prioritizing smart, directed spending.

“The Governor’s budget proposal includes difficult choices responding to the unjustified and vindictive withholding of federal funds by the Trump Administration which are projected to result in $1.4 billion worth of unnecessary costs, driving up health care costs and reducing food assistance to over 3 million families.

“I am particularly pleased to see funds put toward universal access to free transitional kindergarten and a sustainable aviation fuel investment that will improve air quality and protect critical Contra Costa County jobs. I will work to expand this investment to renewable diesel fuel, increasing our climate impact while supporting economic growth.

“However, this proposal has a long way to go when it comes to affordable housing. The Legislature is once again working from zero. As co-chair of the Assembly Select Committee on Housing Finance and Affordability, I am committed to finding solutions that will bring down the rising cost of housing in California and increase the construction of affordable homes.

“Over the next several months, I will work closely with my colleagues to negotiate and pass a state budget that provides the best outcomes for our community and state.”

“We are actively exploring opportunities to expand in the bio and e-SAF market, and Haffner was the ideal partner.
Additionally, excess biogenic CO₂ generated during syngas production can be combined with renewable hydrogen produced by IGNIS P2X to create e-SAF, a synthetic sustainable aviation fuel of non-biological origin.

The partners announced that the project’s first priority is identifying an optimal site for the facility in Spain.

“AeroVerde builds on Haffner Energy’s innovative methods for turning residual biomass into valuable fuel products,” said Gustav Granberg, Director of P2X Business Development & Strategy at IGNIS. “We are actively exploring opportunities to expand in the bio and e-SAF market, and Haffner was the ideal partner. Our immediate focus is to select the most strategic location for the initial project in Spain.”

Haffner Energy’s proprietary technology transforms residual biomass—without competing with food or land use—into hydrogen-rich syngas, which can then be converted into bioSAF through pathways such as Alcohol-to-Jet and Fisher-Tropsch. Additionally, excess biogenic CO₂ generated during syngas production can be combined with renewable hydrogen produced by IGNIS P2X to create e-SAF, a synthetic sustainable aviation fuel of non-biological origin.

The European SAF sector is under mounting pressure to scale up rapidly. Under the ReFuelEU Aviation mandate, airlines will be required to use a 6% SAF blend across the EU by 2030. Yet, according to an October report by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), SAF accounted for only 0.6% of aviation fuel consumption in 2024, with around 55% produced domestically. Most of the EU’s SAF currently comes from used cooking oil and waste animal fats (HEFA), nearly 70% of which is imported from Asia. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has warned that such imports can offset the carbon reduction benefits of SAF mandates.

AeroVerde plans to strategically locate its first facility to ensure efficient access to local residual biomass while minimizing transportation distances to offtakers.

“Our business model is rooted in the circular economy, and partnering with IGNIS P2X allows us to combine our technological expertise with their strong presence in Spain,” said Marcella Franchi, Chief Commercial Officer and Head of SAF at Haffner Energy. “Together, we are well-positioned to bring sustainable aviation fuels to the Iberian Peninsula.”

As Spain’s largest independent energy manager, IGNIS oversees more than 9 GW of power assets for domestic and international clients. The group operates over 30 GW of renewable projects globally, spanning Europe, the U.S., Latin America, and Asia.

In 2025, the Washington State Department of Commerce awarded the port a $1.5 million grant to support SkyNRG’s facility construction. With environmental approvals in hand, the project will now enter its engineering and detailed design phase, aiming to begin operations in 2030. Construction is expected to generate up to 600 jobs, with roughly 100 positions available once production starts.",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-7.png,N,,2026-01-10 11:57:53.251038

At a share price of $68.65, Corteva has seen a 30 day share price return of 5.45% and a 90 day share price return of 11.03%. Its 1 year total shareholder return of 21.48% and 5 year total shareholder return of 65.84% indicate momentum has been building around the recent Etlas and Hexagon Bio announcements, despite short term volatility and legal headlines.

If this kind of transition toward bio based fuels has your attention, it could be a good moment to scan other that are reshaping how we think about long term resilience and structural demand.

With the stock at $68.65, a value score of 0, an intrinsic value estimate that sits about 8% above today’s price and a roughly 14% gap to analyst targets, is there still upside here, or is future growth already priced in?

Most Popular Narrative: 11.7% Undervalued

With Corteva last closing at $68.65 versus a narrative fair value of about $77.76, the story centers on measured growth, higher margins and a richer earnings profile over time.

Advancements in Corteva's innovation pipeline, including premium trait launches (Vorceed, PowerCore), expansion of biological products, and gene editing, enable premium pricing, secure market share, and improve product mix, translating into higher gross margins and earnings growth. Accelerated adoption of sustainable and eco-friendly agricultural inputs, supported by favorable policy shifts in gene editing and biofuels, positions Corteva for outsized growth as regulatory and consumer preferences move toward biological and reduced-chemical solutions. This can expand both revenue and addressable market over the long term.

Curious how moderate revenue growth, rising margins and a premium P/E all come together to support that higher fair value line? The key assumptions might surprise you. One element hinges on future earnings power, another on what multiple the market could be willing to pay. Want to see exactly how those moving parts stack up?

Result: Fair Value of $77.76 (UNDERVALUED)

However, slower crop protection demand and tougher environmental or regulatory requirements could squeeze margins and challenge the higher earnings and P/E assumptions behind that 11.7% undervaluation story.

Another View: What Earnings Multiples Are Saying

The fair value narrative points to Corteva trading about 11.7% below a US$77.76 estimate, but the earnings multiple tells a more cautious story. At a P/E of 27.6x, the stock sits above both its fair ratio of 25.3x and the US Chemicals industry at 25.2x, as well as above peers at 15.1x.

That gap means you are paying a richer price for each dollar of earnings today, which can limit room for disappointment if growth or margins fall short. So does the premium reflect solid conviction in the earnings path, or does it leave less margin for error at this price?

DHL's GoGreen Plus service will empower NCC Bank to reduce their Scope 3 emissions, the indirect greenhouse gas emissions in up- and downstream transportation and distribution. This ""insetting"" approach would allow the bank to curtail the carbon emissions associated with their shipments.

Through the book-and-claim model, DHL substitutes fossil fuels with sustainable fuels across its network and assigns the resulting environmental benefits to customers, like NCC Bank, who invest in its GoGreen Plus solution, even if their shipments are not directly transported with these fuels.

Currently, DHL's GoGreen Plus is the only solution in the global express logistics industry that enables customers to leverage sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to minimize emissions linked to their shipments.

Md. Miarul Haque, managing director of DHL Express Bangladesh, said NCC Bank has taken a meaningful step toward reducing the environmental footprint of its shipments. Together, they would be able to accelerate the adoption of SAF across the air transport industry.

Global agribusiness leader Bunge has secured the first ever ISCC CORSIA PLUS certification for soybeans processed at its Rondonópolis plant in Mato Grosso. The audit confirms that the crop carries a low risk of indirect land use change, meeting stringent criteria set by the aviation sector for sustainable fuel feedstocks. With one of the largest crushing capacities in South America, the facility can now channel certified oil directly toward sustainable aviation fuel production, opening an immediate path from farm gate to flight deck.

How Low ILUC Soy Benefits Airlines

Airlines governed by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation can count certified low ILUC soy toward their renewable energy targets without penalty factors. This translates into higher blend limits and simpler compliance reporting. Because the beans are sourced from existing farmland, no new land clearing is involved, keeping carbon intensity scores comfortably below the CORSIA threshold. Refiners also benefit; feedstock loads depart from an inland rail hub, reducing marine emissions associated with long distance imports.

Non-Obvious Market Ripple

A quietly powerful effect of this certification is price discovery. By placing a premium on low ILUC soy, the market now offers growers a clear financial signal to adopt precision agriculture, double cropping and satellite monitored land stewardship. Over time, these practices may raise overall yields, freeing up additional acreage for protein rich food crops even as fuel demand grows. Thus the aviation mandate could indirectly enhance food security, an outcome not typically associated with biofuel policy.

Conclusion

Bunge has demonstrated that large scale soybean production can meet the most demanding sustainability checks while supporting farmer prosperity and aviation decarbonisation. As more Brazilian facilities pursue certification, the global supply of high integrity feedstock for sustainable jet fuel is set to rise rapidly.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Copy-of-White-Simple-Photocentric-Zoom-Virtual-Background-7.svg,N,,2026-01-10 14:12:18.007192

To own Gevo, you have to believe its sustainable aviation fuel and carbon solutions can scale enough to support a still unprofitable business with less than one year of cash runway. The newly announced COO succession, alongside the pending CEO transition, does not materially change the near term focus on securing project financing for ATJ plants and managing exposure to policy dependent tax credits and carbon related revenue streams.

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises.
On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable.
He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance.","By Kaushal Verma

New Delhi [India], January 10 (ANI): India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) is preparing to dilute up to 25% of its government stake as part of its next phase of evolution, ahead of the proposed Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Financial year 2027.

Speaking with ANI, Deputy Managing Director Palash Srivastava on Saturday, said that this move is likely part of the government's strategy to raise funds for infrastructure development and to promote private-sector participation.

""There is a lot of preparation to do, and we are on course for this to happen,"" Srivastava told ANI, adding that the timing of the proposed divestment aligns with a period when IIFCL's funding strategy is increasingly integrated with global capital markets.

IIFCL DMD's remarks came in the backdrop of reports that the government is considering selling stakes in IIFCL, its long-term infrastructure lending arm, and that the ministerial panel is expected to finalise the IPO structure, which may combine fresh equity issuance and a partial government stake sale to meet public shareholding norms.

IIFCL is a wholly owned Government of India company that provides long-term financing and advisory services for viable infrastructure projects in India, covering sectors such as energy, transport, water, and digital infrastructure, with the aim of boosting national development.

Talking on how global interest rate cycles affect infrastructure financing, Srivastava said IIFCL is ""very much linked to the global financing system"" and regularly borrows internationally on the strength of its own balance sheet. ""We have found that international market rate cuts also help our rates go down,"" he said.

He said IIFCL's borrowing rates are flexible and benchmark-linked. ""When the benchmark rates are cut, our rates also come down,"" Srivastava said, noting that this improves margins on infrastructure projects and makes IIFCL's participation in direct lending and takeout finance more competitive.

Highlighting the importance of floating-rate structures, he said, ""The floating rate regime is helping us tide over,"" adding that close to 55 per cent of IIFCL's portfolio is currently on a floating-rate basis. He said institutions funded through amortising and floating-rate loans or bonds benefit more from rate cuts, while those relying largely on fixed-rate bonds may see less impact.

On India's green transition, he said development finance institutions are ""actually the main influencers"" in making infrastructure projects green. He said the transition covers multiple dimensions, starting with renewables, where India has already made significant progress.

""About 500 gigawatt of solar and wind capacity is already in place,"" he said, adding that further expansion will not only help meet national targets but also promote manufacturing through green energy.

Srivastava said DFIs are also enabling the transition of hard-to-abate sectors. Referring to sustainable aviation fuel, he said, ""We have actually financed the sustainable aviation fuel export from India into the UK,"" demonstrating how financial institutions can provide enabling finance and effective support mechanisms for green transition.

On MSMEs, Srivastava said green transition must also extend to small enterprises. ""Our MSMEs also have to turn green,"" he said, adding that IIFCL is working with NITI Aayog on a programme to aggregate MSMEs in industrial clusters or estates. ""Aggregation is going to help,"" he said, noting that green energy can be supplied through rooftop solar or open access, while overcoming RESCOs' reluctance to take individual MSME credit exposure.

He said DFIs are also contributing through blended finance and guarantee mechanisms. ""There are certain conversations about green guarantees and green insurance,"" he said, describing them as part of the broader toolkit to help the Indian industry transition to green.

On geopolitical risks, Srivastava said geopolitics is ""a very important contributor"" to long-term infrastructure outcomes, especially in maritime infrastructure. ""Geopolitics affects trade first and foremost,"" he said, adding that trade dynamics shape the infrastructure ecosystem supporting export and import activity.

He said recent disturbances have shown how trade corridors and connectivity plans can be disrupted, underscoring the need for resilience in long-term infrastructure planning.

Turning to global supply chains, Srivastava said diversification trends have accelerated in recent years. ""Most economies don't want to put all their manufacturing in one country,"" he said, adding that manufacturing and secondary economic activities are increasingly shifting from the Global North to the Global South.

He said this presents opportunities for India, particularly in electronics manufacturing. ""We have been in conversations with bilateral partners like JBIC,"" Srivastava said, noting that long-term blended finance can help develop clusters, create value chains and strengthen shipping and logistics linkages.

Srivastava also said IIFCL has been in touch with the Sagarmala Development Finance Corporation and may partner with it under the proposed Maritime Development Fund.

Further on technology, he said artificial intelligence should be seen as ""a smart support system"" rather than a replacement for human judgment. ""I don't see it as anything more than an iteration over the decision support systems we already have,"" he said.

He said IIFCL has begun planning a transition to AI and machine learning to flag regulatory, compliance, international mandate-specific, and technology risks when a case is uploaded. ""This will enable an appraiser to get a broad brush reference immediately,"" he said.

Srivastava also discussed blockchain and smart contracts, noting that IIFCL would like to move toward smart financing. ""This will enable just-in-time financing to flow to projects and bring down the overall cost of financing,"" he said.

On global slowdown concerns, Srivastava said the key challenge to infrastructure growth is perception. ""The risk perception definitely affects investments,"" he said, stressing that policy continuity, consistent stress asset resolution and predictability in awards are critical to sustaining private sector capital expenditure.

On infrastructure demand, he said India's requirements remain structurally strong. ""As a country of 1.45 billion people, we definitely have a lot of infrastructure to build,"" Srivastava said, adding that domestic infrastructure demand is not materially affected by international impulses.

On climate risk, Srivastava said infrastructure projects typically span 20 to 25 years, making climate considerations unavoidable. ""These days, we are designing for climate events,"" he said, citing floods, droughts, cyclones and high-speed winds.

He said design parameters increasingly account for 1.5-degree and 2-degree temperature-rise scenarios, even though this entails additional costs. ""Together with CDRI, we have evolved a framework whereby financing for disaster-resilient infrastructure could be taken up,"" he said.

On funding strategy, he said external commercial borrowings are becoming a structural necessity. ""If I am trying to borrow money for 15 years or 20 years, I am not getting it in the commercial market in India,"" he said.

He added that IIFCL recently raised a 15-year amortising overseas loan at a very competitive cost using structured finance and hedging. ""Hedging is not such an issue,"" he said, noting that international banks can provide all-in hedging solutions.

On currency markets, Srivastava said improved rupee-dollar hedging frameworks could support deeper and more stable derivative markets. ""If DFIs collaborate, we could create economies of scale and get better hedging solutions,"" he said.

Highlighting internal developments, he said IIFCL has constituted 11 task forces to reinvent the institution. ""We are looking at a batch of new product offerings,"" he said, including bridge finance to address the 6 to 18 month delay in financial closure and subordinated debt products to support state governments in projects such as hybrid annuity models.

He said IIFCL is also standardising monitoring, reporting and verification protocols for green finance. ""We want a common MRV protocol,"" he said, so that international green capital does not impose additional conditionalities on Indian institutions.

Srivastava added that IIFCL is strengthening engagement with India-based multilaterals such as the International Solar Alliance, the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure and the Global Bioenergy Alliance as it prepares for the next phase of growth. (ANI)

Essentially, the expansion of sources for fuel improves strategic autonomy, reduces exposure to hostile supply chains, and ensures stability for future technological development.","The importance of jet fuel to any dynamic military goes without question. Fossil-based jet fuel is a critical commodity of concern for militaries worldwide, yet strategic thinkers, engineers, and leaders in the Royal Air Force (RAF) are exploring alternatives.

Military preparedness does not only require the newest technology; it needs the most advanced sources of energy. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) presents a critical new security asset for defence policies that can reduce dependency on non-renewable sources and fragile fuel supply chains. It also highlights a change in Western strategic thinking, forecasting how multi-polar dynamics are set to evolve globally.

This article is the opinion of the author and not necessarily that of the UK Defence Journal. If you would like to submit your own article on this topic or any other, please see our submission guidelines.

Western air forces face fundamental risks in access to global fossil fuel supply chains, whether from uncertainty in the Middle East, the Caribbean, or unfair trade practices from state-run companies in China or Russia. The RAF is dependent on imported oil, creating higher costs, vulnerable reliance on exporting countries, and inflexibility in military readiness and operational capacity. Using SAF as an alternative fuel actually reduces regular jet fuel use by 50%, with a healthy by-product of reducing carbon emissions by over 80%. SAF works by refining and distilling combustible hydrocarbons derived from fats, oils, wood waste, alcohols, and other organic materials into a fuel that is chemically similar to traditional jet fuel.

The distillation process removes impurities such as sulphur and aromatics, resulting in a cleaner-burning fuel that produces fewer particulates, burns more efficiently, and improves engine performance and longevity. SAF undoubtedly diversifies supply chains, and military demand incentivises chemical engineers to develop new fuels using on-shored production facilities.

The RAF has been flying jets with sustainable aviation fuels since 2021, but recently, Chinese manufacturers have taken the lead in exporting SAF to Europe. Chinese companies are expected to meet state-mandated export quotas, increasing manipulated market competition and raising concerns about the fuel as a strategic security asset. China holds the second-largest aviation market, positioning it to easily overpower Western markets through more streamlined manufacturing and state-run initiatives.

SAF has been costlier than traditional fossil fuels, especially in western markets where production efficiency lacks optimisation, feedstock supplies need expansion, and price differentials remain high. Markets have also lacked crucial intermediaries between innovation and military use. Logistics, aggregation, and cross-border distribution form the connective layer between SAF innovation and military adoption, where firms such as BGN Group operate.

BGN Group, a Swiss-based commodity trader, has secured a series of strategic SAF deals in recent years, designed to decouple aviation fuel supply chains from traditional, often volatile, oil-producing regions. By investing heavily in both infrastructure and supply logistics, the firm sets an example for the private sector to insulate sensitive and overly reliant industries from geopolitical vulnerabilities. These efforts are particularly critical for high-stakes operators like the RAF, where fuel and energy security becomes an issue of national security.

Growth in Western aviation markets has, likewise, been driven by friendshoring and inter-military cooperation. In the United States, for example, alternative fuels are being used to enhance mission flexibility and operational effectiveness, allowing military operations to utilize local or regionally produced fuels even when far from larger bases. SAF technology and information are shared between the US and European states through NATO cooperation, procurement, and shared production contracts. In 2022, the RAF flew a 100% sustainable flight using genetically modified bacteria as a fuel source and flew a drone using a synthetic fuel in collaboration with the US Navy.

In admiration of the success, Defence Procurement Minister Jeremy Quin said, “This is an exciting moment for the RAF and British industry as they continue to develop pioneering solutions to help address climate change. These new approaches will maintain our world-class fighting forces whilst reducing our carbon footprint.” While the US Navy noted that “finding innovative solutions to operational challenges, and the ability to manufacture this fuel without large infrastructure requirements would be ground-breaking for deployed forces.”

Defence industries in both Brussels and Washington are aligning as SAF development improves defensive capabilities and meets carbon emission reduction goals. The Department of Defense has steadily increased funding into the hundreds of millions of dollars for individual grants, research, and SAF procurement pilots. Similarly, offtake agreements across the public and private sectors in Europe and the US are stabilising demand expectations and encouraging long-term market trust and sustainability. In late 2025, three Memorandums of Understanding (MoU) were signed between Houston-based XCF Global (SAFX) and Impact Jets, BGN Group, and FlyORO, each aiming to scale SAF manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain solutions. BGN explicitly builds out supply chains and expands SAF distribution capacity while operating within the Western regulatory environment.

As they note in the MoU, the demand for SAF is expected to grow to 165 billion gallons annually by 2050, requiring the construction of up to 7000 new facilities worldwide. Western-based SAF development will ultimately advance military capacities for the US Air Force and RAF, reinforcing interoperability planning for the alliance and NATO logistics. Early movers in distillation and supply-chain integration will be best positioned to provide essential components and fuels at scale, ensuring allied forces retain operational flexibility in contested environments.

Team Washington refocused its national security strategy in 2025; however, the new emphasis on ‘America First’ military preparedness still shows strong compatibility with Brussels’ interest in climate sustainability, especially in the area of SAF. Western markets remain poised to scale transformative fuel solutions like SAF, innovating in collaboration through mutual understandings, military cooperation, and directed investments. Industrial alignment and technological transfer is increasing as well, with logistics networks from companies like BGN further supporting British and American strategic interests by participating in IATA trade rules, Western aviation standards, and international rule-of-law norms.

SAF acts as a transition technology, advancing sustainability and military competitiveness. It bridges innovative creators with real defensive needs from Western militaries, practically fulfilling security needs in unforeseen ways. Essentially, the expansion of sources for fuel improves strategic autonomy, reduces exposure to hostile supply chains, and ensures stability for future technological development. In the recent past, impetus for change was largely driven by ESG initiatives and climate narratives; now, however, it is clear that SAF is needed for competitive advantage. Competition with Chinese or Russian manufacturing is important globally, but Western militaries should be aware of supply chain dangers as China aims to dominate the market. SAF technology offers a solution to new thinking about energy independence and resilience, especially when advanced through open-market aligned firms. With the proper investment and government direction, SAF will serve to prepare militaries in new, more cost-effective ways while improving geopolitical autonomy in an increasingly multi-polar world.",https://ukdj.ams3.digitaloceanspaces.com/2024/01/83EAG-20240111-RUSHES-VOYAGER-TYPHOON-TAKEOFFS-002.00_02_37_05.Still018-copy.jpg.iCfh04veMWATAA.0i83YNt8pv.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 06:56:12.161269

Shell plc is no longer just an oil company. It is positioning itself as a full-stack energy and chemicals platform that sells molecules, electrons, and infrastructure across the entire value chain. From liquefied natural gas (LNG) and advanced petrochemicals to EV charging networks and renewable power trading, Shell plc is trying to turn a legacy hydrocarbon engine into a diversified energy machine that can survive — and profit — in a decarbonizing world.

This evolution matters because the traditional playbook for integrated oil and gas companies is under existential pressure. Investors want cash returns, regulators want emissions cuts, and customers want energy that is cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable. Shell plc’s core product today is not a single asset or technology, but an ecosystem: a global portfolio of upstream production, LNG, refining, petrochemicals, power trading, and customer-facing businesses, all wrapped in a narrative of ""orderly transition"" rather than abrupt disruption.

Inside the Flagship: Shell plc

When analysts talk about Shell plc as a product, they are increasingly talking about a portfolio architecture rather than a single headline asset. The company has been reshaping that architecture around several flagship pillars.

1. LNG and gas-centric energy

Shell is one of the world’s largest LNG players, and this is arguably its most defensible and differentiated product line. Through projects in Qatar, Australia, the U.S., and West Africa, Shell plc markets LNG as a transition fuel that can backstop intermittent renewables and displace coal. Its LNG trading, shipping, and regasification infrastructure create a global platform that smaller rivals struggle to match.

Beyond production, Shell’s integrated gas unit acts like a high-frequency logistics and arbitrage machine: buying, routing, blending, and selling cargoes into price-sensitive markets in Europe and Asia. That flexibility became a critical product feature when Russian pipeline gas to Europe collapsed; Shell plc’s LNG portfolio effectively became part of Europe’s energy security toolkit.

2. Integrated refining, chemicals, and low-carbon fuels

Shell has been pruning its older, less efficient refineries and retooling some into so-called ""energy and chemicals parks."" These assets are designed to shift from classic fuels into higher-margin and lower-carbon products: biofuels, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), lubricants, and performance chemicals.

At facilities like Shell’s Energy and Chemicals Park in Rotterdam and its operations in Singapore, the company is investing in renewable diesel, advanced biofuels made from waste feedstocks, and technologies to cut emissions intensity via electrification and carbon capture. The pitch is simple: if Shell can turn refineries into multi-output, lower-carbon product hubs, it can keep the infrastructure advantages of being a supermajor while aligning with net-zero policies.

3. Power, renewables, and EV charging

Shell plc’s growth-facing product set sits in its power and renewables portfolio and its global mobility business. Under the Shell Recharge brand, the company operates thousands of EV charge points across Europe, North America, and Asia, often integrated into its existing retail service stations. This allows Shell to use legacy real estate as a bridge from liquid fuels to electrons.

Beyond charging, Shell has been building a position in power generation and trading: offshore and onshore wind, solar farms, grid-scale batteries, and virtual power plants aggregating distributed energy resources. The company is less a pure-play green generator and more a power-market operator, using its trading DNA to balance intermittency and optimize pricing. For large corporates, Shell plc increasingly sells power purchase agreements (PPAs) and bundled decarbonization solutions rather than just diesel or gas.

4. Customer solutions and digitalization

On the customer side, Shell plc is wrapping all of this into more integrated offerings: fleet solutions that combine fuel cards, EV charging, telematics, and route optimization; B2B decarbonization packages blending biofuels, offsets, and consultancy; and digital apps that link retail fuels, charging, and loyalty programs.

The unifying theme is that Shell is trying to move from commodity seller to service provider. While molecules and megawatt-hours are still the revenue engine, the differentiation increasingly comes from integration, optionality, and data.

Market Rivals: Royal Dutch Shell A (alt) -> Shell plc vs. The Competition

Shell plc does not operate in a vacuum. Its closest peers are other European integrated energy majors that are undergoing their own transitions: BP plc and TotalEnergies SE are the most direct competitors, with ExxonMobil and Chevron acting as U.S.-centric hydrocarbon counterpoints.

BP: The ""Reinvented"" Energy Company

Compared directly to BP’s integrated energy portfolio, Shell plc looks more conservative but also more balanced. BP spent the early 2020s branding itself around aggressive renewables growth, from offshore wind auctions to large solar pipelines. It positioned EV charging under the BP Pulse brand and chased early-mover status in green power retail in markets like the UK and Germany.

However, BP backtracked on some of its most ambitious targets under investor pressure to prioritize returns from oil and gas. Shell plc, by contrast, set less extreme renewables volume targets but focused heavily on LNG and cash generation, using those flows to fund both shareholder returns and selective low-carbon bets.

In practical product terms:

Renewables and power: BP has been more aggressive in headline gigawatt-scale wind and solar projects. Shell plc leans more on LNG and power trading, plus targeted renewables plays where it can monetize volatility.

EV charging: BP Pulse vs. Shell Recharge is a tightly contested race. Shell’s advantage is its vast retail footprint and its ability to bundle charging with convenience retail and fleet services.

Hydrocarbon core: Shell’s LNG portfolio is widely viewed as stronger and more global than BP’s, giving Shell plc a more differentiated gas product.

TotalEnergies: The Multi-Energy Challenger

Compared directly to TotalEnergies’ multi-energy platform, Shell plc faces a rival that has arguably been more coherent in its rebranding from oil major to energy major. TotalEnergies has leaned hard into utility-scale solar and onshore renewables, building pipelines that make it look, in certain markets, as much like a power company as an oil company.

Yet Shell maintains several edges:

LNG scale: While TotalEnergies is a serious LNG player, Shell plc’s LNG trading and shipping network remains the industry benchmark. For customers buying flexible gas supply, that matters.

Retail and mobility: Shell operates one of the world’s largest fuel retail networks, and its pivot to EV charging and convenience retail at scale gives it a consumer presence TotalEnergies is still scaling toward.

Power trading: Shell’s capabilities in energy trading — both physical and financial — give it a formidable position as power markets get more volatile.

ExxonMobil and Chevron: Hydrocarbon Maximalists

Compared directly to ExxonMobil’s upstream-heavy portfolio and Chevron’s hydrocarbon-centered strategy, Shell plc looks more diversified and more aligned with European-style climate regulation. The U.S. majors are focusing on oil, gas, and carbon capture & storage (CCS) with far less emphasis on renewables and EV charging.

This divergence creates a clear competitive contrast:

Shell plc offers institutional investors a way to stay exposed to hydrocarbons, LNG, and cash flows while also owning a real — though still minority — stake in renewables, power, and EV infrastructure.

ExxonMobil and Chevron are effectively pure-play bets on a slower energy transition, while Shell positions itself as a hedge on both speed and direction of change.

The Competitive Edge: Why it Wins

Shell plc’s core advantage isn’t that it is the greenest, nor that it is the purest hydrocarbon play. Its edge is that it is building an integrated, transition-ready product stack that can flex depending on how policy, technology, and demand actually evolve.

1. LNG as a strategic backbone

LNG is the closest thing Shell plc has to a flagship product. It underpins the company’s narrative that natural gas will remain essential for power generation, industry, and heating for decades, particularly in Asia and Europe. Shell’s scale in LNG production, shipping, and marketing means it can arbitrage regional price differences and respond quickly when crises hit, as Europe’s gas crunch starkly demonstrated.

Where competitors might own impressive individual LNG assets, Shell plc owns a system. That system-level advantage is difficult and slow to replicate, making LNG a durable differentiator.

2. A portfolio built for optionality

Shell’s strategy emphasizes ""disciplined"" capital allocation into low-carbon businesses rather than all-out land-grabs. This has drawn criticism from climate advocates who want faster decarbonization, but from a product perspective it delivers optionality: if certain technologies — say hydrogen or advanced biofuels — scale successfully and profitably, Shell plc is positioned to ramp up; if they stall, it has not overcommitted.

This optionality-based approach differentiates Shell from BP’s earlier high-ambition renewables push and from Exxon’s low-renewables, CCS-heavy path. Shell plc is essentially selling investors a conviction-lite transition product: meaningful exposure to new energy, but not at the expense of short- and medium-term returns.

3. Customer integration and brand

Few energy companies have the consumer-facing footprint of Shell plc. Millions of daily retail transactions at service stations, a rapidly expanding Shell Recharge EV charging network, and deep relationships with commercial fleets give Shell data, loyalty, and cross-selling opportunities that utilities and pure-play renewables developers lack.

When a logistics company wants to decarbonize, Shell can offer a bundled solution: biofuels and lubricants now, EV and hydrogen options later, digital fleet optimization in the background. That integrated offer is a product in its own right, and it is harder for narrower competitors to match.

4. Trading and risk management as a product layer

As grids fill with variable renewables and as LNG and power markets become more volatile, trading and risk management become central to the value proposition. Here, Shell plc’s decades of experience in commodities trading turn into a software-like moat: complex models, algorithms, and human expertise that help customers manage price swings and supply risks.

Where some competitors sell energy units, Shell increasingly sells energy plus optionality, plus risk hedging — a higher-value bundle that leverages its scale.

Impact on Valuation and Stock

On the financial side, Shell plc — listed in London and other exchanges under ISIN NL0000009827 — remains a bellwether for how markets price the energy transition.

Real-time snapshot

As of the latest market data checked via multiple financial sources (including Yahoo Finance and MarketWatch) on a recent trading day, Shell plc’s stock was trading in line with other European energy majors, with valuation metrics reflecting a blend of classic oil & gas cash generation and cautious growth expectations in low-carbon segments. When markets are closed, investors focus on the last close price and the trailing performance over the preceding months, which has broadly tracked the swings in oil and gas prices as well as macroeconomic sentiment.

Importantly, the stock remains highly correlated with commodity cycles, but the narrative around it is shifting: investors increasingly scrutinize not just how much capital Shell returns via buybacks and dividends, but also where it allocates growth spend — LNG expansions, refinery-to-chemicals conversions, EV charging rollouts, renewables, and power trading capabilities.

Product portfolio as a valuation driver

The success of Shell plc’s product strategy influences its stock in several ways:

Cash engines: Upstream oil, gas, and LNG remain the core cash machines. Strong performance here funds shareholder distributions and underwrites investments in transition businesses. When these segments deliver high margins, markets are more tolerant of moderate spending on low-carbon projects.

Growth options: EV charging, renewables, and power trading are treated as long-dated growth options. Clear evidence of profitability or scalable competitive advantage in these areas can support a higher valuation multiple versus pure hydrocarbon peers.

Risk profile: A credible transition plan with tangible assets — energy and chemicals parks, LNG expansion, grid-scale renewables, and charging networks — helps reduce regulatory and stranded-asset risk in the eyes of ESG-sensitive investors.

Is it a growth driver?

Right now, Shell plc’s low-carbon and power businesses function more as strategic hedge and optionality than as the primary earnings engine. The growth story is that, over time, a larger share of Shell’s EBITDA will come from power, low-carbon fuels, and customer-centric energy solutions, supported by the LNG backbone.

For investors, Shell plc is effectively a transition hybrid: still heavily dependent on fossil-based revenues, but with a visible — if gradual — reallocation of capital toward products and platforms aligned with a lower-carbon future. How well Shell executes on this product roadmap will determine whether its stock continues to trade primarily as a cyclical oil play or earns a re-rating as a diversified, transition-resilient energy platform.",https://mdb.ad-hoc-news.de/bilder/bild-2405014_600_800.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 08:56:49.425679

As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.
The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era.","E-commerce has reshaped the world’s air cargo networks at breathtaking speed, and digitalisation, data, and collaboration are key to maximising the benefits.

What began as a small stream of lightweight ‘parcels’ has evolved into one of the industry’s strongest and most resilient growth engines, with volumes acting as a stabilising base amid cyclical downturns.

Even amid global trade uncertainty, capacity fluctuations, and cost pressures, e-commerce operations have continued to grow and evolve, especially in the last 10 years.

While e-commerce growth stabilised following the pandemic-driven surge, e-commerce sales surpassed $6.3trn in 2024 and are forecast to reach $8trn by 2027, according to eMarketer.

Online retail has continued to expand across emerging markets, with Southeast Asia, India, and the Middle East showing some of the world’s fastest growth rates.

While maritime and road transport handle the bulk of total e-commerce tonnage, air remains indispensable for cross-border, time-sensitive, and high-value shipments, particularly in the fast-moving sectors of electronics, fashion and healthcare.

Cross-border e-commerce has become a defining force in international logistics. According to IATA, cross-border shipments now represent up to 25% of global air cargo volumes, driven largely by consumer expectations for rapid fulfilment and visibility.

For airports, airlines, cargo ground handlers, and integrators, this segment oﬀers both promise and pressure. Consistent demand is paired with operational complexity that requires agility, digitalisation, and collaboration.

Harnessing technology is key to ensuring the air cargo industry will adapt to sustain and profit from e-commerce over the long term, while embracing flexibility is crucial to effectively deal with challenges.

One such challenge has been the legislative crackdowns on e-commerce this year.

The end of the de minimis exemption in the US saw volumes shift from China-US to China-Europe, demonstrating that the whole industry needs to be alert to how quickly demand and supply chains can shift, although volumes to the US have recovered and not to the detriment of volumes to Europe.

Meanwhile, European Union (EU) member states have agreed to introduce a €3 customs duty per item on e-commerce parcels valued below €150 from July 2026, to bridge the gap until the setting up of the EU Customs Data Hub in 2028. The UK also plans to end the de minimis exemption by March 2029 at the latest.

Rethinking networks and fleets

Airlines have also been forced to rethink the very structure of their cargo networks to support e-commerce developments.

The traditional long-haul, palletised model is evolving toward higher-frequency, regionalised operations, which emphasise speed, predictability, and often smaller shipment sizes.

Airlines are now actively adjusting fleet strategies to align with this demand. Narrowbody and converted freighters, such as 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighters (BCFs) and Airbus A321 passenger to freighter (P2F) conversions, are increasingly deployed to feed major hubs and connect secondary e-commerce gateways.

These aircraft oﬀer the flexibility and cost-eﬃciency needed for dense, high-frequency routes.

Some airlines are taking it further by developing dedicated e-commerce divisions or product verticals. China Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and Emirates SkyCargo, among others, have introduced specialised e-commerce solutions that blend air transport with digital order management and last-mile partnerships.

Meanwhile, integrators like FedEx, UPS, and DHL Express continue to expand regional air networks in Asia-Pacific to shorten delivery cycles and support marketplace-driven fulfilment models.

The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

From a revenue perspective, e-commerce is reshaping yield management. The smaller, high-turnover shipments typical of this trade generate a strong yield per kilogram compared to traditional freight, despite their operational complexity.

The challenge lies in achieving density and optimising capacity utilisation, especially when balancing postal, express, and general cargo flows on the same aircraft. Air cargo revenue management requires expertise.

Grounding eﬃciency

If airlines are the lift, ground handlers are the pulse of the e-commerce air cargo chain on the ground.

The volume and velocity of e-commerce shipments demand ground operations that incorporate automation, smart data flows, and precision timing.

This is confirmed by Nikolai Schaﬀener, global head of commercial, Swissport International. He says: “Ultimately, the cargo ground handler’s core business is to serve its airline customers. A mindset change is, however, required.

“Swissport encourages the entire community to look beyond the airline customer and provide a larger contribution to the overall air cargo ecosystem. This leads to increased collaboration where there is mutual willingness to do so. It requires entrepreneurial thinking in how the system works.”

The average e-commerce consignment is smaller, less uniform, and less predictable than traditional air cargo. A single flight can carry thousands of individual parcels, each with its own label and data record. For cargo handlers, this translates to higher handling intensity on a piece level and shorter processing windows.

To meet these challenges, major ground handling companies are investing heavily in digital infrastructure and automation.

Schaﬀner confirms: “Our focus is on a digital toolkit that enables transparency and consistency across our global network. We ensure that our Cargo Management System, Cargospot, is installed at each location globally. This enables standardised messaging and communication with our supply chain stakeholders.”

Many airports, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Liege and Leipzig, are developing e-commerce-dedicated terminals, often in partnership with integrators, airlines or large e-commerce platforms.

This includes Swissport with Schaﬀner confirming that “there is huge potential in first- and second-line warehousing”.

He adds: “This has taken place, for example, in our network in Liege and Amsterdam with ‘tailor-made’ handling solutions which are combined under one operational roof.

”Workforce dynamics are also shifting. Automation works hand in hand with manpower to provide the best and most efficient service to our customers.”

Handlers are trying to upskill their workforce to manage data-driven processes, exception handling, and digital traceability through a variety of change management programmes that include third-party workforce models.

These models often provide a great flexibility in the ‘plug and play’ approach, but ultimately, as Schaﬀner states, “the responsibility of delivery towards the customer is not outsourced”.

The future cargo terminal is as much about systems integration as it is about people, forklifts and mobile workstations.

Data handling capability

If e-commerce is the demand engine, data is the fuel. The modern e-commerce shipment travels first through networks of information before it even reaches the aircraft. Transparency, predictability, and digital compliance are non-negotiable.

The industry’s collective digitalisation push is accelerating. IATA’s ONE Record initiative, due to be implemented by 1 January 2026, is a key component to this evolution as it is designed to replace the legacy patchwork of messaging standards with a single, standardised data-sharing model.

With ONE Record, all stakeholders from airlines and handlers to customs and forwarders can access and update the same set of shipment data in real time.

The actual uptake in the industry, however, remains to be seen. It’s not just about the big players; it’s about the larger number of small- and medium-sized organisations at both ends of the supply chain.

This harmonisation is essential for e-commerce, where speed and visibility are critical diﬀerentiators. The goal is to move from a document-driven process to a data-centric supply chain, enabling faster clearance, pre-alerted handling, and predictive exception management.

Complementary eﬀorts such as Cargo iQ performance standards, electronic Air Waybill (e-AWB) adoption, and the expansion of API-based integrations between logistics tech providers are pushing the industry toward true end-to-end transparency, but there is a long way to go.

Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics are also taking hold. Airlines and cargo ground handlers are increasingly deploying machine learning models to forecast eCommerce peaks, predict oﬄoad risks, enable network steering, and dynamically allocate resources.

Customs authorities in several regions, particularly within the EU and Southeast Asia are exploring pre-clearance models using shared data pipelines — allowing shipments to clear before they even land.

The next phase will be interoperability — creating a unified digital language across diﬀerent cargo management systems, marketplaces, and logistics platforms. This is where the real eﬃciency gains will emerge.

Key challenges and constraints

Despite its momentum, the e-commerce air cargo ecosystem faces structural challenges that must be addressed for long-term sustainability.

1. Infrastructure pressure:

Major airport gateways such as Hong Kong, Incheon, Liege, and Amsterdam are seeing record volumes of small parcels, often stretching terminal capacity and sorting capabilities. Without investment in automation and smarter flow management, bottlenecks risk negating air transport’s speed advantage.

2. Data fragmentation:

While digitalisation is advancing, the global picture remains uneven. Many smaller forwarders and handlers still operate on manual or legacy systems. Without the broad adoption of common standards, the full benefits of ONE Record and similar initiatives cannot be realised.

3. Labour and skill shortages:

Handling e-commerce cargo eﬃciently requires both technology and skilled operators. Shortages in ramp and warehouse labour, combined with the need for digitally proficient staﬀ, continue to challenge throughput consistency — particularly in high-volume hubs.

4. Sustainability and public perception:

The e-commerce consumer’s desire for next-day delivery often clashes with growing scrutiny over the carbon footprint of aviation and logistics. Airlines are accelerating the shift toward Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and fleet renewal, while logistics providers are investing in electric ground vehicles and optimised routing. But achieving measurable progress requires coordinated industry eﬀort and transparent reporting.

Will e-commerce ever plateau?

In the near to medium term, the answer appears to be no. The rate of e-commerce growth may normalise, but it will remain a key driver of air cargo demand.

Delivery expectations are shifting from pure speed to predictability, visibility, and sustainability. Marketplaces and platforms will continue to consolidate their logistics ecosystems, with air cargo serving as the premium layer for time-definite deliveries and high-value goods.

What’s more, new product categories are entering the air e-commerce pipeline. Pharmaceuticals, temperature-sensitive goods, and direct-to-patient healthcare logistics are increasingly adopting the e-commerce model, further integrating traditional special handling cargo with retail distribution dynamics.

As automation and data maturity improve, we may see capacity planning evolve from reactive to predictive. Airlines could dynamically allocate belly space or freighter capacity based on e-commerce demand forecasts linked directly to online sales data.

The future e-commerce air cargo ecosystem will be less about chasing spikes and more about managing predictable, data-driven flows.

Collaborative future

E-commerce has, perhaps unintentionally, become the catalyst for long-needed transformation in the air cargo industry. It has forced stakeholders to confront fragmentation, data silos, and ineﬃciency head-on, therefore driving a collective shift toward integration.

Standardisation is there; it’s been around for a long time through IATA industry standards. But the old-time pain point of adoption is what’s needed to really embed this.

The most successful players will be those who view e-commerce not as a commodity flow but as a collaborative digital ecosystem. Airlines will need to forge freighter partnerships with cargo handlers, postal operators and platforms.

Handlers will need to invest in transparent systems that connect directly to airline and forwarder platforms. Regulators and customs authorities, too, will need to align on data-driven compliance models to enable true global harmonisation.

In this interconnected future, information becomes as valuable as cargo space. Data visibility, operational agility, and sustainable performance will define competitiveness far more than rate per kilo or transit time.

E-commerce has made the sector faster, smarter, and more customer-centric, but also more complex and data-dependent, which is the acceleration that’s been needed for several years to ensure the supply chain truly adopts the digital era.

As the global supply chain continues to digitalise, the distinction between e-commerce logistics and traditional airfreight will continue to widen.

The goal now is to ensure that the entire air cargo ecosystem, from the shipper to the consignee, moves in digital harmony.

The continued rise of e-commerce is not simply a trend; it is the foundation of a new air cargo era. Those who invest early in digital connectivity, harmonisation, and sustainable innovation will not only meet the challenge but define the standard for what comes next.",https://d1m8zjqyxnlv3j.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/2/6/2/12262_jameswyattphotoaeroconcept_776922.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 03:57:02.014253

Multiple industry stakeholders and association leaders have gone on record to say that, as far as U.S. ethanol production and opportunity go, Nebraska is second to none.

With 11 (and counting) confirmed plants either sending CO2 through the pipeline or in various stages of work to do so, producers in the Cornhusker State are playing a major role in the latest chapter of the American ethanol success story, says Ben Rhodes, executive director of the Nebraska Ethanol Board. “There has never been a better time than now to be a Nebraska ethanol producer,” Rhodes says.

Don’t be fooled by any perceived bias Rhodes may have for the state he works for. Shortly after the Tallgrass pipeline was officially placed into operation in fall 2025, Iowa Renewable Fuels Association Executive Director Monte Shaw offered his take.

“For the first time since 2000, Iowa is no longer the best place to produce corn ethanol,” Shaw said. “The plants on the Tallgrass pipeline now have a leg up in many ways.”

Plants on the Pipeline

Although it might be hard to determine which ethanol plant agreed in some fashion to participate in the Trailblazer pipeline first, there is no doubt that the first to ship real CO2 was Mid America Agri Products/Wheatland. The western Nebraska plant is the closest to Wyoming where the CO2 will be sequestered.

On Oct. 3, 2025, the plant in Madrid, Nebraska, about an hour southwest of North Platte, became the first customer to ship, according to Steven Davidson, Tallgrass’ vice president of government affairs. The original Trailblazer line flowed in the opposite direction than it does now and has transitioned from moving natural gas to compressed CO2.

For the MAAPW team, the Trailblazer announcement was the culmination of plant founder Robert “Bob” Lundeen’s last great project before his passing. Tina Lundeen Smith, executive vice president of business development at MAAPW, says her father Bob believed ethanol’s future depended on bold investment.

“Thanks to the vision of Nebraskans like Bob Lundeen, the state is now positioned at the forefront of the biofuel industry,” said Alison Nelson, segment president of CO2 business development and origination for Tallgrass at the time of the MAAPW announcement. “We are incredibly proud to work alongside MAAPW and others across Nebraska to make large-scale carbon capture a reality and demonstrate how rural economies can thrive while setting the standard for global energy innovation.”

MAAPW’s announcement was released on a Friday. By Tuesday the following week, Green Plains Inc. announced that it was successful in its startup of carbon capture and storage equipment at its 50 MMgy York, Nebraska, ethanol plant. The company’s 116 MMgy plant in Central City and 121 MMgy plant in Wood River, both in Nebraska, followed closely behind.

Carbon capture and sequestration via pipeline at York has long been part of Green Plains’ carbon strategy, says Chris Osowski, CEO. The three Green Plains Nebraska plants will contribute CO2 from 287 MMgy of ethanol production.

POET will connect its Fairmont, Nebraska, bioprocessing facility to Trailblazer, as well. The world’s largest producer of biofuels announced an agreement with Tallgrass in February 2025. At press time, no official announcement that POET was operating on Trailblazer has been made yet, but the company said in its initial February statement that once the Trailblazer was up and running in 2025, POET would have connectivity in the “near-term.”

ADM has also begun capturing and shipping CO2 on Trailblazer. With its Columbus, Nebraska, ethanol complex, ADM says it has the world’s largest ethanol carbon capture facility in the world. The 100 MMgy wet mill was connected to the Trailblazer by lateral lines using only voluntary easements by landowners, according to ADM. Like Green Plains, ADM’s team said the CCS project linked to the Trailblazer is a key part of its decarbonization strategy.

“This is an exciting project for the industry and for the future of CCS technology,” says Chris Cuddy, president, North America at ADM.

KAAPA Ethanol Holdings, an ethanol producer now owning and operating multiple plants in areas of close proximity to Trailblazer, also sees the pipeline as an important strategy for its future. Although the company had not yet announced its official operational status on the pipeline at press time, it is committed and has already invested in connecting its ethanol plants in Aurora and Ravenna.

In Lexington and Hastings, Nebraska, Chief Ethanol has connected two plants—fermentation CO2 from a combined 125 MMgy of ethanol production—to the Trailblazer pipeline. In October 2025, the company replaced its old scrubber with a new, larger CO2 scrubber to clean up the CO2 that leaves the fermenters prior to capture. The new unit has dramatically decreased the plant’s water use, according to Brent Jessop, manager at Chief Ethanol.

On the border of Nebraska and Iowa, the team at 140 MMgy Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy is working to connect to Trailblazer by mid-2026. Retired former CEO Mike Jerke has been active in his support of Trailblazer, writing letters to the Iowa Governor to effect legislation that would benefit the pipeline.

Commitment to Community

Advocates like Rhodes cite a unique aspect of the Trailblazer pipeline that was crucial to its ultimate success. Through the Trailblazer Community Benefits Agreement, ethanol producers will support direct funding to landowners who have agreed to site the pipeline on their properties in addition to the communities hosting infrastructure. The agreement also created rigorous landowner rights through the entire lifecycle of the pipeline.

Tallgrass formed the benefits agreement with the input and help of several organizations, including: Renewable Fuels Nebraska, Nebraska State Volunteer Firefighters Association, Nebraska Farm Bureau, Nebraska Corn Growers Association, Nebraska Cattlemen, Nebraska Farmers Union, Nebraska Soybean Association, Nebraska Sorghum Producers Association, Nebraska State Dairy Association, Nebraska Pork Producers Association and We Support AG. Bold Alliance, an organization formed to build “unlikely alliances to protect the land and water,” was also a big partner helping to form the agreement.

Monetary funding through the agreement also includes $500,000 commitments to nonprofits in the counties associated with the project. Another $400,000 commitment goes to first responders throughout the development of the pipeline, in addition to ongoing funding for essential equipment once the project is operational. If the pipeline is decommissioned, the easements will be returned to landowners who may elect to have the pipeline abandoned in place or removed from their property.

“Tallgrass is the first pipeline company we have encountered that has been willing to engage proactively, acknowledge the need for the landowner benefits that Bold fights to achieve, and genuinely commit itself to addressing those benefits by written agreement,” says Jane Kleeb, founder of Bold Alliance.

Close But Not Connected

Several more ethanol plants throughout Nebraska are close to the Trailblazer line but have not invested or committed to it. Some of those plants already have plans for alternative CO2 capture options.

Bridgeport Ethanol in far southwest Nebraska is working with Carbon America on a sequestration well and underground pipeline project. Through their agreement, Carbon America will finance, build, own and operate the CCS system utilizing CO2 produced from Bridgeport.

Valero Renewable Fuels - Albion, is on the Northern proximity of the Trailblazer line but the company has already committed to the proposed Summit Carbon Solutions option that would capture CO2 from several states before terminating in North Dakota.

Nebraska Corn Processing LLC in Cambridge, Nebraska, near the Kansas border, has no public plans for CO2 capture to date. Trenton Agri Products LLC, another southwestern Nebraska ethanol plant, has previously explored CO2 capture and sequestration options due to its location within a potential geologic formation capable of storing CO2.

Significance of Success

To Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, Trailblazer is a major step forward in proving what’s possible with CCS. It’s potential lies in more than its link to sustainable aviation fuel, he says.

“The most important point is this: Carbon capture isn’t some someday idea,” he says. “It’s happening right now. States that are embracing this technology are building new markets for ethanol, creating jobs, spurring rural economies and supporting farmers.”

States that are “slow-walking,” as Buis says, or blocking progress, run the risk of falling behind.

Rhodes and his team at NEB worked with Tallgrass to enable Trailblazer’s success, through educating audiences around the state about its benefits. The excitement surrounding the reality of the pipeline has prompted high hopes for 2026. It could be another banner year for the state, Rhodes says, as the team continues to work on forward-thinking research projects and developing new opportunities.

Buis says there is much to learn from the work of Rhodes and the success of the Trailblazer in Nebraska. Carbon capture succeeds when stakeholders stay focused, protect local economies and keep rural industries competitive, he says.

“Another lesson is that carbon capture is the future and long-term play,” he says. “The industry has to be proactive, whether its upgrading technology, building partnerships with farmers or preparing to meet standards.”

The Trailblazer ultimately succeeded, Buis says, because state leaders stepped up and saw the value early. Then, they worked to give energy producers and rural communities a fair, predictable permitting process. They focused on science, safety and what the project meant for Nebraska farmers, ethanol plants and long-term economic growth.

“We are at a tipping point and if America fails to lead, countries like Brazil, China and others will gladly step in to meet the demand for low-carbon fuels,” Buis says. “That means jobs, innovation and revenue leaving the Midwest (and the U.S.) and never coming back.”

Although the company’s name rarely appears to the traveling public, its technology forms the essential foundation of modern flight, operating as an invisible yet indispensable force beneath the wings and fuselages of aircraft.

The Industrial Engine Behind Aviation

Unlike consumer-facing brands, Safran functions as a critical infrastructure provider within the aerospace industry. Its extensive portfolio encompasses commercial jet engines, aircraft interiors, avionics, landing systems, military propulsion, and initiatives aimed at sustainable aviation. The company’s influence extends across multiple dimensions: enabling airlines to reduce fuel consumption, assisting air forces in modernizing their fleets, and supporting Europe’s strategic pursuit of aerospace autonomy.

Safran confronts a complex array of challenges, including the urgent need for aviation to decarbonize, reduce operating costs, and reinforce supply chains amid geopolitical uncertainties. Concurrently, defense clients demand enhanced range, stealth capabilities, and independence from foreign technologies. Positioned at the nexus of these pressures, Safran leverages its deep expertise in propulsion and avionics to reshape both the economics and capabilities of flight.

Propulsion at the Core

Central to Safran’s integrated portfolio is its propulsion and systems business, which serves both commercial and military aircraft. This ecosystem is anchored by several key pillars.

At the forefront of Safran’s commercial strategy is its 50/50 joint venture with GE Aerospace, CFM International, which produces the CFM LEAP engine family. These engines power prominent aircraft models such as the Airbus A320neo, Boeing 737 MAX, and COMAC C919. Safran supplies critical components including high-pressure turbines and advanced composite materials. The LEAP engine achieves significant fuel-burn reductions compared to its predecessors, driven by innovations such as advanced composite fan blades and cases that reduce weight and enhance efficiency, 3D-woven composite materials that improve hot-section durability, and a high-bypass architecture that enables quieter and more efficient operation. These technological advances directly contribute to lowering airline fuel costs and carbon dioxide emissions, positioning Safran at the forefront of aviation’s decarbonization efforts.

Looking to the future, Safran is co-developing the CFM RISE (Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines) program, which introduces an open-fan propulsion concept designed to deliver up to 20% additional fuel savings. The RISE engine features an unducted open-fan design that achieves ultra-high bypass ratios, hybrid-electric capabilities that anticipate evolving power grids and airframe technologies, and full compatibility with 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from the outset.

Navigating a Competitive Landscape

Safran’s leadership in aerospace innovation faces mounting challenges. The civil engine market is expected to become increasingly competitive, with 2026 potentially marking the beginning of a new “engine war” as rivals accelerate their technological advancements. In response, Safran has undertaken strategic initiatives such as divesting its in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) unit to Kingswood and integrating Skyted’s silent call technology into its passenger connectivity systems. These moves reflect the company’s efforts to sharpen its focus and maintain a competitive edge.

At the same time, competitors are advancing rapidly. Saab is developing software-defined fuselage technology, while Gogo’s Galileo system is poised to enter the inflight connectivity market, intensifying the race for technological supremacy.

As the aviation and defense industries confront increasing demands for efficiency, sustainability, and resilience, Safran S.A. remains a pivotal, though often unseen, force shaping the future of flight. Its capacity to innovate across propulsion, systems, and connectivity will influence not only its own trajectory but also the broader evolution of the aerospace sector.",https://pub-a51e4d676a044eb380faeff15def343e.r2.dev/2e7d79cab3be4cdb8609be55c3bea04e.avif,N,,2026-01-10 00:57:28.757370

On Thursday, Washington leaders launched a nonprofit committed to sustainable aviation fuel, which promises to reduce aviation carbon emissions by 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The nonprofit, called the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator, secured $20 million from state funding and a private donation to de-risk” the production of sustainable aviation fuel, making it easier for companies, universities and institutions to study, develop and, eventually, produce the alternative fuel source.

Sustainable aviation fuel has been in the works for nearly two decades, but the industry has not taken off. SAF is slow and costly to produce and, though the technology is mature, there are few facilities producing the alternative fuel.

SAF accounted for less than 1% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to a December report from the International Air Transport Association.

On Thursday, Washington’s elected officials and aviation leaders gathered at Boeing’s Future of Flight museum in Mukilteo to celebrate the new initiative. Leaders from Boeing, Alaska, Amazon, Washington State University and the state Department of Commerce pledged again and again that Washington would be at the forefront of sustainable aviation, carrying on a legacy of aviation firsts in the state.

“We have all the pieces in place to ensure this once-in-a-generation economic opportunity is realized, and this accelerator will make that happen,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said.

“You have a partner in the state of Washington,” he told the aviation industry. “For this truly historic opportunity, we have to move our state forward.”

SAF is an alternative to petroleum that makes fuel from so-called “feedstocks. There are several ways to make it, but all capture gases from renewable sources, like used cooking oils or animal waste. After a complicated process, SAF is eventually mixed with traditional jet fuel to lower carbon emissions during flight.

The accelerator introduced Thursday is meant to speed up both research and production, which will enable the state to produce SAF on a large scale. It will put Washington at the forefront of what the state expects will be the next economic boom in the aviation industry, the nonprofit’s leaders said.

Washington already passed legislation to accelerate permitting and environmental review for construction of clean energy plants and introduced a tax credit that provides subsidies for SAF.

At the celebratory event Thursday, Boeing announced that, starting this year, all its flights for operations and deliveries from Renton, Everett and Paine Field will fly on up to 30% SAF.

And SkyNRG, a Dutch company building a sustainable fuel production facility in Walla Walla, said Thursday it had completed state and county environmental reviews that will allow it to move forward with construction.

A ‘catalyst’ for the industry

The aviation industry has been chasing SAF for decades. Boeing conducted the world’s first test flight powered by biofuels with Virgin Atlantic in 2008.

Yet SAF production accounted for just 0.6% of annual jet fuel consumption last year, according to the December report from the International Air Transport Association.

SAF production doubled from 2024 to 2025, IATA found, totaling about 634 million gallons last year. For comparison, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport alone uses about 600 million gallons of jet fuel annually, according to the Port of Seattle.

The alternative fuel is also still pricey, IATA found. In 2025, the extra costs associated with SAF added $3.6 billion in fuel costs for the aviation industry.

On Thursday, Washington’s aviation industry nonetheless projected optimism. The accelerator it introduced is meant to tackle those problems, its supporters repeated over the course of the event.

Washington State University President Elizabeth Cantwell told the group “it’s probably late to the game to begin solving it at this scale, but it’s not too little. It’s exactly what’s needed.”

The accelerator’s list of partners is extensive: Alaska Airlines, Amazon, Boeing, the Port of Seattle, Snohomish County, the state Department of Commerce and Washington State University.

The group received $10 million in state appropriations last year and another $10 million from a philanthropic gift, said Sen. Marko Liias, a Democrat representing Edmonds. “We are now sitting on $20 million to catalyze this industry,” he said.

It’s not clear how far that funding will go, though.

SkyNRG, the Dutch company, originally estimated it would need $600 million to $800 million to get its facility up and running.

SkyNRG plant moves forward

John Plaza, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, acknowledged at Thursday’s event that the industry has more demand for SAF than supply, but urged attendees to consider how far the initiative has come in the last 20 years.

“Lots of people like to say ‘there’s not enough SAF, we haven’t made enough progress,’” Plaza said. “Today, we’re past the theory. We’re into the implementation.”

SkyNRG set out to develop its Washington site in 2023, calling it Project Wigeon. The facility will sit on a 165-acre site at Wallula Gap and, once up and running, will produce 50 million gallons of SAF a year.

SkyNRG said Thursday the company secured approval from the state Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County to begin construction.

The company will start construction in 2028 and begin producing SAF in 2030.

Plaza declined to share how much private funding the company has for the Walla Walla facility. In 2025, the state Department of Commerce awarded a $1.5 million grant to the Port of Walla Walla to support SkyNRG’s construction of the facility.

Andy Billig, a former Washington state senator and now senior adviser for SkyNRG, said passing those environmental reviews was the hardest part of the process. The technology SkyNRG will use to make SAF is already in use elsewhere, Billig said, so he isn’t worried about putting it into practice.

“Now it feels like not easy sailing, but easier sailing,” he said.",https://thumb.spokesman.com/l2sMHX5ZvY-IivJJOF8GNS33NSY=/600x0/media.spokesman.com/graphics/2020/08/sr_placeholder.png,N,,2026-01-09 19:57:45.027416

Corteva and bp have announced the launch of Etlas, a new joint venture focused on producing oilseed crops for biofuel production. Etlas will grow crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower to create feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

The venture brings together Corteva’s expertise in seed technology and bp’s experience in fuel refining and marketing. The goal is to build a strong and reliable supply of plant-based feedstock to meet the fast-growing global demand for cleaner fuels.

Etlas plans to produce one million metric tonnes of feedstock each year by the mid-2030s. This amount could support the production of more than 800,000 tonnes of biofuel annually. Initial supplies are expected to begin in 2027 and will be used at existing refineries and dedicated biofuel plants.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business.

Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel is rising quickly. Industry estimates show that demand for SAF could reach 10 million tonnes by 2030, while renewable diesel demand could grow to 35 million tonnes. Etlas aims to help meet this growing need with a dependable and scalable supply.

The crops used by Etlas will be grown on existing farmland between main food crop seasons. These crops can improve soil health and provide farmers with an extra source of income without requiring additional land.

Etlas will be led by Ignacio Conti as Chief Executive Officer, with Gaurav Sonar serving as Chair of the Board. The company plans to work closely with farmers around the world to expand production and support clean energy goals.

Through Etlas, agriculture will play an important role in supporting cleaner fuel solutions for transportation while offering farmers new opportunities for revenue and sustainability.

“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”",,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:31.231651

A major highlight of the project was the plant’s ability to meet and exceed its guaranteed performance criteria.
After achieving steady-state operations, the facility maintained ethanol yields above the guaranteed threshold for more than 14 consecutive days.
This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.","LanzaTech Global, Inc. has reported the successful achievement of guaranteed operational performance at a municipal solid waste (MSW)–to–ethanol pilot facility in Japan, marking an important milestone in the commercialization of industrial carbon recycling technologies. The facility, located in Kuji City in Iwate Prefecture, is owned and operated by SEKISUI CHEMICAL CO., LTD., a long-term partner of LanzaTech, and represents a one-tenth commercial-scale demonstration of waste-to-ethanol production.

With an annual production capacity of approximately 400 metric tons of ethanol, the pilot plant began operations following mechanical completion in April 2022 and remained in operation for nearly four years. During this period, the facility consistently demonstrated the ability of LanzaTech’s proprietary gas fermentation technology to process highly heterogeneous and unsorted non-recyclable municipal waste streams. These materials would otherwise be disposed of through landfilling or incineration, both of which carry significant environmental burdens. The successful handling of such variable feedstocks highlights the adaptability of the technology to regional differences in waste composition, a key requirement for enabling a truly global circular carbon economy.

The Kuji waste-to-ethanol project was supported through investment by SBR, a joint venture between Sekisui Chemical and INCJ, which operates under the oversight of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. Additional financial backing was provided by the Ministry of the Environment Japan, reflecting strong governmental support for innovative low-carbon and waste-reduction technologies.

A major highlight of the project was the plant’s ability to meet and exceed its guaranteed performance criteria. After achieving steady-state operations, the facility maintained ethanol yields above the guaranteed threshold for more than 14 consecutive days. This represented the most productive fermentation campaign recorded at the site to date. Importantly, this level of performance was sustained even while operating under particularly challenging conditions, including difficult and variable gas compositions.

The plant processed synthesis gas containing a combined carbon monoxide and hydrogen concentration ranging between 40% and 55%, with hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratios fluctuating from 1.1 to 1.4. Such gas compositions can pose significant challenges for many conventional catalytic conversion technologies. LanzaTech’s process, however, demonstrated exceptional resilience and flexibility, maintaining high ethanol productivity despite these demanding parameters. This achievement underscores the robustness of biological gas fermentation compared with more rigid chemical conversion pathways.

Gasification itself is a well-established method for converting solid waste into syngas, and LanzaTech has previously integrated its fermentation platform with several conventional gasifier systems. The Kuji project also served as a testing ground for collaboration around a novel gasifier design. Despite variability in feed gas quality, the fermentation system remained stable and consistently met performance targets, further validating the reliability of the technology.

Commenting on the achievement, Jennifer Holmgren, Chief Executive Officer of LanzaTech, expressed pride in the collaborative success of the project and acknowledged the contributions of Sekisui Chemical, the local authorities in Kuji City and Iwate Prefecture, and the Government of Japan. She emphasized that the results reaffirm the scalability and technical soundness of LanzaTech’s platform and signaled optimism for expanding sustainable fuel and chemical production in Japan and other markets.

Looking ahead, LanzaTech continues to advance waste-to-energy and waste-to-fuels solutions that support circular economy principles. By converting problematic waste streams into valuable ethanol and other chemical feedstocks—potentially including inputs for sustainable aviation fuel—the company aims to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and accelerate the transition toward low-carbon industrial systems worldwide.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2026-01-10 03:58:35.809948

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft.
More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators.
And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.
Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.","Correction: A previous version of this article mischaracterized the Commercial Drone Alliance’s stance on UAS manufactured in China. This story has been updated to reflect the group’s neutral position.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on Wednesday partially reversed a sweeping ban on the sale of foreign drones and components. But to the chagrin of American uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) operators, the ban still covers China’s DJI, which produces some of the world’s most widely used drones.

The FCC in December added all UAS and components produced in foreign countries to its covered list at the direction of the White House, which determined they pose “unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States and to the safety and security of U.S. persons.”

The ban does not affect equipment previously authorized by the FCC or already in the hands of American consumers. But it effectively prohibits the sale of any new foreign models in the U.S. It also impacts new components such as cameras and batteries, which could make it more difficult to maintain or upgrade approved drones.

On Wednesday, the FCC loosened the ban, exempting UAS and critical components on the Pentagon’s Blue List of cleared UAS aircraft. That means drones produced by Parrot, Aerovironment, Teledyne FLIR, AgEagle Aerial Systems, Wingtra, Auterion, and others on the list will remain available. So too will components produced by Sony, Nvidia, Panasonic, and others.

“UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list have met the highest security standards so they are able to operate in sensitive environments, protect sensitive information, and prevent cyber vulnerabilities,” an FCC notice announcing the move reads. “Given the extensive testing of the Blue listed UAS and UAS critical components, the [Pentagon] has determined that UAS and UAS components included on the Blue UAS list, do not pose unacceptable risks to the national security of the United States.”

The exemption will expire in 2027 and be reassessed to determine if foreign equipment is “hampering the resiliency of our domestic drone industrial base,” the notice adds.

Also exempted are UAS and components that are manufactured in the U.S., so long as domestic components account for 65 percent of the cost of the finished product. That provision will also sunset in 2027. The FCC said the industry should view the 65 percent requirement as a “baseline” that will be raised in the future.

The agency further clarified that the ban does not impact drones made exclusively for use by the U.S. government.

DJI Ban Persists

Federal officials and industry groups such as the Association for Uncrewed Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) have long clamored for restrictions on foreign drones, citing them as a national security concern and a hindrance to American UAS manufacturing.

In 2020, for example, DJI’s market share among U.S. hobbyists and public safety operators was estimated as high as 77 and 90 percent, respectively. Officials and industry stakeholders worry about the potential of the manufacturer’s drones to surveil American citizens and infrastructure. The Pentagon went as far as labelling DJI a “Chinese military company”—a designation the company sought but failed to reverse in September.

However, some in the industry felt the FCC’s initial ban went too far.

“We were surprised by the expansion of the FCC’s action to add UAS and UAS critical components produced in any foreign country, rather than just certain foreign adversary produced drones, to the covered list,” the Commercial Drone Alliance, which has adopted a neutral stance toward Chinese UAS, said in a statement Monday. “The scope of this action will create unnecessary challenges for American innovators without thoughtful implementation.”

The majority of American drone operators surveyed by The Pilot Institute, which offers online drone and airplane training, share that sentiment.

In a white paper published Wednesday, the company said it surveyed 8,056 stakeholders, most of whom identified as commercial or professional drone operators. More than 43 percent of them said their business could shutter if the DJI ban remains, including more than half of agriculture, public safety, and utility operators. About 47 percent said they support targeted restrictions on foreign drones—in line with the FCC’s Wednesday update—but only for sensitive government or critical infrastructure uses.

Strikingly, 70 percent of respondents said they operate drone fleets that are fully DJI. Eighty-five percent said DJI drones make up at least three-quarters of their fleet. And 97 percent said they use at least one DJI drone.

By contrast, only 5 percent of respondents said their drones come from Skydio, one of the leading American manufacturers. Nearly 30 percent said there is no FCC-approved alternative to DJI that meets their needs, citing higher costs and lower performance and reliability.

Overall, about 58 percent of operators said they are “extremely concerned” about the direction of U.S. policies on foreign UAS.

“More than 80 percent of the nation’s 1,800-plus state and local law enforcement and emergency response agencies that operate drone programs use DJI technology; these programs will be at immediate risk if they no longer have access to the most cost effective and efficient drone technology available,” DJI wrote in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in December.",https://flyingmag1.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/DJI-2-1.jpg,N,,2026-01-10 00:57:44.896444

The Sustainable Markets Initiative has appointed Paul Griffiths, chief executive of Dubai Airports, as CEO Champion of its Sustainable Aviation Fuel Pathfinder Initiative, the organisation said on Thursday. According to the original source, the initiative, founded by UK's King Charles III in 2020 when he was Prince of Wales, aims to accelerate the production and adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is widely seen as the most viable near-term option for cutting aviation emissions.

SAF can reduce flight emissions by up to 80 per cent, but currently accounts for less than 1 per cent of global jet fuel supply. The SAF Pathfinder Initiative focuses on mobilising investment and demand signals to unlock production, advocating for harmonised global policies and incentives, enabling critical infrastructure upgrades, and driving collaboration across the aviation supply chain to address production and cost barriers.

Griffiths appointment comes as pressure mounts on the aviation industry to meet its long-term climate targets, including a sector-wide goal of net zero emissions by 2050. ""Im honoured to take on this role at such a critical time for our industry,"" Griffiths said in a statement. ""Sustainable aviation fuel is one of the most important levers we have to decarbonise flight, and Im committed to accelerating its availability and adoption across the sector.""

Griffiths said the work would align with the oneDXB Sustainability Alliance, a multi-stakeholder initiative led by Dubai Airports, which aims to drive decarbonisation, innovation, and resilience across Dubai International Airport and Dubai World Central - Al Maktoum International. Under Griffiths leadership, Dubai Airports has achieved Level 4 ""Transformation"" accreditation from Airports Council International, placing it among the top 5 per cent of airports globally.

The accreditation reflects measures including collaboration with partners, the use of biodiesel-powered ground fleets, and the rollout of green infrastructure projects at Dubai International Airport. Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, chief executive of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, said SAF could play a central role beyond aviation. ""We view Sustainable Aviation Fuel as a powerful catalyst, not only for decarbonising aviation, but also for driving the global expansion of sustainable technologies and investment,"" she said.

GREENVILLE, SC, UNITED STATES, January 9, 2026 /EINPresswire.com/ — The U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities (the Endowment) has announced a new collaboration with the Georgia Institute of Technology. This partnership aims to address the far-reaching social, economic and environmental impacts of pulp and paper mill closures across the United States, particularly in the rural South, where these mills have long served as economic anchors.

The Endowment and Georgia Tech’s Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) are developing an integrated decision-making dashboard to help policymakers, community leaders and industry stakeholders quantify the effects of mill closures and identify data-driven pathways to offset them through the sustainable use of forestry residues to produce bioenergy, renewable diesel, and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Over the past decade, nearly 50 paper mills have shut down nationwide, including major facilities in Georgia, South Carolina, Louisiana, Texas and Ohio. These closures have resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs and disrupted local supply chains that once connected family forest owners, loggers, sawmills and manufacturers in tightly interdependent networks. As markets for timber and forestry byproducts contract, landowners face reduced incentives for active management – conditions that can increase the risk of wildfire, invasive species and forest conversion to other uses.

“Across the Southeast, the closure of major paper mills has disrupted livelihoods, strained local economies and weakened the markets that keep forests healthy,” said Pete Madden, president and CEO of the U.S. Endowment for Forestry and Communities. “By combining the Endowment’s industry expertise with Georgia Tech’s data modeling capabilities, we’re helping communities understand these impacts and uncover new opportunities for resilient growth.”

The Endowment–Georgia Tech collaboration seeks to turn this challenge into opportunity.

Using key performance indicators such as jobs created or retained, capital and operational expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX), energy and SAF output potential, and regional economic metrics, the tool will offer a transparent, quantitative framework for decision-makers to assess the trade-offs and benefits of emerging forest-based industries.

“The forest sector is in a period of transition, and data-driven analysis will be key to ensuring that change supports both people and the planet,” said Dimitri Mavris, ASDL director and Regent’s Professor in the Guggenheim School. “Through this partnership, we’re building a model that not only captures economic realities but also points toward responsible, resilient solutions.”

Ultimately, this effort aims to reimagine the role of forestry residues — once viewed as a byproduct — as a foundation for renewable energy innovation. By aligning rural development, responsible forestry and energy security, the project seeks to chart a path where the decline of traditional industries can give rise to new, regenerative ones.

The effort is part of ASDL’s Grand Challenges program, which gives teams of first-year graduate students a broad, open-ended problem to address. Students must become fluent in their challenge area, learn about the techniques and methods available to assist with problem-solving, and determine the data and scope of modeling required to present results and findings. Examples of previous projects include creating a systems approach to planetary defense, a U.S. Coast Guard integrated deepwater system, and a commercial air transportation system-of-systems probabilistic air travel demand tool.

The Endowment project will be conducted over the course of two academic semesters, concluding with a final presentation in Spring 2026 to ASDL’s External Advisory Board and other sponsors and stakeholders.

About the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL)

ASDL is a leader in the area of systems design and was created in 1992 in response to feedback from companies that universities produced scientists, not engineers. Part of the Daniel Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the lab was formed to help support the industrial need for large-scale systems integration. Starting with a handful of students, the lab has grown to more than 50 research faculty and 300 students organized into seven divisions.

A Chinese UCO producer reported a slight increase in domestic UCO prices, particularly for premium UCO.
As a result, some sellers now prefer to supply domestic SAF plants, given the subdued demand from export markets such as Europe.
""Despite ongoing plant maintenance, some facilities are still actively procuring feedstocks,"" a UCO collector said, noting that North China UCO prices remain supported even with maintenance activities.","The China domestic used cooking oil market is showing signs of recovery in early 2026, reversing its earlier contraction as market dynamics shift. This improvement was driven by market participants selling UCO feedstocks to domestic sustainable aviation fuel plants. Chinese SAF producers have pivoted to hydrotreated vegetable oil production while awaiting SAF approval, according to market participants.

On Jan. 9, Platts, part of S&P Global Energy, assessed UCO DAP prices at major Chinese ports as follows: Tianjin Port, North China at Yuan 7,000/mt, up 2.19% from the recent low of Yuan 6,850/mt on Dec. 23; Nantong Port, East China at Yuan 7,050/mt, up 2.92% from the same low; and Nansha Port, South China at Yuan 7,050/mt, up 2.32% from Yuan 6,890/mt on Jan. 5.

In September, prices reached yearly highs before declining: Tianjin Port rose to Yuan 7,925/mt on Sept. 23, then fell 7.95% to Yuan 7,295/mt by Dec. 4; Nantong Port peaked at Yuan 7,975/mt on Sept. 18, dropping 8.53% to Yuan 7,295/mt; and Nansha Port climbed to Yuan 7,725/mt on Sept. 17, before falling 6.86% to Yuan 7,195/mt on Dec. 4.

Domestic feedstock availability

A representative from a trading house noted that a significant portion of UCO supplies is currently being directed to SAF plants, as demand from major export markets remains weak.

""We've heard there is some demand for feedstocks from SAF plants, which might help support domestic UCO prices,"" the representative said.

A Chinese UCO producer reported a slight increase in domestic UCO prices, particularly for premium UCO. ""I think there might be some movement in the export market in late January. The market should see some activity before the upcoming Lunar New Year celebration, and I believe there will still be some transactions taking place,"" the producer said.

An East China-based UCO supplier reported that, following recent tenders from SAF plants, premium UCO feedstock prices had increased slightly. European buyers continue to see Chinese UCO as too expensive. Although SAF producers' buying prices have declined compared to last year, pressure from European buyers is even greater. As a result, some sellers now prefer to supply domestic SAF plants, given the subdued demand from export markets such as Europe.

""Despite ongoing plant maintenance, some facilities are still actively procuring feedstocks,"" a UCO collector said, noting that North China UCO prices remain supported even with maintenance activities.

Chinese SAF producers pivot to HVO

According to market participants, despite the imposition of antidumping duties from Europe, HVO production is still profitable due to high market prices -- even after accounting for duties and other costs. Additionally, domestic feedstock prices in China are currently below previous highs, making large-scale HVO production viable for producers.

This explains why, before obtaining SAF whitelist approval, producers are focusing on HVO production. This strategy enables them to maintain their operations and generate profits while awaiting SAF approval.

Rather than waiting, companies are seizing current opportunities in the international HVO market to expand production capacity, boost cash flow, and fortify their supply chains.

In a move that could reshape the aviation industry’s approach to environmental challenges, leaders from Amazon, Boeing, and regional government officials have unveiled the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator. This initiative, launched on January 8, 2026, in Mukilteo, Washington, aims to position the Pacific Northwest as a global hub for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The accelerator brings together a coalition of industry heavyweights, academic institutions, and policymakers to accelerate the development, production, and adoption of SAF, which promises to slash lifecycle emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The launch event, held at the Future of Flight Aviation Center, featured prominent figures including Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson, Amazon’s Vice President of Worldwide Sustainability Kara Hurst, and Boeing’s Chief Sustainability Officer Chris Raymond. According to reports from GeekWire, the gathering highlighted the region’s unique assets, such as its abundant agricultural and forestry resources, which could serve as feedstocks for SAF production. Ferguson described it as a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to leverage the area’s innovation ecosystem for climate action.

This partnership isn’t just ceremonial; it’s backed by concrete commitments. The accelerator will focus on scaling SAF supply chains, fostering technological innovations, and addressing regulatory hurdles. Participants include major airlines like Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines, as well as universities such as Washington State University, which will contribute research expertise in biofuel development.

The Coalition’s Ambitious Blueprint

At the heart of the accelerator is a collaborative model designed to bridge gaps between research, production, and commercial deployment. Sources from Alaska Airlines’ news portal detail how the initiative will prioritize rapid scaling of SAF production, targeting feedstocks like agricultural waste, forestry residues, and even municipal solid waste. This approach aligns with broader industry goals to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, as outlined in international aviation agreements.

Boeing, a key player, brings its extensive experience in sustainability efforts. The company’s website notes its long history of pioneering eco-friendly technologies, including the ecoDemonstrator program that has tested over 230 innovations since 2012. Chris Raymond emphasized during the launch that Boeing’s involvement will include sharing insights from its ongoing work on non-CO2 emissions mitigation, such as contrails, which contribute to aviation’s climate impact.

Amazon’s role is equally pivotal, given its massive air cargo operations through Prime Air. With a fleet projected to expand significantly, the company has a vested interest in sustainable fuels to meet its own carbon-neutral goals by 2040. Kara Hurst highlighted how the accelerator could help decarbonize e-commerce logistics, drawing on Amazon’s investments in renewable energy and electric vehicles.

Regional Strengths and Economic Stakes

The Pacific Northwest’s push comes at a critical time for aviation, which accounts for about 2-3% of global CO2 emissions but faces growing scrutiny amid climate concerns. Local leaders point to the region’s natural advantages: vast forests for biomass, innovative tech hubs in Seattle, and a robust aerospace manufacturing base anchored by Boeing. A post on X from Boeing in Washington underscored the economic benefits, noting that aviation drives tourism and jobs, making SAF adoption essential for long-term growth.

Academic partners like Washington State University are set to play a crucial role. As detailed in WSU Insider, the university will lead efforts in feedstock research and conversion technologies, building on its expertise in bioenergy. This collaboration could unlock new methods for producing SAF at scale, potentially reducing costs that currently make it two to eight times more expensive than conventional fuel.

Government support is another linchpin. Gov. Ferguson’s administration has committed to policy frameworks that incentivize SAF, including tax credits and infrastructure investments. Reports from Lynnwood Times indicate that the state revised its climate impact data recently, providing a clearer picture of aviation’s footprint and justifying the accelerator’s urgency.

Overcoming Hurdles in SAF Adoption

Despite the optimism, challenges abound. SAF production globally is still nascent, representing less than 1% of jet fuel demand. The accelerator aims to tackle this by creating a regional supply chain that could serve as a model for others. Insights from recent news on KING 5 highlight how Washington’s bet on cleaner fuels follows updated emissions data, emphasizing the need for immediate action.

Industry insiders note that feedstock availability is a key bottleneck. The Pacific Northwest’s agricultural sector could provide corn stover or wheat straw, but competition with food production and land use concerns must be addressed. Boeing’s sustainability plan, as covered in Sustainability Magazine, includes strategies for sustainable sourcing, which the accelerator will likely adopt.

Moreover, technological innovation is vital. Posts on X from aerospace enthusiasts, such as those discussing blended wing body designs or supersonic sustainable flights, reflect a broader sentiment of excitement around aviation’s green transformation. For instance, historical tweets from Boom Supersonic and United Airlines show ongoing commitments to net-zero technologies, mirroring the accelerator’s goals.

Broader Industry Implications

The Cascadia initiative could influence national and global standards. With Boeing’s coalition work alongside NASA on projects like the X-66A demonstrator, as mentioned in X posts referencing truss-braced wing designs, the accelerator might integrate such aerodynamic advancements with SAF to amplify efficiency gains.

Amazon’s involvement extends beyond aviation; it’s part of the company’s holistic sustainability strategy. A Bloomberg tweet from 2020 projected Amazon’s air fleet growth, underscoring the e-commerce giant’s stake in scalable green solutions. By partnering here, Amazon could pilot SAF in its cargo operations, providing real-world data to refine the technology.

Regional carriers like Alaska Airlines are already committing to SAF blends. Their recent order of 110 Boeing planes, reported in The New York Times, signals expansion plans that hinge on sustainable fuels to meet regulatory pressures and consumer demands for eco-friendly travel.

Stakeholder Perspectives and Future Outlook

Feedback from the launch has been overwhelmingly positive. GeekWire captured quotes from executives calling it a “game-changer” for the region. Alaska Airlines’ involvement, detailed in their announcements, positions them as a testbed for SAF adoption, potentially influencing routes across the West Coast.

Critics, however, caution about the timeline. Scaling SAF to meaningful levels by 2030 requires billions in investment, and geopolitical factors like energy prices could disrupt progress. Yet, the accelerator’s multi-stakeholder approach—encompassing government, industry, and academia—offers a resilient framework.

Looking ahead, the initiative could catalyze job creation in biofuel refineries and research labs. WSU Insider reports estimate thousands of new positions, bolstering the Pacific Northwest’s economy while advancing climate goals.

Innovation at the Intersection of Tech and Aviation

Beyond fuels, the accelerator may spur related technologies. Boeing’s website highlights past milestones, like hydrogen-powered flights in 2008, which could inform future SAF-compatible engines. Integrating these with Amazon’s logistics expertise might lead to hybrid systems optimizing fuel use in cargo fleets.

X posts from figures like Mario Nawfal discuss innovative aircraft designs, such as the “flying pancake” blended wing body, which could enhance SAF efficiency. This sentiment aligns with the accelerator’s innovation focus, potentially attracting startups to the region.

Furthermore, the partnership reflects a shift toward collaborative decarbonization. As Simple Flying notes in their analysis of Boeing versus Airbus in 2026, Boeing’s recovery hinges on sustainability, making initiatives like this crucial for competitive edge.

Policy and Global Context

Washington state’s policies are evolving to support such efforts. Lynnwood Times coverage of Gov. Ferguson’s announcement ties into broader climate legislation, including incentives for clean energy projects.

On a global scale, the accelerator echoes efforts in Europe and Asia, where SAF mandates are gaining traction. By leading in the U.S., the Pacific Northwest could influence federal policies, especially with Boeing’s advocacy in Washington, D.C.

Industry observers on X, including posts from GeekWire, express enthusiasm, with some calling it a “fuel innovation boom.” This public sentiment could drive further investments.

Sustaining Momentum Through Challenges

To succeed, the accelerator must navigate supply chain vulnerabilities. KING 5 reports underscore the need for diversified feedstocks to avoid overreliance on any single source.

Engaging communities is key, particularly indigenous groups with stakes in forestry resources. Transparent processes will ensure equitable benefits.

Ultimately, the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator represents a bold step toward a greener aviation sector. By harnessing regional strengths and fostering partnerships, it could set a precedent for how industries tackle climate imperatives, ensuring the skies remain open for generations to come.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/article-5917-1767941426.jpeg,N,,2026-01-09 10:59:14.201160

The two Nordic firms inked a memorandum of understanding that will see Norsk e-Fuel conduct a feasibility study for the eSAF project to be located next to Outokumpu’s stainless-steel mill in Tornio, Finland.

Outokumpu would supply carbon monoxide side streams from its existing ferrochrome production as a feedstock to be combined with green hydrogen to produce 80,000-100,000 tonnes of eSAF.

The project would be led by Norsk e-Fuel, drawing on its network for project development and financing. They estimate the project will cost €1.2bn-€1.5bn ($1.4bn-1.7bn).

Subject to the feasibility study, the company anticipates taking final investment decision around 2028, with construction planned for 2032.

Lars Bjørn Larsen, CCO at Norsk e-Fuel said, “Outokumpu’s industrial platform and available side streams, combined with our experience in developing power-to-liquid projects, create a strong foundation for competitive eSAF production in Tornio”.

This new plant would look to support the EU’s eSAF quota and advance the decarbonisation of aviation.

The announcement comes within a year of Norsk e-Fuel revealing plans for an 80,000 tonne-per-year hydrogen-based SAF facility in Sweden, and alongside ongoing projects in Finland with which the company “continues to progress as planned”.

The EU has introduced strong mandates on SAF, with at least 2% of fuel supplied at EU airports required to be SAF from 2025, growing to 70% by 2050. There’s also a 1.2% 2030 sub-target for green hydrogen-based synthetic fuels, which could reach 35% by 2050.

It also includes increasing fleet conversions for heavy-duty transportation, expanding into new markets such as marine fuels or exports to Japan, evaluating additional feedstocks, and growing the company’s fueling station network.","Five years ago, OPAL Fuels stepped out of the private sector and emerged as an ambitious leader in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas.

With major partners including NextEra Energy, UPS, CHS and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and more than 350 projects nationwide, OPAL has positioned itself at the forefront of the renewable energy transition. And just in time, it seems, as pressure to decarbonize increases. The United Nations’ COP30 climate summit, held in Brazil in November and the first post-U.S. withdrawal, stressed “the inherent connection between pursuing efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius and pursuing just transition pathways.”

While the conference failed to agree on decarbonization regulations, 23 countries endorsed their commitment to Belém 4X, an initiative to quadruple the use of sustainable fuels by 2035. RNG serves as an easily applicable fuel source for industries looking to decarbonize while maintaining current infrastructure. And to OPAL co-CEO Adam Comora, RNG is the perfect place to invest amid current climate goals.

In With the New

Formed in late 2020 by Comora and co-CEO Jonathan Maurer, OPAL entered the public sector backed by decades of experience. “We got started in the business of capturing biogas and trying to find a productive use for it 25 years ago,” Comora says. “A lot of folks were noticing that methane emissions from decaying organic waste could be used productively and that electricity generation was a good answer because it’s baseload power, 24/7.”

Prior to OPAL’s formation, TruStar Energy, Fortistar Methane Group and Fortistar RNG operated as portfolio companies of Fortistar LLC. The three companies merged together to form OPAL Fuels, bringing together upstream and downstream capabilities. Later that year, OPAL combined with ArcLight Clean Transition Corp. II, officially exiting the private sector as a vertically integrated producer and distributor of RNG.

“We saw a really interesting opportunity to transform what we were doing at the Fortistar Methane Group on the landfill gas-to-electric side,” Comora continues. “We really got excited that there could be something better to do with the biogas resource from an economic perspective, and create an opportunity to help fleets achieve their objectives.”

OPAL’s long-term partnership with American legacy utility NextEra Energy began in April 2021 with the development of a Minnesota RNG project designed to produce 2,140 dekatherms of RNG per day, eliminating 43,900 metric tons of carbon per year. In December 2022, OPAL signed a long-term agreement with UPS to provide operations and maintenance services to 51 UPS RNG dispensing stations in the U.S. In 2023, OPAL and South Jersey Industries signed a 50-50 joint venture agreement to develop RNG facilities. The following year, OPAL announced commercial operations at its RNG facility at the Polk County municipal landfill in Jones Corner, Florida.

Today, OPAL splits its operating segments into three categories: RNG fuel, renewable power and fuel station services, Comora explains. In a report of OPAL’s third-quarter results, Comora noted an 8% increase in RNG production compared to the second quarter and a 30% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024, despite depressed D3 RIN prices. Maurer shared the company’s annual design capacity of 9.1 million MMBtu across 12 projects in operation during the same briefing, adding that “at present, RNG and CNG are the most attractive alternatives to replace diesel for the Class 8 trucking market.”

With D3 RINs remaining depressed, Comora and Maurer’s lengthy backgrounds in renewable energy investing bring stability to their work. “There are a few cost areas that we’re really focused on,” Comora says. “One is the capital costs of the facilities, where we did see some significant inflationary cost pressures over the past three to four years or so. Thankfully, those have been offset by the Section 48 ITC tax credit, and we did safe harbor a number of projects in our advanced development pipeline that will qualify for those ITC tax credits. But we are spending a lot of time on value engineering.”

Further federal tax incentives like the Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit and the Renewable Fuel Standard program affect how OPAL moves. “Policy clarity has a lot more impact on investing in RNG assets, and they all form a piece of the puzzle,” he says. “And 45Z is definitely helpful when thinking about investing in new RNG production facilities. Those run through 2029, so if new facilities take a ballpark estimate of 18 months to build, you may only be getting a year of 45Z benefits.”

Current legislative efforts, including a notice of proposed rulemaking released by the White House Office of Management and Budget, attempt to further extend 45Z beyond 2029, as well as reinstate the $1.75-per-gallon sustainable aviation fuel incentive, which Comora says makes a significant impact on RNG investments. “We’re waiting for final clarity on a GREET model to do all the carbon intensity scoring around our projects, but if you can have visibility or clarity on 45Z for a period of time, that can have a big impact on investing in RNG facilities,” he says. “It also works in conjunction with the 48 ITC, so 45Z is a tool or a lever that can offset those capital cost increases.”

Trucking Along

Despite OPAL’s roots in the U.S., Comora says opportunities beyond the domestic market are growing. “Japan is starting to import RNG. They have a mandate that by 2030, 1% of their net gas has to be low-CI. You can send it there as LNG or as renewable methanol,” he says. “In Europe, marine fuel is really interesting, as well as here in the U.S., whether it be in barges or around ports, and potentially for ocean-going vessels. There’s going to be a big market because they’re going to be taxed based on their carbon emissions when they pull into ports, and now you’ve got all these ships on the ocean that can run on renewable methanol. So, there are other offtake markets that want low-CI natural gas.”

New markets, of course, mean new regulations, even inside the continental U.S. “Any time we dispense RNG in California, CARB assigns us a CI score based off the Argonne GREET models. 45Z is going to have something similar. And we also have third-party engineers that do baselines,” Comora says.

When it comes to the transportation sector, the challenges of decarbonization are half the fun, and OPAL is happy to answer the call. “The reason why we’re focused on transportation fuel, and specifically heavy-duty trucking here in the U.S., is because it’s a hard-to-decarbonize sector,” he says. “Electrification is challenged by battery weight and electricity grids—there are just so many things that stand in the way, and hydrogen has proved challenging to distribute in the U.S. as well.

“We’re collecting biogas that’s maybe 50% methane,” Comora continues. “We are physically passing it through membranes to separate all other impurities so that you can get it up to a pipeline-quality spec, use existing pipeline infrastructure to transport it where you need it, build a fueling station that pulls off the RNG, compresses it and puts it right into the vehicle where it can be used. You can’t get a more streamlined operational economic model for the sector.”

The balancing act between building new RNG plants and expanding OPAL’s current fueling infrastructure is calculated at every step. “Everything that we invest capital in competes for that capital resource and needs to be justified on a strong, unlevered, risk-adjusted return,” Comora explains. “And the good news is we’re seeing good opportunities on both sides.

With major fleets increasingly reengaging with CNG and RNG, Comora and the OPAL Fuels team view fueling infrastructure as a compelling growth opportunity and are investing accordingly. “We see a stronger adoption curve of natural gas or RNG for heavy-duty trucking,” he says. “That being said, you’ll likely see us continue to invest in both, and at the same time, I feel like some of the capital is going to get shifted more toward the fuel station part of the business in the next couple of years.”

Using RNG allows companies to record zero Scope 1 emissions (direct emissions and fossil fuels) and zero Scope 2 emissions (indirect emissions released through purchased energy). The CI of the combusted RNG can then be used to offset Scope 3 emissions, which include all other indirect emissions occurring across the value chain. “It’s hard for companies to do Scope 3 emissions accounting work, but we provide the CI of the RNG we’re supplying if they’re trying to establish a Scope 3 framework,” Comora adds. “So if you use RNG in a fleet: zero Scope 1, zero Scope 2, you create a biogenic emission and then you have a reduction in your Scope 3 emissions based on the CI.”

Finding the Future

With five to six projects under construction, Comora says OPAL is looking ahead. “It’s been a lot more work, and it’s more expensive being a public company. And we think it’s worthwhile to do that work,” he says. “One, we think it’s a better platform to raise capital, raise awareness and do some of our public policy advocacy work. We also think it’s been really impactful to attract talent to our team, and it’s made us much more disciplined.”

With nearly 30 years of experience in the renewable investment industry, the challenges of operating as a public company are navigated by returning to fundamentals. “Methane emissions are 80 times more damaging than CO2, specifically over the first 20 years,” Comora stresses. “Methane abatement is likely the lowest-hanging fruit and the most impactful thing that we can do. Does it get us all the way there? No. Should we be doing it? Yes.”

For OPAL, success is defined by setting the industry benchmark for reliable RNG production, with high facility availability and uptime, Comora says. It also includes increasing fleet conversions for heavy-duty transportation, expanding into new markets such as marine fuels or exports to Japan, evaluating additional feedstocks, and growing the company’s fueling station network. “We really paved our own path in terms of how we built the company, so it was really exciting—and still is exciting,” he adds. “A lot of interesting things come from that. We found it to be really challenging and fun, and it continues to motivate all of us.”

Skyports Infrastructure and Linden Airport Services Corporation have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop, modernise and operationalise Miami’s Watson Island Heliport, creating an immediate landing zone for helicopters and a future hub for electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.

The collaboration aims to transform the historic Watson Island site into one of the most advanced urban aviation facilities in the United States. The upgraded heliport will support both traditional rotorcraft operations and next generation eVTOL services, positioning Miami at the forefront of the emerging Advanced Air Mobility sector.

The project will bring together industry-leading partnerships and relationships, including engagement with helicopter and eVTOL operators, collaboration with real estate developers, and preparations for the introduction of future eVTOL services. A comprehensive development plan will set out how the site can be adapted to support safe, efficient and scalable urban aviation operations.

Watson Island has a long aviation history dating back to the early 20th century and once played a central role in Miami’s vertical aviation network. Its location makes it uniquely strategic, as the closest landing zone to Miami Beach and just minutes from Downtown Miami, Brickell, Fisher Island, Star Island, Palm Island, Hibiscus Island and the Port of Miami. This central position gives the heliport unmatched accessibility for residents, visitors and commercial operators, reinforcing its importance as South Florida prepares to become a leading global market for eVTOL operations.

Linden Airport Services Corporation has been involved with the Watson Island Heliport project for more than 20 years, having been awarded the original heliport contract and working to secure Federal Aviation Administration and Florida Department of Transportation approvals. Final local occupancy permits are now in process. Linden’s experience managing Linden Airport in New Jersey, a major helicopter base serving the New York metropolitan area, complements Skyports’ operational expertise as the manager of the Downtown Skyport in New York, the world’s busiest civilian commercial heliport.

Together, Skyports and Linden will assess the highest and best use of the Watson Island Heliport, with the goal of restoring it to prominence while supporting the long-term growth of advanced air mobility in Miami.

“Watson Island is an extraordinary asset for Miami and a pivotal location for the future of urban aviation,” said Robbie Ladov, General Manager of US Heliports and Vertiports at Skyports Infrastructure. “By partnering with Linden, we are combining Skyports’ global leadership in skyport development with Linden’s decades-long dedication to preparing this site. Together, we are laying the foundation for a next generation facility that will serve the region for decades to come.”

Paul Dudley, CEO of Linden Airport Services Corporation, added: “Our commitment to Watson Island spans more than 20 years, navigating regulatory and operational milestones to get this site ready for the future. Partnering with Skyports enables us to advance the heliport into a modern skyport, engage key aviation and real estate partners, and help establish Miami as a leader in advanced air mobility.”

Both organisations will continue to work closely with local authorities and industry stakeholders as development progresses.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/Watson-Island-Heliport-Map-for-press.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 08:58:05.461632

The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024.","A who’s who from Washington state business and Democratic politics on Thursday extolled the virtues of alternative jet fuel and said the state would strive to become the nation’s leading enabler of greener flying.

The occasion was a splashy launch event in Snohomish County for a new state-funded eco-fuel development nonprofit, dubbed the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

The business accelerator debuted with $10 million in tax dollars approved by the Legislature, matched by another $10 million from an unidentified philanthropic donor. Those new commitments build on tens of millions of dollars the Legislature and Congress previously allocated. The earlier funding was meant to lure alternative fuel refiners to Washington state, supports a Washington State University research lab, and incentivizes green jet fuel use in the state.

Executives from Boeing, Amazon, Alaska Airlines and the Port of Seattle joined Gov. Bob Ferguson, state legislators and the president of WSU on stage at Boeing’s Future of Flight visitor center next to Paine Field.

“Collectively, we have the political will and the private partnerships to get big things done,” state Rep. Mia Gregerson, D-SeaTac, told the standing-room crowd.

State Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, said, “Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to decarbonizing air transportation, and Cascadia is the one region with the research, industry, policy and workforce needed to scale it.”

The state’s approach contrasts with the Trump administration, which just this week pulled the U.S. out of the foundational United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Trump administration officials have heaped scorn on taxpayer-financed decarbonization incentives. They favor policies to maximize fossil fuel production to drive down energy costs.

“While there are confusing signals coming out of the other Washington, the rest of the world is all-in on sustainable aviation fuel,” Liias said. “This is the fuel of the future.”

The board chair and vice-chair of the new Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator said the trade organization would lead education and advocacy efforts, recruit companies, invest in research and go to bat for project developers.

The industry’s moniker for alternative jet fuel is sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF for short. There are multiple methods to make it using a variety of feedstocks such as crop and forestry waste, used cooking oil, algae or hydrogen. Depending on the details, the eco-fuel can reduce the carbon footprint of air travel by anywhere from 50% to 80%.

SAF is favored by airlines because it is a “drop-in” fuel, meaning it works with existing airplane engines and fuel infrastructure. Most jet engines are currently limited to a maximum 50% blend with conventional jet fuel. Major engine makers are in the process of testing and certifying engines for 100% SAF.

The trouble is that SAF currently costs two to five times as much as conventional jet fuel. The high price and limited supply are holding back wider adoption.

At present, there is no continuous, commercial-scale production in Washington state. But several major companies have plants in design or construction.

Dutch energy company SkyNRG said Thursday that it aims to break ground in late 2027 or in 2028 on a large biofuel production facility at the Wallula Gap industrial park along the Columbia River southeast of Pasco. The company plans to produce 50 million gallons per year of SAF and renewable diesel by converting bio-methane collected from local and regional landfills, as well as a little bit from cow manure digesters.

A competitor named Twelve recently completed construction on a synthetic jet fuel plant in Moses Lake. Twelve plans to use a power-to-liquid production method that relies on lots of renewable electricity to transform carbon dioxide captured from the air and water into what it calls “E-Jet” fuel.

Executives at Twelve portrayed the Moses Lake facility as a demonstration plant. It may begin production in a matter of weeks and ramp up to 50,000 gallons annually. The California-based company plans to locate a much larger commercial-scale E-Jet fuel plant somewhere in the Midwest.

On the west side of the Cascades, BP received nearly $27 million in federal grant funding in 2024 to buy equipment and make upgrades at its Cherry Point refinery. The goal is to begin production in 2029 of 10 million gallons of SAF annually using biomass feedstocks, like food waste, vegetable oil and beef tallow. The BP oil refinery in Whatcom County is connected by pipeline to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, and the major airports in Vancouver, British Columbia and Portland, Oregon.

If you add up the capacity of the eco-jet fuel projects announced in the state so far, you make only a modest dent to transition Washington airports to climate-friendly fuel. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimated Washington’s jet fuel consumption at 848 million gallons in 2024. According to the Port of Seattle, Sea-Tac Airport alone dispenses around 600 million gallons of jet fuel per year, a number expected to rise over the coming decade.

By the end of the decade though, an Oregon border county could become home to a much larger alternative fuel refinery whose output would equal Sea-Tac’s annual demand. A Texas-headquartered company named NXTClean Fuels is in the process of permitting an alternative jet fuel and renewable diesel refinery along the Columbia River near Clatskanie with a capacity of 750 million gallons per year.

If that project comes to fruition, it would theoretically go a long way toward addressing limited supply in the Pacific Northwest. But that still leaves the barriers of feedstock availability and affordability for airlines.

During a press availability following Thursday’s launch event, the CEO of SkyNRG Americas, John Plaza, said he foresaw plenty of availability of the renewable natural gas raw ingredient that his company needs to make jet fuel at its planned southeast Washington plant.

Airlines such as Amazon Air have demonstrated some willingness to pay a premium to achieve climate and sustainability goals.

“We strive to have the airline industry pay as little a premium as possible,” Plaza said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/alaska_airlines_biofuel_001-2048x1363.jpg,N,,2026-01-09 07:58:14.308025

Corteva and bp have introduced Etlas, a new joint venture designed to support the production of clean fuels through agriculture. Etlas will grow oilseed crops such as canola, mustard, and sunflower to create feedstock used in making sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.

This partnership combines Corteva’s long history in seed development with bp’s global fuel marketing and refining expertise. Together, they aim to build a reliable and scalable supply chain for biofuel feedstock.

Etlas plans to reach annual production of one million metric tonnes of feedstock by the mid-2030s. This production could support more than 800,000 tonnes of biofuel each year. Initial deliveries are expected to begin in 2027 for use in biofuel refineries.

“By helping found Etlas, Corteva continues to deliver on two critical parts of our mission: to help fuel the world and to support farmers. Agriculture is part of the solution, and we are excited to see Etlas come to life,” said Judd O’Connor, executive vice president of Corteva’s seed business.

Demand for clean fuels is rising worldwide as governments and industries look for ways to reduce emissions. Global demand for sustainable aviation fuel could reach 10 million tonnes by 2030, while renewable diesel demand may grow to 35 million tonnes. Etlas is being developed to help meet this demand.

The crops grown by Etlas will be planted on existing farmland between main crop seasons. These crops help improve soil quality and allow farmers to earn additional income without expanding farmland use.

Ignacio Conti will serve as Etlas Chief Executive Officer, while Gaurav Sonar will act as Chair of the Board. The company will work with farmers to expand production and strengthen the clean energy supply chain.

“As the aviation industry looks for reliable, sustainable and cost-competitive sources of SAF, it is clear farmers have a critical role to play,” said Etlas CEO, Ignacio Conti. “Etlas brings together global leaders in agriculture innovation and energy production to harness this demand by leveraging technological expertise and trusted relationships with farmers around the world to help scale production and boost supply while offering farmers new revenue streams.”

Lift The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is not a guarantee of success.","The reason everyone gathered at Paine Field last week was clear: to launch the Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator.

More than 175 people filled Boeing’s Future of Flight building in Everett—senior state and county leaders, airline and aircraft executives, project developers, financiers, labor leadership, and top academic researchers—there to formally stand up a regional engine designed to do one thing exceptionally well: turn sustainable aviation fuel ambition into commercial velocity.

“This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,” said Governor Bob Ferguson. “Sustainable aviation fuel isn’t optional for this industry. It is literally the future—and Washington is uniquely positioned to lead.”

The launch is backed by $20 million in initial capital—$10 million from the State of Washington, matched dollar-for-dollar by philanthropy—with an explicit ambition to scale toward one billion gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production over time.

And then, during the launch, something happened that made the room lean forward.

SkyNRG announced that Project Wigeon—a commercial-scale SAF facility planned for Eastern Washington—had secured its key environmental approvals and was moving into engineering. Fifty million gallons per year. Renewable natural gas feedstocks. Operations targeted for 2030.

SkyNRG wasn’t why people came.

But the announcement confirmed why they were there.

As Earth Finance managing director Tim Zenk put it plainly from the stage, without years of coordinated work to build Cascadia’s accelerator, this project would not exist—and we would not be in this room today. The announcement didn’t hijack the launch. It validated it.

That is what acceleration looks like.

Near the coffee station sat a scale model of the Saturn V. One look at it and caffeine felt redundant. The message was implicit: this is a place that remembers what it takes to move from audacity to execution—and has done it before.

A Coalition That Shows Up

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator didn’t appear overnight. Senator Marco Liias, who has worked on SAF policy for more than a decade, framed the moment plainly.

“Some of us have been sitting in workgroups on sustainable aviation fuel for ten years just to get to today,” Liias said. “This launch didn’t happen by accident. It happened because people stayed at the table.”

That persistence was on display when Governor Ferguson paused the program to honor Dave Somers, naming him Washingtonian of the Day live from the stage for his role as a catalyst.

“This region has been building airplanes for more than fifty years,” Somers said. “If sustainable aviation fuel is the future of flight, this is exactly where that future should be built.”

The Drag Problem

For years, the SAF story has been a study in drag.

Despite molecular brilliance and urgent climate necessity, sustainable aviation fuel has often felt like a seaplane trying to take off from a lake of peanut butter. The thrust is there. The demand is real. But velocity has been missing. Drag costs time. Time costs money. Money costs interest. Interest erodes return on investment. And when ROI collapses, adoption stalls.

After four cycles—ethanol, biodiesel, renewable natural gas, and now SAF—it’s time to ask a harder question: what if the constraint isn’t feedstocks, chemistry, or even price?

Markets don’t price distance. They price time under uncertainty.

Why Cascadia Exists

Cascadia was launched to attack that problem directly.

Its mission isn’t to invent new molecules. It’s to collapse timelines—to reduce the compounding delays that quietly kill projects long before the first gallon is produced.

Scaling SAF requires crossing multiple thresholds at once: ASTM certification (the global fuel safety standard), state environmental review under SEPA (Washington’s gold-standard environmental policy), engine testing, carbon accounting, permitting, and infrastructure build-out. None of these hurdles is fatal on its own. Together, they destroy velocity.

Cascadia exists to build scaffolding around producers—policy, finance, infrastructure, workforce, and research—so projects don’t have to survive a decade-long game of Half Dome Economics, where one slip sends capital over the edge.

“This is a systems problem,” said Betsy Cantwell, president of Washington State University. “Universities can’t solve it alone. Industry can’t solve it alone. Government can’t solve it alone. Regional efforts like this are how hard problems actually get solved.”

Proof, on Day One

That’s why the SkyNRG announcement landed with such force.

Project Wigeon cleared review by the Washington State Department of Ecology and Walla Walla County, confirming compliance with land use, water protection, air quality, and transportation standards. With permitting secured, the project now moves into engineering—the phase where steel replaces slides.

“This milestone allows us to move forward the right way,” said John Plaza. “It demonstrates that you can meet Washington’s rigorous environmental standards while building real projects that deliver clean fuel, economic opportunity, and long-term community benefits.”

The facility will use renewable natural gas from landfills, wastewater facilities, and agricultural operations, delivered through existing infrastructure. Once operational, the fuel can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 85 percent compared to conventional jet fuel—while materially reducing soot and particulate matter.

Representative Mia Gregerson, who represents communities near Sea-Tac Airport, put a human frame around those numbers. In neighborhoods downwind of runways, she said, residents can die nearly a decade earlier due to chronic exposure to air particulates. One reason SAF matters is that when it burns, the reduction in soot and particulates is visible to the naked eye—not just to a carbon calculator.

Leaders from IAM 751 emphasized another dimension: scaling SAF is also about ensuring that the next century of aviation manufacturing and energy production remains rooted in family-wage jobs.

This wasn’t a promise. It was progress.

Why Washington, Why Now

Washington’s aerospace sector supports roughly 200,000 jobs and generates more than $70 billion in annual economic impact. For leaders in the room, SAF isn’t a climate accessory—it’s an industrial necessity.

Inside the glass-walled Future of Flight building, leaders talked about fuels and timelines—while just across the street, Boeing teams were assembling aircraft that will fly for decades. The message was quiet but unmistakable: this is a place where ambition eventually turns into hardware.

As President Cantwell noted, while federal agencies can set policy, only regional efforts can actually build physical supply chains. That’s why the rest of the world is watching Cascadia—not as a local experiment, but as a blueprint for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors globally.

Lift

The Cascadia Sustainable Aviation Accelerator is not a guarantee of success. But its launch—validated immediately by a real, permitted project—marks a shift from activity to velocity. At Paine Field, it felt like the brakes were finally off.
