Once reserved for Hollywood blockbusters, new electric vertical flight technology represents a generational opportunity to revolutionise air travel. While the entire aerospace sector is focused on decarbonising, a whole new class of aviation is fast emerging to deliver zero-carbon flight in the near term.

Electric Vertical Take off and Landing (eVTOL) technology is developing at speed, with the UK well placed to play a leading role in demonstrating and commercializing zero-emissions flight. Amidst a shifting commercial landscape across Europe, the UK now likely remains the only European country capable of bringing a product to market in the near term.

That offers a huge opportunity for the UK to champion and scale new vertical flight technology, supporting thousands of jobs across the UK and contributing towards the UK Government’s core missions to grow the economy and boost regional connectivity.

Estimates from PwC suggest that Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) could bring more than £2 billion worth of socioeconomic benefit per year to the UK by 2040 if we get this right.

Yet the benefits extend far beyond economic opportunities. AAM could reduce carbon emissions by 222 million tonnes every year, equivalent to taking 120,000 diesel cars off the road, and boosting the number of sustainable transport options for consumers.

Public services will also benefit from emerging vertical flight technology. Uncrewed drones are already supporting medical deliveries in London, transporting urgent blood samples between Guy’s Hospital and St Thomas’. Yet not only are they reducing emissions by 99%, they are also speeding up deliveries by more than 93%. Meanwhile, eVTOLs could support rural and island connectivity, as well as medical emergencies in hard-to-reach areas.

Vertical flight technology policy

So what does industry need from the government to industrialise vertical flight technology and secure the UK’s international leadership? Principally, it comes down to regulation. By and large, the technology is already at an advanced stage of readiness, but regulators need to keep pace to ensure the UK’s competitiveness with other markets. That is why the CAA needs to outline its eVTOL rulemaking framework for operations and vertiports, giving industry clarity on the route forward.

Political direction is also needed to encourage investment in new vertical flight technology and supporting infrastructure such as vertiports and the grid. With the government committed to the strategic objectives of the Future of Flight Action Plan, but not the plan itself, the government needs to continue working closely with the Future of Flight Industry Group to set out a vision of the best way to unlock the benefits of this new technology through use cases and integration.

To support the industrialisation of AAM technology, the government should launch the next phase of the Future Flight Challenge at the Spending Review. Previous phases have successfully positioned the UK as a world leader in green aviation, but we must not now lose momentum just as the technology is ready to be commercialised.

Public perception will also be critical to supporting the sector’s future growth. Without public buy-in, vertiports could struggle to secure planning permission, and vertical flight technology will unduly remain the preserve of the wealthy. That’s why industry needs to work with the government and regulators to raise awareness of new technologies and dispel myths around noise generation.

Scaling new vertical flight technologies

It might sound as though these issues are niche, but the reality is that they are absolutely critical to the scaling of new vertical flight technologies. To truly realise the advantages of zero-emissions aviation, the public needs to understand how they will benefit from vertical flight and what it will mean for them. That could mean the government steps in as a first customer to demonstrate the public value of zero emissions vertical flight, whether that be air ambulances or another critical application.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iStock-1393960783.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 08:42:23.609650

FAQ About US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports Why did the US implement tariffs on Brazilian tallow?","Understanding the Impact of US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports

The international tallow market is experiencing a significant transformation following the announcement of substantial US tariffs on Brazilian imports. This development has sent ripples through global biofuel supply chains and forced Brazilian exporters to rapidly reconsider their market strategies. This analysis examines the multifaceted impact of these tariffs and explores the emerging alternatives for one of Brazil's most valuable agricultural exports.

What Are the Recent US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow?

Overview of the Tariff Implementation

The tallow market faced a dramatic shift when US President Donald Trump announced a 50% tariff on all Brazilian goods on July 9, 2025. Set to take effect on August 1, 2025, this comprehensive tariff includes tallow—a critical feedstock for biofuel production in the United States. The announcement came with explicit warnings that any attempts to circumvent these tariffs through transshipment would face even higher rates, effectively closing potential loopholes.

The tariff implementation represents a significant policy shift that directly impacts a well-established trade relationship between the two nations. According to Fastmarkets analysis, the timing of the announcement created immediate market uncertainty, as numerous shipments were already en route to US ports when the news broke.

""The tariff announcement created a situation where exporters had to quickly reassess not only future shipments but also cargoes already at sea,"" noted industry analysts from Fastmarkets in their July 2025 market report.

Historical Trade Relationship Before Tariffs

Prior to the tariff announcement, the United States had been the predominant destination for Brazilian tallow exports, accounting for approximately 97% of Brazil's total tallow exports in 2025. This heavy reliance on a single market underscores the vulnerability now faced by Brazilian exporters.

Brazil's tallow export volume to the US had been robust throughout 2025, averaging 51,000 tonnes monthly during Q2. June 2025 marked a particularly significant period with record-breaking exports of 71,650 tonnes shipped to US-based buyers. These established trade patterns, developed over years of commercial relationships, now face severe disruption.

The historical price stability and logistics efficiency of this trade route had created a deeply interdependent relationship, making the tariff announcement particularly impactful for both nations. Brazilian processors had optimized their production specifically for US market specifications, while US biofuel producers had come to rely on the consistent quality and supply from Brazil.

How Has the Tallow Market Responded to the Tariffs?

Immediate Market Reactions

Following the tariff announcement, the export trading of Brazilian tallow initially came to a complete halt. Market participants from both countries entered a strategic planning phase, focused on mapping alternative approaches to manage the new economic reality.

By late July 2025, activity cautiously resumed with storage tanks at the Port of Santos—Brazil's primary tallow export facility—receiving product for export once again. Approximately 36,000 tonnes were sold for August delivery to US-based buyers, representing a significant decline from pre-tariff volumes but demonstrating continued trade despite the new barriers.

September shipment offers were being presented even as August deliveries were finalized, though market sources indicated that negotiations were expected to be prolonged and complex as both sides adjusted to the new cost structure. This gradual resumption of activity suggests that market participants are finding ways to adapt, albeit with reduced volumes and increased costs.

Price and Supply Chain Disruptions

The tariff implementation has triggered considerable oil price movements and pricing volatility in both Brazilian and US markets. Shipments already en route to the United States during the announcement faced particular uncertainty, with some exporters seeking last-minute diversions to alternative markets.

US domestic biofuel producers have been scrambling to secure alternative feedstock sources, leading to upward price pressure on domestic tallow and competing feedstocks. The reduced Brazilian export volumes are creating potential supply gaps in the US market that domestic production cannot immediately fill.

The disruption has had cascading effects throughout the supply chain:

Rendering facilities in Brazil are facing storage capacity challenges

Logistics providers are renegotiating shipping contracts and routes

Biofuel producers in the US are reassessing production schedules

End-product prices for biodiesel and renewable diesel face upward pressure

This period of adjustment has created both risks and opportunities for market participants able to navigate the changing landscape effectively.

What Alternative Markets Are Brazilian Exporters Exploring?

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production Route

A creative solution has emerged with US-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel producers becoming a primary outlet for Brazilian tallow despite the tariffs. This approach leverages the duty drawback mechanism available under US customs regulations.

SAF production allows companies to claim reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs paid when the finished product is subsequently exported. This creates an economically viable pathway for Brazilian tallow to enter the US market, undergo processing, and then leave as a value-added product.

However, this option is limited to exporters with established relationships with the relatively small number of US companies that have established SAF export channels to European markets. The specialized nature of this production path means it cannot absorb the full volume of previous Brazilian tallow exports to the US.

European Market Potential

Europe has been identified as the most likely alternative destination for direct Brazilian tallow exports. According to industry projections, European demand for certified beef tallow for SAF production is expected to grow by an impressive 250% between 2022-2035, creating substantial long-term potential.

Despite this promising outlook, Brazilian exporters face significant barriers to immediate market entry:

Complex certification requirements with minimum 40-day compliance timelines

Higher export costs reducing price competitiveness

Established European supplier relationships limiting market access

Economic viability challenges compared to the pre-tariff US market

One industry expert familiar with European certification procedures explained: ""Certification and export costs are extremely high and undermine the competitiveness of our product. Exporting to Europe does make sense, but if it happens, it will be more due to pressure from the Brazilian side than actual demand from Europe.""

Regional Alternatives in South America

In search of more immediate solutions, the Brazilian rendering sector has engaged in high-level meetings with Uruguayan officials to explore regional alternatives. Uruguay already serves as an export route for tallow from Argentina and Paraguay, potentially offering established channels for Brazilian product.

Argentina was also considered as a potential market, but analysis indicated that its domestic market would be overwhelmed by the volume of Brazilian exports, making it an impractical solution for anything beyond small shipments.

Transshipment options through neighboring countries were explicitly rejected by industry leaders due to fraud concerns and the threatened higher tariffs for circumvention attempts. As one source noted, ""This would be the same as committing fraud,"" highlighting the industry's commitment to legitimate market solutions despite the challenging circumstances.

What Are the Duty Drawback Mechanisms Being Utilized?

How the Drawback System Works

The US duty drawback system has emerged as a critical mechanism for mitigating the impact of US tariffs on Canadian industries and Brazilian tallow. This customs provision allows companies to claim reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs paid when imported materials are used in products that are subsequently exported from the United States.

The process works through the following steps:

Brazilian tallow is imported into the US with the 50% tariff paid

The tallow is processed into Sustainable Aviation Fuel or similar products

The finished product is exported to international markets (primarily Europe)

The US processor files for duty drawback reimbursement

After processing and verification, up to 99% of the original tariff is refunded

This creates a legal pathway to significantly reduce the effective tariff rate while maintaining compliance with US customs regulations. SAF producers in particular have been quick to leverage this mechanism, creating a specialized market channel for Brazilian tallow.

Limitations of the Drawback System

While the drawback system offers a valuable tariff mitigation strategy, it comes with significant limitations that prevent it from serving as a complete solution:

Significant delays in recovering tariff payments, typically several months

Cash flow requirements limiting participation to companies with strong financial positions

Specialized knowledge needed for compliance with complex customs procedures

Limited capacity among qualified SAF exporters with established European distribution

The system also creates a competitive advantage for larger, more financially robust companies that can absorb the tariff costs during the reimbursement waiting period. Smaller processors face disproportionate challenges in utilizing this mechanism effectively, potentially leading to market consolidation over time.

What Are the Long-Term Implications for Global Tallow Markets?

US Market Adjustments

The US domestic biofuels market will continue requiring imported feedstocks despite the tariffs, as domestic production cannot meet current demand levels. This fundamental supply-demand imbalance is likely to drive several market adjustments:

Potential shift toward alternative suppliers like Australia

Price increases for domestic US tallow to attract more collection/production

Biofuel producers advocating for tariff relaxation or targeted exemptions

Possible technology shifts to accommodate different feedstock profiles

Looking ahead, changes to the 45Z tax credit program starting in 2026 will exclude imported feedstocks from eligibility, creating an additional layer of complexity for market participants planning long-term strategies. This regulatory change, when combined with the US tariffs and inflation, represents a significant reshaping of the US biofuel feedstock landscape.

Global Supply Chain Realignment

The disruption to established trade flows is triggering a broader realignment of global tallow supply chains. Australia is positioned to become a stronger supplier to Asian markets, potentially filling gaps created by shifting trade patterns.

Industry experts have noted that ""Australia is expected to become a stronger supplier of animal fats in Asia,"" indicating a broader geographic rebalancing of the market. However, Brazilian tallow faces challenges in directly competing in these markets, with one source noting that ""Brazilian tallow is already uncompetitive [in Southeast Asia] in terms of costs and product quality.""

The potential surplus of Australian tallow in Asian markets could occur if US-bound volumes redirect, creating cascading price effects across the region. European certification requirements are simultaneously creating barriers to quick market shifts, slowing the rebalancing process and potentially creating temporary regional surpluses and shortages.

Brazilian Domestic Market Impact

The Brazilian domestic market faces significant changes if export volumes cannot find alternative international destinations:

Increased domestic supply leading to downward price pressure

Rendering sector exploring new business relationships and value-added opportunities

Adaptation period required for establishing new international market channels

Potential consolidation among smaller producers unable to weather market disruption

Brazilian producers are investing in certification processes despite the costs, recognizing the need for market diversification in the new trade environment. The adaptation period is expected to last 6-12 months as new commercial relationships develop and market participants adjust to the changed economic conditions.

How Are Regulatory Changes Affecting the Biofuels Landscape?

US Policy Changes Beyond Tariffs

The 50% tariff represents just one element of evolving US biofuels policy. The 45Z tax credit program changes starting in 2026 will exclude imported feedstocks from credit eligibility, creating a double challenge for international suppliers to the US market.

Ongoing developments in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) are simultaneously affecting market dynamics, with potential changes to blending requirements and carbon intensity scoring methodologies. The combined impact of tariffs and credit changes is fundamentally reshaping supply chains and investment decisions throughout the sector.

This regulatory evolution creates a complex decision matrix for market participants:

Regulatory Factor Current Impact Future Implications (2026+) 50% Tariff Immediate price pressure; Drawback utilization Potential for tariff adjustment or expiration 45Z Tax Credit Currently includes imported feedstock Will exclude imported feedstock starting 2026 RFS Requirements Driving demand for all qualifying feedstocks May shift toward favoring domestic production

Certification Requirements for International Markets

European markets represent the most promising alternative destination for Brazilian tallow, but they come with extensive certification procedures that create both time and cost barriers:

European market certification requires a minimum of 40 days for compliance processing

High costs associated with certification significantly undermine competitiveness

Many companies currently prefer domestic sales despite slightly lower prices

Certification complexity creates additional administrative burden

As one industry source explained: ""For now, many companies prefer to sell domestically rather than earn slightly more and deal with all the extra work [of certification]."" This sentiment highlights how non-tariff barriers can be as significant as direct tariffs in reshaping trade flows.

FAQ About US Tariffs on Brazilian Tallow Exports

Why did the US implement tariffs on Brazilian tallow?

The tariffs are part of a broader 50% duty imposed on all Brazilian imports announced by US President Donald Trump on July 9, 2025. These tariffs were not specifically targeting tallow alone but affect the entire trade relationship between the two countries. The measure impacts a wide range of Brazilian exports to the United States, with tallow being particularly affected due to its significance in the biofuel supply chain.

Can Brazilian exporters legally avoid the tariffs?

Yes, through the US duty drawback mechanism, which allows for reimbursement of up to 99% of tariffs when the imported material is used in products that are subsequently exported. This approach is being utilized particularly by sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers who import Brazilian tallow, process it into SAF, and then export the finished fuel to international markets.

While this creates a legal pathway to mitigate tariff impacts, it requires significant cash flow capacity to cover the tariff payments during the several-month reimbursement process, limiting its accessibility to larger, financially robust companies.

What alternative markets exist for Brazilian tallow?

The primary alternatives for Brazilian tallow exporters include:

European markets: Offering long-term growth potential but with significant certification barriers and higher export costs

Regional South American markets: Including Uruguay and Argentina, though with limited absorption capacity compared to US volumes

Domestic Brazilian consumption: Providing immediate sales channels but typically at lower prices than international markets

Each alternative presents unique challenges in terms of price competitiveness, market access requirements, and volume capacity. Brazilian exporters are likely to pursue a diversified approach rather than relying on any single alternative market.

How long might these tariffs remain in place?

The tariffs are set to take effect on August 1, 2025, but their duration remains uncertain. Market participants are monitoring political developments while simultaneously developing both short-term workarounds and long-term alternative market strategies.

The policy could potentially be adjusted based on several factors:

Bilateral trade negotiations between the US and Brazil

Changes in US domestic biofuel production capacity

Evolution of global renewable fuel markets

Pressure from US biofuel producers facing feedstock shortages

Given this uncertainty, industry participants are developing strategies that can adapt to multiple scenarios, including both the potential continuation and eventual relaxation of the tariff measures.

The facility forms part of HAMR Energy’s broader strategy to capitalise on new international regulations that enable methanol as a SAF feedstock.
“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class LCLF industry,” said Jon Stribley, Co-founder of HAMR Energy.
HAMR Energy is currently finalising a $10 million Series A funding round, drawing strong interest from strategic partners and private investors.
The company sees this project as a cornerstone for positioning Australia as a leader in clean aviation fuel production and energy security.","HAMR Energy has unveiled plans to construct Australia’s first large-scale methanol-to-jet fuel production facility. The initiative, valued between $700 million and $800 million, aims to help decarbonise the aviation industry through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and generate jobs across the construction and operational phases.

The facility forms part of HAMR Energy’s broader strategy to capitalise on new international regulations that enable methanol as a SAF feedstock. Methanol, produced from sources like forestry residues and hydrogen, offers a scalable and flexible pathway to cut aviation emissions. The move also seeks to address a global SAF shortfall expected to reach 10 million tonnes by 2030.

The company’s recent feasibility study found that its technology offers a commercially viable way to produce SAF from methanol, with South Australia and Victoria identified as ideal locations.

“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class LCLF industry,” said Jon Stribley, Co-founder of HAMR Energy. “This methanol to jet feasibility study demonstrates our ability to deliver competitive, bankable, projects to help hard to abate industries like aviation decarbonise, whilst attracting significant investment and improving national fuel security.”

The proposed site will convert 300,000 tonnes of methanol into about 125 million litres of SAF annually, enough to offset emissions from roughly 3.5 million economy-class flights between Sydney and Melbourne.

Meanwhile, the USA and China had started a fresh round of talks as expectations grew that the world’s two biggest economies could agree a 90-day extension to their trade war truce, the BBC wrote on 28 July.

The trade deal with Indonesia included provisions eliminating tariff barriers on over 99% of US products exported to Indonesia across all sectors, including for all agricultural products, health products, seafood, information and communications technology, automotive products and chemicals, the Ethanol Producer report said.

According to a 23 July FreightWaves report, US trade with Indonesia totalled US$38.3bn in 2024. Key US imports from Indonesia include palm oil, electrical machinery, solar panels, leather shoes and cocoa butter.

US agriculture groups praised the new trade deal with Japan that calls for the nation to significantly increase its imports of US rice and purchase US$8bn in US goods, including corn, soyabeans, fertilisers, ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), according to a World Grain report.

“This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include US ethanol,” Ryan LeGrand, president and CEO of the US Grains Council (USGC), was quoted as saying in the 25 July report.

According to the US Census Bureau, Japan is the USA’s fifth-largest trading partner in goods, with two-way trade between the two countries totalling U$227.34bn in 2024 and Japan running a trade surplus of nearly US$70bn. ow

The US-EU deal will impose 15% tariffs on almost all European exports to the USA including cars, about triple the 4.8% tariff currently in force but avoiding punitive 30% import duties Trump had threatened to impose on 1 August, according to a 29 July report by The Guardian.

Trade between the two heavyweights was critical to global trade as it represented the most significant bilateral trade and investment relationship in the world, commodity platform Vesper wrote on 16 July.

In 2024, the US imported nearly US$3bn more in dairy products from the EU than it exported. Specifically, the EU’s agri-food exports to the USA, including dairy products, were valued at €25.1bn (US$29.45) between January and October 2024, according to the EU’s official website.

The European trade commissioner Maroš Šefčovič described the deal as a “breakthrough” in the face of a potential trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, The Guardian report said.

However, French prime minister François Bayrou said the EU had capitulated to Trump’s threats of ever-increasing tariffs, labelling the framework deal struck in Scotland on 27 July as a “dark day” for the EU.

German chancellor Friedrich Merz and Italian prime minister Giorgia Meloni welcomed the deal as averting a more damaging outcome.

Following the announcement of the US-EU trade agreement, trade organisation le ‘Comité Européen de Liaison du commerce agricole et agroalimentaire (CELCAA), which represents the interests of European agricultural and agri-food traders, said the deal would bring a degree of certainty and lead to the re-equilibrium of trade activity between the USA and the EU.

“While tariffs are nothing to celebrate, the agreement brings short-term certainty and avoids the threat of further escalation which has been hanging over operators for months now,” the association said on 28 July.

Trump’s agreement with the Philippines will reduce its tariff rate on goods from the country to the USA to 19%, without paying import taxes for what it sells there, according to the FreightWaves report. The previous duty rate on products from the Philippines was 20%.

The Philippines was the 33rd ranked US trading partner in 2024, with two-way trade totalling around US$23.5bn that year, the report said.

Despite daily “tactical pauses” declared by Israeli forces, humanitarian conditions in Gaza remain catastrophic, with children starving, aid workers overwhelmed and fuel and water supplies critically low, UN humanitarians reported on Wednesday.

Speaking at the regular news briefing in New York, UN Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said that even four days into the announced pauses, “we are still seeing casualties among those seeking aid and more deaths due to hunger and malnutrition.”

He added that parents are “struggling to save their starving children” and warned that the current conditions for aid delivery are “far from sufficient”.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said that while it is using every available window to deliver supplies during the unilateral pauses, the scale of need vastly outpaces what is getting through.

“A permanent ceasefire is needed more than ever,” Mr. Haq said, emphasising that “unilateral tactical pauses alone do not allow for the continuous flow of supplies required to meet immense needs levels in Gaza.”

Access a major hurdle

Access remains one of the biggest hurdles.

Entry through the Kerem Shalom/Karem Abu Salem crossing requires multiple layers of approval from Israeli authorities, including safe passage, cessation of bombardment and the literal opening of locked gates.

“Yesterday, three facilitated missions allowed our staff to collect cargo containing food from the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings and allowed for fuel to be transferred within Gaza,” Mr. Haq said.

“However, the others faced impediments, particularly delays in receiving the green light to move by the Israeli authorities, and one had to be cancelled.”

Extreme hunger haunts children

The situation was echoed by Ricardo Pires, UNICEF’s communication manager, who returned from Gaza this week.

“It’s absolutely apocalyptic,” he told UN News. “Children are being injured and killed while trying to get food and aid while suffering from malnutrition and hunger.”

Mr. Pires said that two out of the three criteria for a famine declaration have been met, according to the latest alert by food security experts.

UNICEF and other agencies are also grappling with the collapse of basic infrastructure.

Perfect storm of suffering for children

“We’re at the brink of a man-made drought,” Mr. Pires said, with only 40 per cent of water production functioning and children turning to contaminated sources, risking deadly disease.

“Children are dehydrated. They are reverting to contaminated water, which will make them sick, with deadly diseases or diarrhoea outbreaks and in some cases, even meningitis,” he added.

In conclusion, Veolia's Maia project is more than a technical achievement—it is a strategic investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow.
As the world transitions from a linear to a circular economy, projects like this will define the next decade of sustainable growth.","In an era where climate action is no longer optional but imperative, the convergence of technological innovation and circular economy principles is reshaping global markets. At the forefront of this transformation is Veolia, whose groundbreaking carbon capture and e-fuel project in Portugal exemplifies how strategic investments in decarbonization infrastructure can align profitability with planetary impact. For investors seeking opportunities at the intersection of sustainability and scalability, this project offers a compelling case study.

The Maia Project: A Blueprint for Circular Carbon Economy

Veolia's collaboration with LIPOR and P2X Europe at the Maia Energy Recovery Plant near Porto represents one of Europe's first Power-to-Liquid (PtL) projects. By capturing 100,000 tonnes of biogenic CO₂ annually from waste-to-energy (WtE) emissions, the project converts this carbon into e-kerosene, e-diesel, and chemical products using green hydrogen. This closed-loop system not only reduces the plant's emissions to near-zero but also transforms non-recyclable municipal waste into a resource, aligning with Portugal's carbon neutrality goals.

The project's strategic value lies in its dual impact:

1. Circular Economy Enablement: By repurposing CO₂ emissions as feedstock for e-fuels, the initiative redefines waste as a commodity, closing the carbon loop in energy production.

2. Decarbonization Scalability: The integration of CCU technology with existing WtE infrastructure demonstrates a replicable model for industrial decarbonization, particularly in sectors like aviation, which lack low-carbon alternatives.

Strategic Investment Logic: Aligning with Global Transition Trends

Veolia's Portugal project is not an isolated endeavor but part of a broader €4 billion investment strategy to dominate the €500 billion local decarbonizing energy market. Key drivers for investors include:

- Policy Tailwinds: Portugal's aggressive climate targets, including a 2050 carbon neutrality goal, create a regulatory environment that incentivizes CCU and e-fuel adoption.

- Market Demand: The aviation industry alone requires 300 million tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel by 2050 to meet ICAO targets, a demand Veolia's e-kerosene production is poised to address.

- Technological Leadership: Veolia's global R&D in CCU (e.g., amine capture, MOFs) and its track record in projects like India's Tata Steel CCU plant reinforce its competitive edge.

Financial and Market Implications

While specific ROI metrics for the Maia project are not disclosed, the broader financial landscape suggests strong potential. A 2020 study of European utilities found a positive correlation between renewable energy investments and profitability, a trend likely to extend to CCU and e-fuel ventures. Veolia's GreenUp program, backed by €2 billion in capital, aims to reduce Scope 1-3 emissions by 50-30% by 2032, a trajectory validated by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

For investors, the project's alignment with the EU's Green Deal and COP28 ambitions further enhances its appeal. Portugal's role as a renewable energy leader (with 80% of its electricity already from renewables) positions it as a testing ground for scalable decarbonization solutions, which Veolia is uniquely equipped to commercialize.

Investment Advice: Positioning for Long-Term Value

Veolia's Portugal project underscores a critical shift: decarbonization is no longer a cost but a value driver. Investors should consider:

1. Equity Exposure: Veolia's stock, with its strong ESG alignment and €4 billion energy transition investment, offers exposure to a company at the vanguard of the circular economy.

2. Thematic ETFs: Funds focused on carbon capture, renewable energy, and ESG innovation can diversify risk while capturing sector-wide growth.

3. Public-Private Partnerships: Portugal's policy framework, including incentives for green hydrogen and CCU, signals a fertile ground for future collaborations, enhancing long-term returns.

In conclusion, Veolia's Maia project is more than a technical achievement—it is a strategic investment in the infrastructure of tomorrow. As the world transitions from a linear to a circular economy, projects like this will define the next decade of sustainable growth. For forward-looking investors, the message is clear: align with innovation, and the returns will follow.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-31 07:32:06.285661

Turning to SAF is a bigger, riskier move, but the Luxembourg-based operator is determined to continue its road to decarbonizing business aviation.

A recent collaboration puts the focus on clean jet fuel made in Iceland. Luxaviation has selected IdunnH2 for SAF deliveries, and this is a long-term, strategic partnership that will impact the future of private aviation. Instead of going for an established SAF producer with an existing roll-out, Luxaviation chose to support Iddunn H2, which is a green hydrogen company, to start making SAF and gradually increase its capacity.

This is known as an offtake framework, meaning that Luxaviation has agreed to purchase something that will be produced in the future, namely SAF. The actual delivery of Icelandic SAF to Luxaviation is set to begin in 2029, under this 15-year takeoff framework. Quantity-wise, we're talking 10,000 metric tonnes (11,000 tons) of RFNBO-compliant SAF per year.

The clean fuel will be certified in accordance with European standards (EU RED II and ReFuelEU) and will be distributed in the European Economic Area via an established book-and-claim system.

There are many types of SAF, and the one purchased by Luxaviation is e-kerosene. e-kerosene is made using green hydrogen (obtained from renewable power) and CO2, either straight from the atmosphere or from an industrial source. In order to qualify as a clean, sustainable fuel, e-kerosene must be produced with green hydrogen and sustainable water resources.

IdunnH2 will produce e-kerosene at a new facility in Helguvik Garbor, close to the Keflavik International Airport. Iceland is uniquely positioned to become a leader not only in green hydrogen but also SAF. IdunnH2 describes it as ""Europe's renewable energy island,"" which will allow the future SAF facility to run entirely on off-grid clean energy.

In addition to abundant water availability, Iceland has been one of the pioneers of green hydrogen in Europe. Here, green hydrogen has been used in the mobility sector for more than 15 years. More than two decades ago, in 2003, Iceland officially inaugurated the world's first commercial filling station. Fuel cell bus demonstrations took place as early as 2003 as well.

IdunnH2's SAF facility near the Keflavik Airport is expected to reach a capacity of 66,000 tons of fuel per year. This could be the first step in making Iceland one of the most important SAF suppliers in Europe.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/luxury-private-jet-operator-turns-to-icelandic-sustainable-fuel-255173_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-31 07:32:26.243551

• In the past few years, analysts from various houses seemed to view Singapore-listed China Aviation Oil (CAO) with mixed feelings.

• Recommendations have been muted, as they shifted emphasis at varying times in response to fluctuating risk factors.

Things like oil price volatility, trading margins, and associate contributions (from Shanghai Pudong International Airport Aviation Fuel Supply Company).

• Breaking out of that sentiment, CGS International has now put out a 'buy' call and a high $1.40 target price.

So has OCBC Investment Research, citing CAO as a potential beneficiary of the Equity Market Development Program (EQDP) given ""its significant net cash position and positive growth outlook.""

This follow CAO's robust US$78.1 million earnings for 2024 (+33.8% y-o-y).

• A striking thing is CAO had amassed a cashpile of US$500 million by end-2024, up from US$373 million a year earlier.

• When you look at the company's current market value of S$972 million (US$747 million, stock price S$1.13) and subtract all that cash, the actual business is valued at only S$328 million.

For a company pulling in ~US$85 million in profit, that's dirt cheap -- with ex-cash PE of 3.

• Wait, there's a downside risk -- CAO's trading of oil products is high volume and thin margin.

CAO reported losses for its 2H24 ""other oil products"" trading segment.

• Bottomline: SPIA's contribution is on an uptrend with Chinese aviation growth, while oil trading risks pose uncertainty for CAO. • For more, read what CGS says below ...

Excerpts from CGS International report

Analysts: Tan Jie Hui & Lim Siew Khee

Resume coverage; Add and a TP of S$1.40, ex cash 2x CY26 P/E.

We resume coverage on CAO with an Add call and a higher TP of S$1.40 as we roll over our valuation to FY26F and adjust our P/E multiple from 9.5x to 10x (CAO’s 10-year historical average).

The stock trades at CY26F 8.5x P/E and ex-cash P/E of 2x.

We estimate US$500m net cash at end-FY25F along with healthy operating cash flows, which should allow CAO to keep its FY25F dividend payout ratio at 30% minimum.

Re-rating catalysts: strong recovery in outbound China flight volumes, GPM improvement through sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) trading and M&As.

Downside risks: geopolitical tensions and economic slowdown impacting China’s outbound flight volumes and CAO’s GPM. Geopolitical tensions may weaken 2H25F margin

In Jun 25, escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran heightened concerns over disruptions to oil production and shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical chokepoint for global crude supply.

We reckon a potential volatility in freight costs for oil trading could impact GPM in 2H25F as not all of it can be passed through to customers, though CAO could capitalise on the rising oil prices for arbitrage opportunities.

As such, we estimate 1H25F contributed 57% of FY25F net profit.

Dividends and M&A ""CAO has maintained a robust net cash position for more than 10 years and it stood at US$500m as of FY24. Its debt-free balance sheet accords dry powder for M&As, which we see as a catalyst for longer-term growth. CAO was also able to sustain its 30% dividend payout (c.US$25m as of FY24). We believe CAO will pursue opportunities related to vertical integration across the value chain.""

Visa reforms and airline expansions to drive aviation growth

In Dec 24, China expanded its visa-free policy, allowing ordinary passport holders from 38 countries to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa while extending the permitted stay for eligible foreign travellers from 72 hours to 240 hours (source: gov.cn).

According to Centre for Aviation, airlines are ramping up China-bound services in 2025F.

We forecast EPS growth of 7%/7%/5% for FY25F/26F/27F.

1H25F preview: strong volumes likely led by aviation boom

More than 90m travellers (+7% yoy) passed through China’s aviation system during the spring festival season in Jan-Feb 25 while the May Day holiday brought a record 11m passenger trips on civil aviation networks (+12% yoy), according to Civil Aviation Administration of China.

We estimate CAO’s net profit rose 14% yoy to US$48m in 1H25F due to jet fuel volume growth and improvements in GPM due to better SAF trading with higher GPM.

We also believe share of associates’ profits climbed 19% yoy to US$28m in 1H25F as passenger traffic at Shanghai Pudong International Airport likely spiked during the abovementioned festive seasons.

Domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet 30% of New Zealand's jet fuel needs by 2050 could generate NZD 1.3 billion in gross value added (GVA) and create 5,700 jobs, while also strengthening fuel security, according to a Cyan Ventures study supported by Boeing.

“The opportunity to secure New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply, boost economic growth and help meet ambitious climate goals through SAF is compelling,” said Kimberly Camrass, Boeing acting regional sustainability lead, Asia Pacific. “Overall there’s a clear case to act now, and a clear set of potential steps.”

The report outlines the benefits of defining acceptable feedstocks and certification standards, linking SAF to the national Emissions Trading Scheme, establishing a policy framework to support investment into SAF, and create a strong demand and investment signal at a leadership level.

It also found that New Zealand can potentially safeguard NZD 4.1 billion in tourism revenue and almost NZD 200 million in trade revenue over the period to 2050, as other countries accelerate decarbonizing aviation and SAF becomes a business and passenger expectation.

""Additionally, New Zealand's reliance on imported jet fuel highlights the need for a domestic SAF supply. This is critical for reducing emissions as aviation could rise to represent 22% of the country’s gross emissions by 2050 if no action is taken, but also for ensuring sovereign security,” said Camrass.

SAF is produced from renewable sources – such as agricultural and forestry waste, animal fats, vegetable oils and municipal solid waste – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

While SAF currently costs more than conventional jet fuel, the study states that adopting 5% use of SAF by 2030 would align with other countries in the Asia Pacific region and add less than the cost of a cup of coffee on one-way domestic flights – a cost outweighed by attracting 1.2% more travelers.

More than 190 countries, including New Zealand, have agreed via the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reduce carbon intensity of aviation fuel by 5% by 2030, and approximately 45 countries are already implementing or committed to SAF policies, including all of New Zealand’s top ten trading partners.

The New Zealand SAF study, which is part of Boeing’s commitment to the aviation industry’s goal to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, was unveiled at a New Zealand industry Policy Roundtable on Aviation Decarbonisation held in Wellington today.

government’s new Low Carbon Jet Fuel (LCJF) standard.
To achieve this, the volume of LCJF blending in jet fuel in B.C.
But sustainable aviation fuel production is currently not meeting existing demand, and the investment climate in B.C.
Suppliers who sell smaller amounts of jet fuel are exempt from the requirements, according to the B.C.","British Columbia has long had the dubious distinction of having the highest gasoline prices in Canada. B.C.’s low carbon fuel standard is just one of the hidden costs that contribute to higher gas prices here. B.C. may soon have the highest jet fuel prices, too, thanks to the B.C. government’s new Low Carbon Jet Fuel (LCJF) standard.

As it has done with EV mandates, the David Eby government appears to have gotten out over its skis with its new LCJF standards, as they will require airlines to buy a type of fuel that is up to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and which does not exist in sufficient quantities yet in Canada or, indeed, anywhere in the world. “The airlines are very concerned about paying more, because one of their primary costs — if not the most expensive thing that they do — is buy their fuel,” said David Schick of the Canadian Fuels Association.

The new standards require major airlines and their fuel suppliers to decrease their carbon intensities by 2%, starting next year, with 2% decreases each year thereafter until they top out at 10% in 2030. To achieve this, the volume of LCJF blending in jet fuel in B.C. is mandated at 1% by 2028 and 3% by 2030.

Now, one or three per cent may not sound like a lot. But when that fuel additive is three or four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and when it is not being produced at the volumes required to meet demand, it could become very costly, if not impossible, for airlines to meet the new standards. Airlines and suppliers that can’t source enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to meet the standards will be subject to a penalty of $0.50 per litre. How much that additional cost will add to your airplane ticket to Calgary or Mexico remains to be seen.

Biofuels made from canola oil, animal fats or wood waste can be used as a drop-in fuel additive that lowers the emissions intensity of jet fuel without requiring any modifications to jet engines. But sustainable aviation fuel production is currently not meeting existing demand, and the investment climate in B.C. is such that proposed biofuel production projects here have stalled or been shelved. As a result, B.C. will be the only province in Canada obliging jet fuel buyers to buy fuels that are not being produced domestically, and doing so in a highly competitive market.

The Parkland refinery last year produced a small amount of low carbon jet fuel on a pilot basis – 101,000 litres – with Air Canada becoming a customer. But no one in Canada is currently producing SAF in the quantities that will be needed. To put things into perspective, YVR uses 1.5 billion to 2 billion litres of jet fuel annually, so 1% of that would be 15 million to 20 million litres, and 3% would be 45 million to 60 million.

Last year, the total global production of SAF was 1.3 billion litres, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which was 600,000 litres short of the 1.9 billion that had been expected to be produced. So the shortfall of SAF production isn’t just domestic, it’s global. The BC Chamber of Commerce warns the new SAF requirements will put B.C. at a disadvantage by raising costs for flying. “If British Columbia proceeds with its current timeline, in advance of the creation of domestic SAF production, and ahead of its peers on the west coast of North America and throughout Canada, airlines flying to and from BC airports will be at a competitive disadvantage,” the chamber warns.

Since there is currently no domestic production of these fuels, suppliers will have to import them from the U.S., and will be competing with airlines in Europe, which also has new LCJF mandates, for a limited supply. “Folks like our members are very concerned about being obligated on something that doesn’t exist,” Schick said. “There’s just not enough of it to be able to meet the targets.” Which raises the question: Will air travel in and out of B.C. become more expensive? And will small regional and municipal airports and charter operators be suddenly hit with soaring fuel bills? The standards only apply to the suppliers of jet fuel for the big airlines and largest airports. Suppliers who sell smaller amounts of jet fuel are exempt from the requirements, according to the B.C. government. Small, regional airports and small charter airline companies therefore should not be subject to the new LCJF standards. Only major airlines and airports will be required to meet the new standards.

“It’s not in every litre that you have to have renewable in some percentage,” Schick explained. “It’s in aggregate. It’s over the total pool.” “So if you have to be 5% SAF in your mix for the province of British Columbia, you may have 7% at YVR to make up that total obligation, and not have it at many of the small airports. It would be just too difficult, logistically, to move it around.”

To get some idea of what B.C.’s new LCJF standard might mean for air travel costs, we can look to Europe. The EU has a 2% SAF standard in place, and some airlines operating out of European airports are already adding surcharges, as a result. Lufthansa has a new environmental surcharge to cover the increased cost of SAF that adds one to 72 Euros (CAN$1.60 to $114) to the ticket price for flights out of 27 European countries, the UK, Norway and Switzerland.

If the B.C. government wants airlines to meet new LCFS standards, it and the federal government will need to somehow incentivize domestic SAF production. “Most of my job these days is trying to get the Government of Canada to help us create an investment climate that allows us to compete with the U.S.,” Schick said, “because they have a lot of incentives to make this stuff.”",https://resourceworks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/SAF-AP-Photo-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 20:01:04.992217

“The opportunity to secure New Zealand’s long-term aviation fuel supply, boost economic growth and help meet ambitious climate goals through SAF is compelling,” said Kimberly Camrass, Boeing acting regional sustainability lead, Asia Pacific. “Overall there’s a clear case to act now, and a clear set of potential steps.”

The report outlines the benefits of defining acceptable feedstocks and certification standards, linking SAF to the national Emissions Trading Scheme, establishing a policy framework to support investment into SAF, and create a strong demand and investment signal at a leadership level.

It also found that New Zealand can potentially safeguard NZD 4.1 billion in tourism revenue and almost NZD 200 million in trade revenue over the period to 2050, as other countries accelerate decarbonizing aviation and SAF becomes a business and passenger expectation.

""Additionally, New Zealand's reliance on imported jet fuel highlights the need for a domestic SAF supply. This is critical for reducing emissions as aviation could rise to represent 22% of the country’s gross emissions by 2050 if no action is taken, but also for ensuring sovereign security,” said Camrass.

SAF is produced from renewable sources – such as agricultural and forestry waste, animal fats, vegetable oils and municipal solid waste – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

While SAF currently costs more than conventional jet fuel, the study states that adopting 5% use of SAF by 2030 would align with other countries in the Asia Pacific region and add less than the cost of a cup of coffee on one-way domestic flights – a cost outweighed by attracting 1.2% more travelers.

More than 190 countries, including New Zealand, have agreed via the International Civil Aviation Organisation to reduce carbon intensity of aviation fuel by 5% by 2030, and approximately 45 countries are already implementing or committed to SAF policies, including all of New Zealand’s top ten trading partners.

Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.
It includes sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel.","Comment: When I board my flight from Wellington to Sydney, I’m not just thinking about the meetings ahead. As CEO of a transport energy company, I’m acutely aware that the fuel powering that aircraft represents one of our greatest decarbonisation challenges.

New Zealand is a geographically remote island, which means air travel is vital to our connection with the rest of the world. Tourism also makes up an essential part of our economy. The overwhelming majority of visitors get on a plane to visit and air transport enables the export of some of our most valuable products to customers across the globe every day.

While critical, its contribution to carbon emissions is a challenge that needs to be addressed. Aviation accounts for around 2-3 percent of global carbon emissions, but unlike road transport where we’re seeing the adoption of electric vehicles, the technology pathway for low-carbon aviation is far more challenging. There is no battery technology currently on the horizon to power long-haul international flights. For the foreseeable future, if we want to keep flying, we need liquid fuels.

Beyond changes such as reducing flights or deploying more efficient aircraft, airlines are looking to alternative jet fuel options, such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), as the most viable solution currently available for a lower-carbon emission future in air travel.

SAF is an industry term used for a form of alternative jet fuel made using feedstocks such as forestry residues, municipal waste, or used cooking oils with the goal of reducing the lifecycle carbon footprint of jet fuel. SAF is most typically used by international airlines when blended with conventional jet fuel to form part of the overall fuel mix and is considered as a ‘drop‑in’ fuel, meaning it can be used in an existing aircraft fleet.

SAF was first used in New Zealand in September 2022, when Z, in partnership with Air New Zealand and Neste, imported 1.2 million litres – enough fuel to power approximately 400 return flights between Wellington and Auckland. This remains the largest SAF shipment New Zealand has made to date.

The aviation sector globally is showing growing interest in SAF. Some airlines have set carbon emission reduction targets, passengers are increasingly conscious of their carbon footprints, and international regulations are generally evolving towards tighter environmental standards. Yet today, SAF represents less than 1 percent of total aviation fuel use worldwide, primarily due to limited supply and high costs.

One of the biggest challenges for SAF production is getting enough of the right feedstock (raw material from which fuels are produced). There are several different feedstocks that are commonly used, such as tallow and vegetable oils. Other feedstocks such as woody biomass or hydrogen can technically be used, however these can be harder or more costly to manufacture. The additional layer of complexity with any feedstock is that many have alternative uses in the energy transition, so the best use case for each feedstock needs to be taken into consideration as countries and industries navigate the energy transition.

For me it isn’t a question of if we need SAF in New Zealand, but how we will be able to successfully establish its supply for the domestic and Trans-Tasman markets when international demand for the product is increasing.

At Z, we’ve spent considerable time over the past few years working with industry partners across Aotearoa to understand what it would take. Our conclusion is clear: we need supportive policy settings to give industry the confidence to invest, combined with strategic partnerships and economies of scale that can deliver SAF reliably and in the most cost-effective way to our airline customers.

The global policy race is already underway

All of New Zealand’s top 10 trading partners now either have SAF-supportive policies in place or have shown support for it. Many countries already have minimum SAF-blending requirements, and over time, market access may depend on meeting these requirements. Without action to establish policy settings that create a level playing field, our region risks losing competitiveness, increased exposure to offshore compliance costs, and being shaped by policies set by others.

The call for supportive policy settings extends beyond Z. Air New Zealand’s public support for a SAF mandate last year reflects broader industry recognition of what’s needed. We’re continuing to collaborate with fuel supply chain partners, airports and airlines and their representative groups to help inform the Government on policy settings that aim to keep New Zealand competitive in an increasingly regulated global aviation market.

Collaborative advantage

Z’s view is that New Zealand’s approach to SAF should play to our strengths – our strong relationships, particularly our Trans-Tasman connections, may allow us to access SAF supply more effectively than attempting to build domestic production capacity from scratch.

That is why Z is looking to our parent company Ampol, to see what opportunities we can leverage with our joint scale. Ampol’s Memorandum of Understanding with GrainCorp and Industry Funds Management Investors (IFM) to explore the establishment of an integrated renewable fuels* industry presents one possible opportunity.

The initial priority under the memorandum saw Ampol and IFM progress a feasibility assessment of a renewable fuels facility at Ampol’s refinery in Brisbane and work with GrainCorp to explore the supply of homegrown feedstocks, including additional crushing capacity to supply canola oil to the potential future plant. The feasibility work for the plant is now complete, and the project has moved into the next phase of pre-FEED (front-end engineering and design).

The project is still very much in its infancy, with much progress to be made before it’s determined viable, but it’s a step in the right direction. It’s not the only project on the table, there are others exploring similar opportunities, and every initiative will keep more options on the table to hopefully see the industry create a viable market in the future.

The opportunity remains

New Zealand needs to evaluate any SAF policy announced in Australia and be ready to consider how it might be mirrored or adapted for the New Zealand market.

This isn’t just about following Australia’s lead; it’s about ensuring we don’t create unnecessary barriers that fragment what could be a unified Trans-Tasman market. When policies are aligned, this will help investment stay in our region.

Aotearoa New Zealand has a genuine opportunity to be part of building a thriving SAF market that could benefit our aviation sector, climate goals and economic competitiveness.

This ambitious program seeks to achieve its environmental objectives by promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for all domestic flights. This is not merely another aid scheme; it represents the very first such initiative approved by the Commission that specifically champions the widespread adoption of SAF.

The Danish scheme, slated to run until December 31, 2027, is meticulously crafted to incentivize airlines operating within Denmark to transition to SAF on their domestic routes. A key objective of this initiative is to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates using a minimum of 40% SAF, a figure remarkably close to the current technical limit of 50%.

Under the framework of this progressive scheme, the financial assistance will be disbursed as monthly direct grants. These grants are specifically earmarked to cover the additional costs incurred by airlines when utilizing SAF as opposed to conventional kerosene. This comprehensive coverage also extends to supplementary expenses related to airport infrastructure adaptations necessary for handling and supplying SAF. To ensure fiscal responsibility and maximize the impact of the aid, the level of support will be determined through a competitive bidding process. This mechanism is designed to guarantee both cost-effectiveness and efficiency in the allocation of funds. The program is projected to support a minimum of 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations on a weekly basis, spread across one or more domestic routes within Denmark.

To prevent any instances of overcompensation, the scheme incorporates stringent rules. These include the explicit exclusion of supported SAF from any parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive. Furthermore, the scheme strictly prohibits the use of SAF that has previously received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or any third countries, ensuring that the aid contributes genuinely new reductions in emissions.

Denmark, for its part, has committed to ensuring that the aid will result in overall CO2 reductions and will not merely lead to a displacement of emissions from one sector to another.

This approval highlights the continued evolution of the 2022 CEEAG, which provides vital guidance on how the Commission assesses the compatibility of environmental protection, climate protection, and energy aid measures that fall under the notification requirement of Article 107(3)(c) TFEU. These Guidelines establish a flexible and fit-for-purpose enabling framework, designed to empower Member States in providing the essential support needed to achieve European Green Deal in a targeted and cost-effective manner.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-07-30 14:56:53.166807

The company plans to assemble the prototype core for testing starting around year’s end at its recently acquired test site at Colorado Air and Space Port in Watkins. Located close to Denver International Airport and the company’s Centennial headquarters, the facility will be expanded for follow-on, full-up propulsion system tests later in 2026.

Boom founder and CEO Blake Scholl noted July 28 on social media that “first chips” had been cut by a computer numerically controlled lathe that was newly installed in the company’s Denver “Supercenter” facility. Other recently acquired machine tools include a 65,000-lb. mill for producing precision machined large castings and forgings. Parts will be combined with a growing collection of other core components already produced, including additively made turbine blades and outer blade air seals.

Texas-based high-temperature materials and components partner ATI is providing materials for Symphony’s high-pressure compressor integrated blade and disk stages, as well as the turbine disk. Other engine partners in the Boom-led propulsion program include Standard Aero and Florida Turbine Technologies (FTT), a unit of Kratos.

In development for Boom’s planned Mach 1.7 Overture airliner, the two-spool, 3:1 medium-bypass turbofan engine will feature a single-stage 72-in.-dia. hollow blade fan and be optimized for prolonged supersonic operation with an air-cooled, single-stage high-pressure turbine and three-stage low-pressure turbine. The overall propulsion system will weigh 14,000 lb. and measure 41-ft. long, of which 12 ft. will be made up by the core.

Speaking at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Aviation Forum in Las Vegas on July 25, Lazzara says Symphony “is an ambitious attempt to bring a new engine to market that fits in between existing off-the-shelf options as a 40,000 lb.-thrust class medium bypass ratio engine. It is already designed to be 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) compatible, so that we can plug that in once the infrastructure is ready for use.

“On top of that, it has a key set of design features going from the inlet to the trailing edge at the back of the nozzle that enables it to meet the noise regulations as part of the package overall with Overture,” Lazzara says. “We have some experienced partners in the industry that have helped with the turbomachinery design, as well as others who have been a part of engine OEMs and aircraft OEMs that have come together to bring the design in a way that would not be possible by simply pulling an off-the-shelf engine.”

Explaining the difference between a conventional aircraft design approach and the integrated airframe-engine process underway at Boom, Lazzara says “airframe design and the engine design are basically two separate design worlds that are brought together and oftentimes in a suboptimal marriage. When Boom made the choice to bring the engine in-house, they essentially brought those two worlds and made them one, allowing for optimal integration, mission performance and even closure of a business model. This is what sets Boom apart from other attempts at high-speed flight in the past,” he adds.",https://aviationweek.com/sites/default/files/AWN_favicon_06122019.png,N,,2025-07-30 14:57:01.826058

There are concerns that green policies, such as using more sustainable aviation fuel, could lead to higher air fares.

Nats, the air traffic control provider that commissioned the research, said it had worked closely with aviation partners over the past 12 months to enhance punctuality and resilience.

This included using tools such as intelligent approach, which optimises the distances between arriving aircraft.

Nats said it was responsible for 1.2 per cent of total delays to flights en route to Europe in June, despite handling nearly a quarter of air traffic.

Thousands of UK airline passengers have suffered delays because of industrial action by French air traffic control staff in recent months.

The survey indicated that 52 per cent of UK adults had flown internationally in the previous 12 months, while 32 per cent flew domestically. Some 26 per cent expected to fly more in the following year.

The poll also suggested a growing acceptance of aviation innovation such as drones, flying taxis and AI-enabled services.

For example, 68 per cent of respondents supported using AI to screen bags while 50 per cent were in favour of it managing flight routing.

Simon Warr, Nats’ communications director, said: “The 2025 Aviation Index highlights the public’s clear priorities – reliable service, greater environmental performance, and smart use of innovation.

The 230,000-panel installation was developed by Energy Solutions Group (ESG), the Belgian green energy firm, which invested 90 million euros in the project, according to reporting by De Tijd.

The De Groene Energie Corridor (DGEC) solar farm, covering 100 hectares, lies under Schiphol’s approach routes and is capable of powering around 40,000 households. A Dutch court recently ruled that only part of the site (two of its four zones) must be taken down due to potential glare during landings. However, Schiphol is now pushing for the entire farm to be removed.

Safety concerns

In a letter to the Dutch infrastructure minister, Schiphol CEO Pieter van Oord warned that from late August to early April, glare from the panels could force runway closures and lead to ""accidents with potentially fatal consequences."" The airport argues that this would reduce capacity, increase noise elsewhere, and potentially cause millions in damages.

“The main issue is who is responsible for the costs""

ESG and DGEC say they are disappointed with Schiphol’s decision to escalate the issue politically after losing in court. They continue that the project has an irrevocable permit and have proposed reorienting the panels to reduce reflection, but are asking Schiphol to contribute to the cost. “The main issue is who is responsible for the costs,” ESG said.

The dispute marks a setback for ESG, which has grown rapidly with support from investors including Patronale Life, SFPIM and France’s Infranity. The Limburg-based company recently raised 125 million euros and is seen as a potential green energy unicorn.

While solar farms near airports are a growing trend, they remain sensitive. Brussels Airport aims to be carbon neutral by 2030 and has conducted extensive reflection studies for its own solar installations. At Ostend-Bruges Airport, solar panels were also added without issue.

That opportunity, radiating with promise and potential, is green hydrogen.

The upcoming Global African Hydrogen Summit 2025 is not merely another forum for dialogue; it is a clarion call for bold leadership and decisive action. The vision of Africa as a global green hydrogen powerhouse is no longer a distant aspiration. It is an emerging reality, and is fuelled by the continent’s abundant renewable energy resources, a surge in political will, and, most significantly, a dynamic generation of young Africans ready to innovate and lead change.

Consider this: over 60% of the world’s most abundant solar resources shine upon Africa. When combined with expanding wind corridors, burgeoning geothermal developments, and ongoing improvements to hydropower infrastructure, Africa holds an unparalleled natural advantage. This positions the continent to produce green hydrogen at a globally competitive scale and cost. Yet, this journey is not solely about electrons and molecules — it is a roadmap to transformational development, one that uplifts lives and empowers communities.

Green hydrogen is a catalyst for inclusive growth, delivering benefits across multiple sectors:

Decarbonising industries and forging new global value chains: By embracing green hydrogen, we can revolutionise our industrial landscape, positioning itself at the heart of emerging green global value chains. This ushers in a new era of sustainable industrialisation — one that is both environmentally sound and economically resilient.

Creating dignified jobs and empowering local talent: The green hydrogen economy is a powerful engine for employment. From electrolyser manufacturing and advanced engineering services to logistics and infrastructure, this sector offers career pathways that build skills, foster economic independence, and empower individuals and communities alike.

Empowering local communities with clean energy and infrastructure: Beyond large-scale industrial developments, green hydrogen brings direct benefits to communities. It means modern infrastructure and access to clean, reliable energy to power homes, schools, and businesses — transforming lives from the ground up.

Unlocking new markets for African exports: Green hydrogen presents a unique opportunity to enhance the value of African exports. From green hydrogen-based fertilisers to green steel, the continent can open new market frontiers, adding value to agricultural and mineral resources and strengthening trade competitiveness.

The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €36 million (DKK 268 million) Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector. This will be achieved through encouraging the use of sustainable aviation fuel (‘SAF’) for domestic flights. This is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of SAF and represents a significant step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, aligning with both national and EU climate objectives.

The Danish scheme

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027. The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark. The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or third countries.

The Commission’s assessment

The Commission assessed the scheme under EU State aid rules, in particular Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (‘TFEU’), which enables Member States to support the development of certain economic activities subject to certain conditions, and the Guidelines on State aid for climate, environmental protection and energy (‘CEEAG’), which allow Member States to support measures reducing or removing CO2 emissions.

The Commission found that:

The scheme is necessary and appropriate to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector in line with national and EU environmental targets.

The scheme has an incentive effect, as airlines benefitting from the measure would not use SAF to the same extent without the public support.

The aid has limited impact on competition and trade within the EU. It is proportionate as the aid will be limited to the minimum necessary, given the use of a competitive bidding process. Denmark committed to ensure that the aid delivers overall CO2 reductions and that it does not merely displace emissions from one sector to another.

On this basis, the Commission approved the Danish scheme under EU State aid rules.

Background

The 2022 CEEAG provide guidance on how the Commission will assess the compatibility of environmental protection, including climate protection, and energy aid measures which are subject to the notification requirement under Article 107(3)(c) TFEU.

The Guidelines create a flexible, fit-for-purpose enabling framework to help Member States provide the necessary support to reach the European Green Deal objectives in a targeted and cost-effective manner. The rules involve an alignment with the important EU’s objectives and targets set out in the European Green Deal and with other recent regulatory changes in the energy and environmental areas and will cater for the increased importance of climate protection.

From hydrocracker hacks in Croatia to post‑Brexit fuel moonshots in the UK, from Hawaii’s island‑energy puzzle to solar‑made jet fuel in Switzerland, a new wave of innovators is showing how to crack the hardest code in aviation: scaling SAF without breaking the system that keeps planes (and economies) in the air.

The Hydrocracker Hack: CLG & INA Break New Ground

The first code cracked? Making old refineries run like new.

Chevron Lummus Global (CLG) and Croatia’s INA recently pulled off a milestone demonstration at INA’s hydrocracker unit, proving that legacy infrastructure can be deftly retooled to co‑process bio‑based and fossil feedstocks at scale. The test involved 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) alongside fossil feedstocks — a first for the site — yielding ISCC‑certified clean fuels under the watch of independent body Bureau Veritas d.o.o.

This wasn’t just a “plug‑and‑play” switch. The project required custom filters, re‑engineered laboratory methods, and boosted capacity in both hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units — all while keeping the biogenic feedstock within safe operating parameters.

CLG and INA’s work shows how existing assets can be bent toward the future without breaking budgets or production schedules. And this isn’t a one‑off stunt: INA plans to complete all preparatory work by 2029, positioning itself for continuous SAF supply.

Post‑Brexit: The UK’s Fuel Codebreakers

If Bletchley Park cracked wartime ciphers, the UK’s Department for Transport (DfT) is cracking the supply code for jet fuel’s low‑carbon future.

Through its Advanced Fuels Fund (AFF), DfT just backed Essar Energy Transition to build one of the UK’s largest advanced SAF production hubs at Stanlow. The Methanol‑to‑Jet facility is slated to produce 200,000 tons of SAF per year, drawing from 550,000 tpa of renewable e‑methanol and bio‑methanol, including supplies from Essar Future Energies’ upcoming project in Gujarat, India.

The roadmap is clear: pre‑FEED design by March 2026, full FEED by Q2 2026, and a final investment decision by late 2027. When online, the hub will flow directly into the Manchester Jet, Midlands, and UKOP pipeline systems— using existing jet fuel “arteries” to pump green molecules across the UK.

And Essar isn’t the only player in this decoding effort. LanzaTech Global just secured an $8.5M AFF grant for its DRAGON projects:

DRAGON 1 will turn recycled ethanol into jet fuel at a Port Talbot facility using LanzaJet’s Alcohol‑to‑Jet tech.

DRAGON 2 will pioneer the conversion of waste CO₂ + green hydrogen into ethanol for SAF at a UK site yet to be named.

Meanwhile, LanzaJet’s Project Speedbird (36% owned by LanzaTech) also got AFF backing, helping scale SAF production inside the UK.

Island Ciphers: Hawaii & Tahiti Rewrite Their Fuel Future

For islands, energy is its own Enigma — and Hawaii is cracking the code with one of its biggest SAF plays yet.

Par Pacific Holdings, Mitsubishi, and ENEOS Corporation have joined forces under the banner Hawaii Renewables to produce renewable fuels at Par Pacific’s Kapolei refinery. Mitsubishi and ENEOS, via Alohi Renewable Energy, LLC, are putting up $100M for a 36.5% stake, with Par Pacific leading project execution.

Once operational, Hawaii Renewables will pump out roughly 61 million gallons per year of renewable diesel, SAF, naphtha, and low‑carbon LPG — with up to 60% SAF capacity aimed squarely at decarbonizing the islands’ aviation sector.

And in French Polynesia, Atoba Energy and Air Moana are taking a similar path, locking in a 10‑year SAF offtake deal that ramps up from 2026 through 2035, blending physical delivery with a book‑and‑claim system to meet ReFuelEU targets.

Solar Decoded: SWISS & Synhelion Turn Sunlight Into Jet Fuel

In perhaps the most poetic codebreak yet, SWISS International Air Lines became the first airline to integrate solar‑made jet fuel into regular operations.

Swiss‑based Synhelion delivered 190 liters of synthetic crude — created at its DAWN solar‑thermal plant — to a northern German refinery, where it was processed into certified Jet‑A1 fuel. It was then fed into the Hamburg Airport supply system and blended for SWISS flights.

“A genuine milestone,” said CEO Jens Fehlinger, calling it a proud investment in Swiss innovation and a vital step toward wall‑to‑wall renewable aviation.

Cracking the Registry: Ensuring Trust in SAF

Even SAF tracking is getting its code cracked.

The Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO) and 4AIR have joined forces to harmonize SAF registries across commercial and business aviation, eliminating double‑counting risks and streamlining emissions claims. “It sends a strong demand signal for more SAF,” said 4AIR President Kennedy Ricci, emphasizing the importance of transparency and integrity in the emerging market.

From Riga to the Runway: The Baltic Breakthrough

And in Latvia, a priority project for the Latvian Investment and Development Agency has broken ground: a 236,000‑ton feedstock plant in Riga, expected to produce 93,000 tons of HVO and 87,000 tons of SAF annually — enough to cover 100% of Baltic aviation demand and export 70% of production.

The Bigger Picture: From Enigma to Everyday

Each of these moves — whether hacking hydrocrackers, repurposing pipelines, or rewriting sunlight into fuel — chips away at the central cipher: How do we make enough SAF, cheaply enough, to decarbonize global aviation?",,N,,2025-07-30 13:56:28.768342

That performance feature allows flights to haul more cargo or land at airports with short runways and makes operations both more flexible and profitable for carriers as well as improving safety for pilots.

The way Airbus achieved that in its latest widebody series is a combination of a few engineering factors. One of the primary contributors is the low weight of the big jet, thanks to its composite materials. The other big contributor is the aerodynamic shape of its wings and the performance of its engines. So, without any further ado, let's break it down.

How Slow Does The A350 Go?

Now, if you ask any pilot or air traffic controller (ATC), every landing is different, and that means that landing speeds are too. Even with that in mind, the A350 generally comes in around the 140-knot (259 kmh) mark on approach and touchdown. That low speed makes landing safer and smoother during normal operations, but the qualities that make that possible also unlock other potential. In the post-pandemic era of recovery, airlines need the flexibility to fly to virtually any destination with many different load factors and route profiles while keeping costs low.

The large wing surfaces of the A350 with extending flaps and other control surfaces make it highly controllable in harsh weather or under tough conditions like hot or high operations. When the air is thin in hot weather or at high-altitude airfields, the A350 is unbothered, and flights run like business as usual. Its reverse thrusters also shorten the rolling distance the A350 needs to stop once it hits the tarmac, which opens more destinations and increases the max payload potential. That means carriers can fly more, fly further, and go to more places than before with better operating efficiency than ever before.

Airbus has been locked in a rivalry with Boeing for decades over both the narrowbody and widebody market, which has inspired innovation by both aerospace juggernauts. As Boeing struggles with certification and production issues on both the 737 MAX and 777X, Airbus has had an opening to shine. The A350 has impressed airlines around the world with its flexibility, efficiency, and excellent flying characteristics, filling the order books and even prompting a specialized ultra-long-haul variant, the A350-900ULR, to be made for Singapore Airlines.

The A350-900 By The Numbers

Airbus’ original extra-widebody A350 officially entered commercial service in 2015 with the first delivered A350-900 going to Qatar Airways. The first of its class, the -900, is not a small plane by any means. Purpose-made to be a champion of long-haul flying, it also carries a strong seat count that makes it highly useful for both dense hubs and distant connections. Over 560 of the -900 model have been built for customers all over the world, from the United States to China or Qatar, along with almost 100 of the -1000 variant thus far.

The -900 so impressed with its fuel efficiency and range that Singapore ordered seven jets with more fuel capacity to make nonstop flights between Changi International Airport (SIN) and New York’s John F Kennedy International (JFK), which covers 9,537 miles (15,349 km) and is nearly 19 hours long. The high-lift aerodynamic design that makes low-speed landings possible also gives it that incredible range.

The A350-1000 By The Numbers

Three years after its predecessor, the stretched A350XWB variant would arrive at Qatar as well, with the first A350-1000 touching down at Doha International Airport (DIA) in 2018. The -1000 has the more powerful Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-97 engines compared to XWB-84 on the -900 but virtually identical wings, but thanks to its elongated fuselage, it can carry more fuel to fly even further.

The A350-1000 has an equally good reputation for low-speed handling that makes takeoff and landing a smooth and safe experience for aircrew and passengers alike. The freighter variant A350F that is expected to debut in 2027 will use the same platform as the -1000, just swapping seats out for pallet anchors. The -1000 has been a success serving the largest hubs in the world for global airlines like Emirates, Japan Airlines (JAL), British Airways, and Air France, to name just a few.

Composite Airframe Weight Savings

Airbus claims that by using composites known as carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and other weight-saving techniques, the A350 cut 1.2 metric tons of weight compared to conventional alloys. Minimizing the aircraft's systems, structures, and installation architecture also enabled this weight loss regimen. These advances in material science were applied to both the -900 and the stretched -1000.

The A350 program advanced the aerospace application of cutting-edge carbon fiber. The support structure of the landing gear, as well as the upper and lower wing covers, all use the same material, in addition to the fuselage structures. CFRP helped make the cabin quieter, and its greater strength allowed for a reduced cabin altitude of 6,000 ft (1,828 m). The wider and longer cabin also allowed for bulkheads in the rear and cockpit to be changed, with 30 extra seats possible thanks to the new layout.

In the first recorded incident of a serious A350 crash that occurred in Japan last year, the composites materials were credited with actually saving lives. At Tokyo Haneda Airport(HND), the JAL A350-900 collided with a Coast Guard Bombardier Dash-9 patrol plane en route to Niigata with humanitarian aid. The Dash-9 crew all perished in the mishap, but all 379 passengers and crew of the Airbus escaped, which was attributed to the fire-resistant qualities of the plane’s materials in a report by Plastics Today.

The use of advanced carbon-fiber composites made the A350 lighter, which makes its lowest airspeeds before stall better than the previous generation. That material also dramatically increased the performance of its control surfaces and wing, which enhanced its lift generation and aerodynamic properties in all flight regimes.

Aerodynamics For Ideal Handling

Each variant of the A350 has essentially the same wing with a flexing shape that “twists” as it flies through different conditions of speed, altitude, and load factors. That wing enables it to fly efficiently at high cruising speeds as well as land with slow, gentle handling characteristics. The carbon composite material that makes up much of the wing’s composition allows it to have this incredible flexibility while also being very light and strong.

A report by the International Council of Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS) praised the engineering of the A350, saying:

“‘Shaping Efficiency’ was the directive for the design of the aircraft, which was valid for all involved disciplines but of special motivation for aerodynamics. That means for the high-lift system to deliver maximum aerodynamic efficiency for low approach speeds and low take off drag, while keeping the overall system small and simple to provide low weight and low complexity.”

The wings of the A350 are very large and get even larger when the leading Droop Nose Device (DND) and slat surfaces drop down to increase lift. The Adaptive Drooped Hinge Flaps (ADHF) extend as the plane nears the runway, which raises the wing’s lifting power even more. There are also seven spoilers on the wing to complement the flaps’ effects. All of these qualities make both the A350-900 and -1000 a slow, safe, and predictable widebody jetliner when it returns from the sky and gently sets back down on earth.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-the-airbus-a350-has-such-a-slow-landing-speed-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 12:58:08.732889

The successful test, conducted within a CLG-licensed hydrocracking unit, underscores the adaptability of existing refinery infrastructure for producing renewable fuels. This development is particularly crucial as the aviation industry seeks viable pathways to decarbonize and reduce its environmental footprint. The ability to integrate new feedstocks into current operational units offers a cost-effective and efficient solution for increasing SAF production capacity.

""This test-run conducted at INA's hydrocracker unit, along with several other recent tests by CLG licensees, showcase how our technology can be integrated into customers' existing infrastructure to co-process a wide range of feedstocks to produce clean fuels,"" stated Arun Arora, Chief Technology Officer, Chevron Lummus Global. Arora further emphasized, ""The results also underscore the flexibility and scalability of our technologies and how they help customers maximize the value of their assets while achieving their sustainability goals."" His comments highlight CLG's commitment to fostering innovation that supports both economic viability and environmental responsibility.

The testing phase involved the co-processing of 1,000 tonnes of 5% palm oil mill effluent (POME) feedstock, a biogenic material, alongside conventional fossil-based feedstocks. The rigorous process and the resulting biofuels were meticulously certified by Bureau Veritas d.o.o., an independent certification body, in strict adherence to the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) standard for sustainable biofuels. This certification provides crucial validation of the sustainability credentials of the produced SAF and renewable diesel.

Prior to the commercial test, CLG and INA engaged in extensive collaboration to overcome the inherent complexities associated with processing a novel feedstock like POME, which possesses distinct physical and chemical properties. This collaborative effort encompassed a wide array of preparatory activities, including the procurement of specialized filters, the adaptation of existing laboratory methodologies, and crucial modifications to enhance the capacity of both the hydrocracking and vacuum distillation units. Furthermore, meticulous attention was paid to ensuring the controlled and safe handling of the biogenic feedstock within the refinery's existing operational parameters.

The pilot marks an initial step toward a nationwide rollout planned for early 2026, as part of Vietnam’s broader push toward cleaner energy alternatives.

Petrolimex will introduce E10 at 36 fuel stations across Ho Chi Minh City, while PVOIL will begin sales at six locations, including four in Hanoi and two in Hai Phong.

Despite the upcoming launch, concerns remain about ethanol supply. Vietnam currently has six ethanol production plants with a combined capacity of around 500,000 cubic metres per year. However, only two facilities are currently operating, producing just 100,000 cubic metres annually.

Dao Duy Anh, deputy director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade’s Agency for Innovation, Green Transition and Industry Promotion, noted that Vietnam may need to import ethanol in the early stages. Major ethanol-producing countries such as the United States, Brazil, and Argentina, as well as regional suppliers like Singapore and South Korea, are expected to help fill the gap.

In the meantime, domestic ethanol producers are preparing for a potential rebound in demand. The Petrovietnam Central Biofuels Joint Stock Company is working to restart key production facilities, including the Dung Quat plant, which is expected to resume operations by late 2025.

This approval marks the first time the Commission has greenlit a state aid scheme focused specifically on promoting the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), reflecting a key step towards decarbonising the aviation sector, reports European Commission.

The Danish government’s plan targets domestic flights, encouraging airlines operating within the country to switch from conventional jet fuel to SAF. The scheme will remain in effect until the end of 2027 and aims to ensure that at least one domestic air route operates with 40% SAF—just below the current 50% technical limit and well above the 2% minimum required under the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation regulation.

To support this transition, airlines will receive direct monthly grants to cover the extra costs of SAF compared to regular fuel. These grants will also help offset any associated infrastructure expenses at airports. The aid will be awarded through a competitive bidding process to guarantee cost-effectiveness. The scheme is expected to support a minimum of 20 commercial one-way flights each week using SAF on one or more domestic routes.

The program includes safeguards to avoid overcompensation. It ensures that supported SAF does not benefit from other forms of government or EU subsidies, including those under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the ReFuelEU framework. SAF that has already received funding from Denmark, other EU countries, or third countries will not be eligible for support under this scheme.

The European Commission evaluated the Danish scheme under Article 107(3)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU), which permits state aid that supports economic development, and the 2022 Climate, Environmental Protection and Energy Aid Guidelines (CEEAG).

The Commission concluded that the plan is both necessary and appropriate for helping Denmark and the EU meet their environmental goals. It determined that the public support gives airlines a real incentive to switch to SAF—something they would not likely do on their own at this scale. The Commission also noted that the scheme is designed to minimize market distortion, as the aid is limited to what’s necessary and awarded through a competitive process. Denmark has committed to ensuring the measure leads to genuine carbon reductions, not merely shifting emissions elsewhere.

Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition said that this Danish scheme paves the way for more sustainable aviation by fostering the use of sustainable aviation fuel beyond current EU mandates.

US refiners criticize Trump biofuels approach

New York, 29 July (Argus) — A US oil refining trade group wrote to top Republican lawmakers to criticize federal biofuel policies that are favorable to farmers and to voice opposition to a bill that would authorize higher-ethanol gasoline blends. ""Recent policy decisions will negatively impact consumers, our members, and the President's energy dominance agenda,"" the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM) wrote in a 25 July letter to House speaker Mike Johnson and Senate majority leader John Thune, which was obtained by Argus . AFPM has long criticized biofuel policies it says hike energy costs and threaten domestic refining capacity. But the group was previously noncommittal on legislation that would allow the year-round sale of 15pc ethanol gasoline (E15), which nearly passed Congress late last year. The bill — previously seen as a narrow compromise with oil interests since it also offers some small refiners targeted relief from biofuel blend mandates — is a top priority for ethanol advocates this year and could now require further changes to assuage the oil industry. The outreach suggests that Republicans' efforts to boost fossil fuel companies after an unfavorable regulatory environment during former-president Joe Biden's tenure are not entirely succeeding. And the letter is notable too given some other oil companies' recent support for stronger biofuel incentives. The American Petroleum Institute joined a lobbying push this year for a steep increase in biomass-based diesel quotas and has supported the E15 bill. AFPM focuses much of the letter on the Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires oil refiners and importers to annually blend certain amounts of biofuels or buy credits from those that do. The Trump administration recently proposed requiring record-high biofuel blending the next two years and halving credits for fuels made abroad or from foreign feedstocks. The US plans to finalize those new biofuel quotas before November. The changes could mean not just pricier credits for oil refiners with limited biorefining capacity but also thinner margins for companies that saw renewable diesel as their way to escape the program's mounting compliance costs. The fuel lacks the blend limits of ethanol and biodiesel and can be made through a similar hydrotreating process as crude refining, but renewable diesel producers say domestic feedstock options are limited. US refiners used South American tallow and Asian used cooking oil to make more renewable diesel than ever before last year, frustrating farm groups that see foreign supplies as curbing demand for domestic crop-based fuels and feedstocks. The letter also faults the Environmental Protection Agency for its delays resolving a long backlog of small refiners' requests for program exemptions and signaling it could require larger companies to compensate for any future waivers by blending more biofuels themselves. AFPM did not confirm the letter, although the group told Argus it has ""deep concerns with federal biofuel policy and the latest [Renewable Fuel Standard] proposal, especially"" and that it is sharing these concerns with the administration and Congress. The letter points to other policies too, including ""eleventh-hour"" emergency waivers allowing E15 year-round in 2025. Some refiners had already spent millions of dollars preparing for a now-delayed shift to a lower-volatility summertime gasoline blend in the midcontinent, which would have allowed E15 blending in that region. AFPM is also frustrated with recent legislative changes to a biofuel tax credit — upping subsidies for corn ethanol in future years while cutting off eligibility for renewable diesel made from many foreign inputs — and with tariffs on renewable feedstock imports. Valero and Phillips 66 — which both told analysts last week that they would throttle biofuel output because of poor margins — are members of AFPM alongside other major renewable diesel producers like Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, and HF Sinclair.

US-EU deal sets impossible energy sales goal

Washington, 28 July (Argus) — A deal the EU negotiated with President Donald Trump's administration in a bid to avoid a major trade war committed the European bloc to purchasing $250bn/yr in US energy commodities in the next three years — a target that outstrips current US production and export capacity. Comments from European officials indicate that the commitment is likely to focus on LNG, in the broader context of efforts by the EU to phase out the remaining imports of Russian pipeline natural gas and crude. EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic on Monday called the $250bn/yr target ""achievable"", and the White House said the deal will ""strengthen the US energy dominance, reduce European reliance on adversarial sources, and narrow our trade deficit with the EU"". US exports of crude, refined products, LNG and natural gas liquids (NGLs) to the 27 members of the EU amounted to $74.3bn in 2024, based on US Department of Commerce data. The new deal would require the EU to quadruple the value of those exports — and increase the volume of exports by an even higher amount, since oil prices are lower this year than in 2024. The US exported 1.54mn b/d of crude and 655,000 b/d of refined products to EU members last year — at a total customs value of $58bn. At current WTI prices, US crude exports to the EU would hypothetically need to increase to over 10mn b/d to achieve the US-EU deal's target — about 75pc of current total US output and significantly higher than the total US exports last year. US LNG exports to the EU amounted to 1.7 Tcf of gas equivalent last year — about 22pc of total US LNG exports, US Energy Information Administration data show. The average LNG export price for EU destinations was $6.59/mmBtu last year, and the value of US LNG exports to EU members was $12.2bn. The total value of US LNG exports was $28bn last year. The energy component of the US-EU trade deal is outwardly similar to the so-called ""Phase 1"" deal Trump's first administration signed with China in January 2020 — and is likely to encounter the same issues with enforcement as political commitments clash with market realities. The US-China 2020 deal required Beijing to step up purchases of energy commodities by $18.5bn in 2020 and another $33.9bn in 2021. Hitting the target when the agreement was concluded in January 2020 would have required buyers in China to import an extra 1.2mn b/d at then WTI export prices. Just months later, the Covid-19 pandemic upended global oil markets and resulted in significantly lower oil prices — so achieving the export target would have required an even higher volume of US exports. China, in the end, never reached the Phase 1 deal energy purchase target. US-China trade relations continued to worsen even in the interlude between Trump's two presidencies. Unlike the EU, China has responded with strong countermeasures against tariffs Trump imposed earlier this year. Washington and Beijing are negotiating terms of new trade arrangements against a deadline of 10 August for the snapback of even higher tariffs.

Spain's Moeve sees wider refining margins in 2H

Madrid, 28 July (Argus) — Spanish integrated Moeve expects wider refining margins in the second half of 2025 to support group earnings, after weakness in April-June contributed to a fall in company profit. Moeve's refining margin fell to $5.80/bl in April-June from 7.60/bl a year earlier, it said today. There was regional weakness earlier in the quarter and the firm's entire 464,000 b/d refining system had to shut and restart after a blackout on 28 April. But margins have been above $10/bl throughout July and will continue to be supported by ""stronger product cracks, higher yields and the adaptability of our refining business,"" Moeve's chief financial officer Carmen de Pablo said today. De Pablo sees the visibility of the refining business improving in July-December in terms of marine and aviation fuels, as the timeline becomes clearer for transposition of the EU's renewables directive RED III in Spain. The directive is unlikely to be fully brought into Spanish law before the end of 2025. The outlook for sales of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is positive for the second half of the year, de Pablo said, because airlines have been purchasing and ordering more than the 2pc regulatory minimum blend mandated by RED III in 2025 ahead of directive's transposition. The blackout, combined with scheduled maintenance at the 220,000 b/d Huelva refinery in April and May, drove refinery output 14pc lower on the year to 4.6mn t in the second quarter. Capacity utilisation was 82pc, compared with 94pc in April-June 2024. Moeve's Energy business, which includes its core refining and marketing segments, reported a 31pc drop on the year in adjusted replacement-cost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) to €277mn ($325mn). Initial estimates for losses resulting from the power cut for Moeve's refineries alone are ""well above €50mn, which we will claim"" said de Pablo. She did not quantify the blackout-related losses at Moeve's aromatics-focused chemicals division, but noted the firm is over the ""worst of the chemicals environment"". Adjusted Ebitda at the business fell by 24pc on the year to €58mn, and sales were down by 12pc at 547,000t. Upstream Ebitda fell by 24pc on the year to €63mn. Moeve's crude production fell by 13pc on the year to 30,000 b/d, reflecting the divestment of 60pc of its upstream portfolio over the past few years. Moeve plans no further disposals this year, de Pablo said, having sold its 25pc stake in exploration block 53 offshore Suriname to TotalEnergies in June. Moeve's adjusted Ebitda fell by 31pc on the year €356mn in the second quarter, and its adjusted profit increased by 8pc to €186mn on unspecified lower depreciation and amortisation charges. Profit including the inventory effect and other unspecified one-time items fell by 49pc to €89mn. Moeve is fully owned by Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth investor Mubadala and US private equity firm Carlyle. Its unlisted status allows it to provide only limited financial information in its earnings results. Group net debt was steady on the year at €2.5bn as of the end of June. Capital expenditure (capex) fell to €502mn from €673mn, and Moeve expects this to be lower still in the second half resulting in capex of ""less than €1.0bn"" for the full year, de Pablo said.

More than a decade after the first SAF-powered test flight, this cleaner alternative is becoming more available in big countries, and wider availability also leads to better affordability.

Avfuel is committed to bringing more and more SAF to the business aviation sector. SAF customers range from major OEMs and airports to corporate flight departments. Avfuel is working with multiple SAF production partners (Neste, Valero, TotalEnergies, and Gevo) and is also actively supporting innovative production technologies (such as power-to-liquid and woody biomass SAF).

Eight of 57 Avfuel fueling locations are SAF strategic supply points across the US. Denver, Colorado, is the latest to join the club, alongside California, Florida, Texas, and New Jersey. This new supply hub in Denver will be the first of its kind in the entire region, which can contribute significantly to making SAF more readily available to operators in the central United States.

The clean fuel that will be available at the Denver location is SAF produced by Diamond Green Diesel, a joint venture between an affiliate of Valero (which is a subsidiary of Valero Energy Corporation) and an affiliate of Darling Ingredients. This is a HEFA-type of SAF, meaning it's made using lipids (fats) such as used cooking oil. This type of SAF claims to reduce GHG emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

However, because SAF can only be used in a blend with conventional fuel, in accordance with the current legislation, this level is much lower in actual operations. More specifically, a blend of 30% SAF and 70% jet fuel can lower GHG emissions by approximately 24%.

This might seem like a small percentage for a clean fuel, but the industry agrees that it's the best alternative available right now, taking into account factors like costs and availability. Even if the percentage is moderate, SAF's greenhouse gas footprint is small enough to be worth it overall.

Avfuel joined forces with Valero to set up this new supply point in Denver, and this kind of agreement between suppliers and producers is essential for advancing the commercial use of SAF. On the other hand, major airlines such as United, Qantas, and Air New Zealand are also investing in green jet fuel and gradually increasing the use of SAF for regular operations.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/new-saf-supply-point-in-denver-is-the-first-of-its-kind-in-the-region-255115_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 04:56:28.855795

Solar Jet Fuel Used for the First Time in Civil Aviation

A reputable European airline and a clean tech startup are the players behind a pioneering move related to green aviation: SOLAR FUEL WAS USED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN CIVIL AVIATION, and it was successful. In terms of numbers, it is only a small step, but the implications are tremendous, paving the way for a cost-efficient, sustainable alternative to conventional jet fuel.

SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) is a term that is currently widely used when talking about zero-emission aviation, but solar fuel isn’t a well-known alternative to conventional fuel. Solar jet is a type of synthetic crude oil produced using solar energy. Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel[i] as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

SYNHELION has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That’s because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion[ii] delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at

using proprietary thermal energy storage system. [CLICK on image to see fascinating video on the process.]

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn’t something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn’t about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that THIS ALTERNATIVE FUEL CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY USED TO POWER AIRPLANES via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there’s still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.

[i] A solar fuel is a synthetic fuel produced using solar energy, through photochemical (i.e. photon activation of certain chemical reactions), photobiological (i.e., artificial photosynthesis), electrochemical (i.e. using solar electricity to drive an endogenic reaction such as hydroelectrolysis),[1][2][3][4] or thermochemical methods (i.e., through the use of solar heat supplied by concentrated solar thermal energy to drive a chemical reaction).[5][6] Sunlight is the primary energy source, with its radiant energy being transduced to chemical energy stored in bonds, typically by reducing protons to hydrogen, or carbon dioxide to organic compounds.

A solar fuel can be produced and stored for later use, when sunlight is not available, making it an alternative to fossil fuels and batteries. Examples of such fuels are hydrogen, ammonia, and hydrazine. Diverse photocatalysts are being developed to carry these reactions in a sustainable, environmentally friendly way.

[ii]Solar energy is converted into high-temperature process heat beyond 1’200°C. At DAWN, this solar heat is generated either by renewable solar power from a PV field through an electric heater, or by heliostats that direct the solar radiation onto a solar receiver.Part of the generated solar heat is fed into the thermochemical reactor that produces syngas, a mixture of H2 and CO. The syngas is then processed into fuels, such as jet fuel, gasoline, or diesel, using standard gas-to-liquid technology. The other part of the heat is saved in the thermal energy storage to enable continuous 24/7 operation.

[iii] nucleus of a helium atom, a doubly positively charged cation. The term helion is a portmanteau of helium and ion, and in practice refers specifically to the nucleus of the helium-3 isotope, consisting of two protons and one neutron.

[iv] ✈️ The FAA’s approval process for Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is rigorous and rooted in international standards to ensure safety, compatibility, and environmental integrity.

Certification Standards

SAF must meet ASTM International specifications, primarily:

ASTM D7566: Covers synthesized hydrocarbons for aviation turbine fuel. SAF must be blended with conventional jet fuel and meet ASTM D1655 standards after blending.

ASTM D1655: Standard for conventional Jet A/Jet A-1 fuels. Once SAF is blended and meets this spec, it’s considered fully certified for use.

Approved SAF Pathways

There are currently 11 ASTM-approved production pathways, including:

HEFA-SPK (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids)

FT-SPK (Fischer-Tropsch Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene)

ATJ-SPK (Alcohol-to-Jet)

CHJ (Catalytic Hydrothermolysis Jet) Each pathway has specific feedstock requirements, conversion processes, and blend limits—typically up to 50% with conventional jet fuel.

FAA’s Role

The FAA supports SAF development through testing, evaluation, and streamlining approvals.

It collaborates with ASTM, OEMs, and research institutions like ASCENT to validate SAF performance and safety.

FAA also contributes to international efforts via ICAO’s CORSIA program, ensuring lifecycle emissions reductions are credible and standardized. Incentives & Legislation

SAF producers may qualify for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, with up to $1.75/gallon based on lifecycle GHG reductions.

The FAA administers FAST grants to support SAF infrastructure and blending at airports.

For more information about H2G and GEIH, please visit: https://h2g.green.","As H2G innovates in novel hydrogen production technologies, the biochar byproducts of its process will be refined and commercialised under the agreement.

SINGAPORE, July 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ — H2G Green Limited (SGX:5AI) (“H2G” or the “Company“, together with its subsidiaries, collectively the “Group“), a leader in sustainable energy solutions, and its subsidiary Green Energy Investment Holding Private Limited (“GEIH“) today announced a licence agreement with Singapore’s Agency for Science, Technology and Research (“A*STAR“).

GEIH is an innovator in sustainable hydrogen with proprietary technologies that repurposes and transforms waste biomass into green hydrogen, as well as biochar and other high-value, sustainable materials. GEIH will commercialise a proprietary treatment process by A*STAR Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (A*STAR IMRE) to purify biochar, a by-product, into high-value hard carbon material for market use. Hard carbon materials are primarily used as anodes for batteries such as sodium-ion and lithium-ion batteries, due to their unique properties. They are also found in applications for water and air purifications as well as conductive additive in paints and coatings.

Following execution of the licence agreement, GEIH and A*STAR will begin the next phase of scaling up to accelerate the commercialisation pathway of the biochar purification process, focusing on producing hard carbon as anodes for use in sodium-ion batteries.

Mr. Sydney Kwan, CEO of GEIH, remarked: “We are deeply grateful to A*STAR for their ongoing collaboration and support. Our joint efforts are transforming the nation into a hub for sustainable technologies and green energy.”

An earlier exploratory phase found that the hard carbon GEIH produces tends to be superior to existing commercial materials due to a high graphite content, which makes the material favourable for anodes in sodium-ion batteries. These have possible applications for grid-scale energy storage, electric vehicles, and consumer electronics. The abundance of sodium makes sodium-ion batteries a more sustainable alternative to lithium-ion batteries.

GEIH’s technologies make it especially suited to this endeavour. The Company’s proprietary high-temperature thermochemical process turns any type of biomass without silica into hydrogen, biochar, bio-oil (for sustainable aviation fuel), and wood vinegar. The entire process incorporates circularity of materials as a guiding principle, and production of biochar results from incorporating carbon sequestration. The output materials power sectors as diverse as data centres, wafer fabrication, construction, agriculture, food manufacturing, laundry services, and central kitchens.

Mr. Pek Hak Bin, CEO of H2G, added: “Hydrogen is the energy of the future and a core part of Singapore’s low-carbon energy strategy. H2G is expanding possibilities for Singapore and beyond by pioneering a novel hydrogen production process that is cost-effective, less carbon intensive than electrolysis, and repurposes waste into sustainable materials. These power sustainable industries, as our hard carbon anode materials for sodium-ion batteries will empower a broader range of industries to reduce their environmental impact. In this way, H2G creates win-win-win sustainability solutions to multiple problems across industries.”

Some 63% of UK adults polled said ensuring planes take off and land on time should be a priority for the sector.

That is compared with 56% who said the same for cutting emissions.

The figure for reducing emissions is up from 53% in 2024, but down from 70% in 2020.

Air traffic control (ATC) provider Nats commissioned the research.

The Government has a target for the UK aviation industry to reach net zero for carbon emissions by 2050.

There are concerns that green policies – such as using more sustainable aviation fuel – could lead to higher air fares.

Nats said it has worked closely with aviation partners over the past 12 months to enhance punctuality and resilience.

This includes using tools such as intelligent approach, which optimises the distances between arriving aircraft.

Nats said it was responsible for 1.2% of total delays to flights en route to Europe in June, despite handling nearly a quarter of air traffic.

Thousands of UK airline passengers have suffered delays because of industrial action by French ATC staff in recent months.

The survey indicated that 52% of UK adults had flown internationally in the previous 12 months, while 32% flew domestically.

Some 26% of respondents expected to fly more in the following year.

The poll also suggested there is growing acceptance of aviation innovation such as drones, flying taxis and AI-enabled services.

For example, 68% of respondents supported using AI to screen bags while 50% were in favour of it managing flight routing.

Simon Warr, Nats’ communications director, said: “The 2025 Aviation Index highlights the public’s clear priorities: reliable service, greater environmental performance, and smart use of innovation.

“As the aviation industry continues to modernise, aligning with these expectations will be key to maintaining public trust and delivering the benefits aviation brings to society.”

Hughes Energy plans to develop a $12 million demonstration facility in Innisfail to convert municipal solid waste into homogeneous fiber which can be used for cardboard manufacturing, biofuels, green hydrogen, and sustainable aviation fuel.

The provincial government announced last week it was providing $5 million toward the project through Emissions Reduction Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emissions Reduction (TIER) program.

It was one of 18 projects to share in up to a $49 million disbursement through the program.

“Support from the provincial government through Emissions Reduction Alberta is instrumental in launching our organics processing pilot facility in Alberta,” said Dane McSpedon, Hughes Energy Group’s chief executive officer, in the province's funding announcement.

“By converting organic material into clean, high-value cellulosic fiber, we’re helping avoid methane emissions from landfills and creating low-carbon feedstocks that support decarbonization across multiple downstream industries,” he said.

Meanwhile, a project planned for Sundre is also receiving funding through the program.

FutEra Power Corp. plans to construct a $15 million closed loop geothermal pilot project. It will receive $5 million through the TIER program.

The TIER fund uses industry dollars to help Alberta facilities invest in innovative emissions-reduction technology to stay globally competitive, create jobs and save money, according to the government.

The 18 projects will reduce about 3.4 million tonnes of emissions by 2030, the government says, and will create close to 1,600 jobs and inject $233 million into Alberta’s economy.

While Emissions Reduction Alberta did not release info on FutEra Power Corp. plans for Sundre, it did give some details of Hughes Energy's proposal for Innisfail.

This project, according to Emissions Reduction Alberta, aims to demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of the Hughes System as a step towards commercial-scale operations.

""The modular design of the pilot facility will enable optimization of system performance, validation of feedstock and product quality, and the establishment of long-term partnerships with municipalities and off-takers. At full-scale commercial operation, the facility is projected to process up to 170,000 tonnes of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) annually, diverting this amount from landfills and reducing approximately 300,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions per year,"" it says.

The project is expected to create three to five full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs and 25-35 indirect jobs during the pilot phase, with 50 FTEs and 250-300 indirect jobs anticipated at the commercial scale.

""Economically, the initiative will attract investment, establish a new value chain for MSW, and enhance cost competitiveness in waste management and renewable energy sectors. By reducing landfill waste and producing renewable products, this project aligns with Alberta’s circular economy goals and contributes to substantial GHG emissions reductions,"" notes Emissions Reduction Alberta on its project list.",https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/mountainviewtoday/images/mvt-emissions-reduction-alberta-projects.jpeg;w=1200;h=800;mode=crop,N,,2025-07-30 00:56:43.672455

In its submission to the Federal Government’s Economic Reform Roundtable, GrainCorp argued that the agriculture sector has consistently lifted productivity over decades through innovation, resilience and scale.
“Agriculture has quietly been one of Australia’s most reliable productivity engines,” said GrainCorp Managing Director and CEO Robert Spurway.
Spurway said smarter investment in freight and digital infrastructure will cut emissions and improve export flow.
“Our supply chain moves more than 60 million tonnes of grain annually, yet it’s being constrained by outdated infrastructure and fragmented planning.","Australia’s trucking industry could gain a major productivity boost if GrainCorp’s call for freight and fuel reform is adopted, with proposals targeting outdated infrastructure, fragmented planning and the untapped potential of renewable diesel.

In its submission to the Federal Government’s Economic Reform Roundtable, GrainCorp argued that the agriculture sector has consistently lifted productivity over decades through innovation, resilience and scale. It stands ready to lead the nation’s economic transformation.

“Agriculture has quietly been one of Australia’s most reliable productivity engines,” said GrainCorp Managing Director and CEO Robert Spurway.

“In the grains industry, growers have embraced innovation and continuously adapt to volatility in weather, markets and politics – all while driving more value from every hectare, every tonne, every season.

“Our message to the Government is to let agriculture be an example for other sectors, and to build on that success.”

GrainCorp highlighted the opportunity to establish a sovereign renewable fuels industry that leverages Australia’s agricultural strengths. In partnership with Ampol and IFM Investors, GrainCorp is exploring the production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel using local feedstocks such as canola, tallow and used cooking oil.

Spurway said with the right policy settings, such as targeted production incentives and a robust certification framework, this industry could contribute up to $36 billion in market value by 2050 and abate 230 million tonnes of CO₂-e emissions.

“Australia exports billions in feedstocks each year, but we’re missing the opportunity to value-add through local refining and production,” he said.

“A renewable fuels sector doesn’t just support our net zero ambitions, it’s a nation-building investment in energy security, regional jobs and industrial capability.”

The second reform priority outlined in the submission is the urgent need to modernise Australia’s regional freight infrastructure.

Inefficiencies in freight and logistics infrastructure, particularly underinvestment in rural roads, short rail sidings and port congestion, result in significant avoidable costs for growers and exporters each year.

Spurway said smarter investment in freight and digital infrastructure will cut emissions and improve export flow.

“Our supply chain moves more than 60 million tonnes of grain annually, yet it’s being constrained by outdated infrastructure and fragmented planning.

“Improving first- and last-mile freight and unlocking modal shift from road to rail isn’t just an agricultural issue, it’s an economic one.”

GrainCorp’s third area of focus is on regulatory streamlining, pointing to inconsistent and outdated compliance requirements across jurisdictions.

The submission calls for a nationally harmonised freight access scheme for harvest, standardised rail and road protocols, and a single-window digital approvals platform to consolidate infrastructure and environmental applications.

“We’re not asking for weaker regulation, we’re asking for smarter, faster, more consistent regulation,” said Spurway.

“If we want to encourage investment and unlock supply chain performance, we need to match the ambition of our industries with equally modern policy settings.”

GrainCorp’s proposals align closely with the Government’s Five-Pillar Productivity Agenda, particularly in supporting the net zero transition, improving regional infrastructure and using data to drive smarter decision-making.

“These are not sectoral wish-lists,” said Spurway.

“They are nation-building ideas with relevance across multiple industries, and with the potential to create long term economic value.”

GrainCorp said in a statement it will continue to work closely with Government, industry groups and supply chain partners to ensure reforms deliver meaningful outcomes across the broader economy.",https://primemovermag.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GrainCorp-Managing-Director-and-CEO-Robert-Spurway.jpg,N,,2025-07-30 00:56:49.137754

This collaboration marks an additional step forward in Luxaviation’s commitment to decarbonizing business aviation, building on the company’s ambitious sustainability roadmap.

The agreement foresees the delivery of up to 10,000 metric tonnes of RFNBO-compliant eSAF annually, beginning in 2029, under a 15-year offtake framework. The fuel, to be produced near Iceland’s Keflavík International Airport using renewable electricity and recycled CO₂, will be certified to meet EU RED II and ReFuelEU criteria and distributed via a book-and-claim system within the European Economic Area.

""The agreement reflects what it takes to make eSAF work: long-term demand, credible certification, and delivery systems that can scale,” said Nanna Baldvinsdóttir, CEO of IdunnH2.

“From a producer’s perspective, this is exactly the kind of agreement we need to move capital into needed eSAF infrastructure.”

The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.

“History often shapes the future,” said Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group.

“Today’s agreement with IdunnH2 not only accelerates our SAF ambitions, it also pays tribute to the longstanding aviation bond between our two countries. Just as Luxembourg once opened its skies to Icelandic innovation, we are now forging the next chapter in that story through climate-conscious aviation.”

The Helguvík eSAF facility, operated by IdunnH2, will leverage Iceland’s 100% renewable energy mix and favorable regulatory environment. Once operational, it is expected to produce up to 65,000 tonnes of eSAF per year, positioning Iceland as a key supplier for Europe’s growing SAF demand. Luxaviation’s role as a launch customer demonstrates the vital role that business aviation and long-tenor SAF agreements can play in unlocking infrastructure investment and accelerating aviation’s transition to net zero.

Kahirós Kahirós is Uruguay's first green hydrogen project to enter construction.","Energy sector decision-makers and stakeholders gathered in Uruguayan capital Montevideo for local renewables chamber Auder's annual conference – Latam Renovables.

Event partner is the Uruguayan branch of the World Energy Council.

BNamericas looks at some of the takeaways from the first day.

Auder president Diego Oroño said a double transition was underway: energy and digital.

The two are closely intertwined, Oroño told the 11th version of the conference.

Citing the opportunities for Uruguay presented by data center investments, Oroño underscored the need to carefully plan, given the potential for competing demand for resources such as water.

""There's no AI without electricity,"" he said, warning of the global risk of AI-related electricity demand playing against emissions-reduction efforts.

Google is building an US$850mn data center in Canelones department dubbed DC-01.

Clean energy matrix

Uruguay obtains over 95% of its electricity from carbon-free sources, but the pace of growth of new clean energy capacity has slowed. Energy must accompany and support economic growth, the event was told.

Renewables expansion will likely be led by solar PV, followed by wind. Multiple projects are in the environmental review phase, many linked to future green hydrogen projects.

State power company UTE has solar PV capacity of around 100MW in development, via 75MW project Melo and a 25MW initiative in San José department.

To bolster the network, a new 500kV transmission corridor is needed, conference attendees heard. About 20% of UTE's budget is earmarked for grid infrastructure, said the company's CEO Andrea Cabrera.

Environment minister Edgardo Ortuño Silva said Uruguay's challenge was carrying out a second energy transition, after building up its clean energy muscles. He cited as work areas electromobility and green hydrogen.

Industry, energy and mining minister Fernanda Cardona also referred to the competitive edge provided by the country's clean energy park.

Uruguay knows where it is heading, Cardona said. The country now needs to take another step, citing decarbonization of industry, and the importance of state policy as an enabler. She referred to the potential of green hydrogen to help achieve this.

The country needs to consider how it can benefit from AI, she said, adding that public-private collaboration and citizen consultation was critical.

An objective is exporting ""value,"" the audience was told. ""This is a government of opportunities,"" Cardona said.

Green hydrogen

In terms of green hydrogen, officials have been in talks with developers in spheres such as planning, local content and financing.

Uruguay has two major green hydrogen projects in the environmental permitting phase: Enertrag's US$1bn Tambor and HIF's US$6bn Paysandú, both targeting derivative e-methanol.

The country has a process underway to create a strategic evaluation system for green hydrogen projects. Uruguay is seen well-positioned to supply the global sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market.

Cecilia San Román, the head of state hydrocarbons firm Ancap, said that to support resilience, diversifying the country's energy matrix was key.

Leveraging Argentine gas, reincorporating biodiesel in the finished diesel mix and producing sustainable fuels are part of the strategy, the event heard.

Oil demand has remained largely flat in Uruguay with growth in renewables and electromobility.

Ancap and UTE have a pilot project underway to produce green hydrogen for fuel-cell powered trucks, with a key objective being knowledge and skills-building.

The hydrocarbons company also wants to gradually convert the La Teja refinery into a biorefinery to produce SAF for export. The project is in the basic engineering phase, San Román said. Biofuel unit Alur would provide feedstock and is looking at the potential of nonfood raw materials. Potential processing capacity is 150,000t/y pre-treated oil. A final investment decision is due next year, with Ancap currently looking for partners.

Ancap is also looking to explore for naturally occurring hydrogen, the conference was told. A bidding round could be held.

Regarding offshore production of green hydrogen, Ancap has been working on a planned auction. This project, however, has dropped down the list of priorities, San Román said.

Green hydrogen project update

Tambor

Tambor is planned for three sites, for production, logistics and carbon capture, Enertrag planner Griselda Castagnino told the event.

Wind (194MW) and solar (188MW) parks are planned, along with a grid connection and a reservoir for storage of surface water. Proposed electrolyzer capacity is 140MW, to produce 84,000t/y e-methanol for export. Tambor is in the environmental evaluation phase.

Use of underground water is not planned but could be required for backup.

Ancap

Ancap energy transition manager Santiago Ferro said for ""quite some time"" various energy sources, clean and polluting, will have to co-exist.

The transition is turning out to be more difficult and costly than originally thought, he said, adding that clean sources have expanded the generation park, not substituted other technologies.

Offshore green hydrogen production could be underway by 2040, Ferro said, adding that Uruguay needed to start seeking interested parties. Ancap requires the nod from the government to advance with an auction process.

Planned for San José department, Ancap and UTE's US$8-10mn hydrogen fuel cell project is in the prefeasibility phase. The objective is to supply 2-3 Ancap trucks. Proposed electrolysis capacity is 1MW. A final investment decision is due around the turn of the year.

Eventual offshore production of hydrocarbons could generate revenue to help accelerate development of sustainable fuel initiatives, Ferro said. Oil and gas exploration projects have been filed for environmental review.

Paysandú

The first of four planned modules has capacity to produce 150,000t/y e-fuels. HIF is negotiating with UTE for power supply for the first phase.

A 1.1GW wind park is planned, called Elena. A 921MW solar PV park, Lucía, is also planned along with 160km of transmission lines.

HIF Uruguay head of communities and environment Pablo Montes said a revised layout reduces the production plant's physical footprint.

Carbon dioxide, e-methanol and the e-fuels would be transported by pipeline. The rail network would also be used for transport of the finished product for export.

The project is in the environmental evaluation phase and the next stage involves construction, Montes said, adding that an environmental decision was expected around the middle of 2026.

Kahirós

Kahirós is Uruguay's first green hydrogen project to enter construction.

With Grupo Santander as investor, the Kahirós hydrogen fuel cell project is being built in Río Negro department as a pilot initiative. Kahirós is being developed by three companies: Korean industrial giant Hyundai, transport company Fraylog and generation park construction firm Ventus.

Industry sources reported on July 27 that SK Energy dispatched approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery in early June.
This delivery represents the company’s first HVO export in 2025 and its second overall.
Furthermore, SK Energy has committed to supplying over 20,000 tons of SAF to Cathay Pacific Airways in Hong Kong by 2027, showcasing its commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources.
Through these ongoing efforts, SK Energy is not only expanding its export portfolio but also contributing meaningfully to global decarbonization goals, as highlighted by several media reports.","SK Energy has marked another milestone in the eco-friendly fuel sector by successfully exporting a second shipment of hydrogenated biodiesel (HVO) to Europe, reinforcing its growing presence in the global green energy market. This achievement follows the company’s pioneering move in 2023, when it became the first South Korean firm to export Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Europe, according to several media reports.

Industry sources reported on July 27 that SK Energy dispatched approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery in early June. The shipment is expected to arrive in Europe by mid-August. This delivery represents the company’s first HVO export in 2025 and its second overall. The initial shipment, involving around 5,000 tons, was made in December 2023.

Hydrogenated biodiesel, or HVO, is a renewable alternative to traditional diesel. It is derived by treating plant-based oils, such as used cooking oil, with hydrogen. The result is a fuel compatible with existing diesel engines in vehicles like buses, trucks, and passenger cars, requiring no engine modifications. HVO is recognized for its significant environmental benefits, including the ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to standard diesel.

The European Union’s increasingly stringent environmental policies, especially its Renewable Energy Directive (RED), are key drivers behind the rising demand for HVO. Under this directive, EU member states are obligated to ensure that at least 29% of the energy used in transportation comes from renewable sources by 2030. These regulations are accelerating the shift toward cleaner fuel options across the continent.

Reflecting this growing demand, HVO prices in Europe have recently surged. On June 20, the price of HVO reached $2,216 per ton — a peak not seen in seven months, as per industry data. A representative from the energy sector explained, “The tightening carbon regulations in Europe are elevating the importance of low-carbon fuels like HVO. By 2026, HVO consumption across Europe is expected to reach record levels.”

In alignment with this global trend, SK Energy has made strategic moves to solidify its role in the low-carbon transportation fuel market by focusing on both HVO and SAF. The company began full-scale production of SAF at its Ulsan refinery in early 2024 and successfully completed its first SAF export to Europe earlier this year. Furthermore, SK Energy has committed to supplying over 20,000 tons of SAF to Cathay Pacific Airways in Hong Kong by 2027, showcasing its commitment to supporting the aviation industry’s transition to cleaner energy sources.

ICJ opinion could open door for more climate litigation

London, 28 July (Argus) — A landmark outcome from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 23 July found that countries have an obligation to contribute to cutting emissions, and wealthy, industrialised nations should take the lead on tackling climate change. The court left the door open for further climate litigation, finding that breaching these obligations constitutes a ""wrongful act"" for which ""injured states"" could claim restitution and compensation. The ICJ's advisory opinions are not legally binding but carry significant weight and may contribute to the development of international law, non-profit the Centre for International Environmental Law says. International climate treaties — such as the 2015 Paris Agreement — ""establish stringent obligations upon states to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic GHG [greenhouse gas] emissions"", the ICJ said. Countries ""must fulfil their duty to prevent significant harm to the environment by acting with due diligence"", the ICJ said. It noted the discretion built into UN climate body the UNFCCC for nations to determine the means by which they cut emissions. But it was clear that ""this discretion cannot serve as an excuse for states to refrain from co-operating with the required level of due diligence or to present their effort as an entirely voluntary contribution which cannot be subjected to scrutiny"". The court found that countries party to the Paris Agreement have an obligation to present national climate plans that align with its primary temperature goal of limiting the global rise to 1.5°C from a pre-industrial baseline. The ICJ also focused on the primary cause of GHG emissions — burning fossil fuels. ""Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from GHG emissions — including through fossil fuel production, fossil fuel consumption, the granting of fossil fuel exploration licences or the provision of fossil fuel subsidies — may constitute an internationally wrongful act... attributable to that state"", it found. ""Where several states are responsible for the same internationally wrongful act, the responsibility of each state may be invoked,"" it said. Definitive legal guidance The ICJ's opinion ""will equip judges with definitive guidance that will likely shape climate cases for decades to come"", environmental organisation ClientEarth lawyer Lea Main-Klingst previously told Argus . Existing pathways could allow countries to take legal action against other nations, ""and no changes to international law are needed for it to happen"", CIEL climate and energy programme director Nikki Reisch tells Argus . Individual states could vary in how they interpret the court's findings, but the opinion was comprehensive and punctured arguments often used to push back on more stringent climate action. The ICJ noted that ""it is scientifically possible to determine each state's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions"", and that states could be found responsible if they do not regulate emissions caused by ""private actors"" under their jurisdictions. Climate litigation has risen steadily in recent years and cases including those challenging fossil fuel projects are ""more often reaching the highest courts around the world"", researchers at the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute say. And the damage caused by climate change is growing, increasing the pressure to define legal parameters and responsibilities. The ICJ proceedings hit several milestones. The issue drew the highest level of participation in a proceeding seen by the ICJ or its predecessor. And the court adopted the advisory opinion unanimously — just the fifth time in its 80-year history that this has happened. But it made the point that international law is just one tool in the fight against climate change. The proceedings ""concern an existential problem of planetary proportions"", the ICJ said. ""International law… has an important but ultimately limited role in resolving this problem"".

NZ will miss GHG targets without policy change: report

Sydney, 28 July (Argus) — The New Zealand government needs to act ""urgently"" to meet emissions reductions targets over 2026-35, including amending its emission trading scheme (ETS), the country's Climate Change Commission (CCC) has warned. The centre-right coalition government's plans are ""insufficient"" to meet the 2026-30 and 2031-35 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions goals of 50pc and 51-55pc below 2005 levels respectively, the CCC said on 25 July in its monitoring report for emissions reductions. The country is on track to meet its 2022-25 emissions reduction goal of 39pc from 2020 levels , which the CCC said was primarily due to a change in how emissions are measured. New Zealand needs to adapt the NZ ETS for it to be effective from 2026. The net emissions cap — the targeted level of net emissions the government seeks to achieve from sectors covered by the NZ ETS — is expected to reach zero in the late 2030s, and the scheme is not incentivizing significant gross emissions reductions. These issues need to be addressed before the government releases the third emissions budget in 2029 for the country to meet its 2050 net zero goal. It may also be ""too late"" for planned NZ ETS incentives for carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) because of declining reserves and the uncertain outlook for gas, making investment uneconomic, the CCC said. Other policies need to be introduced to compliment the NZ ETS, the report found, focusing on the agriculture, renewable energy and transport sectors. Emissions from the transport sector could be reduced by incentivising the use of zero emissions heavy vehicles, making low-carbon fuels and sustainable aviation fuels more accessible, and increasing EV batteries, especially for larger vehicles. NZ's jet fuel market is expected to grow , according to the government's draft national fuel security plan. Air New Zealand must use a 10pc blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with traditional jet fuel to meet its GHG reduction target of 20-25pc by 2030 from 2019, it said in May. In 2023, agricultural emissions accounted for 53pc of New Zealand's gross emissions. Further reductions are in part reliant on technologies, such as a methane-reducing capsules, that do not have certain timelines. This could be helped by focusing on high-value, low-emissions land uses. The government plans to implement agricultural emissions planning by 2030. Legislative changes were made last year to keep the agricultural sector out of the NZ ETS . The government announced rules to limit the conversion of farmland to forests late last year but the CCC is uncertain of this policy's impact. ""How this policy will affect afforestation rates and the NZ ETS incentive for gross emissions reductions is uncertain,"" it noted.

US Republicans seek to block Paris climate funds

Washington, 25 July (Argus) — US congressional Republicans are moving to block funding for a number of UN climate change programs tied to the Paris climate agreement. The US House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Wednesday voted 35-27, along party lines, to advance a fiscal year 2026 funding bill for the State Department and other foreign operations. It includes language that would prohibit directing funds to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to implement the Paris climate agreement and to the related green climate, clean technology and loss and damages funds. The bill does not specify any amount of funding that would be affected, but it could be in the billions, based on past US contributions to the UN programs. The committee did not respond to requests for comment. The restrictions would be in line with the President Donald Trump's decision to pull back from global engagement on climate change. Trump, in one of his first actions back in office, ordered the withdrawal of the country from the Paris agreement, and the State Department in February rescinded about $4bn in pledged US funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The vote comes less than four months before the UN Cop 30 climate talk in Brazil, which plans to deliver a ""roadmap"" setting out how global climate finance could be increased to $1.3 trillion/yr. Brazilian officials have acknowledge that Trump's return to office could complicate those efforts. Committee Democrats warned the bill would put US interests at risk and further isolate the nation from the rest of the world. ""Their bill surrenders our efforts to combat the climate crisis — eliminating support for climate adaptability and clean energy, ignoring the nexus between climate, conflict, and migration, and jeopardizing the safety and security of our children and our grandchildren,"" ranking member Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut) said. The GCF finances projects in developing and emerging countries with a focus on mitigation, adaptation and resilience efforts, such as climate-friendly agricultural methods, reforestation or coastal protection. It recently approved more than $1.2bn in funding for 17 projects across 36 countries. The GCF now has a portfolio of 314 projects, which total $18bn in GCF resources and $67bn including co-financing. The appropriations bill still has several more steps to clear before the funding restrictions become law, including a vote by the full House. In addition, the Senate Appropriations Committee still has to take action and has not yet released its own version of the State Department bill. The committee is chaired by US senator Susan Collins (R-Maine), a supporter of US participation in the Paris agreement. The committee did not respond to a request for comment. A group of 41 Democratic senators on Wednesday called on Collins not to allow any appropriations bill to include ""poison pill"" policy riders, or language restricting the ability of federal agencies to carry out certain environmental policies that is often included in such legislation.

The plans are a key part of HAMR Energy’s strategy to capitalize on incoming international regulations allowing methanol as a feedstock for producing SAF.

Using methanol is a major breakthrough for the aviation industry, according to HAMR Energy, unlocking production scale as demand for low-carbon liquid fuel soars.

Methanol can be produced from a wide range of sustainable sources, offering a versatile, scalable drop-in fuel to decarbonize air travel.

This will be essential for the aviation sector to meet emissions-reduction targets and help close the estimated global SAF supply shortfall of 10 million metric tons by 2030.

HAMR Energy’s proposed SAF production facility will convert 300,000 tons of low-carbon methanol made from forestry residues and hydrogen at its Portland Renewable Fuels project into approximately 125 million liters (over 33 million gallons) of SAF—enough to decarbonize around 3.5 million economy-class passenger trips between Sydney and Melbourne each year.

The proposed SAF production facility is expected to attract hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.

HAMR Energy’s feasibility study identified refining technology, which provides a commercial, scalable pathway to produce SAF from methanol.

It went on to assess key project factors, including renewable power costs, market access and construction economics, identifying South Australia and Victoria as ideal locations for the facility.

The company’s vertically integrated model looks after the whole production process from biomass to fuel.

This model, supported by feedstock arrangements for finite renewable biomass, gives the company the lowest cost of production—an attractive proposition for users such as airlines racing to secure low-carbon liquid fuels.

“With the right policy settings, Australia has the opportunity to build a world-class low-carbon liquid fuels industry, creating regional jobs, strengthening fuel security and leveraging abundant renewable energy and biomass resources” said David Stribley, co-founder of HAMR Energy.

“This methanol-to-jet feasibility study demonstrates our ability to delivery competitive, bankable projects to help hard-to-abate industries like aviation decarbonize while attracting significant investment and improving national fuel security,” he added.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/80995f_47953b31c83d4710827d493e5d147b2f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_750,h_500,al_c,q_85/80995f_47953b31c83d4710827d493e5d147b2f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-07-29 17:59:20.556451

Mike Kane MP visits Sheffield

Announced by the Aviation Minister, Mike Kane MP, the University of Sheffield will lead a £1.5 million project to commercialise its new SAF production technology and attract investors to build SAF production plants in order to boost the supply of the cleaner fuel to the aviation industry.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy (US), Green Lizard Technologies (UK), Drax Power (UK), IMI Vivo (Italy), Gardner Consulting (UK), and Leeds Bradford Airport (UK), and received letters of support from Airbus, Boeing, City of Doncaster Council and Qatar Airways.

SAF is typically produced using bio or waste feedstock. However, there are concerns over whether a sufficient level of feedstock is possible to establish and maintain.

The University of Sheffield’s new production pathway eliminates this reliance as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

This pathway could enable cost-competitive SAF production, offering operational flexibility while also decarbonising industrial appliances.

The Sheffield-led project, called NextGen-SAF, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF – a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor.

The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2, and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF.

The plant will demonstrate the operability, reliability and performance of the integrated system so the method can be scaled up.

Professor Koen Lamberts, President and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Sheffield, said: “We are proud to lead this project, made possible by this vital funding, to develop a new and innovative SAF production pathway.

“Sustainable aviation fuel is essential to reducing emissions from the aviation industry and through this project, we are taking a major step toward scaling up SAF production right here in the UK.

“This initiative not only advances the UK’s goals around SAF but also strengthens the nation’s fuel production capabilities and will deliver lasting economic benefits.”

Announcing £63 million of funding for 17 projects to accelerate SAF production, Aviation Minister Mike Kane said: ""This £63 million is liftoff for Britain's green aviation revolution.

“We're not just backing brilliant British innovation, we're creating thousands of high-skilled jobs and positioning the UK at the forefront of the global sustainable aviation market.

""From the labs of Sheffield to the runways of the future – this is how we kickstart economic growth, secure energy independence, and make Britain a clean energy superpower.""

The University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre is home to some of the most advanced clean energy research facilities in Europe.

This offers pilot-scale testing facilities that enable academics and businesses to collaborate to test new clean energy technologies, including sustainable aviation fuel, before scaling up and commercialising.

The University hosts the UK SAF Clearing House – one of only two centres in the world – that supports fuel producers in obtaining the certification needed for use in the aviation industry.

Sheffield was also part of a consortium that delivered the world’s first transatlantic flight powered by sustainable aviation fuel.

Researchers from the University analysed the impact of SAF on the flight’s particulate emissions and contrail formation using the unique SAF research facilities at the Energy Innovation Centre. The results demonstrated up to a 70 percent reduction in emission levels.

Professor Mohamed Pourkashanian, Managing Director of the University of Sheffield’s Energy Innovation Centre, who is leading the project, said: “It is fantastic to see the University of Sheffield playing a leading role in the development of sustainable aviation fuel and supporting the aviation industry in its efforts to reduce its emissions.

Companies can’t afford to risk their credibility and reputation by making a loose promise or claiming an environmental benefit that isn’t verifiable. All participants have a lot at stake.

As momentum builds in the voluntary market through insets like SAFc, let’s set the record straight about decarbonizing with sustainable fuels and insets.

Myth: There isn’t a clear roadmap for addressing Scope 3 emissions.

Reality: Insets have created a plan for companies to follow.

Corporations with ambitious emissions reduction goals have been using insets like SAFc as indirect mitigation tools, even though they haven’t had a universal way for those reductions to be recognized. These first movers have set a clear example of how to use insets as a responsible business strategy. Their commitments have demonstrated demand and helped accelerate supply in the sustainable aviation fuel industry. Now, with certification measures and tracking systems — all of which create trusted conditions for participants to invest in clean fuels— the market has established guidance to help more companies use insets with confidence.

For example, the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials (RSB) and the International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (ISCC) audit and verify that physical products and industrial supply chains meet or exceed environmental standards. In parallel, registries track environmental attributes to create transparency and accurately issue credits to the right customers.

Companies are demanding the highest standards in quality assurance and traceability — and industry leaders are meeting the call with an increasingly clear roadmap. Effective systems and models are operating at full speed to foster trust and confidence in addressing Scope 3 emissions through clean fuels and insets.

Myth: SAFc works by replacing conventional jet fuel with an equal volume of SAF.

Reality: Not all SAF is created equal. What matters is the fuel’s carbon intensity, which is measured by efficiency — not volume.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, which is bought exclusively for propulsion, fuels like SAF have two distinct purposes: propulsion and decarbonization.

Volume or price per gallon doesn’t accurately measure the efficiency of a clean fuel and its potential for decarbonization. If a company’s goal is to reduce emissions, then the best metrics relate to the carbon intensity of the products available — and not all clean fuels are equal in terms of their impact.

Carbon intensity (CI) is a measure of the total GHG emissions associated with producing and using a fuel, expressed as the amount of carbon dioxide (or equivalent emissions of another gas) produced per unit of energy (e.g., grams CO₂e/MJ). At World Energy, we help organizations rethink the efficiency and impact of their investments in biofuels by focusing on the carbon intensity of fuel, rather than on its volume. For example, the SAF we produce today has an emissions reduction level of up to 85 percent, on a full life-cycle basis.

Let’s compare that, volume-to-volume, to a SAF product that might look the same on the surface but that has life-cycle carbon emissions reductions of just 50 percent. An organization would need to purchase 67 percent more of the less efficient fuel to yield the same carbon reduction.

Myth: It’s the end product that matters — not how the fuel is made or delivered.

Reality: Every step counts in biofuels production.

To reduce emissions through sustainable fuels and insets, most customers are paying for — and should be concerned with — decarbonization services that start long before any fuel is produced. To that end, the behind-the-scenes production process absolutely contributes to the integrity of the fuel and its potential for carbon reduction.

For example, commercial producers of biofuels like SAF need to grapple with upstream environmental effects: How does the production process impact farms and food systems? What are the environmental costs of land and water use? Is the displacement of conventional fuels creating unintended environmental challenges?

To stand behind investments in SAF or other clean fuels, it is therefore critical for customers to understand the full social and environmental impacts of fuel alternatives so they can truly evaluate the impact of the insets they’re purchasing. This is where certification bodies such as RSB and ISCC come in, ensuring that clean products meet specific standards and are audited from end to end — with their entire supply chain and production methods accounted for.

Myth: Fuels like SAF are too scarce and costly to decarbonize aviation.

Reality: SAF is projected to account for 65 percent of aviation’s emissions reductions by 2050. 1

It’s true that SAF is more expensive than conventional jet fuel and is not readily available to address all aviation emissions. But the ecosystem is evolving quickly and dramatically through SAF and SAFc, and customers already have mechanisms to manage emissions from business travel and cargo delivery. As more leading companies invest in sustainable fuels through insets, and as advanced technologies continue to emerge, a virtuous cycle of demand is expanding availability for everyone.

One major accelerator of SAF supply and distribution is the current movement toward long-term offtake agreements. This trend of companies structuring multiyear commitments for decarbonation services through SAF and SAFc doesn’t just benefit individual customers. It also helps expand the entire biofuels market by raising confidence with investors who, in turn, provide more capital to build SAF refineries and develop systems to deliver it into the supply chain efficiently. These multiyear agreements are creating demand certainty and playing a crucial role in expanding the US supply of SAF, lowering customer costs, and reducing the environmental impact of aviation.

Insets offer a market mechanism that can displace conventional fuels used in day-to-day business operations — without having to physically exchange molecules for molecules.

Trump Administration Releases Info on Latest Trade Agreements

European Union Deal: Tariff Elimination and Market Growth

The newly announced trade deal with the European Union includes significant provisions aimed at opening European markets to American goods. Most notably, the agreement will eliminate all EU tariffs on U.S. industrial products. While the focus is broad, agriculture plays a key role in the package.

According to the White House, the agreement will allow U.S. producers—including farmers, ranchers, and fishermen—to grow their export footprint and increase competitiveness in the European marketplace. In addition to tariff reductions, the EU has committed to addressing long-standing non-tariff trade barriers that have hampered U.S. agricultural exports. These include improvements to the sanitary certification process for American dairy and pork products—areas that previously faced regulatory bottlenecks.

This enhanced market access is expected to fuel growth across the U.S. economy by enabling small and large businesses alike to reach millions of European consumers. As tariffs fall and regulations align, American-made and American-grown products will now compete more effectively across the Atlantic.

Japan Deal: $8 Billion in U.S. Agricultural Purchases

The trade agreement with Japan, another key U.S. partner, centers on strategic agricultural exports. Japan has committed to purchasing $8 billion worth of American goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel.

This deal not only deepens the U.S.-Japan economic relationship but also supports American farmers and producers facing oversupply or seeking stable overseas markets. The inclusion of sustainable aviation fuel and bioethanol also underscores a mutual commitment to clean energy and renewable agricultural products.

Indonesia Agreement: Tariff Barriers Removed on U.S. Food and Agriculture

Meanwhile, the trade deal with Indonesia includes a dramatic reduction of trade restrictions—eliminating approximately 99% of all tariff barriers on U.S. agricultural and food products. This agreement paves the way for a sharp increase in American exports to Southeast Asia, giving U.S. producers access to one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing consumer markets.

By removing nearly all agricultural tariffs, this agreement levels the playing field for U.S. farmers and creates new commercial opportunities in a region with rising demand for high-quality food imports.

Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails.
Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups on rails in the East.
However, just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades.
Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027.","OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Union Pacific is seeking to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country.

The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific’s rail network in the West with Norfolk’s rails that snake across Eastern states.

The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage that so many businesses rely on.

The railroads said the tie-up would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods across the country by eliminating several days of delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week.

Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic.

But if the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge so they can compete. The continent’s two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved.

Some big shippers like chemical plants may be wary of the merger because of fears about the monopoly power the combined railroad would wield over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may back the deal if it means their packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh in on the deal before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.

Consumers would benefit if the deal does reduce shipping rates and delivery times as the railroads predict.

There’s speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered.

Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal.

Union Pacific’s stock rose slightly to $229.35 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern’s stock dipped more than 2% to $279.95.

Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has been championing a merger, said the deal could make it possible for lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh to all reach their destinations more seamlessly.

“Railroads have been an integral part of building America since the Industrial Revolution, and this transaction is the next step in advancing the industry,” Vena said.

A combined Union Pacific and Norfolk would have an advantage because they won’t have to hand off shipments in the middle of the country anymore, enabling them to make deliveries more quickly and likely at a lower rate.

U.S. railroads have already gone through extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads that handle the majority of shipments nationwide.

Rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and he may be interested in completing one last major deal before he gives up his role as chief exeucutive at the end of the year.

Last week Buffett threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC, but given that he rarely uses investment bankers that doesn’t mean that he and his successor, Greg Abel, aren’t considering their options. After all, Buffett reached the agreement to buy the rest of BNSF for $26.3 billion in a private meeting with the CEO in 2009.

Yet there’s widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial industry.

That’s largely because of the aftermath of an industry consolidation nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. Union Pacific merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups on rails in the East.

However, just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad.

There were some unique factors in that deal that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America.

Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027.

On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That’s up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs.

Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.",https://www.thewellnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Transcontinental_Railroad_Merger_25210415968361-1568x1045.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 12:57:36.895998

Introduction: Why Insetting Matters Now

The global push for climate resilience is redefining corporate responsibility. While carbon offsetting has long been an organizational staple, a more holistic and impactful approach is gaining significant traction for companies aiming to neutralize emissions. The term insetting is making the rounds in executive discussions and rising through the ranks of sustainable business strategies. Offsetting as an approach has become polarizing in markets and among sustainability professionals. Insetting is a more integrated, value-chain-driven approach to achieving real, measurable, and supply-chain-aligned impact.

But what exactly is Carbon Insetting, and how does it differ from offsetting?

ESG News breaks down key descriptions to ramp up your insetting knowledge—what it is, how it works, who’s doing it, and why it’s a critical tool in tackling Scope 3 emissions in alignment with science-based climate goals.

What Is Insetting?

When it comes to decarbonization, insetting refers to the practice of investing in emission reduction or carbon removal projects within a company’s own value chain. Unlike the arguably dated approach of carbon offsetting, which funds external projects (such as forest preservation or renewable energy in unrelated regions), insetting focuses on interventions that directly benefit the company’s supply chain, operations, or upstream/downstream stakeholders.

Insetting projects are typically designed to:

Reduce Scope 3 emissions (the indirect emissions across a company’s value chain)

Build resilience and sustainability into supply chains

Generate shared value for suppliers, farmers, and local communities

Carbon Insetting vs. Carbon Offsetting: What’s the Difference?

Carbon Insetting is increasingly seen as a direct, strategic sustainability investment, while offsetting is often regarded as a short-term mitigation tactic that doesn’t directly address the environmental, social, and financial impact of a company’s operations.

Why Insetting Is Gaining Traction

Carbon Insetting has emerged as a credible solution for addressing Scope 3 emissions, which often account for 70% or more of a company’s total carbon footprint. These emissions are notoriously difficult to measure and manage because they originate from suppliers, distributors, and consumers.

Key drivers of insetting adoption include:

Pressure from investors and regulators for credible emissions reductions

Scope 3 accounting standards set by frameworks like the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi)

Corporate net-zero commitments and ESG disclosures

The desire to achieve co-benefits such as improved soil health, biodiversity, water use, and farmer livelihoods

How Insetting Works: Real-World Examples

General Mills (GIS) – Supports regenerative agriculture in U.S. wheat and dairy supply chains, reducing emissions and improving soil carbon and farmer income.

LVMH (MC.PA) – Its “LIFE 360” program includes insetting efforts across natural material supply chains (leather, cotton, grapes, flowers).

Unilever (UL) – Works with suppliers to adopt renewable energy in manufacturing, cutting Scope 3 emissions.

Mars, Incorporated – Funds climate-smart cocoa and rice farming projects in West Africa and Southeast Asia to help suppliers reduce emissions.

Nutrien (NTR) & Athian – Piloting bovine feed additives to reduce dairy methane emissions, quantified for internal Scope 3 accounting.

Nissan (NSANY) – Partners with steel/aluminum suppliers to reduce emissions through recycled content and low-carbon production.

Nestlé (NSRGY) – Invests in agroforestry and farmer training for coffee and cocoa supply chains to reduce emissions and boost resilience.

What Can Be Counted as an Insetting Project?

To be legitimate, an insetting project should:

Be tied to the company’s core supply chain

Deliver quantifiable GHG reductions or removals

Be additional (i.e., not business-as-usual)

Be verifiable and traceable

Align with broader sustainability goals (e.g., biodiversity, livelihoods)

Examples include:

Regenerative or climate-smart agriculture

Livestock methane reduction (e.g., feed additives)

Reforestation within supply chain zones

Clean energy for suppliers

Water efficiency technologies for manufacturers

Challenges and Evolving Standards

Carbon Insetting is still maturing. Challenges include:

Accounting complexity – Risk of double-counting emissions reductions

Verification standards – Lack of a unified global framework; IPI and GHG Protocol are developing guidance

Costs and scalability – Especially for smallholder farmers

Legal attribution – Companies must prove ownership of Scope 3 reductions as they become financially material

Insetting and the Future of Scope 3 Reporting

Scope 3 emissions—those occurring across a company’s value chain—represent the largest share of corporate emissions and the most difficult to manage. They encompass raw material extraction, transportation, consumer use, and product end-of-life.

Frameworks such as TCFD, ISSB, ESRS, and the U.S. SEC climate rule are increasingly holding companies accountable for these emissions.

Insetting is emerging as a key strategy.

How Insetting Aligns with the Future of Scope 3 Reporting

Strengthening Supplier Relationships and Transparency

Insetting fosters collaboration with upstream suppliers, driving transparency, emissions data collection, and climate resilience.

Improving Operational Efficiency and Risk Resilience

Tactics like soil health improvement or renewable energy use reduce costs, boost efficiency, and improve supply chain resilience to inflation and climate shocks.

Demonstrating Environmental and Social Impact with Credibility

Unlike offsets, insetting provides localized, measurable impact aligned with ESG goals. Projects often yield biodiversity, water stewardship, and social co-benefits.

Meeting Regulatory Requirements and Audit Preparedness

With robust MRV systems, insetting offers auditable, traceable proof of emissions reductions—critical for avoiding greenwashing claims.

Unlocking Capital Through ESG Performance

Insetting helps companies qualify for green finance products, attract ESG-focused investors, and improve credit ratings through credible decarbonization plans.

A Compliance-Aligned Strategy for the Next Decade and Beyond

What was once optional is becoming required. As ESG regulation tightens, insetting is fast becoming a core tool for Scope 3 compliance and long-term value creation.

Bottom line: Insetting bridges the gap between ambition and action—offering measurable, aligned, and credible decarbonization.

Conclusion: A Strategic Shift Toward Integrated Climate Action

Insetting as a tool helps evolve the complex accountability of carbon reduction to become a strategic lever for resilience, value creation, and credible ESG performance. By investing in their own operations, companies can truly future-proof their supply chains, support frontline communities, and meet the mounting demands for transparent, science-aligned climate action.

As sustainability reporting matures, expect to see insetting approaches shift from a niche strategy to a mainstream pillar of corporate decarbonization—and ESG News will be here to report on global progress.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/What-Is-Carbon-Insetting-What-You-Need-to-Know-about-the-Strategy.jpeg,N,,2025-07-29 09:56:11.715968

Farms and food processors are taking advantage of new technologies to systematically repurpose agricultural byproducts and waste, either reintegrating them into field level operations or deriving wider commercial value from them. Major companies and startups are channeling technical innovation into processes that convert crop residues, processing waste and manure into biofertilizers, bioplastics, and bioenergy as part of an emerging sustainable farming ecosystem.

A Breakdown of Food Loss and Waste across the World

How an AgTech - Enabled Circular Economy can Function

The simplest way to create a circular economy built around agri‑waste valorization is to establish an on-farm nutrient recycling framework. Manure and crop residues are processed naturally on site and reintegrated into operations as compost and biofertilizers etc. These basic (and low cost) frameworks can be enhanced by data-driven cover cropping and crop rotation and intercropping strategies, as well as the application of biochar to create a sustainable and low impact circular economy farming operation that substantially reduces dependence on chemical inputs.

Local biorefineries can process agricultural waste to generate clean bioenergy, biochemicals, and biofertilizers. Innovative anaerobic digestion processes, fermentation, controlled composting methods and even insect bioconversion can also convert waste into valuable resources. Byproducts from the refining process such as digestate or nutrient rich ash can be returned to local farms. An emerging trend is the creation of economic incentives and regulatory support for circular‑agriculture models.

One of the more unusual techniques for agri‑waste valorization is the use of insects. Dutch company Protix uses the black soldier fly to transform food waste into high quality nutrients for aquaculture and livestock and pet food, while converting process byproducts into fertilizers. Approximately one third of all food is wasted, mainly at the retail and consumer end of the supply chain. This food requires disposal, often via landfill sites and inevitably creates a carbon footprint, as well as additional impacts. Protix’s goal is to use science-based innovation to create a profitable low-footprint food chain that generates nutritionally dense proteins. There is still a way to go in creating consumer interest in insect-derived foods for humans, but the aquaculture and animal feed market offers strong potential for growth.

Another good example is ICL Group, a leading global specialty minerals company and one of the largest fertilizer manufacturers in the world. The company has a longstanding commitment to sustainability and the creation of circular economies. One area where ICL is consistently innovative is in brine and phosphate recycling, particularly within the context of fertilizer solutions. The raw materials for ICl’s Puraloop® fertilizer are obtained by recycling phosphorus from organic waste streams as a sustainable alternative to utilizing mined phosphorus rock. The key advantages of Puraloop® are its versatility, ease of application on open fields, orchards and plantations, and minimal environmental impacts. Puraloop® is a flagship circular economy solution that turns waste matter into a valuable crop nutritional solution.

Versalis is an Italian company that is investing in the creation of large scale circular economies. Versalis uses groundbreaking technologies to create high quality industrial-grade monomers, polymers, and elastomers from waste materials. They also produce bionaphtha from used vegetable oils - detritus from the very end of the food supply chain. It can be used to produce polymers or sustainable aviation fuel and diesel alternatives. Versalis also offers a broad spectrum herbicide solution called Sunpower that is produced from renewable materials. It is designed for the control of annual and perennial weeds in urban and industrial locations.

BlueFire Renewables (previously BlueFire Ethanol) is a pioneering biofuel company that converts waste material into ethanol. The company utilizes a complex chemical process to break down waste and extract natural sugars. The sugars in turn undergo a yeast fermentation which produces ethanol. Once produced, the ethanol can be used in the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, citric acid and edible xanthan gum for food ingredients. Ethanol is also used as a fuel, and is emerging as a cleaner alternative to petrochemical fuels. BlueFire Renewable’s Concentrated Acid Hydrolysis Technology Process is proving scalable and the company has been awarded funding by the U.S. Department of Energy to construct a new commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production facility.

Conclusion: Anticipating a Transition to Circular Economy

Pioneering companies like ICL Group, Versalis and Protix are demonstrating that the integration of circular economies that repurpose waste and byproducts within, or for, the agricultural sector are commercially viable. The creation of on-farm recycling frameworks is a straightforward venture and the core principles are scalable. Localized biorefineries and large scale commercial enterprises can all contribute to the development of resilient and sustainable agricultural systems. The key message is that repurposing waste is potentially profitable, and also delivers powerful ESG and reputational advantages for businesses.",https://www.finextra.com/finextra-images/member_photos/thumb_161503_jacobo_weizenblut_11.jpg,N,,2025-07-29 10:56:16.957941

It is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] and represents a significant step in aviation decarbonisation.
The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes.
Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure.
The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark.","The European Commission has approved, under EU State aid rules, a €36m (DKK268m) Danish measure aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the domestic aviation sector.

It is the first State aid scheme approved by the Commission that promotes the use of sustainable aviation fuel [SAF] and represents a significant step in aviation decarbonisation.

The scheme is specifically designed to encourage airlines operating in Denmark to use SAF on domestic routes. It will be in place until 31 December 2027.

The goal is to support at least one domestic air route using 40% SAF, which is very close to the current technical limit of 50%. This exceeds the minimum set by the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation, which requires fuel suppliers to achieve a minimum share of 2% during the scheme period.

Under the scheme, the aid will take the form of monthly-paid direct grants that will cover the additional costs linked to using SAF compared to conventional kerosene, including costs related to airport infrastructure. The aid level will be determined through a competitive bidding process, ensuring cost-effectiveness and efficiency.

The measure will support at least 20 commercial sustainable one-way operations weekly, on one or more domestic routes in Denmark.

The scheme includes rules to prevent overcompensation, namely by ensuring that supported SAF is excluded from parallel support measures under the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation and the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) directive, and by prohibiting the use of SAF that has already received subsidies from Denmark, other EU Member States, or third countries.

Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, said “This Danish scheme paves the way for more sustainable aviation by fostering the use of sustainable aviation fuel beyond current EU mandates.”

The UK government recently awarded 17 companies £63m in SAF funding under the Advanced Fuels Fund scheme, swelling overall funding to £198m.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2023/07/shutterstock_2304836079.jpg",N,,2025-07-29 09:56:21.532628

“Emerging markets, including China, have strong momentum in green logistics innovations.","The logistics sector accounts for up to 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Emerging markets can leapfrog directly to state-of-the-art green innovations.

At the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, experts deliberated on how emerging economies can fast-track green logistics development.

Logistics is the backbone of the global economy, but the sector is also a major contributor to climate change, accounting for up to 11% of global greenhouse gas emissions, if warehouses and ports are included alongside freight transportation.

With accelerating digitalization, shifting trade patterns and rising climate urgency, the global logistics sector stands at a critical inflection point. Global freight demand is expected to double between 2019 and 2050. Emerging markets such as China and the Middle East are central to the surge, driven by rapid urbanization, growing trade and infrastructure investment and technological innovation.

China has become the largest e-commerce market globally, generating almost 50% of the world's transactions, with efficient logistics systems underpinning this expansion.

Meanwhile, the Middle East and Africa freight and logistics market is projected at $173.27 billion in 2025, expanding at a 6.36% compound annual growth growth rate (CAGR) through 2030 on the back of major port expansions and cross-border corridors. Saudi Arabia alone plans to elevate the logistics market to a staggering $15.31 billion by 2030, developing 59 logistics zones.

The industry in emerging economies is experiencing unprecedented green transformation, driven by maturity in technologies and increasing climate regulations. For example, battery electric and hydrogen fuel trucks are already surpassing 500km range, and as they mature, the cost ownership will further decrease. China has launched five clusters dedicated to fuel cell vehicle demonstrations, consisting of more than 40 cities; and 36 countries have committed to 100% zero-emission truck sales by 2040.

Emerging markets have a unique opportunity

Emerging markets, in particular, bear a disproportionate burden in the green transition. Their infrastructure often lags behind, and outdated vehicle fleets contribute to higher emissions.

These disparities underscore the urgency of accelerating green logistics to ensure no region is left behind in the global sustainability agenda. Equally importantly, cases have been proven that the transition itself brings the regions robust economic growth and competitive edges.

Moreover, emerging markets can leapfrog directly to state-of-the-art green infrastructure by deploying clean technologies from the outset, instead of much retrofitting of the legacy systems or having high risk locking in carbon-intensive operations for decades.

In the recently wrapped Annual Meeting of the New Champions (AMNC) in Tianjin, China, the Net-zero Opportunities for Value-chain Action (NOVA) initiative convened industry leaders to have deliberated the championing role of the emerging economies in fast-tracking the green logistics development through innovative approaches and modalities.

AMNC participants deliberated through multiple sessions on the championing role of the emerging economies in fast-tracking the green logistics development through innovative approaches and modalities.

“Emerging markets, including China, have strong momentum in green logistics innovations. We are seeing growth in areas such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), green fuel for ships, and heavy truck battery change. International cooperation is key to navigating an effective global transition in the sector,” said Liu Peng, Director-General,Global Sustainable Transport Innovation and Knowledge Center, Ministry of Transport of the People's Republic of China.

In China, battery electric heavy trucks made up 20.9% of new sales in December 2024 – more than double January’s share – signalling rapid fleet electrification. In parallel, investors poured $757 billion into electrified transport worldwide in 2024 – part of a record $2.1 trillion in energy-transition capital – marking a clear market tipping point for green logistics.

Technology and ‘soft’ innovations that power the logistics transition

To unlock green transition and market opportunities, disruptive innovation across the logistics ecosystem is essential. As sustainability imperatives and market dynamics evolve, companies must pursue multidimensional advances in both technology and business models to decarbonize operations, enhance efficiency and unlock new value creation opportunities.

Key innovation areas include:

Fuel switch solutions: Adoption of low- and zero-carbon fuels such as green hydrogen, methanol and biofuels like sustainable aviation fuel.

Vehicles and propulsion technology: Deploying electric/hydrogen trucks, sustainable aviation fuel-ready aircraft, low-emission ships and locomotives.

Green logistic infrastructure: Building green fuelling networks, smart transport hubs and sustainable warehouses.

Digital operation and optimization: Use of artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT) and digital platforms to improve routing, tracking and system efficiency.

Modal shifts: Moving freight to rail, inland waterways and coastal shipping to cut carbon intensity and boost efficiency.

Operating models innovations: Scaling circular logistics, last-mile innovations and workforce upskilling for sustainable performance.

Together, these innovations form the foundation of a greener, more resilient logistics system – one that meets rising demand while enhancing company competitiveness.

“A decarbonized future for the logistics sector will be driven by technology, scale and action. From advancing electric vehicle capabilities to transforming last-mile delivery, we see disruptive innovations becoming the reality across the entire logistics value chain,” said Aditi Rasquinha, Chief Executive Officer, Greater China, DHL Global Forwarding.

Pressing priorities in unleashing the potential of the innovations

However, implementation and scaling of innovative technologies continues to face several significant barriers, such as cost pressures, policy uncertainty and misalignment of resource allocation.

Green fuels, for instance, remain significantly more expensive than conventional alternatives. Sustainable aviation fuel carries roughly a 3.1x price premium over conventional jet fuel, Jet-A, while the total cost of ownership for hydrogen fuel-cell Class 8 trucks is 3-4x that of equivalent diesel rigs, making carriers hesitant to absorb such premiums.

On the policy front, volatility in international regulations poses risks to business stability and supply chain security. Insufficient alignment between upstream supply and downstream demand hampers the scaling of green technologies, underscoring the need for more integrated planning and investment.

“In Guizhou Tyre, we see huge opportunities to work with the value chain partners to jointly decarbonize the sector. But to truly scale these solutions, we need stronger partnerships. De-risking instruments and strong policy signals are still essential to build long-term market confidence,” said Wang Kun, General Manager, Guizhou Tyre.

An ecosystem for sustainable growth

Leading players across both public and private sectors are piloting new collaboration models, scaling blended finance mechanisms and embedding sustainability metrics into decision-making. These frontrunners offer a blueprint for others to follow, demonstrating that when incentives are aligned and ecosystems mobilized, green logistics can move from aspiration to acceleration.

Governments are increasingly adopting integrated policy frameworks that combine regulatory clarity, fiscal incentives and infrastructure planning to drive systemic transformation.

— Nanna Baldvinsdóttir, CEO of IdunnH2

ICELAND, July 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Luxaviation Group, one of the world’s largest private aviation operators, has entered a strategic Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Icelandic e-fuel innovator IdunnH2 for the long-term supply of synthetic Sustainable Aviation Fuel (eSAF). This collaboration marks an additional step forward in Luxaviation’s commitment to decarbonizing business aviation, building on the company’s ambitious sustainability roadmap.

The agreement foresees the delivery of up to 10,000 metric tonnes of RFNBO-compliant eSAF annually, beginning in 2029, under a 15-year offtake framework. The fuel, to be produced near Iceland’s Keflavík International Airport using renewable electricity and recycled CO₂, will be certified to meet EU RED II and ReFuelEU criteria and distributed via a book-and-claim system within the European Economic Area.

“The agreement reflects what it takes to make eSAF work: long-term demand, credible certification, and delivery systems that can scale,” said Nanna Baldvinsdóttir, CEO of IdunnH2. “From a producer’s perspective, this is exactly the kind of agreement we need to move capital into needed eSAF infrastructure.”

The collaboration addresses the urgent need for scalable, high-integrity SAF solutions and supports broader policy goals, including the European Commission’s Sustainable Transport Investment Plan (STIP). The pricing assumptions are within the lower end of current industry benchmarks, and the offtake agreement is expected to reach finalization by September 2026.

“History often shapes the future,” said Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group. “Today’s agreement with IdunnH2 not only accelerates our SAF ambitions, it also pays tribute to the longstanding aviation bond between our two countries. Just as Luxembourg once opened its skies to Icelandic innovation, we are now forging the next chapter in that story through climate-conscious aviation.”

ICAO, which includes a significant number of Asia Pacific states, also has a long-term aspirational goal of achieving net-zero cardon dioxide emissions by 2050.

APSAC’s creation may increase opportunities for financiers to provide sustainability-linked loans and green loans in financing related projects for interested parties. In particular, noting that SAF is a key item for sustainability in the aviation sector, CAAS highlighted in its Sustainable Aviation Air Hub Blueprint that the “[c]apacity [of SAF] will need to increase exponentially to meet the demand in 2050 so that the aviation sector can achieve its net zero goal” and “it is critical that [CAAS] provide fuel producers with a demand signal to give them the confidence to make further investments in SAF production, and accelerate global SAF production”.

SAF producers may consider availing themselves of the various green financing options in the market to finance these investments. Thus, APSAC’s establishment and the involvement of fuel providers therein is an encouraging step towards building industry momentum and brainstorming novel methods to achieve development and sustainability goals for the aviation sector in Asia Pacific.

Ethanol, colorless, volatile alcoholic liquid, is a central figure in the modern world of energy and industries. Primarily used as a fuel additive and biofuel, ethanol finds application in the pharmaceutical, beverage, and cosmetic sectors also. Its environmentally friendly badge of reducing greenhouse gas emission has made ethanol a popular choice to substitute fossil fuels.

Understanding the ethanol supply chain is crucial in a continuously expanding global economy that is focusing on sustainability, energy independence, and circularity. From farm-level production to international trade, the ethanol supply chain is highly interlinked with geopolitics, environmental laws, and innovation and hence it is critical and timely to understand in today's world.

This blog addresses the key drivers of ethanol's global supply chain.

Raw Material Sourcing

Primary Raw Materials:

• Corn: Main feedstock in the U.S.

• Sugarcane: Dominant in Brazil.

• Crops: Wheat, sorghum, barley (used in EU, India, and China).

• Lignocellulosic biomass: Agricultural residues (e.g., corn stover, bagasse) and woody materials for second-generation ethanol.

Top Producing Countries:

• United States (corn ethanol)

• Brazil (sugarcane ethanol)

• India, China, Thailand are growing rapidly due to biofuel mandates.

Sourcing Challenges and Sustainability Trends

Ethanol manufacturing is susceptible to several sourcing issues. Crop yields are susceptible to weather and seasonality, such as droughts and floods. Export restrictions, subsidies, and trade tensions represent geopolitical concerns that can upset supply chains. Deforestation (such as that in Brazil), food vs. fuel competition, and water-intensive crop growing are environmental issues.

To meet these challenges, the industry is moving towards non-food feedstocks and non-sustainable agriculture practices. Certification initiatives such as Bonsucro and RSB are also being utilized to support environmentally and socially responsible sourcing.

Processing and Intermediate Logistics

After raw material collection, ethanol production involves fermentation and distillation. Carbohydrate-rich feedstocks are broken down into sugars, fermented by microorganisms (typically yeast), and distilled to separate ethanol from water. Advanced processes like enzymatic hydrolysis are used for cellulosic ethanol. Post-processing includes dehydration to achieve fuel-grade ethanol (typically 99.5% purity).

Transport methods: Ethanol is transported from production plants to storage or blending facilities via pipelines (in regions with developed infrastructure like the U.S.), rail tankers, trucks, or drums. Due to its hygroscopic nature, ethanol must be transported separately from gasoline until the final blending stage. Key industrial hubs include the U.S. Midwest, Brazil’s southeastern states, and parts of Europe and China with bio-refining clusters.

Key Industrial Zones:

• U.S. Midwest (Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska)

• Brazil’s Southeast (São Paulo, Minas Gerais)

• EU zones: France, Germany

• China: Jilin and Henan provinces

Storage, Handling, and Safety

Ethanol requires storage in tightly closed containers, usually stainless steel or lined carbon steel tanks, so as not to absorb moisture and contamination. It is extremely flammable, necessitating fire-resistant materials and explosion-proof equipment in storage and handling areas. Temperature control is not particularly rigid, but proper ventilation and grounding are essential to prevent vapor buildup and static discharge.

Handling procedures adhere to rigorous safety protocols by international organizations like OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals). SDS is required to be kept, and PPE and proper training are necessitated for all handlers. Emergency response systems consist of spill containment units, fire extinguishing units, and vapor monitoring systems. Adherence to such safety standards allows ethanol to be safely managed from production to final end-use applications.

Global Trade and Distribution

Ethanol is a widely traded commodity, particularly between regions with high production capacity and those with fuel blending mandates but limited domestic output. The United States and Brazil are the top exporters, while countries like Canada, the European Union, Japan, and India are significant importers.

Global trade is shaped by global oil prices, blending mandates, and climate policies, with frameworks like the EU’s RED II and California’s LCFS influencing trade flows. The U.S. exports primarily corn-based ethanol, while Brazil's is sugarcane-based, often preferred for its lower carbon footprint. Freight logistics involve marine tankers, rail shipments, and containerized transport, each requiring specialized equipment and safety measures.

Ethanol trade has become a strategic component of global decarbonization efforts, shaped by both economic and environmental considerations. Tariffs, customs regulations, and sustainability certifications—such as ISCC—add layers of complexity to cross-border transactions. Increasingly, carbon intensity scores and environmental reporting requirements are influencing trade patterns and buyer preferences. However, the sector faces significant barriers, including import duties (e.g., in India), volatile logistics costs driven by fuel prices and geopolitical tensions, and disruptions caused by container shortages.

Global Production Landscape

Ethanol is produced in various regions, each contributing based on their resource availability and industrial infrastructure.

Top 5 Importers and Exporters of Ethanol

Production Process Used

United States: Corn-based ethanol, dry milling, natural gas-powered, mainly Midwest, world’s top producer.

Brazil: Sugarcane ethanol, bagasse energy, São Paulo-centered, efficient and major exporter.

China: Starch ethanol, coal-powered, carbon-intensive, key in northern provinces.

India: Molasses and grains, natural gas energy, expanding fast, blending goal 20% by 2025.

Top Exporting Countries and Their Key Import Partners (2024)

The Evolving Landscape: Ethanol and Supply Chain Transformation

The switch to cleaner fuels is transforming the position of ethanol in the world energy mix at a rapid pace. Ethanol, which has been conventionally employed as a chemical feedstock and biofuel, is increasingly emerging as a cleaner fuel for transportation and industry. With increasing focus on sustainability, improved production technologies, policy backing, and the changing trade routes are restating its supply chain dynamics.

These include the U.S., Brazil, and India, which are not just increasing traditional ethanol production from crops such as corn and sugarcane, but also in second-generation and cellulosic ethanol from farm waste and non-food biomass.

While higher-end ethanol is still pricier, policy support, carbon requirements, and investor support are driving it faster into use—especially in air travel, heavy transport, and blended fuels to decarbonize road transport.

What to Expect Moving Forward

• Shifts in Sourcing and Trade Flow: Regional crop availability and decarbonization policy are driving ethanol trade realignment. As net-zero initiatives move forward, nations might favor domestic production, while exporters might target new markets with supporting mandates.

• Second-Generation Ethanol Projects: Future plants in India, Europe, and North America based on agri-residues and municipal waste mark a departure from biofuels derived from food. They intend to upscale cleaner ethanol with reduced land and water footprints.

• Policy and Regulation: Ethanol's destiny is inextricably linked with government policies—such as the EU's Renewable Energy Directive (RED III), India's 20% blending goal, and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act. Carbon credits, emissions limits, and renewable blending requirements will have a major influence on production economics and trading volumes.

Conclusion

Knowing the ethanol supply chain now is not just knowing the availability of feedstocks or crop production. It is seeing the analysis of logistics, regulatory forces, access to the market, and the increasing move toward cleaner production. While sustainability objectives are tightening around the world, ethanol will make the shift from an add-on fuel to a central actor in clean transportation and energy diversification initiatives.

Phillips 66 on July 25 released second quarter financial results, reporting the company’s Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex in California continues to run at reduced rates due to market conditions. Pre-tax income for the renewables segment was up when compared to the first quarter due to higher realized margins, including inventory impacts as well as increased credits, according to the company.

Phillips 66’s renewable fuels business segment processes renewable feedstocks into renewable fuels at its Rodeo facility in California and the Humber refinery in the U.K. The segment also includes global activities to procure renewable feedstocks, manage certain regulatory credits and market renewable fuels.

Development on the Rodeo Renewable Energy Complex began in mid-2022 and the facility reached full processing rates during the second quarter of 2024.

Sales of renewable fuels averaged 71,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, up from 45,000 barrels per day during the same period of 2024.

The renewable fuels segment reported a $133 million earnings loss for the second quarter, compared to a $185 million loss reported for the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was negative $110 million, compared to negative $163 million.

During an earnings call, Phillips 66 Executive Vice President of Marketing and Commercial Brian Mandell confirmed that renewable margins were slightly weaker during the second quarter than they were during the first three months of the year. “We are running at reduced rates,” he said. “In the second quarter, we ran at reduced rates, and we continue to run at reduced rates.” Operations during the third quarter will depend on various market conditions, he indicated.

Mandell pointed to several regulatory headwinds the Rodeo facility is facing. This includes changes in the 45Z clean fuel production credit that limit credit eligibility to fuels made from feedstocks produced in the U.S., Mexico and Canada, and eliminate the premium value of the credit for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). He also noted that the U.S. EPA’s proposal to reduce renewable identification number (RIN) generation for fuels made from imported feedstocks “will present a challenge.”

“We’re doing a lot of things in self-help, including talking to state and federal regulators to promote profitability for the plant,” Mandell added. “Additionally, we’re working very hard on lowering the cost of operating the plant…and we’re thinking about how to adjust operations to increase SAF production and also to provide additional optionality for feedstocks.”

Mandell also highlighted some market tailwinds, including potentially stronger Low Carbon Fuel Standard and RIN credits as a result of tighter regulations. In addition, he noted European markets are driving greater incentives, with the company exporting to Europe almost every month this year. “There are stronger biofuels programs in Oregon and Washington and stronger Canadian markets as well,” Mandell added.

According to Mandell, the Rodeo complex is one of the world’s largest renewable diesel and SAF facilities. “We can…generate up to 15% of the country’s D4 and D5 RIns,” he said. “So ensuring profitability for the plant will be important for energy supply for affordable energy across the country, given the RIN generation and for energy dominance in the United States.”

Phillips 66 President and CEO Mark Lashier said that the losses for the renewable fuels segment are “unacceptable and unsustainable,” noting that the Rodeo facility is strategic asset not just for Phillips 66, but for the country due to the volume of renewable diesel it produces and the capability to produce SAF. “We are fully engaged at the federal level and fully engaged at the state level in California to make sure all the right choices are made to support this strategic asset,” Lashier added.

Overall, Phillips 66 reported second quarter earnings of $877 million, up from $487 million during the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.5 billion, up from $736 million during the first quarter, and earnings per share was at $2.15, compared to $1.18.

(LTM) has emerged from the turbulence of the pandemic and its 2020 Chapter 11 restructuring to become a beacon of resilience in the Latin American aviation sector. In 2024, the airline reported a record net income of $977 million and transported 82 million passengers, driven by a disciplined cost structure, operational efficiency, and strategic network optimization. As the second quarter of 2025 unfolds, the company continues to outperform expectations, with capacity growth, improved load factors, and a robust balance sheet signaling a sustainable recovery. For investors, the question is no longer whether LATAM can survive, but whether it can capitalize on its momentum to dominate a region poised for long-term air travel growth.

A Strategic Turnaround: From Crisis to Competitiveness

LATAM's resurgence is rooted in a multiyear transformation plan that prioritized liquidity, cost discipline, and customer experience. By 2024, the airline had slashed its net debt ratio to 1.7x, secured $3.53 billion in liquidity, and refinanced nearly all non-fleet debt, reducing interest expenses by over 50%. This financial discipline was complemented by operational rigor: the airline achieved an 85%+ on-time performance rate, streamlined processes via Lean methodologies, and invested in digital tools like touchless check-in and real-time analytics. These measures not only improved efficiency but also reduced unit costs, enabling LATAM to maintain profitability even as fuel prices and labor costs fluctuated.

A critical component of LATAM's strategy has been its focus on premium traffic. By enhancing its first and business class offerings, the airline has captured higher yields without proportionally increasing costs. For example, its upgraded cabins now feature modern interiors, improved catering, and priority services, aligning with global trends toward premiumization in air travel. Analysts project that this focus on premium segments will drive revenue per available seat mile (RASM) growth of 12–15% in 2025, outpacing competitors focused on commoditized domestic routes.

Navigating Regional Demand and Global Shifts

Latin America's aviation market is uniquely positioned to benefit from shifting global demand patterns. While North America and Europe face saturation and regulatory headwinds, Latin America's air travel growth has averaged 6–8% annually over the past five years, fueled by rising middle-class incomes, urbanization, and tourism. LATAM's extensive network—spanning 151 destinations across 27 countries—positions it to capitalize on this growth. For instance, its June 2025 expansion included new routes like Bariloche (Argentina) to Guarulhos (Brazil), catering to leisure travelers and connecting regional hubs.

Moreover, LATAM's cargo operations are gaining traction. In June 2025, the airline increased cargo capacity by 5.2% year-over-year, leveraging its fleet's flexibility to meet surging demand for perishables and e-commerce shipments. This diversification into freight—a sector with higher margins than passenger operations—provides a buffer against cyclical downturns in leisure travel.

Risks and Opportunities in a Competitive Landscape

Despite its strengths, LATAM faces challenges. The proposed merger between Gol and Azul airlines in Brazil could intensify price competition in the region's largest market. Additionally, foreign exchange volatility—particularly the depreciation of the Brazilian real and Colombian peso—poses a risk to USD-denominated revenues. However, LATAM's hedging strategies and cost structure, which are 60% in local currencies, mitigate these risks.

The airline's long-term outlook hinges on its ability to maintain operational flexibility. For example, its 2025 capital expenditures are focused on fleet modernization and airport slot acquisitions, ensuring it can scale capacity in high-growth corridors. Meanwhile, its sustainability initiatives—such as a 97% reduction in single-use plastics and a target of 5% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030—align with global ESG trends and could attract environmentally conscious investors.

Investment Implications: A Buy for the Long Haul

LATAM's financials and strategic positioning make it a compelling investment. With a current market cap of $11.58 billion and a forward P/E ratio of 9.2x, the stock appears undervalued relative to its projected earnings growth of 43% in 2025 (from $3.72 to $5.32 EPS). Analysts have upgraded the stock to “Outperform,” citing its strong cash flow generation, low leverage, and leadership in a high-growth region.

For long-term investors, LATAM offers exposure to Latin America's economic renaissance. While short-term risks like regulatory changes or currency swings exist, the airline's focus on premium traffic, cargo expansion, and operational efficiency creates a durable competitive moat. As global demand shifts toward emerging markets, LATAM's strategic recovery positions it as a leader in a sector that could outperform broader equity indices over the next decade.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-29 02:56:29.923821

Sam Singh, R- East Lansing, and Joe Bellino, R- Monroe, to support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our state.
These measures, otherwise known as House Bills 4424-25 and Senate Bills 235-36, offer a practical, forward-looking approach to strengthening rural Michigan while helping our state lead in clean energy innovation.
The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers.
Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains.","In Michigan, we know how to get things done — especially when we work together. That’s why I’m proud to be part of a bipartisan, bicameral coalition advancing a new path forward for our farmers, economy and environment.

Recently, I introduced legislation with state Sens. Sam Singh, R- East Lansing, and Joe Bellino, R- Monroe, to support the production and use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in our state. These measures, otherwise known as House Bills 4424-25 and Senate Bills 235-36, offer a practical, forward-looking approach to strengthening rural Michigan while helping our state lead in clean energy innovation.

As chair of the House Agriculture Committee, a longtime dairy farmer and lifelong supporter of Michigan’s farm families, I believe this effort represents a smart, balanced approach to the future. We’re not choosing between clean energy and rural prosperity; we’re showing how the two can work together. And, we’re not forcing change from the top down, we’re building it from the ground up, with Michigan-grown solutions.

The SAF proposal could not have come at a better time for Michigan farmers. Shrinking margins, rising costs and uncertainty about the future are taking a huge toll on rural families, and this legislation could offer needed relief for all of Michigan’s farming communities.

The simple truth is that things are changing, whether we like it or not. Clean energy standards are fast approaching. Markets are shifting. And in agriculture, we feel that uncertainty every day. One change in federal policy or a single press conference can send ripple effects through the entire system. Our farmers are watching, waiting and wondering what the future holds. This legislation offers them something solid to stand on, and a new opportunity to grow.

SAF is a low-carbon alternative to traditional jet fuel, capable of reducing emissions by up to 80%. And the best part is, it can be made from crops grown in Michigan. With the right incentives in place, our farmers can be at the center of this emerging industry: supplying corn, soybeans and other feedstocks that help power planes taking off from Michigan’s airports.

But this isn’t only about cleaner fuel, It’s about rural jobs and long-term economic resilience.

SAF production means more opportunities in towns that have seen too many family farms and small businesses disappear. It means consistent demand for what our farmers already produce, new construction jobs to build biorefineries and new careers in bio-manufacturing and logistics. It also offers a way to build that opportunity while also cutting emissions and strengthening the state's energy independence.

This legislation shows what’s possible when we put politics aside. It’s backed by Democrats and Republicans, agriculture leaders and energy advocates, urban interests and rural communities. That kind of cooperation is rare these days, but it’s exactly what Michigan needs more of.

I won’t pretend this is the answer to every challenge we face. But it’s a strong step forward. It sends a message to our farmers that we have their backs; to our communities, that we’re investing in their future; and to the country, that Michigan is ready to lead.

Much like ethanol did in years past, tax incentives for sustainable aviation fuel are a powerful way to drive investment into rural communities — unlocking broad economic gains. This strategy supports President Donald Trump’s vision of strengthening U.S. energy independence and growing American jobs. Moving SAF forward means building long-term prosperity throughout the agricultural supply chain.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2024/09/19/PDTN/75296660007-gunrightsmarch-mich-capitol-14.JPG?crop=2997,1686,x1,y56&width=2997&height=1686&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-07-29 00:02:52.141218

It delivers a powerful signal that the U.S.–Japan alliance is not only a cornerstone of peace in the Indo-Pacific, but also a driver of global growth and innovation.

Japan has agreed to invest $550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries. It is the single largest foreign investment commitment ever secured by any country and will generate hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs, expand domestic manufacturing, and secure American prosperity for generations, the White House affirmed.

At President Trump’s direction, these funds will be targeted toward the revitalization of America’s industrial base including energy infrastructure and production. Investment will also be directed into the semiconductor industry, critical minerals mining, pharmaceutical and medical production, and commercial and defense shipbuilding.

The United States will retain 90 percent of the profits from this investment, ensuring that American workers, taxpayers, and communities reap the overwhelming share of the benefit.

As part of this agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15 percent tariff rate.

In addition to raising billions in revenue, this new tariff framework, combined with expanded U.S. exports and investment-driven production, will help narrow the trade deficit with Japan and restore greater balance to the overall U.S. trade position.

This approach reflects the United States’ broader effort to establish a consistent, transparent, and enforceable trade environment in which American workers and producers are no longer disadvantaged by outdated or one-sided trade rules.

For decades, U.S. companies have faced barriers when seeking access to Japan’s market. This agreement delivers breakthrough openings across key sectors. Japan will immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75 percent, with a major expansion of import quotas; Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. The US will also expand its energy exports to Japan.

Moreover, Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. Japan will also purchase billions of dollars’ worth of U.S. defense equipment, enhancing interoperability and alliance security in the Indo-Pacific.

Longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks will be lifted, granting U.S. automakers access to the Japanese consumer market and U.S. automotive standards will be approved in Japan for the first time ever.

“Trading prices of biomass are influenced by factors beyond our control. But the fact that we maintained our sales volume, and with it our market share, is entirely to our credit. That is an achievement we are proud of. It reflects the strength of our commercial partnerships, and the trust placed in us by our customers,” says Simon Plagborg, and adds:

“We have proven both resilience and foresight by increasing our focus on key markets and segments, investing in new product development, and engaging more closely with our partners and customers.”

Simon Plagborg joined CM Biomass as CEO in January this year, with a clear focus on developing both the commercial side of the business and the production in the USA. Since joining the company, the new CEO has spent time getting to know CM Biomass’ far-reaching organization in depth.

In addition to the change in management, CM Biomass’ majority owner, the family-owned United Shipping and Trading Company (USTC), increased its stake in December 2024 to 89 percent. USTC first acquired 60 percent of CM Biomass in 2021 and raised its ownership to 69 percent in 2023.

A strong business model

In recent years, CM Biomass has strengthened its organization significantly. With extensive in-house production in the U.S., warehouses around the globe, and sales offices on several continents, the company has positioned itself as one of the world’s largest suppliers and producers of biomass for energy production.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/CM_Biomass_July25_a110fe6d4e.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 19:56:43.467561

Learn Today Solar jet fuel → Synthetic aviation fuel made using solar energy, reducing carbon emissions compared to fossil fuels.
Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) → Alternative jet fuels that lower environmental impact, including solar and biofuels.","On July 24, 2025, Swiss International Air Lines (SWISS) became the first airline to use solar jet fuel in regular flights, marking a major step for sustainable aviation. The Solar jet fuel, made by Swiss company Synhelion, was added to SWISS’s flights from Hamburg to Zurich, covering about 7% of the fuel needed for that journey. This move shows that solar jet fuel can work with current airport systems and could help reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint.

The solar jet fuel came from Synhelion’s DAWN plant in Jülich, Germany. This plant, running since late summer 2024, uses solar heat to turn carbon dioxide and water into syngas, which is then made into synthetic crude oil and refined into Jet-A-1 fuel. The first batch delivered to SWISS was 190 liters, a small but important start. According to analysis by VisaVerge.com, this event proves that solar jet fuel can be used in real-world flights and could help the industry move away from fossil fuels.

Jens Fehlinger, CEO of SWISS, said the airline is proud to lead in using new technology for a cleaner future. Philipp Furler, Synhelion’s co-founder, called the milestone a real step toward making solar jet fuel available worldwide. The Lufthansa Group, which owns SWISS, supports these efforts and wants to help scale up sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) use.

Solar jet fuel is certified as Jet-A-1, meaning it meets all safety and quality standards for use in planes. This makes it easy to add to existing airport and refinery systems. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects SAF production, including solar jet fuel, to reach 2.7 billion liters in 2025. However, this is still less than 1% of the world’s jet fuel needs. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has set goals for SAF to help cut aviation’s carbon emissions by 5% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.

The DAWN plant can make several thousand liters of solar fuel each year. Solar energy heats the plant’s reactors to over 1,200°C, driving the chemical reactions needed to create fuel. Solar jet fuel can cut carbon emissions by up to 100% if captured carbon is used, and it also reduces other pollutants like soot and sulfur.

Right now, solar jet fuel costs more than regular jet fuel—about 2 to 10 times as much. Production is still small, so ticket prices may go up until more fuel is made. Still, airlines, airports, and refineries can use solar jet fuel with little change to their systems.

Synhelion plans to build a larger plant in Spain and expand production. Pilatus Aircraft, another partner, wants to use solar jet fuel for its own planes soon. Governments are also pushing for more SAF use, with the United States 🇺🇸 aiming for 3 billion gallons by 2030.

It’s a compelling example of how aviation innovation can extend far beyond air travel and directly serve planet-positive business goals.","Aviation is under pressure to clean up its act, and fast. The industry’s flagship climate tool, the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), is already faltering. A new report has revealed that only one project has issued carbon credits eligible under CORSIA rules. That’s a startling supply crunch for a scheme meant to help airlines hit emissions targets by purchasing offsets, especially as international flights ramp back up post-pandemic. With the voluntary carbon market (VCM) unable to keep pace, airlines could be flying into a serious climate credibility gap.

CORSIA was never meant to be the entire solution. But this shortfall underscores a deeper truth: Aviation can’t offset its way out to sustainability. Airlines and aircraft manufacturers need viable, scalable ways to reduce emissions at the source.

And while policy lags and viable jet fuel alternatives remain limited, the innovation pipeline tells a more hopeful story: A surge of new technologies is reimagining a sustainable future for aviation. Many are still early stage, but they point to a future where the need for offsets shrinks, not grows.

Here are five standout solutions helping aviation cut emissions. Each one tackles the problem from a different angle – and together, they offer a glimpse of what cleaner flight could look like.

Ceramic fuel cells powered by liquid sodium could unlock electric flight

Image credit: Gretchen Ertl

A team at MIT has developed a liquid sodium metal fuel cell designed to overcome one of electric aviation’s biggest hurdles: battery weight.

Instead of using traditional, rechargeable batteries, this system runs on inexpensive liquid sodium and could deliver more than three times the energy density of current lithium-ion tech. The goal? Make electric aircraft feasible for commercial use, without the heavy baggage of today’s battery limitations.

How it works

The system is built around a solid ceramic electrolyte that separates liquid sodium fuel from ambient air. Oxygen from the air reacts with sodium ions that pass through the membrane, producing electricity in the process. Unlike batteries, there’s no need for recharging – just refuel with more sodium. That makes the setup not only lighter and more energy-dense, but also safer, since the two reactive components are separated and one of them (air) is non-combustible. The prototype is currently small, but scalable, and is being further developed by a startup called Propel Aero based at The Engine – MIT’s innovation hub.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation consumed around 99 billion gallons of fossil fuel in 2024 alone and remains one of the hardest sectors to decarbonize. If this technology scales, it could help phase out fossil jet fuel entirely for short- and medium-haul flights. That’s a major opportunity for climate-focused companies – whether it’s greening business travel, decarbonizing supply chains, or investing in breakthrough tech. It’s not just a fuel cell; it’s a potential route to net-zero aviation.

Turning waste polystyrene into a critical SAF ingredient

Image credit: Fred Zwicky

Researchers at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign have developed a method to convert waste polystyrene – the kind found in packaging and containers – into ethylbenzene, a key aromatic hydrocarbon used in aviation fuel.

Aromatics make up 8-25 percent of jet fuel and are essential for ensuring proper combustion and sealing within fuel systems. Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) often lack sufficient aromatics, limiting their use. This breakthrough could help unlock safer, more scalable SAF blends.

How it works

The process relies on thermal pyrolysis, where polystyrene is heated and broken down into a styrene-rich liquid. The team then adds hydrogen to the mix, producing crude ethylbenzene. After distillation, the result is a product that’s 90 percent pure and performs just as well as fossil-derived alternatives when blended with SAF.

Even more impressively, a lifecycle analysis shows a 50-60 percent reduction in emissions compared to petroleum-based ethylbenzene. It’s also cheaper to make.

Yes, it’s still at the lab stage; but the team is aiming to scale to continuous pilot operations and is building partnerships for waste-stream sourcing and sorting to ensure a steady supply of low-cost feedstock.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This innovation checks multiple boxes: waste reduction, emissions savings and better SAF performance. For companies relying on air freight or business travel, it offers a real pathway to lower-carbon aviation. And for brands working toward circularity goals, it’s a powerful reminder that today’s trash could fuel tomorrow’s transport, literally.

Scaling up next-gen SAFs with ‘Aerobrew’

Image credit: Metafuels

Swiss startup Metafuels is pioneering a new process to produce synthetic sustainable aviation fuel (e-SAF) at scale, using a system it calls ‘Aerobrew.’ While SAF has long been recognized as a key to decarbonizing aviation, high costs and low production volumes have held it back. Metafuels’ approach aims to deliver a higher-yield, lower-cost alternative that could replace fossil jet fuel without modifications to existing aircraft.

How it works

The Aerobrew process begins by combining green hydrogen – produced through renewably powered electrolysis – with captured CO₂, sourced from technologies such as direct air capture. These inputs are used to synthesize green methanol, which is then converted into SAF. Unlike other SAF production methods, Aerobrew maximizes conversion efficiency from methanol to jet fuel, which significantly boosts yield and reduces production costs.

The result is a drop-in fuel that works across all aircraft types, with no need for changes to engines or infrastructure. Backed by $22 million in funding, including a recent $5 million grant from the Swiss Government, Metafuels is now moving toward commercial scale. A newly announced facility in Denmark, built in partnership with European Energy, is expected to produce 12,000 litres of e-SAF per day.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

Aviation emissions are rising fast, and SAF remains one of the most promising tools to counter them. But scalability is the sticking point. Metafuels offers a real-world path to volume production of SAF, powered by renewables and carbon capture. For brands with global operations, freight logistics or ambitious climate targets, this innovation could enable cleaner skies without waiting decades for electric or hydrogen planes to arrive.

Using AI flight planning to stop planet-warming contrails

Image credit: chamillewhite

Contrails – those familiar white streaks trailing behind jets – are a surprisingly potent climate threat. They trap heat in the atmosphere and are responsible for up to 60 percent of aviation’s climate impact. Until recently, avoiding them was considered too complex. But UK-based climate tech startup Satavia is proving otherwise. Its DECISIONX platform uses AI to help airlines plan flight paths that avoid contrail formation – cutting emissions without requiring new fuels or hardware.

How it works

Satavia’s system draws on high-resolution weather forecasting, aircraft performance data and atmospheric modeling to predict where and when contrails are likely to form. Built on its 5-DX digital twin of the atmosphere, DECISIONX lets airlines reroute or adjust altitude just slightly – sometimes by as little as a few hundred feet – to avoid the narrow atmospheric bands where contrails form. These minor tweaks can prevent warming.

Importantly, the platform also quantifies the climate impact of these changes – allowing airlines to validate and monetize contrail avoidance by converting it into future carbon-equivalent units, tradable on the VCM. It’s already in use: Etihad Airways has signed a multi-year contract to embed the tech into daily operations.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This is climate mitigation without compromise – no new aircraft, no major costs; just smarter routing. For companies concerned with Scope 3 emissions from business travel or air freight, supporting contrail prevention could offer measurable reductions in climate impact. It also opens the door to carbon credits backed by science, rather than sometimes-questionable offsets.

Solar-powered, autonomous aircraft for continuous, zero-emission monitoring

Image credit: Radical

US startup Radical has developed a high-altitude, autonomous aircraft designed to fly for months at a time without landing – powered by nothing but sunlight. While conventional aviation emits vast amounts of CO₂, this ultra-lightweight aircraft offers an emissions-free alternative with powerful potential across multiple sectors – from climate monitoring to communications.

How it works

The aircraft is powered by solar panels that charge on-board batteries – enabling autonomous, sustained flight at high altitudes. Unlike satellites, these aircraft can hover over precise areas for extended periods – providing real-time, high-resolution data and coverage. Potential applications include monitoring wildfires, weather systems and illegal activity at sea; as well as acting as a low-orbit platform for mobile and internet connectivity, delivering broadband directly to devices.

Radical’s innovation is not just theoretical. After testing a small prototype in October 2023, the company has raised $4.5 million in seed funding from investors including Scout Ventures and Y Combinator. The next step: a full-scale test flight within the year to validate long-duration performance.

Why climate-conscious brands should care

This isn’t about transporting passengers; it’s about enabling smarter, climate-positive infrastructure. For companies involved in agriculture, conservation, telecoms or ESG reporting, these aircraft could offer persistent, zero-emissions solutions for data gathering and connectivity, at lower cost and higher resolution than traditional satellite systems.

“India’s cargo growth will be driven not just by volumes, but by regional inclusivity,” stated Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO of MGH Group.
Institutional execution remains a bottleneck Despite strong policy ambition, experts cautioned that execution gaps remain—particularly around the National Air Cargo Policy Blueprint (2019), which remains largely unimplemented.","India’s reputation as the “Pharmacy of the World” carries significant airfreight implications. Pharmaceuticals comprise over 12 percent of India’s total airfreight export value, and nearly 80 percent of this volume demands some form of temperature control, according to IATA.

“The weakest link is no longer airlift—it’s cold chain consistency from shipper to consignee,” observed Bhasker A, Associate Vice President of Engineering and Projects at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries. “GDP-compliant handling and validated lanes are critical if we are to compete with hubs in Europe or Singapore.”

The concern is validated by discrepancies in airport infrastructure across Indian cities. While metro hubs such as Mumbai and Hyderabad have made progress in pharma-certified facilities, regional airports remain under-equipped to handle high-value cold chain cargo, threatening India’s ability to decentralise pharmaceutical exports.

Digital infrastructure as the invisible enabler

A quiet but profound shift is underway in India’s airfreight sector: the digitalisation of cargo processing and inter-agency coordination. Vineet Malhotra, Director at Kale Logistics, explained how Cargo Community Systems (CCS) at key airports have reduced shipment dwell times by 22 percent and streamlined customs-clearance documentation.

This effort aligns with India’s ambition to improve its ranking in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), where it now ranks 38th globally, a significant improvement from its 44th position in 2018.

“Interoperability between forwarders, airlines, ground handlers and customs is no longer aspirational—it’s fundamental,” Malhotra said. “A paperless ecosystem not only improves turnaround time, but reduces regulatory friction and enhances compliance traceability.”

Policy professionals monitoring digital trade facilitation will note that this evolution aligns with broader WTO efforts on Trade Facilitation Agreements (TFA), where data integration and real-time visibility are central to reducing cross-border inefficiencies.

High-Security & Precision Logistics

India’s rise as a hub for high-value, high-security cargo—ranging from banking assets to high-end electronics and jewellery—has triggered innovation in secure logistics services.

“India’s growth story in this segment is limited, not by demand but by scalable and standardised solutions,” said Rajkumar S, CEO of Sequel Logistics, a market leader in secure logistics. “We’re witnessing a strong uptick in inter-city express movement, especially among banking and bullion sectors.”

Sequel’s model, built on vault-to-vault tracking, temperature integrity, and end-to-end risk management, represents a critical edge in markets where data security, chain of custody, and audit trails are under increasing scrutiny.

Decentralisation: Beyond Metro-Centric Growth

While India’s six major metro airports account for nearly 80 percent of airfreight throughput, speakers at the panel urged policymakers to focus on capacity-building across Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, especially as Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes decentralise manufacturing.

“India’s cargo growth will be driven not just by volumes, but by regional inclusivity,” stated Himanshu Pant, Managing Director & CEO of MGH Group. “We must incentivise the development of smaller cargo terminals and multimodal linkages in the hinterland.”

The success of regional air connectivity schemes like UDAN and the viability of smaller freighter operations will depend heavily on how India integrates cargo-specific incentives into regional airport modernisation plans.

Institutional execution remains a bottleneck

Despite strong policy ambition, experts cautioned that execution gaps remain—particularly around the National Air Cargo Policy Blueprint (2019), which remains largely unimplemented. Industry professionals highlighted the need for harmonised policy across ministries, centralised stakeholder coordination, and enforceable service-level benchmarks.

“India is at the cusp of a logistics revolution—but unless we institutionalise governance, standardisation, and training, we risk squandering the opportunity,” noted moderator Ramesh Mamidala, Head of Cargo at Air India.

A framework akin to the European Union’s Single Window Environment for Customs (EU SW-CERTEX), or a cross-sector regulatory authority for cargo, could help India accelerate execution while reducing regulatory fragmentation.

Implications for Global Trade and Sustainability

India’s airfreight expansion intersects with broader global challenges—particularly supply chain resilience, decarbonisation mandates, and digital trade compliance. With the EU’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and Fit for 55 proposals reshaping trade regulation, operators in India will need to adapt quickly to sustainability reporting, carbon footprint tracking, and green fuel adoption.

“We need visibility not just of cargo, but of carbon,” said one panel participant. “India must develop its SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel) strategy in lockstep with trade policy, or risk being excluded from future air corridors with green mandates.”

In this context, India’s airfreight policy must be better integrated with its climate strategy, trade agreements, and aviation decarbonisation targets to ensure compliance and competitiveness.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Page-9-shutterstock_1936631263-1080x724.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 14:56:08.481501

As part of the Indonesia framework, the White House announced Indonesia would eliminate 99% of tariff barriers for all U.S. and agriculture products and an agreement to purchase $4.5 billion worth of agricultural products. As part of the agreement with Japan, Japan will increase the quota for rice imports and has committed to purchasing $8 billion worth of U.S. goods. Although details are few, the EU and United States reached a framework deal over the weekend that may lower some tariffs on agricultural goods.

Reports indicate the United States and EU will have zero-for-zero tariffs on some agricultural products. The tariff rates for wine and spirits are not yet established. The remaining tariff level will be set at 15%, up from the 10% bar reset on April 9 and in line with the other renegotiated deals in recent weeks. National Grain and Feed Association President and CEO Mike Seyfert said this is a “meaningful step forward in opening one of the world’s most restrictive markets to American producers.” Seyfert added NGFA is “encouraged by the president’s call to diversify agricultural trade with the EU, and we look forward to ongoing discussions to build on that goal.”

Japan is expected to immediately increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, representing a major expansion of import quotas. In addition, the framework establishes Japan will purchase $8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol and sustainable aviation fuel.

In the 2023-24 marketing year, Japan was the second largest importer of U.S. corn; the third largest importer of U.S. sorghum; the fourth largest importer of U.S. barley; and the ninth largest importer of U.S. distillers dried grains with solubles, totaling 14 million metric tons in corn-equivalent exports or $5.95 billion, the U.S. Grains Council shared. “This deal is an embodiment of our countries’ longstanding partnership and includes ethanol and SAF that fits into Japan’s policies of increasing the use of renewable fuels, that include U.S. ethanol,” said USGC President and CEO Ryan LeGrand.

USA Rice President and CEO Peter Bachmann added, “Japan is consistently among our top export markets in terms of both value and volume, but this will be the first opportunity since the 1990s to further that market access.” From 1999 to 2024, Japan imported an annual average of 326,828 MT of U.S. rice, valued at approximately $222.7 million per year (not adjusted for inflation). U.S. rice that enters Japan outside the tariff rate quota system faces a tariff of 341 yen per kilogram, which in U.S. dollars is roughly $2.33 per kg or $2,330 per MT, USA Rice reported.

The framework with Indonesia also addresses non-tariff barriers for U.S. agriculture. Specifically, Indonesia will address and prevent barriers to U.S. agricultural products in the Indonesian market, including by: (1) exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all of Indonesia’s import licensing regimes including its commodity balance policy; (2) ensuring transparency and fairness with respect to geographical indications including meats and cheeses; (3) providing permanent Fresh Food of Plant Origin (FFPO) designation for all applicable U.S. plant products; and (4) recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight, including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry and dairy facilities and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities.

While U.S. soybeans and soy products already enjoyed duty-free access into the market, the framework also announced a commitment from Indonesia to purchase $4.5 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products, including soybeans and soybean meal. In marketing year 2023/2024, Indonesia imported $1.23 billion of U.S. soybean products, making the country U.S. soy’s fifth largest trading partner by volume according to USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service.

The Trump administration is preparing a list of agricultural products to be exempt from reciprocal tariffs. The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has been assembling a list of raw commodities that are not produced in the states to “shape bilateral trade talks and potentially offer tariff relief for U.S. importers,” according to Agri-Pulse. If the exemptions materialize, importers could see some relief for products such as fruit, vegetables, seafood, coffee, cocoa, some seed oils and other critical inputs for food manufacturers. Some sources say the list of raw materials and agricultural goods could be incorporated into country-specific trade agreements, like those the president has made with the UK, Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines and Japan.",https://grainnet-com.s3.amazonaws.com/defaults/_1200x630_crop_center-center_82_none/GJ_default_image_1200x630.webp?mtime=1708746861,N,,2025-07-28 14:23:29.371855

Image Credit: Singapore Airlines","Singapore Airlines (SIA) has long been celebrated for its excellence in aviation, earning accolades as one of the world’s finest carriers. Yet, despite achieving a modest increase in revenue, the airline’s net profit for the first quarter of 2025 has suffered a sharp decline of 59%. The reasons behind this decline include lower interest income, the underperformance of its partner, Air India, and intensifying competition in the aviation sector. This financial setback carries significant implications not just for the airline itself, but for the broader tourism and travel industry in Southeast Asia and beyond.

The SIA Group reported a total revenue of S$4.79 billion, a slight rise from the previous year’s S$4.72 billion, yet its operating profit slipped by 13.8%. The steep drop in profits raises several concerns about the economic pressures faced by the aviation sector, which has seen a notable shift due to volatile market conditions and increasing competition. For tourists planning to travel across Southeast Asia, these changes are bound to affect the landscape of air travel, and by extension, tourism as a whole.

Airlines and the Future of Tourism: The Ripple Effect

The relationship between airlines and tourism is inextricable. As global tourism continues to rebound, airlines, particularly in regions like Southeast Asia, are vital in making destinations accessible to travelers. The profitability of major airlines like Singapore Airlines has direct consequences on travel pricing, availability of flights, and the overall travel experience. A decline in airline profits could signal the possibility of reduced flight frequencies, higher fares, and less competition in certain sectors.

SIA’s passenger numbers, however, paint a more optimistic picture. The group carried a record 10.27 million passengers in Q1 FY2025/26, marking a 6.9% increase from the previous year. The high demand for air travel despite the financial struggles faced by the airline reflects the resilience of Southeast Asia’s tourism sector, where travel is still booming.

However, this growth comes at a cost. SIA’s passenger yields, which represent the average fare paid per mile flown by each passenger, fell by 2.9%. This decline indicates a more competitive environment in which customers may struggle to find affordable tickets, potentially deterring tourists from traveling as frequently or to farther destinations. The concern here is not just about higher ticket prices but also the reduced availability of budget-friendly travel options that appeal to price-conscious tourists, particularly in the leisure and mid-range segments.

The Air India Factor: How Partnerships Affect Tourism

One of the most significant contributors to SIA’s profit decline is its partnership with Air India, particularly after Air India fully integrated Vistara, which was previously partially owned by SIA. The decision to account for Air India’s financial performance as part of its own balance sheet has significantly impacted SIA’s profits, largely due to Air India’s losses. This, in turn, affects the travel plans of many passengers, especially those considering routes that involve multiple airlines under the same partnership.

With the growing dominance of Air India in the South Asian market, the fall of SIA’s profits could slow the progress of joint ventures and collaborations in the region, potentially reducing the number of travel routes or destinations offered by these carriers. For tourists, especially those traveling between Southeast Asia and South Asia, this could mean fewer choices in flights, possibly leading to higher costs or less direct routes. This could affect travel itineraries, particularly for business travelers and leisure tourists heading to destinations like India, Malaysia, and Thailand, where airlines like SIA play a key role in the tourism infrastructure.

Tourism Growth Amid Financial Struggles

Despite the financial setbacks, both Singapore Airlines and its low-cost subsidiary, Scoot, achieved all-time high passenger numbers. The high load factors (the proportion of available seats filled with passengers) of 86.6% for Singapore Airlines and 91.5% for Scoot illustrate that demand for air travel remains robust, even in the face of financial uncertainty. This is particularly important for tourism, as airlines are a primary vehicle for both inbound and outbound travelers in the region.

However, the lower passenger yields paint a concerning picture for the tourism industry. These falling yields, caused by increased competition from other carriers adding more capacity, could result in higher operational costs. Airlines may respond by passing these costs onto customers, particularly tourists who are already facing rising prices for accommodations, activities, and other travel expenses.

On the other hand, the strong performance in passenger volumes provides optimism for the future. Tourists continue to flock to destinations across Asia, and Singapore remains a central hub for international travelers, offering access to key regional destinations such as Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The travel demand in the region is likely to continue, albeit with a cautionary note about pricing.

The Future of Air Travel and Tourism in Southeast Asia

Singapore Airlines’ strong network, including recent expansions in destinations like Iloilo in the Philippines and Vienna in Austria for Scoot, signals that the company is actively exploring new growth opportunities. This is vital not only for the airline’s recovery but also for the sustainability of tourism in the region. Expanding networks and increasing capacity to high-demand destinations help mitigate some of the potential negative impacts caused by economic fluctuations.

Moreover, the group’s partnership with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) suppliers such as Neste and World Energy demonstrates its commitment to sustainability, a critical consideration for tourists who are increasingly concerned with the environmental impact of their travels. With sustainability becoming a more prominent factor in the travel decisions of consumers, airlines that prioritize eco-friendly practices may be better positioned to maintain loyalty from environmentally-conscious travelers.

Additionally, the airline’s strategic initiatives to counterbalance market fluctuations, such as increasing capacity on Asian routes following the closure of Jetstar Asia, could help provide stability in the tourism sector. This will be particularly beneficial for tourists looking for budget-friendly travel options and for countries in the region dependent on international tourism as a key driver of their economy.

Financial Health and Resilience Amid Challenges

Despite the profit decline, the SIA Group remains in a strong financial position. The group’s balance sheet shows a solid equity base of S$15.8 billion, a reduction in debt, and a healthy cash balance of S$7.8 billion. These financial strengths provide the group with the resilience needed to weather the ongoing economic uncertainties, positioning it well for future growth.

For the tourism industry, this strong financial backing is a sign of stability. It suggests that, despite short-term financial challenges, Singapore Airlines will continue to be a major player in the Southeast Asian travel landscape. This is important for both tourists and businesses that rely on the airline’s vast network for logistics and transportation.

Conclusion: Looking Ahead to a Robust Travel Landscape

While the recent decline in Singapore Airlines’ profits raises concerns about the future of air travel and tourism in Southeast Asia, the airline’s commitment to passenger growth, sustainability, and expanding its network offers a promising outlook. The robust demand for air travel, combined with SIA’s strategic efforts to navigate economic uncertainties, ensures that the region’s tourism industry will remain resilient.

The key takeaway for travelers and industry professionals is that while challenges persist, the tourism sector in Southeast Asia remains strong. Tourists will likely continue to flock to popular destinations such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, with airlines adapting to meet these demands. The ongoing investments in infrastructure, sustainability, and route expansions demonstrate that the tourism and travel industries are resilient and will continue to thrive, albeit with careful navigation through uncertain economic times.

The big picture This U.S.–Japan deal is more than a tariff tweak—it’s a strategic alignment that unlocks new flows of trade and investment.","Last week, the U.S. and Japan inked a landmark trade agreement. The deal slashes tariffs on Japanese vehicles, opens Japanese markets to U.S. energy and agriculture, and commits a staggering $550 billion in Japanese investment into the U.S. economy.

Investors are already seeing the impact: Japanese auto stocks jumped double digits on the news. But the ripple effects go way beyond Toyota and Honda… and the smartest investors are positioning now for the next wave of winners.

Let’s break down what’s in this deal, who stands to gain, and how to play it.

What’s actually in the deal?

Here’s the quick breakdown:

Lower tariffs: Japanese autos entering the U.S. will now face a flat 15% tariff—a big drop from the ~27.5% originally threatened.

Massive Japanese investment: Japan pledged $550 billion for U.S. industries, including semiconductors, energy, shipbuilding, and AI.

Market access for U.S. agriculture and energy: Japan will expand U.S. rice imports by 75%, and buy more corn, soybeans, fertilizer, and even sustainable aviation fuel.

Technology and supply chain collaboration: The deal gives U.S. companies better access to Japan’s high-tech industries—like AI, semiconductors, and robotics—while allowing Japanese firms to take part in U.S. supply chain reshoring. It’s a two-way partnership aimed at reducing reliance on China and strengthening critical industries in both countries.

Who’s already winning (and losing)?

The biggest pop came in Japanese automakers, which suddenly got cheaper access to the U.S. market. These companies now enjoy a huge cost advantage over U.S. automakers—at least in the near term.

Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), and Mazda (MZDAY) all surged within hours of the news.

Sony Group (SONY) also rallied thanks to its heavy electronics and supply chain exposure.

Unfortunately for Ford (F) and General Motors (GM), this deal makes Japanese cars more competitive in the U.S. market—right when Ford and GM are still struggling to manage EV costs and shifting supply chains.

GM and Ford now face a major disadvantage. They’ll eventually have to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S.—but that takes time and money. Until then, their margins will lag while Japanese automakers sell cheaper.

But this isn’t just about cars. The $550 billion Japanese investment package targets strategic sectors:

Semiconductors and critical minerals – bolstering supply chains and advanced manufacturing

Energy and shipbuilding – more U.S. LNG, sustainable aviation fuel, and maritime projects

AI and advanced tech – joint development and IP-sharing opportunities

U.S. agriculture – expanded rice, soybean, corn, and fertilizer exports

Think of it as a two-way street: Japanese exports (like cars and electronics) gain a smoother path to U.S. consumers… while U.S. companies get better access to Japanese demand for energy, food, and technology.

And there’s another recurring winner from deals like this: Boeing (BA).

Why? Because trade deals often use big-ticket purchases, such as airplanes, to balance deficits. Japan is expected to boost its orders of U.S.-made aircraft… which will send Boeing soaring.

The next trade deal catalysts

Japan is just the first in a series of deals coming ahead of the August 1 deadline.

Two under-the-radar countries that could become our next trade partners: Cambodia and Bangladesh.

Why does that matter? Because those countries are massive apparel exporters. If the U.S. signs favorable trade deals with them, Gap (GPS), Levi Strauss (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could see a 10–15% pop, similar to what we just saw with Japanese automakers.

So keep an eye on these future negotiations—they could trigger the next round of trade-related stock surges.

How to play it

Here’s a simple roadmap for investors:

Go long Japanese exporters: Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), Nissan (NSANY), Mazda (MZDAY), and Sony (SONY) should continue to benefit from tariff relief and stronger U.S. demand.

Avoid Ford and GM for now: Both face cost and pricing disadvantages until they relocate more production domestically.

Own Boeing as a recurring trade-deal winner: BA often sees orders tied to major bilateral deals.

Watch apparel stocks for the next wave: Gap (GPS), Levi’s (LEVI), Ralph Lauren (RL), and PVH Corp (PVH) could surge if apparel-heavy countries sign similar deals.

The big picture

This U.S.–Japan deal is more than a tariff tweak—it’s a strategic alignment that unlocks new flows of trade and investment. It rewards companies that can pivot quickly… and punishes those stuck with outdated cost structures.

These deals create immediate pops in the companies most exposed to them. If you can position yourself early—before CNBC starts talking about it—you can ride those 10–20% surges.

And with more countries lining up to negotiate before the August deadline, there’s plenty more opportunity on the horizon.",https://www.curzioresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/us-japan-usd-jpy-800.png,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:15.328176

CBO’s estimates are not always accurate—and there’s little formal review when reality diverges from projection.
CBO’s estimates play a major role in shaping policy debates, but they are not infallible.
However, these points of uncertainty are often overlooked, and sometimes CBO’s estimates can be significantly off the mark.
These reviews may be challenging due to the many variables that affect both cost estimates and real-world outcomes.","The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) plays a vital role in shaping legislation, producing hundreds of cost estimates each year. Lawmakers rely on this scorekeeper to provide impartial analysis. But what happens when those projections miss the mark? A new bill from Rep. Andy Barr (R-KY) aims to answer that question by holding the CBO more accountable when its forecasts fail to match reality.

Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act (H.R.2666) would require the agency to publish follow-up analyses of major legislation after they’ve been enacted into law. This would ensure Congress and the public have a clearer picture of how well CBO estimates hold up once policies are implemented.

There’s often a disconnect between what legislation is projected to cost and what it ends up costing once implemented. CBO’s estimates are not always accurate—and there’s little formal review when reality diverges from projection. Barr’s bill aims to close that gap by requiring CBO to compare original projections to real-world outcomes—helping Congress learn from past mistakes and improve future policymaking.

CBO’s Role in the Budget Process and the Risks of Inaccurate Scores

CBO was established as a neutral budget scorekeeper by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Before this, Congress was generally dependent on the White House’s Office of Management and Budget for fiscal analysis. CBO plays a pivotal role in the development of policy, producing official cost estimates for hundreds of bills each year. In addition, members of Congress and their staff routinely consult with CBO for informal analysis while drafting legislation.

CBO’s estimates play a major role in shaping policy debates, but they are not infallible. Many factors can cause actual fiscal outcomes to diverge from projections, including unexpected economic shifts, policy implementation challenges, and incorrect assumptions. For example, CBO’s dramatic underestimation of the cost of the IRA’s clean energy tax credits and its overestimation of the revenue impact of IRS enforcement funding both illustrate how uncertainty can lead to significant discrepancies between projections and reality.

We at NTUF successfully urged CBO to better highlight uncertainty in its estimates, ensuring that lawmakers and the public have a clearer understanding of the potential range of outcomes. Instead of burying these details deep within explanatory text, CBO now summarizes key points of uncertainty more prominently in its reports, particularly in the sections presenting top-line budgetary impacts. This change helps policymakers better assess the reliability of estimates and recognize when projections might be overly optimistic or pessimistic.

However, these points of uncertainty are often overlooked, and sometimes CBO’s estimates can be significantly off the mark. Understanding that CBO’s scores are well-considered but not infallible will be crucial for having a clear view during this year’s tax debate. Taxpayers should be cautious when analyzing estimates that depend on numerous uncertainties. Here are some of the key misses from CBO in recent years.

Inflation Reduction Act Electric Vehicle Tax Credits

One of the most costly miscalculations in recent memory involves the expansion of the Electric Vehicle (EV) Tax Credit under the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The law removed a cap on the number of eligible EVs per manufacturer, massively broadening the credit’s reach.

Though originally intended to boost demand, recent research shows that 75% of the credit’s claimants likely would have bought the electric vehicle anyways, meaning the credit functions more as a subsidy than an incentive. But Congress had little idea of the potential price tag, in part because CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) dramatically underestimated the cost.

In 2022, CBO estimated that IRA’s clean vehicle credits would cost around $14 billion over the decade. Revised and follow up estimates range from around $200 billion from CBO, to around $400 billion from the Penn-Wharton Budget Model with some of the overrun tied to a Treasury Department loophole for leased vehicles.

To rein in these runaway costs, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) phases out or eliminates many of the green energy tax credits created under the IRA. This includes repealing the electric vehicle subsidy. OBBBA also rolls back production and investment tax credits for wind and solar, and eliminates credits for clean hydrogen, sustainable aviation fuel, advanced manufacturing, and zero-emissions facilities. These reforms are expected to save roughly $500 billion over the next decade.

Medicaid Expansion Flop

The Affordable Care Act (ACA) has faced criticism on many fronts, but one of its most costly provisions for taxpayers is the Medicaid expansion. Beginning in 2014, states were permitted to expand their Medicaid coverage to non-elderly, able-bodied adults with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level. When the ACA passed in 2010, the CBO, assuming nationwide adoption, projected sixteen million new enrollees by 2019. Yet by 2019, enrollment in expansion states had already reached fifteen million—even though only about three-fifths of states had implemented the expansion. This is also a huge contributing factor to why the program has been roughly 157% more expensive than anticipated. CBO scored Medicaid expansion repeal at around $800 billion in the ten year budget window back in 2017, which is likely far higher now that additional states have implemented the expansion.

Improving Transparency and Accuracy in Budget Scoring

Budget misses such as these undermine effective policymaking. These cost estimates of enacted laws get included in CBO’s baseline, and, when they are faulty, lead to a skewed outlook of outlays and revenues. More accurate evaluations of major legislation are essential to improving fiscal discipline and accountability.

Under the bill, CBO would assess the actual budgetary effects of such laws and compare them with its original estimates. If actual outcomes diverge from initial projections by more than 10%, CBO must notify Congress and provide an explanation of the discrepancy. The bill also requires federal agencies to cooperate with CBO by supplying data and support necessary for these analyses.

Barr’s bill would build on efforts already undertaken by CBO. For example, it already publishes a variety of recurring reports, such as its ten-year budget and economic outlook and long-term outlook, which include analyses of legislative and economic factors that lead figures to differ from what CBO had previously reported. CBO also regularly examines the accuracy of its baseline. However, these reports do not always dig into the impacts of specific laws.

Barr’s legislation would fill a critical gap by ensuring ongoing reviews of the actual costs of major legislation. These reviews may be challenging due to the many variables that affect both cost estimates and real-world outcomes. However, requiring them would help CBO learn how policies actually unfold and use those insights to improve its future scoring models.

Conclusion

Rep. Barr’s CBO Scoring Accountability Act is a commonsense reform that would strengthen the accuracy and accountability of CBO’s cost estimates—an especially important step following the enactment of sweeping legislation like the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Requiring regular updates on the real-world fiscal impact of major laws will help lawmakers assess whether a policy is working as intended or needs correction. By improving oversight of budget projections, this bill would help ensure more responsible policymaking, provide for improved estimates from CBO, and lead to better outcomes for taxpayers.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2025/03/CBO.jpeg?v=20250303031100,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:18.081870

In a moment marking the end of an era in aerospace testing, Rolls-Royce officially retired its legendary Boeing 747-200 engine testbed, N787RR, on 9 July 2025.

Stationed at Tucson International Airport, the aircraft concluded nearly two decades of ground-breaking flight trials, leaving behind a legacy that has shaped the evolution of modern jet propulsion, Vintage Aviation News reported.

From testing cutting-edge business jet engines to flying on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), N787RR became a workhorse of engineering advancement and a symbol of ingenuity in aviation research.

From passenger carrier to flying laboratory

Originally delivered to Cathay Pacific in 1980 as VR-HIA, the aircraft went on to serve with Air Atlanta Icelandic before its transformation by Rolls-Royce began in June 2005. Re-registered as N787RR, the Boeing 747-200 was meticulously refitted into a state-of-the-art flying laboratory. Stripped of passenger seating, the aircraft was equipped with high-tech instrumentation, recording systems, and a distinctive five-engine mounting configuration—allowing it to safely carry and test experimental engines in real-time flight conditions. Its robust four-engine design made it the ideal platform, enabling engineers to evaluate new powerplants without compromising safety.

Pioneering sustainable aviation fuel

The N787RR’s contribution to aerospace went far beyond structural modifications. In October 2021, the aircraft flew a Trent 1000 engine powered entirely by 100% SAF—demonstrating the potential of greener aviation technologies. The aircraft flew from Tucson airport in Arizona, passing over New Mexico and Texas, with a Trent 1000 engine running solely on 100% SAF while the remaining three RB211 engines ran on standard jet fuel.

The three hours and 54 minutes flight, which soared to 43,000 feet, validated the real-world performance and environmental promise of alternative fuels.

Deborah Robinson, Director of Test and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce, described the aircraft as “a great asset to us… we can take the opportunity to test the corners of the flight envelope and feed back into our extensive models.”

Testing the future: The Pearl 10X

Two years later, the N787RR entered another pivotal chapter as the testbed for Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X engine, destined for the Dassault Falcon 10X business jet. Beginning in March 2024, a series of high-altitude flights validated critical systems—ranging from fan vibration characteristics to in-flight relight capabilities. By mid-2024, at least ten test flights had been completed, with data gathered helping accelerate certification timelines and enhance engine reliability ahead of service entry.

Challenges of an ageing airframe

Despite these impressive achievements, age eventually caught up with the aircraft. Approaching 45 years of service, N787RR faced mounting maintenance and operational costs. With an average of 25 test flights per year, each sortie required increasing logistical support to maintain airworthiness.

A promising plan shelved

Rolls-Royce had once planned to replace the 747-200 with a newer 747-400 variant, registered as N747RR and acquired from Qantas in 2019. But that project was ultimately shelved in 2022 due to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Rolls-Royce invested £56 million ($94 million) in the acquisition and refurbishment of the aircraft. This is in addition to a £90 million investment in Testbed 80 in Derby, described by the company as “the largest and most intelligent testbed in the world.”

The 747-400 in question, once known as VH-OJU “Lord Howe Island,” had served Qantas for two decades, carrying 2.5 million passengers across more than 70 million kilometres. Upon retirement from commercial service, it was flown to AeroTEC’s flight test centre in Moses Lake, Washington, to begin a two-year conversion into a next-generation flying testbed. “This is a significant investment that will expand our world-leading test capabilities,” said Gareth Hedicker, Director of Development and Experimental Engineering at Rolls-Royce at the time. However, as engine development timelines contracted and testing demands evolved, the project was deemed surplus to requirements.

Looking ahead: A new era in testing

In the wake of N787RR’s retirement, Rolls-Royce is pivoting towards ground-based testing and new aviation frontiers. With ongoing development of its UltraFan demonstrator, ALECSys lean-burn engine, and research into hydrogen-compatible propulsion systems, the future of engine testing may increasingly rely on digital modelling and advanced ground rigs like Testbed 80 in Derby.

The end of an icon, the rise of new possibilities

Nonetheless, the gap left by N787RR will not be easily filled. It provided unmatched flexibility, accommodating everything from widebody Trent engines to business jet powerplants on a single adaptable platform. The aircraft didn’t just generate terabytes of performance data; it embodied the philosophy of innovation through rigorous in-flight testing. It made headlines, inspired engineers, and proved time and again that theory only takes flight when tested in the sky.

The 787RR bridged generations of engine technology, offering critical insights from Trent to Pearl and laying the groundwork for what comes next. It showed the aviation world that with the right vision and platform, even a decades-old airframe could remain at the cutting edge of aerospace advancement.

Au revoir, magnificent multi-tasker of the skies!

With its retirement, Rolls-Royce bids farewell to a “magnificent multi-tasker of the skies”, an aircraft that redefined what flying laboratories could achieve. Its legacy now fuels the next wave of cleaner, more efficient engines poised to power the aircraft of tomorrow.

The sun may have set on N787RR’s final mission, but its contrails of innovation continue to stretch far into aviation’s future.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image1.jpeg,N,,2025-07-28 13:56:21.382890

This historic feat was achieved on Vistara’s brand new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner, flying from Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA), Delhi to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai using a blend of 17% SAF with 83% conventional jet fuel. On this flight, Vistara was able to reduce approximately 10,000 pounds of CO₂ emissions. This pioneering initiative is part of Vistara’s ongoing efforts to minimize carbon footprint and support a sustainable future for the aviation industry.

Last month, Vistara operated a wide-body aircraft on a long-haul international route using sustainable aviation fuel, first time for an Indian airline. A blend of 30% SAF and 70% conventional jet fuel was used on a ferry flight between Charleston International Airport, South Carolina to Indira Gandhi International Airport, Delhi, which resulted in the reduction of approximately 150,000 pounds of CO2 emissions over the fuel’s life cycle.

On this occasion, Mr. Vinod Kannan, Chief Executive Officer, Vistara, said, “We have always been committed to driving sustainability and innovation in aviation, and are delighted to carry out yet another industry-first initiative of operating a commercial flight on a wide-body using SAF. We are thankful to our partners and the relevant authorities for their support.”

Vistara, along with other airline companies of the TATA group, has been working extensively towards reduction of carbon emissions through use of sustainable technologies. Last year, they had signed an MoU with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research – Indian Institute of Petroleum to collaborate on the research, development and deployment of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs). Vistara is also working through the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), to lower CO2 emissions for international flights and to curb the industry’s impact on climate change.

Vistara is India’s highest-rated airline on Skytrax and TripAdvisor, and it has been the winner of several ‘Best Airline’ awards, besides being lauded for world-class cabin cleanliness and upholding high safety standards. The airline has recently been featured amongst World’s Top 20 Airlines while being recognised as the ‘Best Airline in India and Southern Asia’ for the second time in a row, ‘Best Airline Staff Service in India and Southern Asia’ for the fourth consecutive year, ‘Best Cabin Crew in India and Southern Asia’ for the second time in a row and ‘Best Business Class in India and Southern Asia’ at the coveted Skytrax World Airline Awards 2022.

On July 23, 2025 the White House published a Fact Sheet on a proposed trade and investment agreement with Japan.

As part of the agreement, imports from Japan will be subject to a baseline 15% tariff rate. On the other hand, Japan has committed to increase market access for U.S. goods on a host of products. For instance, Japan has agreed to increase imports of U.S. rice by 75%, with an expansion of import quotas and agreed to purchase $US 8 billion in U.S. goods, including corn, soybeans, fertilizer, bioethanol, and sustainable aviation fuel. Japan has committed to purchase U.S.-made commercial aircraft, including an agreement to buy 100 Boeing aircraft. The Fact Sheet states that Japan has agreed to lift “longstanding restrictions on U.S. cars and trucks” and recognize U.S. automotive standards.

Further, the Fact Sheet states that Japan will invest $US 550 billion directed by the United States to rebuild and expand core American industries in sectors such as energy, semiconductors, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals and commercial and defense shipbuilding. The United States is expected to retain 90% of the profits from all investments.

The White House and Indonesia reach a Framework Deal on Reciprocal Trade

On July 22, 2025 the Trump administration and the Indonesian government agreed to a Framework for Negotiating an Agreement on Reciprocal Trade. In exchange for an IEEPA Reciprocal tariff rate of 19% set to begin on August 1, 2025, Indonesia has agreed to purchase commitments and offered a host of tariff and non-tariff related concessions to the United States.

Indonesia has agreed to procure (i) Boeing aircraft currently valued at $US 3.2 billion, (ii) purchase agriculture products, including soybeans, soybeans meal, wheat, and cotton with an estimated total value of $US 4.5 billion and (iii) energy products, including liquefied petroleum gas, crude oil, and gasoline, with an estimated value of $US 15 billion.

According to the Joint Statement, “Indonesia will eliminate approximately 99% of tariff barriers for a full range of U.S. industrial and U.S. food and agricultural products exported to Indonesia.” It is unclear whether this means that Indonesian tariffs on a majority of U.S. origin goods will be eliminated altogether or significantly reduced. The countries have agreed to negotiate rules of origin to ensure that the benefits of the agreement are limited to the parties.

Indonesia has also agreed to address nontariff barriers on industrial and agricultural exports. These include accepting vehicles built to U.S. federal motor vehicle safety and emissions standards; accepting FDA certificates and prior marketing authorizations for medical devices and pharmaceuticals; exempting U.S. exports of cosmetics, medical devices, and other manufactured goods from certification and labeling requirements among others; exempting U.S. food and agricultural products from all import licensing regimes (including commodity balance requirements) and recognizing U.S. regulatory oversight (including listing of all U.S. meat, poultry, and dairy facilities) and accepting certificates issued by U.S. regulatory authorities. Further, Indonesia has committed to remove restriction on exports of critical minerals to the United States.

The country has also committed and address a number of other issues such as barriers to digital trade, protection and enforcement of labor rights, maintaining and enforcement of environmental laws and address global excess capacity in the steel sector by joining the Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity.

As indicated above, the current agreement is a “Framework” and the United States and Indonesia are expected to continue negotiate and finalize a formal agreement in the coming weeks.

OFAC To Update Licensing Hotline With New Online Platform

New Statute Will Require BIS to Report Additional Licensing Information to Congress

On July 23, 2025, the U.S. Senate voted to enact H.R. 1316 (officially titled as the “Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act”), which the House of Representatives had previously approved on May 5, 2025. Once signed into law, H.R. 1316 will amend the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 in order to require the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) to provide the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs with an annual report detailing:

Washington, DC, July 28, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) welcomed the inclusion of multiple industry-supported policies in the Fiscal Year 2026 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies (THUD) bill passed by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee.

The Senate THUD bill includes $22.4 billion in funding for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), $13.8 billion of which is allocated for agency operations, $4 billion for facilities and equipment and $290 million for research and development. As with the THUD bill passed by the U.S. House Appropriations Committee on July 18, the Senate measure also recommends funding for the hiring of 2,500 new air traffic controllers.

These initiatives are consistent with the aims of the Modern Skies Coalition, a group of more than 50 international industry stakeholders, including NBAA, supporting a comprehensive upgrade of the nation’s ATC system that serves approximately 45,000 flights and 2.9 million passengers every day.

“We are grateful that the Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the need for swift action to approve this comprehensive funding measure that will enhance safety and reliability of ATC, in addition to many other positive steps to ensure the U.S. maintains its global leadership in aviation,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “We urge Congress to finalize passage of this important legislation.”

Bolen also thanked Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Susan Collins (R-ME) and Ranking Member Patty Murray (D-WA), as well as Senate THUD Committee Chair Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS) and Ranking Member Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) for their work on the measure.

In line with the House funding bill, the Senate measure also eschews calls to privatize the nation’s ATC network. “The committee does not support any efforts to transfer the FAA’s air traffic functions to a not-for-profit, independent, private corporation,” the bill reads, adding such a system would have led to funding shortfalls, ATC layoffs and significant safety risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The committee further cited the U.S. general aviation industry’s support for 1.3 million jobs and its $339 billion contribution to annual economic output and encouraged the DOT and FAA to support workforce development and expanded trade policies. “Collectively, aviation is the second-largest manufacturing export sector and the largest positive trade balance of any manufacturing sector,” the committee added.

Other NBAA-supported priorities in the Senate bill include recommendations for increased funding for FAA airport improvement grants and the hiring of 91 new agency safety inspectors and engineers; expansion of alternative fuels research and production of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF; and the safe implementation of expanded unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and commercial advanced air mobility (AAM) operations.

The committee also expressed support for the development of next-generation radar altimeters resistant to interference from high-strength 5G wireless communications, while also calling on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to work with the FAA on an interagency working group to identify potential spectrum impacts on aviation safety systems.

Lawmakers also called upon the FAA to look toward expanding implementation of safety management systems (SMS) to Part 145 repair facilities, parts manufacturing approval holders and supplemental type certificate holders, among other aviation operations.

Any surplus funds should be used to install radar systems in Class D airport control towers that frequently experience severe weather conditions or are located near adverse terrain, the committee added. Many of these airports are frequently used by business aviation operators.

As the company continues to leverage its operational excellence and strategic positioning, investors and analysts are closely watching its performance and future prospects.

Company Overview and Recent Performance

Valero Energy, with a market capitalization of approximately $44 billion as of July 2025, has established itself as a dominant player in the refining sector. The company’s Gulf Coast-centric operations and disciplined capital allocation have been key factors in its success.

In the second quarter of 2025, Valero exceeded expectations with a strong earnings report, addressing investor concerns and showcasing its ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions. This performance has reinforced the company’s reputation for operational excellence and efficient capital management. According to InvestingPro, ten analysts have recently revised their earnings estimates upward for the upcoming period, suggesting growing confidence in the company’s prospects. InvestingPro’s analysis indicates that VLO is currently trading below its Fair Value, presenting a potential opportunity for investors.

Refining Market Dynamics

The refining sector has experienced significant volatility in recent years, with supply and demand fluctuations impacting margins. Analysts project a robust outlook for refining economics in the latter half of 2025, driven by sustained supply/demand tightness. This environment is expected to benefit Valero, given its strategic asset positioning and operational efficiency.

Crack spreads, a key indicator of refining profitability, have shown improvement, particularly after a challenging period in late 2024. Seasonal factors and industry-wide maintenance activities have contributed to a more favorable pricing environment for refiners like Valero.

Renewable Fuels and Sustainability Initiatives

Valero has been expanding its presence in the renewable fuels market, particularly through its renewable diesel segment. This diversification strategy aligns with broader industry trends towards sustainability and lower-carbon fuel options. However, analysts note that the renewable diesel segment faces near-term pressure due to low Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and Renewable Identification Number (RIN) pricing.

The company’s growing exposure to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) presents an additional avenue for growth, although this market is still in its early stages. Valero’s investments in these areas demonstrate its commitment to adapting to changing energy landscapes and regulatory environments. With a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 0.46 and an Altman Z-Score of 4.19, InvestingPro data shows the company maintains financial flexibility to pursue these growth initiatives while maintaining a strong balance sheet.

Competitive Positioning

Valero’s operational excellence and cost leadership have allowed it to capture above-average margins across market cycles. The company’s advantaged feedstocks, export market access, and relatively lower regulatory burdens compared to peers contribute to its strong competitive position.

Analysts view Valero as one of the best-positioned refiners in the industry, citing its ability to navigate macroeconomic challenges and capitalize on market opportunities. The company’s focus on operational efficiency and strategic investments is expected to support its performance in the face of long-term industry headwinds.

Bear Case

How might declining petroleum product demand impact VLO’s long-term prospects?

The refining industry faces long-term challenges from the gradual shift towards alternative energy sources and improved vehicle efficiency. As global efforts to reduce carbon emissions intensify, demand for traditional petroleum products may decline, potentially impacting Valero’s core business.

Analysts note that consensus estimates for 2026 may be overly optimistic, with potential downside risks due to these structural changes in energy consumption. Valero will need to continue adapting its business model and expanding its renewable fuel offerings to mitigate the impact of declining traditional fuel demand.

What risks does VLO face from potential regulatory changes in the refining sector?

The refining industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations, which can significantly impact operational costs and profitability. Future regulatory changes, particularly those aimed at reducing emissions or promoting alternative fuels, could pose challenges for Valero.

While the company benefits from its Gulf Coast operations, which face fewer regulatory hurdles compared to other regions, any tightening of federal or state-level environmental policies could necessitate additional investments in compliance measures. This regulatory risk remains a key consideration for Valero’s long-term strategy and financial planning.

Bull Case

How does VLO’s operational excellence position it to capture above-average margins?

Valero’s track record of operational efficiency and cost leadership has been a key driver of its success. The company’s ability to optimize its refining processes and capture advantaged feedstocks allows it to maintain profitability even in challenging market conditions.

Analysts highlight Valero’s consistent execution and disciplined approach to operations as factors that enable the company to outperform peers in terms of margin capture. This operational excellence provides a buffer against market volatility and positions Valero to capitalize on favorable market conditions when they arise.

What growth opportunities exist for VLO in renewable fuels and sustainable aviation fuel?

Valero’s investments in renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) represent significant growth opportunities.

Upgrades to the facility not only allow for improved production capabilities but also create a new avenue for soybean oil through co-processing technology.

The processing upgrades were celebrated at a ribbon cutting ceremony in July, where the CountryMark team and top Indiana ag leaders gathered to highlight the wins this will have for Indiana farmers.

Background on renewable fuel

“Renewable fuel” seems to be a catch-all phrase — at least, that is what I’ve noticed during my travels and conversations. But the truth is that these updated processing pathways create new market opportunities for farmers while supporting sustainability goals. In the case of this CountryMark expansion, new technology will allow for production of renewable diesel fuel.

Soybean oil is combined with conventional diesel to make co-processed renewable diesel fuel. Differing from biodiesel, this fuel offers more desirable characteristics, according to CountryMark President and CEO Matt Smorch.

“It is important to understand that renewable diesel differs from biodiesel in several ways,” Smorch says. “Renewable diesel meets ASTM D975 diesel specifications, is stable in long-term storage and has a low cloud point, while biodiesel does not have those characteristics.”

This expansion could mark a turning point in the renewable fuels industry, which may prove benefits to Indiana farmers. Using renewable feedstocks, the renewable diesel fuel produced at this facility alone will drive demand for up to 20 million gallons of soybean oil each year.

“This is a multi-win for farmers,” says Don Lamb, director of the Indiana State Department of Agriculture. “The farmers will benefit from the sale of the product from the farmer-owned cooperative, and they will have another purchaser in CountryMark.”

Next steps

While this expansion is a huge stride in the renewables space, there is still work to be done. It will take more refinery expansions and upgrades to match the growing output from Indiana and U.S. farmers, but this new market opportunity is a step in the right direction.

Looking ahead, another area that will need to stay top of mind is sustainable aviation fuel. And it will be important to keep these opportunities close to home.

“One area we could grow in would be within sustainable aviation fuel and encouraging the development of that technology,” Lamb adds. “We need to look for the companies who are already in Indiana and making these types of products and encourage them to create new products to increase demand for farmers and ROI for their business.”

Not only is this expansion a good move for farmers, but it also will offer a new avenue to match the need for sustainable solutions. Rather than putting that burden on the next generation, CountryMark is taking the initiative now to bring these solutions to Indiana, where both local farmers and consumers can reap the benefits.

This move comes after the company made history in 2023 by becoming the first in South Korea to export Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to Europe, reports Maeil Business Newspaper.

According to the oil refining industry on July 27, SK Energy shipped approximately 6,000 tons of HVO from its Ulsan refinery to Europe in early June. The shipment is expected to arrive in mid-August. This marks the company’s first HVO export this year and second overall, after exporting around 5,000 tons in December 2023.

HVO is a cleaner alternative to conventional diesel, produced by processing vegetable-based materials such as used cooking oil with hydrogen. It serves as a direct replacement for diesel in vehicles like trucks, buses, and passenger cars, and can be used without modifying existing engines. Compared to earlier forms of biodiesel, HVO can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90%.

Demand for HVO in Europe is growing rapidly, driven by the European Union’s stricter rules on fuel composition and carbon emissions. Under the EU’s Renewable Energy Directive (RED), member countries must ensure that at least 29% of fuel used in transport is renewable by 2030.

Reflecting this increased demand, HVO prices in Europe recently hit a seven-month high. On June 20, prices rose to $2,216 per ton, according to industry data. An industry official said, “Europe is placing more value on eco-friendly fuels like HVO due to tighter carbon regulations. By 2026, Europe’s HVO consumption is expected to reach its highest levels yet.”

SK Energy is positioning both HVO and SAF as central to its strategy for entering the low-carbon transportation fuel market. These fuels are seen as essential to reducing reliance on fossil fuels, especially as the EU steps up its clean energy goals.

Earlier this year, SK Energy completed its first export of SAF to Europe after beginning mass production at its Ulsan refinery in 2024.

Qualifying international approved projects would have to implement solid traceability standards capturing material flows and the role of waste workers.

An EPR-funded global scheme would work in tandem with other plastics-related treaty mechanisms and private initiatives.

The international community is negotiating a new UN Plastics Treaty to end plastic pollution, with the sixth Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee session scheduled for August. A central piece of the treaty is Article 11, financial provisions that are meant to arrange how developed countries will provide financial resources, capacity-building and technology transfer to developing countries.

The stakes are high: Without adequate financing, many low-income countries simply cannot develop the waste infrastructure needed to stem plastic leakage. Yet, reaching consensus on a funding mechanism has proven difficult, and there is a real risk that finalizing the details could be pushed off to future Conferences of the Parties after the treaty is signed. Such delays would be costly.

Every year of inaction means millions more tons of plastic flowing into communities and ecosystems. The treaty’s success, therefore, hinges on finding creative ways to bridge the funding gap now, even as the formal mechanisms are still being negotiated.

Leveraging extended producer responsibility

One immediately available solution is to tap into the resources generated by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) schemes in high-income countries. EPR programmes make producers (e.g. brands and manufacturers) financially responsible for the post-consumer waste their products generate, often through fees or tradeable credits that fund recycling and waste management. Dozens of countries have EPR systems, from long-standing systems in Germany and Japan to newer laws in South Africa and the Philippines, usually focused on packaging and single-use plastics.

The United Kingdom’s Packaging Recovery Note and Export Note (PRN, PERN) system offers a compelling example of the scale of funding available. In the UK, producers must purchase PRNs (tradeable certificates) for every ton of plastic packaging they put on the market to meet recycling targets. In 2024 alone, the value of plastic PRNs bought by brands was around £338 million, according to the National Packaging Waste Database.

EPR fees are essentially private-sector money already being spent on compliance with recycling obligations. We propose channelling 10% of the value of these EPR credits into a dedicated fund for certified plastic waste management projects in emerging countries. In the UK’s case, such an allocation would equate to roughly £33-34 million per year directed to emerging economies’ waste infrastructure.

Importantly, this mechanism could be replicated across multiple high-income nations. France, Belgium, the Netherlands and others are piloting similar packaging EPR certificate systems. Were each group to allocate 10% of their EPR revenues to the Global South, the resulting multiplier effect would be evident.

Crucially, this idea does not require waiting for new tax legislation or the creation of a formal UN fund (which could take years). Governments can act in partnership with industry to earmark a share of existing EPR fees or credits for overseas projects. By doing so, developed nations and global brands can demonstrate their commitment to treaty goals now, jump-starting progress, instead of stalling until a complex multilateral fund is operational. It’s a proactive step that complements the treaty process.

Integrity and impact in emerging countries

Any mechanism directing funds to emerging countries must ensure the money is used effectively and transparently. Fortunately, we can draw on proven models from international climate finance. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the Kyoto Protocol showed how high-income countries could invest in emissions-reducing projects in emerging nations and count the resulting credits toward their own targets.

Similarly, under a plastics-focused scheme, countries contributing a slice of EPR funds abroad could potentially count those gains (e.g. tons of waste collected and managed and/or recycled) toward their national action plans under the new treaty.

A common question is: How do we ensure that producers actually contribute and that the money reaches the communities and workers who need it most? First, governments can enforce a mandatory allocation into approved international projects, just as they currently require PERNs (Plastic Export Recycling Notes) or equivalent certificates. This makes the contribution non-optional, while still leveraging familiar systems.

To become an approved international project, traceability should be a mandatory requirement, introduced through a phased approach that supports projects in adopting it over time. Scalable technologies already exist to generate a robust digital trail from the point of plastic collection, capturing not only material flows but also the role of waste workers.

Traceability must include both material and social data to ensure accountability at every level. While a global data standard combining both does not yet exist, it is not a barrier to action. Adapting national EPR policy – focusing on pollution control in emerging economies – would rather catalyze the generation of a global data standard.

A number of organizations are already advancing this space, and the World Economic Forum’s circular innovation initiative is actively convening these efforts. Additionally, independent third-party certification, such as Verra’s Plastic Waste Reduction Standard and Zero Plastic Oceans Social Plus standard, can further ensure that only credible, results-based projects qualify for funding.

Finally, transparency can be enhanced through public registries and regular reporting by fund administrators. Projects would be required to publish annual impact reports, including how much waste was managed, how many workers were employed, and how funds were distributed.

Joining forces against plastic pollution

It’s worth emphasizing that an EPR-funded global mechanism would not exist in isolation. It complements other financial solutions under discussion and in practice. For example, the treaty negotiations can consider a “plastic polymer levy” – essentially a small fee on the production of new (virgin) plastic resin. This fee would be collected upstream from polymer producers, while EPR fees are collected downstream from product manufacturers and retailers, making the two tools naturally synergistic.

Additionally, our proposed mechanism would amplify and scale voluntary private-sector investments already underway. In recent years, alliances of companies and investors have begun dedicating funds to fill critical gaps, from corporate pledges to eliminate plastic leakage, to impact investors backing recycling start-ups.

However, these voluntary efforts, while important, remain far below what’s needed. By contrast, leveraging a fraction of mandatory EPR payments provides a sustained, significant funding stream, driven by regulation but implemented in partnership with industry. It can co-exist with other innovative financing approaches, such as the World Bank’s outcome bond, or venture funds for circular economy infrastructure. Such efforts would build a financing ecosystem where public, private and blended capital reinforce each other and decrease the risk together.

The upcoming UN negotiations offer a pivotal chance to move this idea from proposal to reality. While delegates hash out the details of Article 11’s official funding mechanism – a process that could stretch on even after the treaty’s text is agreed – they should also embrace parallel solutions that can start delivering impact immediately.

The £1.5mln project to commercialise its new SAF production technology. The new process eliminates the need for bio or waste feedstock as it can produce SAF using a combination of renewable energy sources and next generation carbon capture technology.

The pathway is called Power to Liquid (PtL). It uses renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and captures carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes. The hydrogen and CO2 are then combined to create synthetic hydrocarbons, which can be refined into SAF.

NextGen-SAF, as the project is known, aims to build a world first demonstration plant combining two innovative technologies to produce SAF - a Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell (MCFC) and an Advance Fischer-Tropsch (AFT) reactor. The fuel cell can generate hydrogen and capture CO2 and the reactor converts the mixture into the synthetic hydrocarbons that are then refined into SAF.

The project will be delivered by a consortium, including Fuel Cell Energy, USA, Green Lizard Technologies, UK, Drax Power, UK, IMI Vivo, Italy, Gardner Consulting, UK, and Leeds Bradford Airport, UK), And is supported by several major airlines.

Amid rising expectations from regulators, customers, and investors alike, the sector is under growing pressure to develop credible environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks—not as an afterthought, but as core infrastructure for trade competitiveness.

This urgency was brought into sharp focus during the Air Cargo Forum India (ACFI) Annual Conclave 2025 in a pivotal session titled “Green Corridors and Sustainable Trade Lanes – Airfreight’s ESG Imperative.” The panel, comprising airport operators, freight integrators, ground handlers, and global policy voices, explored the complex path towards a decarbonised cargo supply chain—and the institutional gaps that remain.

Gateways to market access

Sustainability, once a reputational bonus, is now becoming a gatekeeping condition for trade access—particularly with Europe and North America. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which from 2024 covers all intra-European flights, and ICAO’s CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation), entering its first mandatory phase in 2027, will increase compliance pressure on cargo operators from non-OECD countries, including India.

“The decarbonisation of airfreight is not just about climate—it’s about staying eligible for trade,” said Glyn Hughes, Director General of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA). “If India’s airfreight industry cannot report, reduce, and verify emissions in line with international standards, its access to premium trade lanes will diminish.”

Hughes urged the Indian government and private sector stakeholders to accelerate alignment with global reporting protocols and carbon offsetting schemes. Inaction, he warned, would amount to regulatory non-alignment—effectively creating trade barriers.

From infrastructure to climate enablers

Kadhir Kadhiravan, Deputy CEO of GMR Hyderabad Airport, highlighted the evolving role of airports as environmental intermediaries. “We are no longer just physical infrastructure—we are climate infrastructure,” he said.

Hyderabad Airport, widely recognised for its early green investments, has reduced emissions at its cargo terminal by 17 percent since 2022. This was achieved through the electrification of ground support equipment (GSE), increased solar capacity, and energy-efficient cooling systems. Yet Kadhiravan cautioned against premature celebration. “We have built the pilot projects, but scaling this across India’s cargo airports requires standardisation, policy support, and investment in SAF [sustainable aviation fuel] infrastructure.”

Notably, India’s SAF availability remains negligible. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), India produced under 50,000 tonnes of alternative aviation fuels in 2023, compared to the EU’s 1.5 million tonnes.

The sector’s emissions blind spot

While aircraft emissions attract the most regulatory scrutiny, emissions from ground operations remain largely unregulated—despite accounting for up to 30 percent of airport-related emissions, according to industry estimates.

“Handling operations are often the ‘invisible carbon’ in air logistics,” noted Anupama Kachhap, Head of Commercials at Worldwide Flight Services (WFS). “But if we are serious about ESG, they can no longer remain a blind spot.”

WFS data suggests that electrified ground handling equipment can reduce on-site emissions by 40 percent. Yet India’s adoption remains below 15 percent, mainly due to fragmented ownership models and limited access to capital.

Solar jet is a type of synthetic crude oil produced using solar energy. Synhelion, a Swiss-based clean tech startup, describes the process of making solar jet fuel as a combination of affordable feedstock, cheap renewable energy, and cost-effective thermal storage.

Synhelion has benefited from support from Swiss (Swiss International Airlines) since 2020. That is when Swiss became a strategic partner. Two years later, it turned into an investor. Five years after their collaboration began, Swiss and Synhelion were able to demonstrate the use of solar fuel in civil aviation for the first time. It was a premiere for the entire aviation industry.

Although both players are based in Switzerland, the solar fuel was delivered and used in Germany. That's because it was used as part of the fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. First, Synhelion delivered a barrel of its synthetic crude oil to a refinery in Northern Germany. Here, the oil was processed and turned into certified Jet-A-1 aviation fuel.

The crude oil used for this industry trailblazing delivery was manufactured at Synhelion's DAWN facility, using proprietary thermal energy storage system.

For the next phase, this processed fuel was integrated into the fuel supply system at Hamburg Airport, from which it was then used for Swiss flight operations. It wasn't something big, like an entire flight powered by solar fuel, but it was a first step and a symbolic start.

This first use of solar fuel wasn't about quantity, but about getting the ball rolling. Synhelion only delivered a 190-liter (50 gallons) barrel of crude oil, and the resulting jet fuel represented only around seven percent of the total fuel needed for a Hamburg-Zurich flight. The goal was to confirm that this alternative fuel can be successfully used to power airplanes via a seamless logistical process.

Could solar fuel become as popular as SAF currently is? Perhaps, but there's still a long way to go. The production infrastructure required for commercial levels is still in its infancy, and availability is poor. Synhelion has full support from the Swiss, which enables it to move down the certification and scaling-up ladder faster.

Synhelion is now looking to secure the sustainability certification for both its fuel and production process, according to the EU Renewable Energy Directive.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/solar-jet-fuel-used-for-the-first-time-in-civil-aviation-255043_1.jpg,N,,2025-07-28 09:56:09.746066

This includes producers, airlines, airports, and investors from across the globe.

In this Q&A, we speak to Michael Nau, Director of Sales and Sustainability at Lufthansa, who is leading the cost reduction programme for Lufthansa worldwide for sales.

Is it fair to say that aviation’s right to grow is predicated on its ability to grow sustainably?

It's a good question. It depends on the geographical region. In Europe, I would agree with that, because of the mandated programme by the EU, also by the UK, and because some European countries are supporting it with incentives.

In Europe, sustainability is important. Crucially, customers want it, otherwise flight shaming is a risk. And corporate travellers especially want it. B2B travellers need greener tickets with less CO2 emissions because their companies have CO2 reduction targets.

For other parts of the globe, I have my doubts. I mean when you see what's going on in the US right now, it's one step back. Drill, baby, drill. The airlines will grow because kerosene will be cheaper. We’ll see lower ticket prices and increased demand. But is it sustainable growth? No.

In Asia Pacific, sustainability is picking up. Chinese, South Korean, and Japanese companies are buying SAF from us. So Asia Pacific is slightly lagging Europe, but they're on track.

Across the MENA region, I’m seeing a big change. I can see the commitment now from local players. They’re taking it seriously. They’ve realised they have to do something for their reputation to show it matters – and that this is the future.

So, it varies. And it makes sense that Europe would be leading the way. But if European Airlines are having to pay more and ticket prices go up, then passengers will just choose to travel with other airlines who aren't subject to those mandates.

What is the boardroom appetite to embrace SAF?

For the past two years, we’ve had an executive board member responsible for sustainability. And it shows. Sustainability is now in our DNA. All our higher management have it linked to their bonus. And all our key account managers – 720 worldwide – must discuss sustainability in every single customer meeting.

We have five strategic priories. One of those is sustainability. And one pillar of that is increasing the SAF share. In five years, by 2030, we want to be down by 50 percent on CO2 emissions compared to 2019. Every year we must lower it. And that is linked to our bonus – for me as well. Sustainability has well and truly arrived. It’s not only talk.

And to achieve this reduction, [among other focus areas] 23 percent is with new airplanes, nine percent with ops/efficiency; and 19 percent with SAF. So SAF is a major pillar. It has a big focus.

Does Lufthansa have a focus on a specific SAF technology or pathway?

We’re focusing mainly on HEFA, SAF made from used cooking oil. Why? Because of the price – around 2.5x higher than fossil kerosene. We know that HEFA is not the best or the cleanest SAF, but it’s the only that is currently payable for our customers.

From 2030 on, we will look to switch to power-to-liquid (PtL) and sun-to-liquid (StL), but at the moment these are around 50 times more expensive than fossil kerosene. We’ve discussed [adopting it sooner] with some strategic global customers, and it’s interesting because it's a one hundred percent clean hydrogen, but it's too expensive. So, we have spoken to the PtL and StL companies and told them by 2030 we need this price range. If they can do it, we’ll be in the game.

What have been the other major strategic decisions to make with regards to SAF?

We had to decide whether we wanted to be a PtL/StL producer, and whether we invest in such companies. In the end, we said ‘no’ to producing.

Why? Two reasons. First, we are not experts here. Others do it better. They have the facilities. Second, their financial power is much bigger. We would need a billion-euro level investment; that’s too risky for an airline. We can’t afford to have that level of investment if it turns out to be a mistake. Our expertise is flying from A to B, and it’s better to be focused on that.

What are the major barriers to scaling SAF?

Cost is the number one. In central Europe, the willingness to pay more for a flight with SAF is there if the ticket, compared to a normal ticket without SAF, isn’t higher than ten percent – to a maximum of 15 percent, which is already a challenge.

The second challenge is sourcing SAF. Demand and supply are not in balance. One year ago we were short of SAF. We struggled to get SAF at a reasonable price on the spot market. And this is a bit of a showstopper, because there is no hedging. So you cannot plan the price.

What services or offerings are you seeing drive uptake in SAF?

We’ve developed a capability where a corporate customer can decide precisely how much SAF they want. If they want to see an 18 percent reduction in their CO2 emissions from their corporate flights in 2025, and a 21 percent reduction in 2026, we can do this in the system. Our offering is flexible to their own CO2 reduction path. It’s tailor made to each company. This product will launch in September this year. It’s really cool.

What message would you have to other airline leaders looking at SAF?

Of course, other airlines are competitors, but not on this topic. I’m happy if competitors go in the same direction. It helps the industry. We all benefit. And if they have a high demand for SAF, then producers will produce more. We don’t compete on sustainability. Our competitor Is climate change, and the time we have.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/64941dbb608c8d7e0842c57f/65b3bcc050e1d25d78e56a64/68872d525995170f17494a29/1753716836057/5.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-07-28 11:56:53.907695
