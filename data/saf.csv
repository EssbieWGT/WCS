Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.
In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.
“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

And a Queensland company at the vanguard of production is establishing a biofuels facility – one of three being built in the race to cut emissions from challenging industries.

Wagner Sustainable Fuels, based in Toowoomba, also launched Australia’s first biofuel blending facility on Wednesday, and chief executive Matt Doyle says the nation could seize a big financial and environmental opportunity if it acts quickly.

“Waste products will be the new oil,” he says.

“We, as a country, have a lot of waste products so we can be a major player in sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel, and low-carbon liquid fuels in general.”

His prediction follows a $1.1 billion federal government investment in biofuel production and the launch of a public consultation into a national strategy for the burgeoning industry.

While momentum is growing, climate experts say biofuels remain difficult and costly to produce, and their widespread acceptance will require governments around the world to mandate their use.

Biofuels, also known as low-carbon liquid fuels, are made from renewable resources such as agricultural waste and can be used to reduce emissions from industries in which there are few other options.

In transport, for example, sustainable aviation fuel has been flagged as the major solution airlines will use to reach their 2050 net zero target, contributing 65 per cent of the emission reductions required.

Domestic airlines such as Qantas and Virgin Australia are already pursuing biofuel opportunities, Doyle says, as alternative technologies are not ready to go the distance.

“There have been a lot of studies done on electric planes, which are good for very short-haul [flights], but they can’t do any longer,” he says.

“Then there’s hydrogen in 2035 or 2040, but that will only be medium-haul. For long-haul, there’s no other solution other than sustainable aviation fuels out to 2050.”

The Toowoomba-based company is developing a sustainable aviation fuel production facility in Brisbane, co-funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, which is expected to produce 114 megalitres of fuel annually.

But the firm’s latest fuel-blending facility at Wellcamp Airport is using imported synthetic fuel to mix with standard jet fuel while waiting for domestic supplies to become available, Doyle says.

“We’re hoping our facility can be a beacon for the federal government to look at and say everything works.

“Then we can get on with making good policy that will grow the industry and benefit Australia.”

Support for biofuels is growing in Australia, with the government announcing a $1.1 billion, 10-year Cleaner Fuels Program in September to boost its production.

Consultation also opened this month for the development of a National Bioenergy Feedstock Strategy to ensure Australia is producing materials needed to create renewable fuel.

After years “wasted in the climate wars”, the announcements are being welcomed by producers and potential users alike, says Bioenergy Australia chief executive Shahana McKenzie.

Despite the industry’s slow start, she says, Australia’s advantages, such as its strong farming sector, make it a natural biofuels leader in the Asia Pacific region.

“Australia is being looked at by all the other players in our region as the most likely contributor, either from a feedstock perspective or from an export perspective,” she says.

“It’s incredibly important that decarbonisation is actively taking place across all [nearby] jurisdictions.”

Australia already has three biodiesel and two ethanol refineries in operation, with three projects in development: Wagner’s Brisbane base, Ampol’s proposed renewable fuels facility in outer Brisbane, and Jet Zero’s Project Ulysses in Townsville.

Other projects are “progressing behind the scenes”, McKenzie says, to help the nation catch up to its potential.

“I’m very confident Australia will be delivering close to 10 per cent of our aviation fuel market needs in the early 2030s,” she says.

“In terms of the flow of sustainable aviation fuel and renewable diesel in country, we are predicting the first project will deliver fuel in 2028.”

But Climate Energy Finance director Tim Buckley says there will be more challenges to adopting biofuel than just producing it.

Renewable fuels are significantly more expensive to produce than conventional varieties, he says, and will have to be mandated in some industries to ensure emission cuts.

“The cost of biofuels is between 50 and 500 per cent the cost of their fossil fuel equivalents, and that’s a huge impediment to their uptake,” he says.

“A lot of biofuels will go into the maritime and aviation industries, but that will only come about if you get mandates.”",https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5755%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_108/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/t_smh_no_label_no_age_social_wm/655bde7f12ad1d18d87a6a94582a3026bf47d67d,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:11.098081

This was the submission of the Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, John Pearson in an interaction with Festus Akanbi on the sidelines of a media event- Global Trade Shifts- Spotlights Africa, and launch of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker in Johannesburg, South Africa, last week

Figeria sits on a rare confluence of promise — a young, restless population, vast entrepreneurial energy, a swelling workforce, and a strategic position at the heart of Africa. Yet, in the view of John Pearson, Chief Executive Officer of DHL Express, the country’s demographic blessing will only translate into prosperity if the right policies, partnerships, and infrastructure align to unlock its immense potential.

Speaking in Johannesburg at the unveiling of DHL’s 2025 Global Connectedness Tracker, Pearson told THISDAY that Nigeria’s future will depend on how it converts its people into productivity.

“You have over 200 million people, that’s not a challenge, it’s a superpower,” he declared. “But for that power to work, the systems, from education to logistics and regulation, have to move in the same direction.”

Human Capital: The Real Goldmine

At the centre of Pearson’s argument lies Nigeria’s human capital. With over 200 million citizens, half of them under 30, the country stands on a demographic goldmine. Pearson explained that DHL’s experience in Nigeria has shown the quality and competitiveness of local talent.

“We’ve been able to attract, retain, and grow fantastic Nigerian professionals,” adding that “Some of them have gone on to lead teams in other African countries. That tells you the calibre of people you have here.”

He pointed to DHL’s Certified International Specialist (CIS) programme, a leadership and training model applied consistently across all its global operations. “In Nigeria, our people go through the same training and development as their colleagues in Germany or India. It’s not watered down. That’s how we build global competence locally.”

However, Pearson noted that the wider Nigerian economy has yet to connect education to market realities. He emphasised that reforms must bridge the gap between academic training and industrial demand.

“The world of logistics, trade, and digital commerce is changing so fast. Nigeria’s universities and vocational institutions need to reflect that,” he said, pointing out that “We need to revive technical and apprenticeship programmes, bring industries into classrooms, and ensure graduates have practical skills, not just certificates.”

The DHL boss also underscored the importance of retention. “The continuous brain drain is a symptom, saying people leave when they can’t find stability or predictability at home. Salaries matter, but so do security, infrastructure, and a clear sense of direction.

Trade, Borders, and Bottlenecks

Few companies understand the pulse of trade like DHL. Pearson’s perspective on cross-border efficiency is blunt: Nigeria’s logistics arteries are clogged, and it’s costing the nation dearly.

“As a logistics company, our goal is to make the movement of goods seamless,” he said. “We work closely with customs; in some cases, officials even operate from our premises to speed up clearance. But many of the deeper challenges are systemic. No private company can fix them alone,” he said.

From congested ports to crumbling roads, Nigeria’s trade routes continue to be a source of frustration. Clearing goods from Apapa or Tin Can Island can take days, sometimes weeks, adding heavy costs that erode competitiveness. Pearson believes a “national logistics overhaul” is overdue.

“What Nigeria needs is simplicity and consistency,” he explained. “Simplify customs procedures, harmonise agency roles, digitise documentation, and you’ll see trade volumes and investor confidence rise almost immediately.”

He advocates the full activation of inland dry ports to relieve Lagos of its overwhelming cargo burden, as well as the creation of logistics hubs and cold-chain networks nationwide.

“Improving rail and road connectivity to neighbouring countries will also let Nigeria take real advantage of the African Continental Free Trade Area,” he added.

E-Commerce: The New Frontier

In Pearson’s view, the digital revolution is redefining logistics as much as it is redefining business. “The click-and-ship culture is exploding,” he said. “We’re helping Nigerian merchants go global, optimising their websites, setting transparent pricing, and ensuring reliable delivery timelines.”

DHL, he explained, is building the infrastructure and advisory systems that enable local businesses to plug directly into global markets. Yet, the e-commerce ecosystem remains underdeveloped.

“Too many small businesses are still manual,” he observed. “No digital tracking, no online payment integration. And with poor internet, unreliable electricity, and chaotic address systems, last-mile delivery becomes a nightmare.”

For Nigeria to truly benefit, Pearson believes, the government must make broadband access and digital literacy national priorities. “Once small businesses can operate confidently online, their market stops being their neighbourhood; it becomes the world.”

Sustainability: Delivering the Future Responsibly

Pearson’s passion for sustainability is unmistakable. DHL, he said, has made global commitments to reducing its carbon footprint, investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel and electric vehicles.

“In Nigeria, we’re already deploying solar-powered facilities and carbon-neutral warehouses,” he noted. “Our global goal is zero emissions by 2050, and that includes every market where we operate.”

However, Pearson acknowledged that Nigeria’s broader ecosystem remains far behind. “You can’t scale electric vehicles without reliable power or charging infrastructure,” he said. “Government incentives, like tax breaks for clean energy and partnerships for renewable grids, would accelerate adoption.”

DHL’s efforts, he argued, can serve as a template for others. “Sustainability shouldn’t be an afterthought. It’s part of competitiveness now. Customers want to know that their logistics partners care about the planet.”

Infrastructure: The Missing Link

Without physical infrastructure, even the best talent and technology falter. Pearson described infrastructure as the “circulatory system” of any modern economy, and Nigeria’s, he said, is weak.

“Ports are congested, roads are deteriorating, rail is underutilised, and warehouses are often outdated,” he said. “You can’t talk about efficient logistics without reliable arteries.”

He called for a National Logistics Master Plan, one that integrates roads, rail, ports, and production zones into a single coordinated framework. “Every delay on the road, every broken bridge, adds cost,” he said. “Fixing these things doesn’t just make trade faster; it makes businesses more competitive.”

Regulatory Consistency and Predictability

One of Pearson’s most persistent themes is predictability. “Investors can handle high costs,” he said, “but what they can’t handle is unpredictability.”

Frequent policy shifts, overlapping regulations, and opaque bureaucracy, he warned, remain Nigeria’s biggest deterrents to foreign investment. “If a business can’t predict clearance times, tariff levels, or regulatory changes, it can’t plan,” he said. “Predictability is the real investment incentive.”

Still, Pearson acknowledged positive examples. “Our collaboration with customs shows that private-public cooperation is possible,” he said. “It just needs to happen more often, with transparency, professionalism, and mutual trust.”

Empowering the SMEs

Beyond the large corporates, Pearson sees small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as the heart of Nigeria’s growth story. DHL’s GoTrade Initiative, he explained, was designed to help small exporters understand international standards, packaging, and logistics.

“We’re helping Nigerian SMEs connect directly to global buyers,” he said. “When small producers can access export finance, proper packaging, and reliable delivery, the entire economy benefits.”

He suggested that banks and government agencies complement such initiatives with affordable trade finance and insurance products. “Clusters of small producers can share logistics costs,” he said. “Incubators and mentorship programmes can also improve business management and export readiness.”

Digitalisation and Data: The Game Changer

To tie all these threads together, Pearson believes in data transparency. “Data is the new oil,” he said. “When you can measure port dwell times, clearance durations, and delivery success rates, you can fix inefficiencies.”

DHL’s use of route optimisation, scanner tracking, and real-time courier communication has significantly improved delivery performance. Nigeria, he argued, should adopt a similar culture of measurement and accountability.

“With reliable data, decisions become smarter, waste is reduced, and customers are happier,” he said.

The Path Forward

Pearson’s insights return to one central truth: predictability fuels prosperity. Investors, entrepreneurs, and workers all thrive when systems are stable and transparent. “Uncertainty kills momentum,” he said. “Predictability builds confidence and confidence drives growth.”

As Nigeria stands at the crossroads of potential and performance, the building blocks are visible: a youthful population, a vast market, creative entrepreneurs, and growing global attention. DHL’s experience, Pearson believes, is proof that progress is possible, with the right reforms.

“Education, infrastructure, digitalisation, sustainability, and regulatory stability, those are the five pillars,” he summarised. “If Nigeria focuses on these, it will move from a story of potential to one of performance.”

He paused, then added with a smile: “At DHL, we don’t just move parcels; we move economies. Nigeria can do the same, not just move goods, but move the entire continent forward.”",https://global.ariseplay.com/amg/www.thisdaylive.com/uploads/John-Pearson.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 23:56:17.329765

The retrofit, developed with Aviation Partners Boeing, will improve efficiency, cut drag, and reduce fuel burn on each flight.

Delta already uses the older Blended Winglets on its 737, 757, and 767 fleets. The new Split Scimitar design features both an upward and downward fin, creating weaker wingtip vortices and delivering up to 2% fuel savings. The upgrade is part of Delta’s wider push to cut emissions and reach net-zero by 2050.

Fuel accounts for one of the airline’s largest costs, and even small improvements can save millions of gallons per year. The carrier has also pledged to expand use of sustainable aviation fuel, modernize its fleet, and invest in new green technologies.

Passengers may not notice the change in design, but the impact on Delta’s carbon footprint could be huge.

Since its inaugural service in 2000, Emirates has flown 2.8 million passengers across fifteen thousand nine hundred flights, connecting Ugandans to more than onevhundred forty-five destinations worldwide through its hub at Dubai International Airport (DXB). The airline commemorated the occasion with a special four-class Boeing 777 flight, showcasing its fully refurbished cabins, including Premium Economy, which made its debut in Uganda. ​

A Milestone in Aviation and Tourism Development

Emirates’ twenty-five-year journey with Uganda exemplifies the airline’s role in driving connectivity and tourism growth across Africa. When Emirates launched its Uganda service in March 2000, flights operated thrice weekly via Nairobi using Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Now, the carrier operates daily direct flights using the larger Boeing 777-300ER, the only aircraft connecting Uganda internationally with a First Class cabin.

The airline’s steady expansion reflects its commitment to understanding market potential. In 2007, the route became fully direct, solidifying Entebbe’s position as one of Emirates’ most important African destinations. The airline later upgraded its service in 2015 to the 777-200LR before transitioning to the flagship 777-300ER that serves the route today, delivering increased capacity and improved passenger comfort. ​

Strengthening Uganda’s Global Tourism Profile

Emirates’ partnership with the Uganda Tourism Board (UTB) has been integral to boosting inbound tourism over the past two years. Through joint campaigns highlighting Uganda’s world-class natural attractions, such as Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, Murchison Falls, and the Rwenzori Mountains, the collaboration has promoted the country as a premier eco- and adventure tourism destination.

Since January 2025, passenger traffic on the Dubai–Entebbe route has grown by sixteen percent, with the majority of visitors connecting from key global markets including the United States, China, India, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Uganda’s accessibility to international audiences through Dubai’s global hub has also supported its positioning as a safari and conference destination for Middle Eastern, European, and Asian travellers. ​

Investing in Uganda’s Future

Beyond connecting destinations, Emirates has played an active role in corporate social responsibility initiatives within Uganda. In 2024, the airline’s “Dubai 7s for Good” programme raised UGX 587 million (USD one hundred fifty-five thousand) to improve educational and sports facilities at North Road Primary School in Mbale. The project included building a new rugby pitch, installing sixteen solar-powered water stations, donating sports gear, and supporting environmental sustainability through community engagement.

These projects highlight the airline’s commitment to local development and its role as a corporate citizen in Uganda, simultaneously strengthening goodwill and building long-term partnerships with local stakeholders. ​

Showcasing Emirates’ Four-Class Boeing 777

Celebrating this milestone, Emirates operated a one-off flight to Entebbe on its four-class refurbished Boeing 777-300ER, part of the airline’s USD five billion cabin retrofit programme. The aircraft features Emirates’ new First Class Suites, Business Class, Premium Economy, and Economy Class, offering passengers in Uganda the latest innovations in in-flight luxury and design.

The static tour at Entebbe International Airport allowed VIP guests, including Uganda’s Minister of Works and Transport, General Edward Katumba Wamala, and Fred Bamwesigye, Director General of the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority, to explore the aircraft’s updated interiors. From fine-dining settings in Premium Economy to the exquisite lie-flat comfort of First Class, the unveiling signified a preview of the next generation of Emirates services that will gradually expand across global destinations, Uganda included. ​

Collaboration Driving Connectivity

As of October 2025, the Dubai-Entebbe corridor is served by three airlines, Emirates, flydubai, and Uganda Airlines, offering a combined total of twenty weekly flights. Emirates remains the only carrier offering premium First Class cabins, while flydubai provides supplementary frequencies via Dubai Al-Maktoum International Airport. Together, these carriers have strengthened Uganda’s air links with the Middle East, facilitating tourism, trade, and diaspora travel.

The route’s growing performance also supports the broader vision of Emirates to enhance regional connectivity between Africa and Asia, leveraging Dubai’s global status as an aviation nexus. The airline continues to invest in Africa, expanding routes and capacity to meet the continent’s rapidly growing demand for air travel and positioning itself as a key enabler of economic exchange. ​

Sustainability and Future Footprint

Emirates’ long-term vision for Uganda extends beyond capacity growth. The airline is investing heavily in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) partnerships, renewable energy projects, and eco-friendly flight operations. As part of a dollar two hundred million investment commitment, Emirates is advancing research into sustainable propulsion and refining technologies, aligning with the UAE’s “Year of Sustainability” initiative. These efforts underscore the carrier’s pledge to balance environmental accountability with progress in global aviation.

With continuing fleet renewal and upgrades, Uganda will soon join other destinations served by Emirates’ next-generation aircraft and enhanced service offerings, ensuring that Entebbe remains an integral part of the airline’s international portfolio. ​",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/emirates-4.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 18:56:30.089728

The teens had objected to a draft plan to use the fuel – the airplane equivalent of bio-diesel – as a tool for implementing the settlement, which requires the state to eliminate all carbon emissions related to transportation in Hawaiʻi by 2045.

The settlement involves all forms of transportation, but aviation is the biggest problem. Interisland air travel produces more than 50% of Hawaiʻi’s transportation emissions, and there is no existing technology to cut that to zero.

The state’s plan follows litigation that started in 2022 when a dozen teenagers represented by Earthjustice and Our Children’s Trust sued the state, citing their right to a clean and healthful environment.

The suit also called for the department to do a better job working to meet the 2045 deadline, which was previously adopted by the Legislature and mandated by statute.

Gov. Josh Green settled with the teens to fanfare in June 2024.

The settlement called for the Department of Transportation to create a plan to meet the 2045 deadline. In a draft plan issued in June, the department identified the bio-jet fuel as the best solution for reducing aviation emissions. The teen plaintiffs objected, saying the bio-jet fuel wasn’t 100% carbon-free and carried other negative environmental impacts. Instead, they said the state should focus on electric airplanes.

But the aviation industry says electric airplane technology is limited and that the best tool is bio-jet fuel, known in industry parlance as sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF. The industry says SAF produces 50%-80% less carbon than regular jet fuel.

Last week, the Department of Transportation issued a final plan citing the use of SAF as its main strategy for aviation. The plan — which is part of an ongoing deliberative process that a panel of young residents will be able to participate in — cites a collaboration of the U.S. departments of transportation, energy and agriculture to produce enough SAF by 2050 to replace all traditional jet fuel used in the U.S. The department also said it will support a tax credit for SAF production in Hawaiʻi.

While the department’s final plan calls for numerous airport and air ground service changes to reduce emissions, such as buying more electric service vehicles and buses, the plan tacitly rejects the teens’ push for electric planes. The plan for electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft is limited to a “high-level market study.”

Ultimately, the study says, the goal of “zero emissions” from transportation by 2045 may be unattainable. It points to aviation, large cargo vessels and trucks as the biggest challenges.

While the plan says the department’s goal is to achieve “absolute zero emissions” as soon as possible, it also says, “There are some sectors of the transportation system that will be harder to decarbonize than others, and thus there is a need for interim solutions that are designed to reduce emissions while zero-emission solutions continue to be innovated and developed.”",https://d1l18ops95qbzp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/2024/08/17124332/240816-dc-Aircraft-6909.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 18:02:08.745032

Singapur führt grüne Ticketsteuer ein – nur eine Gruppe Reisender muss nicht zahlen

Fliegen ist nicht die sauberste Art zu reisen, das dürfte allen klar sein. Um die Flugemissionen einzudämmen, greift in Singapur, einem der Drehkreuze des internationalen Flugverkehrs, bald eine neue Ticketsteuer.

So unterschiedlich können die Entwicklungen sein: Nachdem vor wenigen Monaten Ryanair Schlagzeilen machte, weil die Airline heimlich die Buchungsoption auf Emissionsausgleich gestrichen hatte – niemand habe sie genutzt, so die Begründung –, geht es in Singapur in die andere Richtung.

Am 14. Oktober hat das Parlament des Stadtstaates der Schaffung einer neuen Ticketsteuer zugestimmt, die ab 2026 viele Reisende betreffen wird. Die Einnahmen aus der neuen Steuer sollen direkt in einen Fonds fließen, aus dem der zentrale Einkauf von nachhaltigem Kerosin – Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) – finanziert werden soll.

Durch dieses umweltfreundlichere Kerosin, das aus erneuerbaren Rohstoffen wie Pflanzenölen oder Abfallstoffen hergestellt wird, sollen die CO2-Emissionen im Flugverkehr drastisch gesenkt werden. Singapur will damit nicht nur seine Klimaziele erreichen, sondern auch zu einem Vorreiter in der Luftfahrtbranche werden.

Im kommenden Jahr wird die neue Steuer in Kraft treten. Fluglinien werden dann verpflichtet sein, mindestens ein Prozent SAF zu tanken. Bis 2030 soll der Anteil auf drei bis fünf Prozent steigen.

Singapur mit neuer Ticketsteuer – Transitreisende bleiben verschont

Nur bei einer Gruppe Reisender macht Singapur eine Ausnahme: Transitreisende, die für die nationale Fluggesellschaft Singapore Airlines eine wichtige Einnahmequelle darstellen, sind von der Steuer befreit. Wer in Singapur also nur umsteigt und den Flughafen nicht verlässt, der kann die zusätzlichen Kosten künftig umgehen.

""The Straits Times"", eine Tageszeitung aus Singapur, schlüsselt auf, wie die Steuer je nach Flugdistanz gestaffelt werden soll. Die Angaben gehen demnach auf die Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) zurück:

Der Singapore Changi Airport (SIN) fungiert als globales Drehkreuz zwischen Asien, Australien, Europa, dem Nahen Osten und Nordamerika. Er wurde mehrfach als ""bester Flughafen der Welt"" ausgezeichnet und fertigte im vergangenen Jahr rund 68 Millionen Passagiere und circa 366.000 Starts und Landungen ab. In Bezug auf Passagiervolumen liegt er auf dem vierten Platz der internationalen Flughäfen.","https://www.watson.de/imgdb/1291/Z1200,675/1052507181874222",N,,2025-10-18 19:57:06.837373

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.","A new American airline is taking shape with an ambitious plan to bridge the gap between private jet exclusivity and first-class commercial travel.

Magnifica Air, a Florida-based startup, officially unveiled its concept at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas last week, and if all goes according to plan, the carrier could begin flying passengers by late 2027.

The company’s mission is simple yet bold: to make private-jet-style travel accessible to a wider audience, offering a high-end, all-first-class experience at a fraction of the charter price. Led by CEO Wade Black, Magnifica Air will operate as a Part 121 scheduled carrier and aims to deliver what Black calls “luxury travel that is seamless, personal, and unforgettable.”

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Black. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Luxury Air Travel: Redefining Your Journey

Launch Plans and Fleet Details

Magnifica Air plans to launch with a fleet of six Airbus aircraft, including four A220-300s and two A321neos. The aircraft are being leased through long-term agreements with Air Lease Corporation (ALC) and Azorra, with deliveries expected to begin in early 2027.

The jets will be sent to Comlux—a Swiss completion specialist known for its work on VIP and head-of-state aircraft—for luxury cabin conversions. These modifications will include hand-crafted seating, adaptive lighting, gourmet dining, and lie-flat first-class suites.

The A220s will feature around 54 lay-flat seats and two private suites, while the A321neos will have 44–46 seats, including four private suites and a rear in-flight lounge. There will be no overhead bins, giving the cabins a spacious, minimalist look more reminiscent of a Gulfstream than a traditional airliner.

“Air Lease is pleased to lease these new Airbus A220s and A321neos to Magnifica Air and be the first to provide brand-new aircraft to the airline,” said David Beker, Executive Vice President of Air Lease Corporation. “Magnifica plans to use them to redefine luxury air travel by making the journey on our aircraft a destination itself.”

The company’s partnership with Azorra also includes the purchase of two ex-EgyptAir A220s. The first will arrive at Comlux’s Indianapolis facility in December 2025 for an 18-month fit-out process, followed by the second in early 2027. Both types will use Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engines, and while Black acknowledged the previous reliability issues that led EgyptAir to retire the type, he added that the Azorra collaboration “puts us in pretty good shape.”

A Focus on Experience, Personalization, and Wellness

Magnifica’s model borrows elements from hybrid private-commercial aviation providers like JSX and Aero, but aims for a more upscale, personalized approach. Travelers will be picked up by black car service at home, greeted by name, and whisked directly to private terminals. A white-glove concierge will take luggage, and TSA-approved screening will be handled privately.

Guests will arrive just 30 minutes before departure, enjoy curated dining and wellness experiences in private lounges, and board via sprinter van or private ramp walk.

Once onboard, technology will drive personalization. Every guest’s preferences, from favorite meals and seat temperature to lighting and entertainment, will be pre-loaded into the system. Magnifica calls this the “curated journey,” where every touchpoint feels familiar and comfortable.

Upon arrival, baggage will be hand-delivered within 10–15 minutes, chauffeurs will be waiting curbside, and post-flight services will include lounge refresh opportunities and concierge follow-ups.

The airline will also debut “The Seven Club”, a membership-based loyalty program featuring Family and Corporate tiers. Members can choose among four levels—Airspace D, C, B, and A—and enjoy guaranteed fixed pricing, exclusive events, and full-service concierge access.

Sustainability as a Founding Principle

Sustainability is deeply embedded in Magnifica Air’s design philosophy. The airline will be carbon-neutral from day one, integrating over seven million gallons of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into its annual operations. It plans to start operations with a 50 percent SAF blend and achieve 100 percent SAF usage by 2030.

Beyond fuel, Magnifica will incorporate solar-powered lounges, a carbon offset program, and eventually hybrid-electric aircraft as part of its long-term fleet evolution.

“We don’t think of wellness or sustainability as add-ons,” said Black. “They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.”

The company will also introduce the world’s first commercial-scale surface purification system and a cabin air humidification system designed to help passengers feel more rested and refreshed after a flight.

Routes, Growth, and the Road Ahead

Magnifica Air expects to obtain its FAA Part 121 certificate by late 2026 and become fully operational by the third quarter of 2027. Initial routes will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Jose, with seasonal service to Napa Valley and, eventually, the Caribbean.

Pricing will reflect the exclusivity. A one-way ticket is expected to cost about twice that of a first-class fare, or roughly $20,000 to $25,000, according to Black. The airline will initially operate six to seven daily departures and expects to grow its fleet to 25 aircraft within four years.

Magnifica Air is backed by $150 million in initial capital from CIG Companies, its renewable energy-focused parent firm, and is currently in talks with additional investor groups.

For now, Magnifica plans to focus on intra-US travel.

“The temptation to fly internationally first provides additional complexity,” Black explained. “We will start domestically, build our program here, and grow from there.”

Magnifica’s long-term vision includes 50 aircraft and a mix of scheduled flights, VIP charters, and curated experience trips tied to major cultural and sporting events like Art Basel and Formula 1.

With predictive safety analytics, a “Collaborative Just Culture” for employees, and one spare aircraft for every four in service, Black says the airline is “designed for resilience and consistency.”

And while others have tried to launch luxury carriers before, he believes Magnifica Air’s foundation is stronger. “Previous entrants weren’t properly capitalized,” he said. “We are.”

Magnifica Air Will Give the Ultra-Premium Segment a Brand New Way to Fly

Magnifica Air is positioning itself as a hybrid between Gulfstream comfort and Delta reliability, blending high-touch hospitality with large-aircraft economics. Its promise is not just to move passengers from city to city, but to make the journey itself the destination.

In that sense, Magnifica Air draws obvious comparisons to JSX, another US operator that has carved out a niche with private-terminal service and crowd-free flying. But while JSX uses converted Embraer regional jets seating 30 passengers, Magnifica is taking a different route by using larger Airbus A220s and A321neos with spacious cabins that allow for lie-flat seating, private suites, and dedicated lounges on board.

CEO Wade Black believes this difference in scale and design will set Magnifica apart. “I’ve always felt like smaller regional jets weren’t the right platform for what we’re trying to do,” he said during a press briefing at the 2025 NBAA-BACE Convention in Las Vegas. “Space is part of the experience. You can’t deliver true luxury in a cabin that feels tight.”

By marrying the comfort and personalization of private aviation with the operational scope of a major airline, Magnifica Air aims to occupy a new space in the US market: one that sits above first class but below private charter, appealing to travelers who value privacy, efficiency, and indulgence in equal measure.

You can follow the carrier’s journey to launch via the Magnifica Air website.

If all goes to plan, Magnifica Air could become what JSX pioneered on a smaller scale, a new class of air travel for those who believe flying should still feel special.

The split scimitar is designed with an aerodynamically shaped cap, with a ventral strake that extends downwards.
Aeromexico also has the Split Scimitar winglets on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.
The carrier program of work to install the split scimitar winglet at Qantas is expected to run through until some stage in 2026.
Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?","One of the world's most iconic carriers, Delta Air Lines, continues to invest in its aircraft capabilities and performance. The Atlanta-based carrier favors Split Scimitar Wingletson its Boeing 737-800 and 737-900ER airplanes. This is through a partnership with Avition Partners Boeing (also known as APB), which develops an upgrade to the current APB ubiquitous Blended Winglet.

The move is expected to improve not only overall fuel efficiency but also deliver savings in the overall consumption of aviation jet fuel and improve the carriers' operational efficiency. Delta already operates one of the largest airline fleets in the world and has an extensive network of domestic and international flights from its various US hubs.

APB Winglet Products At Delta

The decision to add Split Scimitar Winglets to the carrier's 737 family of aircraft comes at a time when the airline had already installed the APB winglet products on a range of its current fleet, albeit the ubiquitous Blended Winglets. These are currently flying on the Boeing 737-800, 737-900ER, 757-200, 757-300, and Boeing 767-300ER.

Currently, the ubiquitous Blended Winglets are a widespread wingtip device, which is common across most modern aircraft. These winglets support a smooth transition across the wing while reducing drag. This provides improved fuel efficiency and, as a result, adds additional range for the aircraft.

As a comparison, Split Scimitar Winglets feature both an upward and downward pointing fin, which creates a weaker vortex on the wing tip, resulting in improved fuel efficiency, reduced drag, and, as a result, a significant reduction in the overall carbon emissions of each flight.

Ubiquitous Blended Winglets

These are designed with one upward fin and are a common sight on popular aircraft around the world, including the Boeing 737, 757, and 767. The design is smooth and features curved extensions that blend right onto the wing's edge. These have been engineered to reduce drag by reducing the formation of the airplane's wingtip vortices. These vortices are swirling air masses that create aircraft drag.

The smooth design allows a more aerodynamic aircraft, which has been shown to increase the operating aircraft's fuel efficiency, which, as a collective result, will save airlines billions of dollars in annual operating costs. Not only will they save airlines in their pocket, but also ensure the plane's longitudinal and directional stability, which allows the aircraft to handle smoother landings, especially in wild weather such as high winds.

The Ubiquitous Blended Winglets were first introduced in the early 2000s and have been installed and adopted on aircraft around the world. Developed by Aviation Partners, the manufacturer first installed these onto the 737, and subsequently, they are now a feature on new aircraft at the assembly line, but can also be retrofitted onto existing aircraft.

Split Scimitar Winglets

First certified in 2014, Aviation Partners' joint venture with Boeing allowed a blended winglet design, which was first offered on the 737NG. Its success led to similar designs being developed for the 757 and 767. The split scimitar is designed with an aerodynamically shaped cap, with a ventral strake that extends downwards. This is proven to save more fuel, add additional range, and even increase in overall payload.

The dual-blade design is unlike normal standard winglets, given its upward and downward blades that optimize airflow. The design allows the plane to create a weaker vortex, lowering the overall drag of the airplane. This has resulted in increased fuel savings, as planes are shown to lower fuel burn by 1.6% to 2.2% per aircraft. This enhanced performance stimulates fuel savings for airlines, given their increased payload and better operational performance.

Many of the world's largest airlines have already adopted these winglet designs, with Europe's largest budget carrier, Ryanair, being one of the biggest adopters of the split scimitar winglet. Other airlines, such as United Airlines and Qantas, have also led to the retrofit of these on existing aircraft, while accepting new deliveries of planes with these already installed. Aeromexico also has the Split Scimitar winglets on its Boeing 737-800 fleet.

Other Carriers' Adoption Of The Split Scimitar Winglet

United Airlines invested in the split scimitar winglet due to the attraction of increased fuel efficiency, which would, as a result, mean lower operational costs. The design provides around 2% of fuel savings, and is fully implemented across the carrier's 737, 757, and 767 fleet. The lower emissions mean that these planes are now more fuel-efficient, improving the airline's carbon footprint.

Qantas Airways, the flag carrier of Australia, also opted for the split scimitar in a bid to improve its fuel burn across its 737-800 aircraft fleet. The significant savings expected from these will lead to a significant annual fuel saving for the airline's balance sheet. The carrier program of work to install the split scimitar winglet at Qantas is expected to run through until some stage in 2026.

This retrofit at Qantas will see the fleet of its narrowbody Boeing 737s have its winglets gradually replaced, cementing these popular aircraft into the next decade of operations. The red-tailed airline is fitting the winglets on all 23 of its Boeing 737-800s. These aircraft are deployed on domestic routes, while also providing capacity on short-haul international services such as to New Zealand, Indonesia, and other South Pacific nations.

Why Will Split Scimitar Winglets Work For Delta?

Atlanta-based Delta is investing in the development and installation of split scimitar winglets, in a bid to not only help improve the fuel efficiency of its Boeing 737 aircraft, but also lower the airline's carbon footprint. These winglets achieve improved operational efficiency due to their design being reshaped in the traditional blended design. Reduction in drag is a big factor for airlines being able to improve operational handling, as high-pressure air spills onto the lower pressure of the tip.

This creates vortices that sap energy from the jet, but the downward strakes weaken these vortices, so, compared to blended winglets, this design is far superior. With Delta looking to improve its efficiency, this also supports its goal of reducing its carbon emissions, reminding the industry that it remains committed to finding ways to develop cleaner, greener ways to fly. Delta has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and is striving to do so through the initiatives detailed below.

The maximized efficiency produces long-haul savings, with the airplanes being able to operate longer flights, which is why we are now seeing the carrier introduce the 737-900ER and 737-800 on longer services. Given that fuel is a major operating cost for airlines, these improvements result in billions of dollars shaved off carriers' yearly fuel bill.

What's Next?

While Delta partnered with Aviation Partners in 2015, the latest move to acquire additional APB winglet products is evident in the carrier's dedication to ensuring sustainable air travel. There is a solid environmental argument for this investment, with the winglets reducing overall fuel consumption on any aircraft that has the split scimitar or even blended winglet fitted. Delta Air Lines is one of the world's largest airlines and one of America's 'Big Three' carriers.

The new partnership will see benefits that not only trickle to the airline's bottom line, but also to the passengers' tickets. Understanding the economics of fuel reduction and optimized performance should result in lower operating costs for the airline, meaning cheaper airfares for travelers.

The split scimitar winglet will see Delta reduce its overall per passenger emission while improving the overall onboard experience, not just in feel-good factor, but also lower the effects of strong jet streams and air vortices that can affect the enjoyment of the flight, but also reduce the amount of carbon emissions that the aircraft would have once produced when carrying more drag.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/blended-winglets-are-great-but-delta-air-lines-thinks-these-winglets-are-better.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 14:56:36.829724

Ini adalah langkah teknologi dan lingkungan yang cukup berani di tengah upaya global pengurangan emisi.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) adalah bahan bakar pesawat yang dibuat dari sumber non-fosil seperti :

minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil),

limbah pertanian,

lemak hewan,

biomassa, atau bahkan

karbon daur ulang dari atmosfer (melalui teknologi carbon capture).

Berbeda dari avtur konvensional yang berasal dari minyak bumi, SAF dapat mengurangi emisi karbon hingga 80% selama siklus hidupnya, tergantung pada bahan baku dan proses produksinya.

Detail Informasi :

Pertamina, perusahaan energi milik negara, sudah mulai memproduksi SAF dari minyak goreng bekas (used cooking oil/UCO) dan merencanakan konversi dua kilang agar kapasitas produksinya naik.

Pemerintah menyusun regulasi untuk implementasi awal 1% SAF pada 2026, dengan target peningkatan bertahap menjadi hingga 5% pada 2035.

Potensi produksi UCO di Indonesia cukup besar: diperkirakan 3-4 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Mengapa Ini Penting :

Teknologi & Lingkungan: Penggunaan SAF merupakan integrasi teknologi energi baru dan pengurangan emisi untuk sektor penerbangan yang selama ini sulit dikurangi.

Industri dan Produksi Lokal: Pemanfaatan UCO sebagai bahan baku membuka peluang ekonomi baru, meningkatkan nilai tambah limbah, serta memperkuat rantai industri domestik.

Posisi Indonesia di Kancah Global: Langkah ini menunjukkan kesiapan Indonesia untuk masuk dalam arus teknologi energi bersih dan menjadi bagian dari solusi global perubahan iklim.

Kesiapan Infrastruktur & Regulasi: Regulasi baru dan konversi kilang menunjukkan bahwa aspek teknologi dan kebijakan sedang digarap bersamaan — bukan hanya janji tapi juga tindakan.

Tantangan dan Catatan :

Menerapkan SAF tinggi-teknologi masih menghadapi kendala seperti harga produksi, efisiensi proses, dan regulasi yang siap pakai.

Meski potensi UCO besar, logistik pengumpulan, pengolahan, dan standar mutu SAF harus dijaga agar kualitasnya layak untuk penerbangan.

Industri penerbangan dan maskapai harus bersiap dengan infrastruktur baru (misalnya, penyimpanan, distribusi SAF) dan perubahan operasional.

Kenaikan dari 1% ke target 5% hingga 2035 menunjukkan bahwa ini adalah perjalanan panjang, bukan solusi instan.

Langkah untuk menerapkan 1% SAF pada 2026 adalah langkah teknologi strategis yang menggabungkan inovasi energi, lingkungan, dan industri. Meski masih banyak tantangan, ini memberi sinyal bahwa Indonesia tidak hanya menjadi pengguna teknologi, tetapi juga bisa menjadi pionir di kawasan untuk penerapan teknologi “bersih” di sektor penerbangan.(FA)",https://ifakta.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_2648.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 15:56:47.688281

Tuduhan yang datang dari Uni Eropa itu umumnya tidak berdasarkan fakta di lapangan. Bahkan juga idak berdasar sebuah kajian ilmiah yang bisa dipertanggung jawabkan.

Petrus juga menjelaskan bahwa kelapa sawit ttelah menerapkan sustainability. Hal itu dibuktikan di salahsau pekebunan kelapa sawit di Kalimantan Tengah Dimana di daerah areal Perkebunan kelapa sawit tetrdapat ribuan hetar areal hutan dan pemukiman masyarakat.

“Hal ini artinya antara sawit, hutan dan Masyarakat bisa hidup berdampingan.

The deal follows an earlier order for 30 A350s placed in April 2024, effectively doubling the airline’s total wide-body backlog to 60 aircraft.

The agreement converts a Memorandum of Understanding signed earlier this year into a confirmed purchase. With this, IndiGo becomes one of the largest future A350 operators in Asia, positioning itself for an international expansion that goes far beyond its familiar regional routes.

A Clear Shift Beyond Domestic

For nearly two decades, IndiGo built its success on the strength of short-haul and domestic efficiency. Its fleet of over 370 Airbus A320neo and A321neo aircraft has made it one of the world’s largest single-aisle operators. But this latest order shows that the airline is no longer content being only a regional carrier.

The A350-900, with its long range and efficiency, gives IndiGo the capability to fly nonstop to Europe, Australia, and even North America, all key future markets as India’s outbound travel demand continues to rise. According to Airbus, the aircraft’s advanced aerodynamics and next-generation engines allow a 25% reduction in fuel burn and CO₂ emissions compared to previous-generation wide-bodies.

Words from the Top

Speaking about the deal, IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers said that finalizing this additional order is “a strong confirmation of our belief in India’s aviation potential.” He described that “converting the MoU into a firm order reflects confidence in the future of Indian aviation and strengthens its long-haul strategy.”

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Airbus Executive Vice President of Sales for Commercial Aircraft, called the announcement “a testament to IndiGo’s confidence in the A350 platform.” He highlighted how the aircraft’s efficiency and comfort make it a perfect fit for the airline’s upcoming long-haul phase.

Backstory

IndiGo first made headlines in April 2024 when it placed its initial order of 30 A350-900s, marking its first step into the wide-body market. Those aircraft are due for delivery beginning mid-2027, intended to launch the carrier’s first direct long-haul routes.

The airline’s history with Airbus goes back to its founding in 2006, when it placed a record order for 100 A320s even before operating its first flight. It continued its massive single-aisle expansion with a 250-aircraft order in 2015 and a 500-aircraft deal in 2023, which remains the largest single aircraft order in aviation history.

Now, with the A350 program, 6E is clearly preparing for a new phase. The combination of A321XLRs and A350-900s will give it both medium and long-range flexibility to reach new destinations across continents.

The Bigger Picture for India’s Aviation

India’s aviation market is growing faster than almost any other in the world. In 2024 alone, more than 160 million domestic passengers were recorded, while international traffic rose sharply as more Indians began traveling abroad for business and leisure.

This latest order ties in well with the government’s “Vision 2047” plan that aims to position India as a major global aviation hub. With the A350s, 6E can finally take on the long-haul game — going head-to-head with the big Middle Eastern players that have long owned the India–Europe and India–US corridors.

For Airbus, India has turned into a key pillar in its global strategy. The planemaker has been steadily pumping investments into the country’s aviation ecosystem, from local suppliers to training centers and pilot development programs, many of which play straight into IndiGo’s long-term growth story.

Aircraft Details & Sustainability Goals

The Airbus A350-900 features a typical two-class layout seating between 300 and 350 passengers. It’s equipped with Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines—among the world’s most efficient large turbofans—and has a range of around 8,000 nautical miles.

The aircraft is also fully certified to operate on up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) today, with ongoing efforts toward 100% SAF capability by 2030. IndiGo, like other global carriers, has pledged to gradually increase its SAF usage over the coming decade.

While the airline hasn’t yet disclosed its cabin configuration or branding strategy for the A350 fleet, industry speculation points toward a full-service long-haul division under the IndiGo umbrella — possibly with premium seating layouts unlike its all-economy narrow-body jets.

Looking Ahead

The first of IndiGo’s A350-900s is expected to enter service in 2027, marking the airline’s official step into the wide-body space.

While Airbus will deliver the remaining aircraft gradually over the coming years, 6E hasn’t yet announced its first long-haul destinations. Many in the industry expect them to start by exploring routes into Europe and East Asia, with further expansion to North America possible as the fleet and infrastructure mature.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65c26eeea7cdaa706d97a75c/68f39798cd5ea2cef1920279_IndiGo%20Orders%2030%20A350-900s.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:18.248530

He emphasized that green buildings and green transport are key pillars in Vietnam’s green economic growth strategy. Beyond reducing emissions and saving resources, they also foster technological innovation, improve living standards, and enhance national competitiveness.

In both 2024 and 2025, Vietnam saw strong growth in the number of certified green buildings and eco-friendly vehicles.

By the end of Q3 2025, the country had around 600 certified green buildings, totaling nearly 17 million square meters of floor space.

In transportation, Vietnam recorded 183,240 electric cars and 974 electric buses on the road.

Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City lead the nation with more than 38,400 electric cars each. The two cities also operate 317 and 507 electric buses respectively.

Other provinces such as Da Nang, Hai Phong, Thanh Hoa, and Khanh Hoa are also witnessing rapid growth, contributing to Vietnam’s green transition and sustainable development goals.

Transport sector must pivot to electric and biofuel sources

Discussing emission-reduction potential in the transport sector, Le Van Dat, Deputy Director of the Strategy and Personnel Training Academy (under the Ministry of Construction), noted that between 2014 and 2023, road transport accounted for over 85% of Vietnam’s total passenger and freight volume.

The country currently has over 7 million cars and nearly 78 million motorbikes, along with hundreds of thousands of vessels in maritime, inland waterway, and aviation sectors.

The transport industry consumes over 95% of its energy from fossil fuels and emits an estimated 45.8 million tons of CO₂ annually-second only to the industrial sector.

Under Vietnam’s third Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC 3.0), the country aims to replace traditional fuels in road transport with biofuels and electricity by 2030.

For the rail sector, electric trains are being implemented in urban areas from 2019 to 2025, while hydrogen is expected to be adopted by 2040. By 2050, diesel, electric, and hydrogen-powered locomotives are projected to account for 40%, 10%, and 50% of the total fleet respectively.

In inland waterway transport, electricity and hydrogen are expected to be introduced starting in 2035.

For aviation, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) will begin to be used from 2035, expected to supply around 10% of the sector’s total energy demand.

Vietnam must build a full green investment ecosystem

In the construction materials sector, Nguyen Thi Tam, Director of the Center for Equipment, Environment and Labor Safety (under the Institute of Building Materials), said the goal by 2030 is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 15.03%, equivalent to 23.2 million tons of CO₂.

With international support, emissions could be cut by up to 20.06%, or 30.97 million tons of CO₂.

To achieve this, the sector is adopting new technologies, utilizing waste in production, optimizing processes, and researching carbon capture innovations.

In parallel, institutional and policy tools are being developed-such as low-emission standards, carbon credit mechanisms, and the establishment of a carbon market.

Ta Duc Binh, representative of the Institute of Strategy and Policy for Agriculture and Environment (under the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment), warned that climate change is progressing at an alarming rate, requiring decisive action from policymakers and investors.

According to the World Bank, Vietnam will need around 368 billion USD by 2040 to achieve net-zero emissions.

This presents a major challenge in mobilizing capital, advancing technology, developing green infrastructure, and training a skilled workforce.

“Vietnam must rapidly complete a comprehensive green investment ecosystem-from legal frameworks and incentives to transparent monitoring systems-to lay the foundation for a prosperous and sustainable future,” Binh emphasized.",https://static-images.vnncdn.net/vps_images_publish/000001/00000Q/2025/10/17/vietnam-reaches-183000-electric-cars-as-ev-adoption-surges-9cd86ce9685549edbdb4aefde4ab1d1d-2322.jpg?width=0&s=fzqAVxojBWLsMtdmgoA8LA,N,,2025-10-18 09:01:12.354753

The success of Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, when the government launched initiatives to reduce dependence on imported oil.
However, Brazil’s biofuel industry continues to face certain challenges.
These emerging biofuels represent the next frontier of Brazil’s energy strategy and are expected to play a critical role in achieving net-zero goals.
The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision.","Brazil has emerged as a global leader in sustainable biofuels, setting an example for countries working to decarbonize their energy systems while supporting economic growth and social development. The country’s long-standing commitment to renewable energy is rooted in decades of consistent government policies, innovation, and collaboration between the public and private sectors. Brazil’s experience, particularly with ethanol made from sugarcane and biodiesel produced from soybeans, provides valuable lessons for the world on how to build a successful and sustainable bioenergy sector.

The success of Brazil’s biofuel journey began in the 1970s, when the government launched initiatives to reduce dependence on imported oil. Over time, this evolved into a well-structured system that includes the RenovaBio program and the “Fuel of the Future Law.” These legislative frameworks have encouraged the widespread use of biofuels through financial incentives, clear regulations, and mandatory blending targets. As a result, Brazil has managed to significantly lower its carbon emissions and increase its energy security while strengthening the agricultural economy. The widespread use of flexible-fuel vehicles, which can run on either pure ethanol or a gasoline-ethanol blend, has been one of the most visible signs of success. This approach has provided consumers with affordable, low-carbon mobility options while promoting domestic renewable energy.

Brazil’s model shows how thoughtful policies can de-risk investments and create a stable business environment. Clear and consistent rules have encouraged cooperation between the government, private investors, and research institutions. This collaboration has driven innovation, leading to improvements in both production efficiency and environmental sustainability. Farmers, fuel producers, and vehicle manufacturers all play a role in this integrated system, ensuring that biofuels contribute meaningfully to national development goals.

However, Brazil’s biofuel industry continues to face certain challenges. One of the key concerns is managing land use effectively. The expansion of biofuel production must not come at the expense of food security or lead to deforestation and habitat loss. Policymakers and industry leaders must ensure that agricultural practices remain sustainable and that environmental safeguards are in place to protect sensitive ecosystems. Additionally, global fluctuations in fossil fuel prices can affect the competitiveness of biofuels. Maintaining policy stability and long-term planning is crucial to sustain investor confidence and ensure continuous progress in the sector.

Despite these challenges, Brazil is now focusing on the next generation of biofuels that promise even greater environmental and economic benefits. The country is investing in advanced technologies such as second-generation (2G) ethanol, which is produced using sugarcane straw and bagasse—agricultural residues that would otherwise go to waste. This approach not only improves resource efficiency but also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions further. Another area of innovation is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which aims to decarbonize the aviation industry, one of the hardest sectors to electrify. These emerging biofuels represent the next frontier of Brazil’s energy strategy and are expected to play a critical role in achieving net-zero goals.

The broader lesson from Brazil’s experience is the importance of global cooperation. As countries around the world transition toward cleaner energy systems, biofuels can make a substantial contribution. Experts estimate that sustainable fuels could provide at least 20% of the world’s total energy consumption by 2050 if countries adopt supportive policies and share best practices. Brazil’s achievements demonstrate that large-scale adoption of biofuels is possible when clear policies, technological innovation, and public-private partnerships align toward common goals.

The story of Brazil’s biofuel journey is one of persistence, innovation, and vision. It shows that renewable energy can power both economic and environmental progress. By building strong sustainability standards and encouraging collaboration across nations, the global community can follow Brazil’s lead in turning climate ambition into tangible results. Brazil’s experience continues to inspire policymakers worldwide to view bioenergy not just as an alternative fuel source, but as a cornerstone of a sustainable and inclusive energy future.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/pexels-photo-923953.jpeg,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:32.379825

That do-it-yourself energy moment is real enough to spark curiosity. The bigger story, though, lives in commercial plants, refinery-ready feedstocks, and airline and shipping buyers that are already purchasing fuels made from waste carbon.

The result is a practical pathway from post-consumer plastics and even captured CO₂ to usable fuels and petrochemical feedstocks that meet industry specifications. The science behind sunlight-driven microwave-assisted pyrolysis is well documented, and it provides a friendly on-ramp to explain the mature routes the industry is scaling today.

Before we dive into the four routes that already work, you will see two patterns. First, large buyers care about specifications and reliability. Second, policy definitions decide who can claim recycling content and who earns fuel credits. Together, those two forces explain why some projects scale quickly while others stay in the lab.

Seven Fast Facts Proving Plastic-to-Fuel is Already Real

Hydrothermal plants are scaling now: Mura Technology announced a 50,000-ton-per-year Hydro-PRT® facility on Jurong Island, Singapore, positioned to process more than 60,000 tonnes of plastic waste annually as it expands.

Electrified cracking just hit a milestone: Coolbrook cracked 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil directly to ethylene and propylene at a pilot scale, while maintaining stable operation.

Conditioning trains make waste oils “cracker-ready”: Technip Energies commercialized Pure.rOil purification to remove contaminants and align boiling ranges for steam crackers.

CO₂-to-fuel is already commercial: The Kassø e-methanol plant in Denmark was inaugurated May 13, 2025, at 42,000 tonnes per year, with offtake tied to deep-sea shipping.

Aviation buyers are investing: United Airlines invested in Twelve, which produces power-to-liquid E-Jet fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity.

CO₂-to-methanol deployments span multiple sites: Carbon Recycling International lists commercial and licensed projects that convert CO₂ into methanol at an industrial scale.

Frontier research is moving quickly: Recent reviews outline microwave-assisted pyrolysis fundamentals and photoreforming routes that turn plastics into hydrogen and valuable chemicals using sunlight.

Fast-conversion case studies show plastic waste turned into jet fuel in under an hour, scalable routes for plastic waste turned into hydrogen, and a bench-scale plastic waste fuel reactor that liquefies mixed streams into usable fractions.

Four Real Pathways that Already Work

Hydrothermal Conversion to Drop-In Hydrocarbons

How it Works

Hydrothermal processes expose plastics to high-temperature, high-pressure water. The supercritical water breaks long polymer chains into shorter hydrocarbons that can be refined into petrochemical feedstocks or fuel cuts. This approach tolerates mixed streams better than many catalytic routes and produces liquids that integrate into existing infrastructure.

Where it is Scaling

Mura’s Hydro-PRT plants showcase the model: site near industrial hubs, convert hard-to-recycle streams, and output stabilized liquids for downstream units. The Jurong Island project in Singapore is the latest expansion, sized at 50,000 tonnes per year with growth plans beyond 60,000 tonnes.

What Buyers Want

Refiners and petrochemical players want stable composition, tight impurity control, and predictable boiling ranges. Hydrothermal liquids can be conditioned to meet those needs, which is why you see projects co-located with crackers and refineries. For background on policy definitions that affect marketing claims, see our explainer on mass-balance rules in the European Union and the evolving U.S. regulatory posture on waste units.

Systems thinking spans industrial capacity and cleanup, from the UK’s biggest recycling plant processing hard-to-sort feedstocks to the Manta Ocean-Cleaning Yacht generating onboard energy from recovered debris.

Pyrolysis Oil to Steam Crackers with Electrified Cracking

How it Works

Thermal pyrolysis converts mixed plastics into a liquid commonly called pyrolysis oil. To feed that oil to a steam cracker that makes ethylene and propylene, operators must remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and fine solids, and in some cases trim the boiling range. Commercial purification trains now exist to perform that conditioning step.

Industrial Proof

Conditioning Is Productized: Technip Energies markets Pure.rOil, a purification platform that treats a wide range of pyrolysis oils so they can run in liquid-feed steam crackers.

Electrified Cracking Removes the Dilution Crutch: Coolbrook demonstrated cracking 100 percent plastic-waste pyrolysis oil in its RotoDynamic Reactor, delivering ethylene and propylene with stable coking behavior. That simplifies traceability and makes circular content easier to track.

Why it Matters

When cracker-grade specifications are met, pyrolysis oil can become a circular feedstock for new plastics, not just a combustion fuel. Small-scale energy use is already practical, with melting plastic waste into fuel to heat homes complementing a modular plastic waste fuel reactor that upgrades packaging into liquid fuel cuts.

Plastic-to-Hydrogen when Gas Beats Liquids

How it Works

There are multiple routes to hydrogen from plastics, including gasification with steam reforming, catalytic pyrolysis with in-situ reforming, and advanced processes that co-reform plastic-derived gases. These systems are useful when feedstocks are highly contaminated, when siting favors distributed units, or when hydrogen credits and local demand improve project economics.

Recent Signals

A growing body of 2025 literature consolidates catalysts, yields, and integration options for plastic-to-hydrogen, and field trials continue to refine performance on mixed streams. Those reviews provide mechanism diagrams and techno-economic guardrails you can cite in procurement and policy conversations.

Where it Fits

Hydrogen routes can be attractive near heavy transport corridors or industrial clusters that already consume hydrogen. Hydrogen pathways are maturing, with plastic waste into hydrogen detailing catalytic routes, and the world’s first waste plastic hydrogen plant illustrating how contaminated streams become clean H₂.

Sunlight and Electrons: The Frontier Moving from Lab to Pilot

Photoreforming With Sunlight

Researchers are rapidly improving catalysts that use sunlight and water to convert plastics into hydrogen and platform chemicals like formate and acetate in a process more commonly known as sunlight-driven microwave pyrolysis. These systems operate at low temperatures and pair naturally with renewable power. Recent reviews summarize pretreatment steps, reaction mechanisms, and stability challenges.

Electro-Routes You Should Watch

Electrified approaches, including joule-heated or plasma-assisted reforming, are being explored to co-convert plastics and CO₂ into syngas precursors for fuels. While these methods remain pre-commercial, they provide an important bridge between low-value waste streams and high-value molecules that heavy industry can use.

Who Buys, Why the Market is Growing, and What Decides the Winning Route

Selecting the right plastic-to-fuel pathway starts with knowing who will buy the output of the green e-fuels revolution and why. Marine carriers seek e-methanol that slots into port logistics, airlines fund power-to-liquid SAF to meet blend and safety rules, and petrochemicals demand cracker-grade liquids for circular polymers. With buyers defined, feedstock quality, energy prices, and policy incentives determine which technology wins in a given region, from plastic-to-hydrogen near industrial hubs to pyrolysis-to-cracker routes inside petrochemical clusters.

Shipping’s E-Methanol Momentum

Deep-sea shipping needs dense liquid fuels that move through existing logistics while meeting tougher emissions targets, which is why e-methanol is gaining traction. Denmark’s Kassø facility began commercial operations on May 13, 2025, supplying certified e-methanol produced from renewable power and captured CO₂. Early bunkering for vessels such as Laura Maersk signals real demand rather than pilot-only activity, and port infrastructure is scaling to handle methanol alongside conventional marine fuels.

What Bunkering Looks Like in Practice

At Kassø, solar-powered electrolysis pairs with biogenic CO₂ capture to synthesize methanol that is stored on site and transferred via standard bunkering hoses to container ships. Transparency on inputs and certification enables shipowners to count emissions reductions toward fleet targets, turning e-methanol into a practical decarbonization lever for ocean freight.

Aviation’s Power-to-Liquid Moves

Airlines operate under strict safety and energy-density constraints, so they are investing in power-to-liquid suppliers that make sustainable aviation fuel from CO₂ and water using renewable electricity. Investments like United Airlines backing Twelve demonstrate how carriers secure future supply, diversify beyond bio-based SAF, and push producers toward fuel specs that fit existing engines and airport fueling systems.

Jet-range molecules are achievable quickly, as plastic waste into jet fuel methods demonstrate rapid deconstruction kinetics and plastic waste fuel reactors document controllable distillation curves for circular polymer or fuel applications.

Petrochemicals Seek Circular Feed

When the objective is to make new plastics instead of combusting fuels, petrochemical buyers require cracker-grade liquids derived from waste plastics. This depends on two industrial capabilities. First, commercial oil-conditioning trains remove chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and heavy tails so the liquid meets steam-cracker requirements. Second, electrified steam-cracking pilots have shown that waste-plastic pyrolysis oil can be processed without relying on fossil diluents, which improves traceability for circular content and simplifies accounting for recycled material.

Carbon-To-Chemicals is Now a Market

Beyond fuels, carbon utilization is producing commodity chemicals. Commercial and licensed CO₂-to-methanol projects already convert point-source CO₂ into a platform molecule used in fuels and chemical manufacturing. Parallel progress in polymers shows how carbon captured from industry can reappear as polypropylene-grade outputs, tightening the loop between emissions and everyday materials.

Why Household and Enterprise Solutions Align

Decentralized systems like biodigesters cut methane at the home or community level, while energy-efficient aviation facilities reduce operational footprints across complex logistics. Both ends of the spectrum point to the same conclusion. Waste carbon becomes valuable when the conversion route fits local feedstocks, the offtake is real, and the policy framework rewards the environmental attributes that markets are willing to buy.

Regulatory Reality Check: The Rules that Pick Winners

Europe’s Mass-Balance Accounting Shapes What Counts

The European Commission launched a 2025 consultation to define how chemically recycled content in single-use plastic beverage bottles should be calculated through mass balance. This is a pivotal definition. If fuel use is excluded from recycled-content claims for bottles, projects will often favor routes that produce cracker-grade liquids for polymer loops rather than fuels. The Commission’s summary explains the accounting intent and the push for a level playing field across technologies. Review the official notice and industry briefs for the current wording and timing.

What that Means for Investors

If your revenue model depends on “recycled content” claims, mass-balance rules determine whether a given output stream qualifies. That is why companies pursuing pyrolysis-to-cracker and hydrothermal liquids often colocate with existing petrochemical assets in Europe. A conservative reading of the Commission’s consultation suggests polymer-loop outputs can be easier to credit than combusted fuels for bottle content targets. Cross-check the language before locking your product slate.

U.S. Compliance Context for Waste-to-Fuel Projects

The EPA finalized an Other Solid Waste Incineration (OSWI) rule in June 2025, effective August 29, 2025. While the rule targets incineration units, it influences how developers classify and permit certain waste-processing configurations. Developers should review the Federal Register text and EPA backgrounders to understand monitoring, emissions control, and siting implications for their specific technology stack. Start with the Federal Register entry and EPA OSWI pages for authoritative details.

Practical Takeaway on U.S. Siting

Compliance categories can shift a project’s cost structure and timeline. Teams should plan early for emissions testing, recordkeeping, and local permitting dialogues, especially when the configuration integrates thermal steps that regulators may scrutinize. Keep language precise in public communications to avoid conflating chemical recycling with incineration.

Route Selector: How To Choose the Right Sustainable Fuel Conversion Path

One rule governs everything: context decides the winner. The optimal route depends on four variables that interact locally: feedstock quality, energy price, nearby buyers, and policy definitions. When those are mapped correctly, the most efficient and sustainable pathway usually becomes obvious.

What Determines The Best Route

Feedstock: purity, polymer mix, contamination, moisture, and volume stability

Energy & Utilities: electricity price and carbon intensity, available steam, water, and heat

Offtake & Logistics: proximity to hydrogen users, steam crackers, ports, or airports

Policy & Credits: recycled-content accounting, fuel carbon intensity standards, hydrogen incentives

Start With Feedstock And End Use

Mixed, Dirty, Or Variable Streams with Local Hydrogen Demand

Choose: Plastic-to-hydrogen routes.

Why it fits: These systems tolerate contamination, can be distributed near end users, and can stack clean-hydrogen credits where they exist.

Best locations: Industrial hubs and heavy-transport corridors that already consume hydrogen for refining, chemicals, steel, or fleet fueling.

Execution tip: Secure a nearby H₂ buyer and grid-connection plan, then size the unit to match steady waste inflow and hydrogen demand.

Access To A Steam Cracker Or Petrochemical Complex

Choose: Pyrolysis-oil conditioning targeting circular polymer loops.

Why it fits: Meeting cracker specifications unlocks high-value offtake and enables verifiable recycled-content claims inside plastics supply chains.

Best locations: Chemical parks with liquid-feed crackers and utilities for pretreatment, hydrotreating, and impurity control.

Execution tip: Budget for a full conditioning train and quality assurance. Align with a cracker operator on acceptable ranges for chlorine, oxygenates, metals, and boiling curves.

Regions With Strong CO₂ Fuel Credits and Low-Cost Renewable Power

Choose: CO₂-to-e-fuels such as e-methanol for marine use or power-to-liquid SAF for aviation.

Why it fits: Policy rewards low-carbon molecules and early plants are already operating with offtake agreements from shipping and airlines.

Best locations: Grid nodes with abundant renewables, available CO₂ sources, and port or airport infrastructure.

Execution tip: Lock power purchase terms and carbon intensity baselines early. Match plant size to firm offtake and certification requirements.

Markets Where Recycled-Content Claims Are Essential

Choose: Routes that trace outputs into polymer loops rather than combustion.

Why it fits: In programs where bottle-content accounting excludes fuel use from recycled-content claims, polymer-to-polymer pathways score better.

Execution tip: Track mass-balance rules closely, align auditing and chain-of-custody systems, and coordinate communications so claims match the local standard.

Putting It All Together: A Quick Decision Flow

Is reliable H₂ demand within trucking distance and are feeds mixed or dirty → pursue plastic-to-hydrogen.

Is a steam cracker nearby with appetite for circular liquids → invest in pyrolysis-oil conditioning for polymer loops.

Is cheap, clean power available and CO₂ credits strong → develop CO₂-to-e-fuels for shipping or aviation.

Are recycled-content claims central to revenue or regulation → bias toward polymer-loop outputs and mass-balance alignment.

Use this selector as a checklist in project scoping. Map your local variables, run sensitivity on power price and policy credit values, validate offtake specifications with buyers, and the winning route will emerge with far less friction.

The Bottom Line on Waste Carbon: What Smart Buyers Know Now

Sustainability has grown up. The popular DIY clips are a useful spark, yet the real story sits in contracts, certifications, and plants that turn waste plastics and captured CO₂ into fuels and feedstocks that meet buyer specifications.

Everyday infrastructure contributes alongside corporate hubs, with Biodigesters That Recycle Household Waste lowering household emissions and Ryanair’s Eco-Friendly Hangar Facility optimizing energy use across ground operations.

Shipping is already bunkering e-methanol in Denmark. Aviation is investing in power-to-liquid suppliers to secure future SAF. Petrochemicals are conditioning pyrolysis oils and testing fully circular, electrified cracking runs.

Policymakers are defining how recycled content is counted and how waste units are permitted, which directly affects what scales first.

This ultimately signaled a decisive move into the world of long-haul flying. The airline's CEO, Pieter Elbers, ultimately said that the deal supports IndiGo's goal of becoming a global player by 2030 and aligning with India's aviation hub ambitions.

The aircraft type promises a roughly 25% lower fuel burn, operating cost, and Carbon Dioxide output than previous-generation rival jet models. The plane can also operate with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel, with a target of 100% currently in the works for 2030. Airbus noted impressive market growth in India, with Airbus A350 orders totaling more than 1,400 from 63 customers by September 2025.

A Deeper Look At The Specifics Of This Deal

IndiGo's firm order for a set of 30 Airbus A350-900s is set to lift its A350 backlog to 60 aircraft, and it is notable on several fronts. This order very quickly converts a Memorandum of Understanding from June, and it signals a strong conviction in the airline's decision to make a pivot into the long-haul market. IndiGo has historically been a very successful low-cost regional carrier, but this shift highlights the airline's strong interest in making an entry into the long-haul market, according to the latest reports from manufacturer Airbus.

The Airbus A350's long-range capabilities, cabin comfort, and roughly 25% advantage in terms of fuel burn make it a good choice for an airline looking to cater to a new kind of long-haul travelers. The jet's exceptional route economics and ability to operate with nearly 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel make it exceptionally capable in relation to earlier-generation competitors. The carrier will now begin the challenging part of planning which long-haul destinations it is looking to fly to.

What Is IndiGo's Plan For Entering The Long-Haul Market?

IndiGo is pursuing a sequenced and risk-managed pivot into long-haul travel. This is relatively unique for an airline that operates on a low-cost model, given the typical higher expenses associated with long-haul intercontinental flights. The airline is starting by layering partnerships across its network to offer diverse one-stop access to destinations across Europe. The airline is then looking to wet-lease Boeing 777-300ER models to build up experience operating services between Delhi, Mumbai, and Istanbul.

Next, IndiGo added a small ""Stretch"" premium cabin on Airbus A321neos to test paid upsell potential and condition customers for two-class services. The airline's fleet architecture is based on a true long-haul model with some future Airbus A321XLR jets that will enable flights on long and thin routes. This will soon be followed by Airbus A350-900s starting in 2027, with this new order bringing the total number of airframes to 60.

The airline's network strategy will leverage Delhi and Mumbai as super-feed hubs, opening up European services first before broader Asia-Pacific and North America moves. Codeshares also fill gaps until the Airbus A350 arrives to provide scale and long-range capabilities. There are some risks associated with the execution of this long-haul fleet strategy. This includes improved slot access at primary gateways, and potential delivery delays could also slow down the airline's planned timeline.

What Does All Of This Mean For Passengers?

Passengers will now have access to more nonstop flights from India to Europe. Later expansion plans call for the airline to add flights to Asia-Pacific destinations and to North America, which will further expand the carrier's long-haul reach. Passengers traveling with IndiGo on long-haul services can anticipate competitive base fares, but an unbundled model that will require them to pay for pretty much everything extra.

In the near term, one-stop connectivity will continue to improve via the airline's partners. Medium-haul routes will use the Airbus A321XLR that features ""Stretch"" seats offering extra comfort. The Airbus A350 does offer top-of-the-line cabin comfort, so its introduction to service will mark an improvement over the 777-300ERs, which it will initially use.

The airline will operate two principal hubs using this aircraft. The airline will center its long-haul service network out of Indira Gandhi International Airport (DEL) in Delhi and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (BOM) in Mumbai.",https://static0.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/indigo-a350.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-10-18 03:56:15.115056

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday.
It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.
Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production.
The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.","The leader of the company that abandoned its immediate plans to build a $2.6 billion ethanol-based jet fuel plant in Lake Preston said Friday that South Dakota is no longer a friendly place to do business.

In 2022, Gevo CEO Patrick Gruber stood alongside South Dakota Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden, then the lieutenant governor, at the ceremonial groundbreaking for the project, billed as the largest economic development project in state history.

This week, Gruber and his Colorado-based company announced plans for a smaller jet fuel facility at an ethanol plant in Richardton, North Dakota.

Gevo bought the plant a year ago in the wake of South Dakota pushback on a carbon sequestration pipeline that was critical to the company’s Lake Preston business plan.

“South Dakota is a very difficult place to do business,” Gruber told South Dakota Searchlight on Friday. “Everything is oppositional. North Dakota is a breath of fresh air.”

Gruber said his company still hopes to build something on the 200-odd acres it owns in Kingsbury County at some point in the future. It wouldn’t be a standalone ethanol plant, he said, but it could be a jet fuel plant that uses corn oil or ethanol, or be used as a chemical production plant.

Gruber sees a future where 70 of the nation’s approximately 180 ethanol plants use designs like Gevo’s to convert to jet fuel production. Demand is growing, he said, and the U.S. can’t keep up with the petroleum-based refineries it has.

That’s long-term, though. Whether the Lake Preston site is a part of that conversation or is used for another offshoot of Gevo’s operations is also a ways off.

At this point, after watching opposition to the Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline drive policy changes over the past three years, Gruber said he’s wary of engaging South Dakota leaders.

In 2022, he said, there was strong support in state leadership for both the pipeline and Gevo’s Net Zero-1 complex in Kingsbury County.

Then the political winds shifted.

“Having lived through the change, I’m not doing that again,” Gruber said.

Carbon sequestration drives business

Summit Carbon Solutions had hoped to gather carbon dioxide from ethanol plants across multiple states and deliver it via underground pipe to a site in North Dakota for sequestration. In doing so, the company would cash in on federal carbon capture tax credits.

Gevo, were it to build its operations in Lake Preston and connect to that line, would be able to lower the carbon emissions of its jet fuel, boosting its value in certain markets.

Sustainable jet fuel developer moves priority from SD to ND amid Summit pipeline delays

Gevo’s North Dakota plant sits atop the same formation that would be used to sequester carbon by Summit. This year, Gevo’s been pumping the carbon from that plant underground and selling carbon credits to other companies that want to offset their carbon footprint. Sequestering carbon also lowers an ethanol plant’s carbon score, so Gevo can sell it for more in some areas.

Gruber said the company can also sell carbon to fossil fuel companies in North Dakota’s oilfields for use in enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas underground to force more crude oil toward a well.

“We did good by buying that plant,” Gruber told Searchlight.

Summit, meanwhile, is in limbo. Gov. Rhoden signed a bill banning the use of eminent domain by carbon pipeline companies this year. Eminent domain is the legal process by which land access can be obtained for use in projects that benefit the public, with compensation for landowners determined by a court. The specter of eminent domain sparked landowner opposition, litigation and political activism in South Dakota, leading to the ban.

The Public Utilities Commission denied Summit’s permit application twice, but the company vowed to reapply.

Issue splits governor candidates

On Thursday, Rhoden said he’s glad to hear that Gevo may still build in South Dakota. He also said signing the eminent domain ban for carbon pipelines was the right thing to do in response to citizen concerns, and that Summit has a chance to “reset” its plans and work with landowners.

Rhoden has not announced if he’ll be a candidate to keep his job in 2026, but he’s spent much of his first year in office on an “Open for Opportunity” tour to meet business leaders across the state.

South Dakota Speaker of the House Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, was the first Republican to announce his intention to run for governor. He’s been among the loudest opponents of the carbon pipeline.

Hansen said he’s not saddened to hear about Gevo’s shift to North Dakota. He pointed to a $12.2 million tax rebate authorized for Gevo by the Governor’s Office of Economic Development in 2023 and said companies ought to be able to thrive in South Dakota without incentives.

“This is yet another example of what I’ve been fighting against: politicians and bureaucrats in the Governor’s Office of Economic Development getting duped by green-energy and other scams — abusing so-called ‘economic development’ programs to hand out our tax dollars to out-of-state corporations.”

Hansen said South Dakotans “want our money back,” and that “corporate welfare waste” would end if he were elected governor.

Gruber said Friday, however, that Gevo never used its tax rebate, because it was predicated on building the Net Zero-1. Since that hasn’t happened, “we have not taken any money from South Dakota.” Josie Harms, Rhoden’s spokeswoman, confirmed that Gevo hasn’t collected any state money, and that it has paid sales taxes on anything it purchased in South Dakota to prepare the site.

Nothing has been done to the land for about two years.

Governor race exposes divergent paths on economic development among South Dakota Republicans

Another Republican candidate for governor, Aberdeen businessman Toby Doeden, also leaned in on opposition to publicly funded economic development incentives in his statement on Gevo. He said companies that want to locate in South Dakota should “share our values” and be able to “succeed without politicians putting their fingers on the scale.”

“As governor, I will attract businesses, large and small, who will come here on fair terms,” Doeden said in a statement. “Businesses that move here should do so on their own two feet without demanding hundreds of millions in state subsidies or abusing residents in the process.”

Republican U.S. Rep. Dusty Johnson, who’s also declared his candidacy for governor in 2026, has talked recently about wanting to make South Dakota’s business climate more friendly again. This week, he sent out a press release on a “Data Centers Done Right” initiative, which he said would incentivize their placement in South Dakota and make the state “be a national leader in the AI revolution.”

Hansen and Doeden each responded to that announcement by saying they’re opposed to tax breaks.

Johnson, in a statement on the Gevo situation, said anti-development attitudes are the reason the state lost ground in the latest iteration of CNBC’s “America’s Top States for Business” rankings.

“Unfortunately, this isn’t the only project looking to leave South Dakota,” Johnson wrote. “Our state has slid down the rankings to the 35th best state for business. South Dakota has many strengths, but if we are going to meet our potential, we’ll need vision and a plan.”

Robert Arnold, the only declared Democratic candidate for governor, said South Dakotans have made their feelings on the carbon pipeline clear. But he also said he’d like to see Gevo follow through and build in South Dakota.

“I hope that we haven’t turned this industry completely away from us and we can negotiate a deal down the road,” Arnold said in a statement.

Lake Preston anticipated loss

Lake Preston Mayor Donna Bumann said pipeline opposition wasn’t an issue in her community.

“For the farmers in our area that Summit has connected with, it’s been quite positive,” Bumann said. “I realize that’s not the same in other areas.”

Gevo trumpets cash on hand, growth potential for sustainable jet fuel in earnings call

Bumann said her community had embraced Gevo and the benefits its proposed jet fuel plant promised. In a presentation offered to investors last year, the company included a slide that said Net Zero-1 would return $170 million annually to the South Dakota economy, create 1,300 short-term and 100 long-term jobs, partner with universities to promote science education and draw graduates to its operations, and pay area farmers a premium for corn.

“We are hopeful that, in due time, circumstances will make it possible for Gevo to move forward,” Bumann said.

Kingsbury County Commission Chairman Kyle Lee wasn’t surprised by the news, either.

“Once the state said that they weren’t going to allow for Summit to do any eminent domain, I think we knew that was going to end up being the straw that broke the camel’s back,” Lee said.

Net Zero-1’s footprint would’ve included an ethanol plant, a plant to turn that ethanol into jet fuel, and a wind farm proposed by a company called Zero6. It also spurred East River Electric Cooperative to invest in a switching station near the Gevo site, meant to help service the company’s power needs.

This month, however, Zero6 pulled its application for interconnection from the Southwest Power Pool’s queue. The Southwest Power Pool manages the wholesale power market for the central U.S.

Chris Studer of East River Electric said the cooperative will still build its switching station and use it to serve existing customers.

“We weren’t just building lines to serve Gevo,” Studer said, but he added that the upgrades will ready the area for any large-scale industrial project that might come along.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Gevo-1-e1683764863266.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 01:56:08.709546

Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?","IP Group PLC (LSE:IPO) CEO Greg Smith joined Proactive to discuss the company’s strategic outlook, recent exits, and high-potential investments.

Topics include future royalty streams from obesity drug programs, portfolio realisations, and IP Group’s backing of clean tech innovator OXCCU.

Here, we take a closer look at what was said.

Proactive: Greg, very good to speak with you this morning. With Pfizer acquiring Metsera for up to $7.3 billion, how meaningful could future royalty income from these obesity drug programs be for IP Group?

Greg Smith: This is quite an interesting development. So this is something that we spoke a little bit about at our half-year results. As a part of our business, we have some patents that we license and manage, and this is one of those examples. I think the announcement that Pfizer was acquiring Metsera has shone an additional light on this area of our business — something we feel has been a little bit overlooked by the market.

So we felt it deserved a bit of an update in the spirit of our commitment to transparency. Pfizer is paying almost $5 billion upfront to acquire Metsera and its anti-obesity drug programs. It’s interesting for IP Group because we are the licensor of the fundamental underlying technology behind their lead compounds and a number of others. If those compounds successfully progress through phase two, phase three, and reach the market, then we could benefit from some quite substantial royalties on drug sales. So it's a significant potential source of future value for IP Group and its shareholders.

Proactive: Metsera’s lead drug is heading into phase three next year. When might IP Group realistically start seeing milestone payments or royalties from this pipeline?

Greg Smith: Interestingly, Metsera recently said they’re accelerating the timetable due to strong progress. They’re targeting getting the phase three trial up and running by the end of this year, which is good news. Analyst forecasts suggest first sales might come in 2029 or 2030.

The majority of our value would come once sales begin, so 2029, 2030 and beyond. It’s worth pointing out these compounds were produced by Professor Stephen Bloom at Imperial College London. Back in 1996, his team discovered that GLP-1 suppresses appetite, laying the groundwork for these therapies. So it’s a high-quality source, which is why we're particularly excited about this opportunity.

This is a very big market, and the drugs have the potential to impact hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of patients. It’s another great example of how IP Group backs developments that target big markets with human impact and significant financial return potential.

Proactive: Does this potential royalty stream change how you think about IP Group's growth model — from being an early-stage investor to holding longer-term revenue interests in late-stage assets?

Greg Smith: It’s an interesting question. It could be of such magnitude over time that we need to think about how we articulate this in our strategy and monetisation plans for shareholders. Ongoing long-term revenue streams fit well with the long-term business model we have at IP Group. It’s one of the benefits of having a permanent capital vehicle that can invest over the long term and grow businesses to material value.

Proactive: It's been a busy period for IP Group. You announced three successful exits recently, including the sale of Monolith to Nasdaq-listed CoreWeave. Are we seeing a broader crystallisation phase for the IP Group portfolio?

Greg Smith: You probably remember that 2022 and 2023 were tough years for the venture market. Last year, we bucked the trend with good progress on realisations — around £160 million in 2024. That included major exits like Featurespace to Visa and Garrison Technology to Everfox.

There’s increasing confidence within IP Group that our portfolio is maturing and attractive for exits, especially in areas suitable for M&A. The CoreWeave exit is another example of the portfolio’s quality. It probably wasn’t a company many shareholders knew about, yet we delivered a strong financial result.

At our full-year results, we said we’re confident in achieving over £250 million in realisations from our private portfolio between 2025 and 2027. This is another positive sign in that direction.

Proactive: Greg, you're also investing £4 million into OXCCU as part of a broader fundraising. Encouraging to see your portfolio getting lots of third-party interest?

Greg Smith: Yes. Exits are the end of the line — that’s where we recycle capital into buybacks or reinvest in the next generation of value-creating companies.

OXCCU is one of those. They’ve just closed a $28 million funding round. What’s interesting is the breadth and depth of investors — including Safran Corporate Ventures and International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent of British Airways. Also involved were other clean tech investors like Clean Energy Ventures from the US.

It’s great to be in a financial position to support this business into its next growth stage. They're based in Oxford and have their proving plant on Oxford Airfield. Many airlines are now committing to including SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) in their fuel mix by 2030, 2040 and 2050.

IAG said they want 10% of their fuel mix to be SAF by 2030 — and that’s not far off. So this investment helps them meet that commitment. The regulatory and industry drivers suggest a bright future for OXCCU. It’s a great example of a British company tackling global problems and attracting strong specialist investment.",https://cdn.proactiveinvestors.com/eyJidWNrZXQiOiJwYS1jZG4iLCJrZXkiOiJ1cGxvYWRcL05ld3NcL0ltYWdlXC8yMDI1XzEwXC8yMDI1LTEwLTE3LTE2LTEyLTEwLTE5MDE1ZThjMjcyMjA1YWQxMDhkYWUzYzIyZjMwNWY4LmpwZyIsImVkaXRzIjp7InJlc2l6ZSI6eyJ3aWR0aCI6MTIwMCwiaGVpZ2h0Ijo2MzAsImZpdCI6ImNvdmVyIn19fQ==,N,,2025-10-18 10:56:48.360530

Sustainable Travel: France Preferring Climate Goals From The World Bank

As the travel sector continues to adapt following the pandemic, a shift toward sustainability has become more apparent. The sector’s commitment to reducing their carbon footprint, transitioning to green energy, and aligning with climate-action goals is encouraging. Sustainable travel is welcomed, with Air France, Delta, and other major global airlines taking global sustainable travel goals integrate sustainability into airline travel. France has been instrumental in climate action and sustainable finance, especially in encouraging the World Bank to keep sustaining climate finance goals.

This article explains the response of the airline and hospitality industries to the climate crisis, how it will impact travelers, the implications of Climate -Goal France’s World Bank position, and the future of sustainable tourism. Finally, we provide eco-travel tips and explain key flight information to guide travelers in sustainable exploration.

Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines Lead Sustainable Travel Efforts

In the past, the aviation sector has played a major role in contributing to worldwide emissions, but there are changes to consider in the hopes of eco-friendly customers. The primary carriers in the field recognize the need to introduce effective emissions mitigation plans and put them into action. Market players such as Air France, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa, and United Airlines developed new and creative methods to minimize the levels of embedded emissions. For these carriers, the levels of embedded emissions are likely to decrease annually, as they use biofuels and other Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) frameworks and engage in various approaches to carbon offsetting.

Air France’s Commitment to Sustainable Aviation

Air France, the leading airline to put SAF into action, shows the impact positive measures can take on the climate, shifting to a more innovative and greener approach. Air France predicted to use more than 43,953 of SAF in 2024 and decrease 150,000 CO2 emissions. This shows Air France’s will and determination in the airline’s promise to climate mitigation greenery. It shows advancement to the projected 2030 10% of the Air France global fuel mix use SAF as a carbon mitigation strategy blend while increasing the positive aviation climate impact. Air France loophole travelers use greener methods and minimized the impact of their carbon footprint.

Delta Airlines Sustainablity Initiatives

Delta Airlines is also one of the leaders of the travel industry when it comes to sustainability. As part of sustainable travel for customers, Delta Airlines has the plan of obtaining net zero carbon emissions by 2050. As part of sustainable travel for customers, Delta Airlines has the plan of obtaining net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Delta has also focused on setting the cross-enterprise carbon council. Members of this council focus on saving on fuel costs. In 2024, this council saved the company $100 million by reducing fuel use by 44 million gallons. Delta Airlines is also focused on fuel efficiency, ecofriendly sustainable fuels, and innovative aircraft designs. This innovative aircraft designs that aim to lessen the carbon footprint of the airline industry.

Lufthanas Aviation Innovations

Lufthansa is also focused on decreasing carbon emissions and the use of sustainable aviation fuels. In 2024, this airline saved 71,952 tonnes of CO₂ emissions. In the upcoming years, this airline plans to release 200 new, more sustainable planes that are expected to enter the aviation industry by 2030. This signifies that passengers flying with this airline, can enjoy their trip and green travel without sacrificing their safety and comfort.#### United Airlines’ Green Aircraft Program

United Airlines also is also becoming environmentally sustainable. In 2024, United blended sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) with regular jet fuel. United plans to have net-zero emissions by 2050. Other investments to improve sustainability with green technologies include aircraft. Passengers traveling with United can relax knowing that the airline is cutting down the carbon footprint.

France Urges World Bank to Stick to Climate Finance Goals

The airline industry is becoming more sustainable and the hospitality industry is also just starting to become more sustainable. Much more on the global scale still needs to be done to prioritize investments focused on climate change. France is one of the global climate change leaders.

France’s Advocacy for Climate Finance

Despite some countries–including the United States–pressuring the World Bank to no longer provide climate finance, France has actively been encouraging the World Bank to continue. France endorses the World Bank’s new target of 45% of climate finance as an improvement from the previous 35%. Since the consequences of climate change are worse than they have ever been, France believes that climate finance is necessary so developing countries can make a more sustainable transition.

The Role of the Hospitality Industry in Sustainability

As the airline industry works towards a more sustainable future, so is a part of the hospitality industry. Major hotel chains such as Marriott, Accor Hotels, and Hilton are trying to lessen their impact on the environment by implementing energy-efficiency, conserving water, and waste reduction. For travelers in search of more environmentally friendly accommodations, these hotel chains are leading the way with their green building certifications and commitment to build more sustainable hotels.

Marriott Hotels: In 2024, Marriott started a new sustainability program aimed at cutting down on water and energy used at all of its hotels and resorts worldwide. Marriott is also going green-moving waste and responsibly sourcing materials. People looking for a greener stay will feel good about eco-friendly options with a stay at Marriott.

Accor Hotels: Since releasing a new sustainability plan, aimed at an overall 30% reduction in carbon emissions expected to be completed by 2030. Several eco-friendly initiatives have begun with solar power, new energy efficient appliances, and promoting sustainable tourist packages for visitors.

Hilton Hotels: Hilton is also doing the same. It is also doing the same by decreasing their negative impact on… waste reduction—in this case, a water saving plan. Eco-conscious stays would be informed through eco-positive stays.

Travel Tips for Eco-Friendly Tourism

The encouraging impact on sustainability within the global tourism sector must be mirrored by travelers. The following travel tips help close the gap to minimize one’s negative (carbon) footprint.

Pick Sustainable Airlines and Flights

To lower your carbon footprint, fly with airlines that use sustainable aviation fuel and participate in carbon offset programs. Air France, Delta, Lufthansa, and United Airlines have made strides in decreasing their emissions and improving sustainability in aviation, so these are the airlines to fly with.

Stay in Eco-Friendly Hotels

When making reservations, look for hotels that focus on sustainability. The Marriott, Accor, and Hilton chains focus on eco-friendly practices, such as making use of energy-saving bulbs, conserving water, and reducing waste. These hotels help support the green initiatives of the sustanability of the hospitality industry.

Take Public Transport and Walk

When you reach your destination, use public transportation or walk instead of renting a car. Many cities have great transit options, including electric buses and eco-friendly metro systems that have a lower environmental cost than private vehicles. By choosing these options, you can greatly lower the emissions of your trip.

Bring Only What You Need

When you carry too much luggage, it will increase the weight of the airplane, and it will need more fuel. While traveling, you should try and pack the bare minimum! Using a carry-on bag will help keep your luggage and the weight of your flight down. Also, you should always choose digital tickets and mobile boarding passes to conserve paper.

This brings the total amount of SAF quotas issued so far in 2025 to around 1.2 million tons, including the first such permits allotted to Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech.

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilise the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.

Magnifica Air aims to have the most efficient carbon footprint in the industry, combining personalisation, wellness and sustainability with the consistency and scale of a commercial carrier’s first-class cabin.
“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Wade Black, CEO.
“They are built into every layer of the Magnifica Air experience.” From launch, Florida based Magnifica Air, will operate with six to seven daily departures, connecting to Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Bay Area, Dallas, and Houston, with seasonal routes to Napa Valley and the Caribbean.
“Magnifica Air is not scaling on hype—we are scaling with intention,” said Black.","A new airline launched at this year’s NBAA-BACE, which took place 14-16 October 2025 in Las Vegas. Magnifica Air says that it aims to transform how travellers experience the skies and “make people feel good about flying again”.

The airline will launch in 2027 with a bespoke fleet of Airbus A220-300 and A321neo aircraft, completed in partnership with Comlux and delivered through Air Lease. Magnifica Air aims to have the most efficient carbon footprint in the industry, combining personalisation, wellness and sustainability with the consistency and scale of a commercial carrier’s first-class cabin.

“Magnifica Air is pioneering a new space between private aviation and first-class commercial travel,” said Wade Black, CEO. “We combine the privacy and intimacy of a private jet with the cultural relevance and operational scope of a world-class airline. This is more than transportation—it’s a movement, redefining how discerning guests experience the skies.”

Each aircraft will carry 45–54 passengers, with two to four private suites per aircraft and bespoke business-class recliners. The A321neo is configured for longer-haul routes (four suites), while the A220-300 serves mid-haul routes (two suites). With no overhead bins, cabins open into expansive spaces finished with adaptive lighting and hand-crafted seating, culinary programmes developed with world-class chefs and sommeliers, and the personalised hospitality of a private members’ club.

Magnifica Air’s fleet will also introduce a commercial-scale surface purification system, powered by patented Aviation Clean Air (ACA) technology. By combining advanced science with thoughtful design, this system is designed to prioritise health, comfort, and luxury—further elevated by an innovative air humidification system.

Responsible digitalisation is also achieved through small actions. And, in this regard, we are taking a new step: business travel by plane from Telefónica will be more sustainable.

Together with Amadeus, BBVA and Repsol, we are one of the founding companies of “Círculo SAF”. Together with these three corporations, we are contributing to the reduction of part of the emissions generated by certain corporate trips and cargo flights operated by Iberia, promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on these flights. This means a reduction in global emissions in the aviation sector, contributing directly to the fight against climate change, with an estimated reduction of between 10% and 30% in Scope 3 emissions from companies in their activity with Iberia.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel for flights. It is produced from agricultural or forestry waste, or from renewable hydrogen, CO2 captured from the air or industrial processes. Compared to traditional kerosene, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80% in terms of life cycle, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The great advantage of SAF is that it can be used without making any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. It is therefore currently the viable alternative for reducing part of the emissions in the aviation sector.

Why are we joining this initiative?

Because our commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2040 also includes our value chain. And that means an ESG culture with more sustainable habits on all fronts.

Because, although corporate travel only accounts for 2% of our global indirect CO2 emissions (scope 3), every tonne counts!

Because it is a pioneering proposal that translates into real changes in the decarbonisation of the economy and accelerates the energy transition.

Building on the Clean Industrial Deal introduced earlier this year, the new international strategy outlines how the EU plans to create a fair, sustainable, and secure energy future both within its borders and around the world.

Clean industry

The new EU global climate and energy vision places clean technology and resilient energy systems at the core of Europe’s international engagement. As the world undergoes a rapid clean industrial revolution, the EU intends to become the leading supplier of clean technologies and adaptation solutions to countries across the globe.

With nearly half of its electricity already generated from renewable sources in 2024, the EU has made significant progress in reducing its dependence on fossil fuel imports. Clean energy investments in the bloc have more than doubled since 2015, reinforcing its position as a key player in the global green economy.

The EU aims to ramp up its clean technology manufacturing capacity to capture 15% of the global market, aligning this goal with the broader objectives of the Clean Industrial Deal, which supports decarbonisation and competitiveness of European industry.

Global partnership

The EU’s strategy emphasises the need for robust and mutually beneficial international cooperation. Through a mix of bilateral and multilateral partnerships, the EU plans to expand clean value chains and promote global standards for sustainability and fair trade.

To support this, the EU will utilise initiatives such as the Global Gateway Investment Hub and the Global Europe envelope to connect European businesses with global investment opportunities. A new Clean Transition Business Council will also be established to facilitate the international expansion of EU clean tech firms and promote climate-resilient business models abroad.

Fair rules and innovation

The EU’s approach is a strong commitment to a rules-based international order and the full implementation of the Paris Agreement. Carbon pricing is highlighted as a key tool to reduce emissions, foster innovation, and ensure a just transition. The EU plans to promote carbon pricing globally through a dedicated task force and support partner countries in establishing their own systems.

The EU will continue efforts to reform global financial institutions to support climate objectives and resilient economic growth better. Security is also a growing focus, with climate change now firmly seen as a strategic issue. The EU will strengthen its response to climate-related security risks by working with international bodies such as the UN and NATO and countering disinformation about climate policies.

Kaja Kallas, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the European Commission said; “Energy supplies are being weaponised while our climate rapidly changes. Energy is a resource and a strategic capability. Today we set out where the EU will focus our climate and energy diplomacy, from promoting European clean tech businesses, to upping our investment in projects across the globe that support a sustainable transition.”

Creating change

The EU’s new strategy hopes to inject fresh political momentum into the global clean transition. By encouraging action through international forums and the Global Stocktake process, the EU aims to keep the world on track to meet shared climate goals.

This global vision builds on the Clean Industrial Deal presented earlier in 2025, which targeted the decarbonisation of energy-intensive industries and introduced new tools such as tax incentives and a revised State Aid Framework to support clean tech innovation.

With greenhouse gas emissions already cut by 37% since 1990, the EU remains on course to reach climate neutrality by 2050. Although it contributes just 6% of global emissions, the EU continues to be the largest provider of climate finance globally, underlining its ambition to lead by example.",https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/iStock-489193525-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-10-18 03:56:37.393381

(DTN) -- U.S. soybean farmers could lose between $3.2 billion and $7.5 billion if the Trump administration does not completely reallocate biofuels gallons to small-refinery exemptions to the Renewable Fuel Standard, a biofuels group told Lee Zeldin, administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, in an Oct. 16, 2025, letter.

Clean Fuels Alliance America cited an analysis by World Agricultural Economic and Environmental Services, that outlines the losses to soybean farmers based on how much volume from SREs is reallocated.

The EPA issued a supplemental proposal to the RFS volumes, asking for public input on a range of reallocation from zero to 100%.

According to the company's study, if the agency adopts a 50% reallocation in 2026 to 2027 490 million gallons of biomass-based diesel production would be lost, leading to $1.4 billion in lost soybean farm revenue and a $1.8 billion drop in the value of soybean products to soybean crushers.

Clean Fuels said in the letter to Zeldin that reallocating zero gallons of biofuels would be ""considerable worse.""

The analysis found it would lead to 1 billion gallons of lost biomass-based diesel production, $2.6 billion in lost soybean revenue to farms and a $4.9 billion drop in the value of soybean products to crushers.

""Biomass-based diesel is essential to America's farm security, now more than ever,"" Clean Fuels said in the letter.

""Domestic biodiesel, renewable diesel and SAF (sustainable aviation fuel) production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown in the United States. With increased farm productivity, U.S. soybean growers are right now harvesting a projected 4.3 billion bushels of soybeans for the season worth $43 billion. And with more than $6 billion of investment, U.S. soybean processors are expected to crush a record 2.5 billion of those bushels next year.""

Clean Fuels said that in facing retaliatory trade measures from China and a growing global competition from Argentina and Brazil, ""America's farmers cannot afford to lose the value"" that U.S. biomass-based diesel brings.

""We acknowledge that the current government shutdown is impacting both the administration's ability to provide economic relief to America's farmers and EPA's goal of meeting the statutory deadlines for the RFS rule,"" the group told Zeldin.

""Nevertheless, America's farmers are facing extreme economic challenge

and making planting decisions for next season. Biomass-based diesel producers and soybean processors are already negotiating feedstock contracts, fuel production and offtake agreements, and investment decisions for 2026. Across the board, our industry needs the rulemaking to be published before the end of the year to provide necessary policy stability and market confidence.""

Kurt Kovarik, Clean Fuels' vice president of federal affairs, said in a statement, ""Clean Fuels urges EPA to quickly finalize the robust, timely RFS volumes it proposed in June and ensure they are not eroded by small-refinery exemptions. U.S. biodiesel and renewable diesel production supports 10% of the value of every bushel of soybeans grown here. Supporting continued growth of U.S. biomass-based diesel is crucial right now to support American farmers and the agricultural economy.""

Abra Group orders new Airbus narrow-body and wide-body jets

Abra Group has confirmed an order for new Airbus aircraft to increase connectivity across the Americas and Europe. The move supports its plan to meet rising travel demand and strengthen its position in key markets.

To enhance long-haul capability, Abra has agreed to acquire up to seven Airbus A330neo aircraft. These aircraft will be deployed across the Group’s airlines depending on market and financial needs.

The A330neo offers 14% lower fuel use per seat than the older A330ceo. It is also around 60% quieter, cutting airport noise and improving the passenger experience.

Abra has also confirmed 50 additional Airbus A320neo aircraft, bringing its total order for this model to 138 units. Deliveries will continue through 2032. The Group already holds firm orders for 88 A320neo and 96 Boeing 737 Max aircraft.

The first A320neo with the new Airspace cabin will enter service with Avianca in late 2025. The aircraft will include XL overhead bins providing 60% more storage, adjustable LED lighting, and three rows of Recaro-designed Premium seats in a two-by-two layout. These features will combine comfort with fuel efficiency and lower emissions.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new U.K.-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the U.K.’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the U.K.’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the U.K. and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, says, ""Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the U.K.’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The U.K.’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the U.K.’s sustainable fuels industry.”

U.K. Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, says, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We're also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to U.K. flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the U.K.""

Sadik Al Hassan MP, sustainable aviation champion and MP for North Somerset, says, “Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a significant boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England, whilst advancing the U.K.’s leadership in green aviation.

“Their vision for a sustainable aviation fuel ‘superhighway’ links delivery hubs to where the green fuel is needed most across the country, making the region more attractive for green investment in sustainable fuel production. It’s a clear signal that the green transition isn’t just possible but here.”

Dave Lees, CEO of Bristol Airport, says, “It’s fantastic to see this investment in our region, with blending facilities being a vital part of the future SAF supply chain that we need to decarbonize aviation. We’ve committed to working with our airline customers to meet the U.K.’s SAF mandate as part of our aim to be a net zero airport by 2050.”",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Exolum_Oct252_a9c43a1f69.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 17:00:49.996833

What is the Green Aviation Fuel Levy?

Simply put, this is a small fee added to departing flights to fund the use of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). It’s an eco-friendly alternative to regular jet fuel. The catch, however, is that sustainable aviation fuel is three to four times more expensive to produce than normal jet fuel. That’s where the levy comes in.

How much more will passengers pay

Although the levy will technically be paid by aircraft operators, most are expected to pass on the cost to passengers as part of the overall ticket price, similar to existing airport or fuel surcharges.

Early estimates suggest that the additional cost will be modest: around S$3 for short-haul flights, S$6 for medium-haul, and S$16 for long-haul journeys. In other words, roughly the price of a cup of coffee at the airport.

While it’s a small increase, the collective impact will help support the production and use of cleaner fuels, paving the way for a more sustainable future in aviation.

Who will be exempt

The levy will apply to departing flights from Singapore, but there are a few key exemptions. Passengers who are transiting or transferring through Changi. Meaning if they’re only stopping in Singapore to catch another flight, they won’t have to pay the charge.

This exemption ensures that Singapore remains an attractive and competitive hub for international travellers. Flights used for training, humanitarian, or charitable purposes will also be excluded from the levy.

A modest start towards sustainability

To kick things off, Singapore is targeting 1 per cent of all jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar Airport to be sustainable by 2026. It may sound small, but it’s a deliberate and practical starting point.

This measured approach allows Singapore to make tangible progress towards greener aviation without causing a sharp rise in airfares or operational costs for airlines. The Government will continue to monitor the rollout to ensure that both airlines and passengers benefit from cost stability as the programme scales up in future.

What travellers can expect

For most travellers, this change will mean a small increase in ticket prices, but it’s a necessary step towards a cleaner, more responsible way to fly. The funds collected through the levy will support Singapore’s broader sustainability goals, helping reduce aviation’s carbon footprint and keeping the city-state ahead in green innovation.

In short, the next time you book a flight out of Changi and notice a slight bump in your fare, you’ll know that those few extra dollars are helping make global travel just a little bit greener.

The facility, which is powered by FlyORO’s proprietary patented technology, is not only an Australia first, but also the first SAF blending terminal co-located at an airport globally. Its modular design can scale with demand and be replicated as the SAF industry takes hold in Australia and the Asia Pacific.

In addition, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has become Australia’s first RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified SAF company. This gives customers a world-leading accounting process and guarantees chain-of-custody and SAF authenticity.

“This is a defining moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and underscores Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to provide solutions today for the challenges of tomorrow,” said Matt Doyle, CEO Wagner Sustainable Fuels. “The launch of our Toowoomba Terminal is the start of our plans to deliver decarbonization benefits and meet the aviation sector’s growing demand through flexible, efficient and scalable SAF blending.”

“With the support from Boeing, we’re focused on bringing large scale SAF and renewable diesel production to Australia and integrating it into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, which is currently under planning and development,” said Doyle.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil fuel sources – like municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, animal fats and vegetable oils – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle, making it a more sustainable alternative for powering aircraft.

SAF blending is the controlled mixing of “neat” SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel that, once tested and certified, is a pure drop-in aviation fuel acceptable within current airport and aircraft infrastructure.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing head of Asia Pacific Sustainability.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets. It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

According to the Boeing CSIRO SAF Roadmapopens in a new tab, jet fuel demand in Australia is projected to grow by 75% by 2050. Wagner Sustainable Fuels partnered with FlyORO to deploy advanced and scalable SAF blending technologies in Australia for commercial, general aviation and defence customers.

“FlyORO’s modular SAF blending system, AlphaLite, doesn’t just help reduce emissions – it creates a scalable platform for collaboration, co-investment, and transparency across the fuel value chain,” said Jonathan Yeo, FlyORO’s Chief Executive Officer. “This integrated model complements FlyORO’s broader deployment strategy, including standalone facilities such as the one operating in Singapore.

“This is how we unlock speed and scale. We’re excited to partner with the leadership of Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to pioneer a more sustainable flying ecosystem in Australia.”

RICHARDTON, N.D. (North Dakota Monitor) – A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.

Then-Lieutenant Governor Larry Rhoden attended a groundbreaking on the project in South Dakota in September 2022 (pictured).

Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.

Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.

Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.

“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.

Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide to an underground storage site in North Dakota. But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance and state permitting hurdles.

Iowa-based Summit is seeking to change its pipeline permit in that state. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.

A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons of jet fuel a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.

He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.

Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain Time at WIX Barn near Richardton.

Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.

“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.

Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.

Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.

Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.

“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.

Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.

Gruber said he was grateful the Department of Energy for working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.

As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.

“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”

But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs.

“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said. “We’ve got a mission here.”",https://www.gowatertown.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Gevo-640x400.jpg?icb=1760752571,N,,2025-10-17 21:56:18.199950

The project includes infrastructure upgrades such as the conversion of existing aviation fuel tanks for SAF storage, installation of advanced blending infrastructure to ensure compliance with the technical standards, and modification of the existing system by installing pumps, filtration units, and segregation valves for transport and integration with the existing pipeline network.

Furthermore, the project is part of a broader plan to develop a nationwide network of SAF blending hubs across the country. The initiative coincides with the progress of the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which aims to introduce new subsidies to support domestic SAF production.",https://renewablewatch.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/favicon.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 20:56:49.115942

“Taiwan is committed to reducing its carbon emissions and biofuels are a powerful tool to improve environmental and human health, so the Council and its members are eager and willing to be a resource to help the development of ethanol adoption here,” LeGrand said.

After arrival, the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) provided a briefing for attending USDA cooperators about the social, economic and political landscapes in the country and how they affect the agricultural market.

The next day, the Council’s delegation visited the Taiwan Science and Technology Office for Net-Zero Emission (T-STONE) to discuss developments in global biofuel policy and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) development, and they received an update on gasoline blending policies in other Asian countries.

The group then attended a meeting of the Ethanol Gasoline Promotion Committee, where members of the Council’s team presented about the carbon reduction potential of an E10 gasoline blending rate and the steps needed to prepare infrastructure to deliver it to consumers.

The program was punctuated by the Economic Daily Media Forum, where high-level industry stakeholders and policymakers were in attendance for presentations about global ethanol supply and demand, Taiwan’s roadmap to net-zero emissions and the country’s energy security.

“These engagements helped the Council and USDA gain insight into the progress, trends and future development directions of biofuels in Taiwan, an already-important export market for U.S. producers that could become even more impactful in the near future if ethanol usage can expand,” LeGrand said. “The Council extends its thanks to USDA for its continued commitment to helping U.S. ethanol find homes in international markets and for our members who took the time to represent the U.S. ethanol industry at these crucial events.”",,N,,2025-10-17 14:01:33.352626

Gevo Investment Narrative Recap

To be a Gevo shareholder today, you need confidence in the company's ability to commercialize sustainable aviation fuel and secure recurring high-margin revenue, with the extended US$1.46 billion Department of Energy (DOE) loan guarantee reducing short-term financing risk and preserving the most important project catalyst: timely project funding. However, Gevo's business remains heavily exposed to government tax credits and policy changes, which could still materially impact future profitability, so the impact of this extension does not remove those risks.

Gevo’s recent partnership with Frontier Infrastructure Holdings to launch North America's first integrated carbon management platform is especially relevant in light of the DOE extension, as it highlights the company’s focus on creating new revenue opportunities while capitalizing on federal support, enhancing potential project economics if scaled successfully.

That threw a spotlight on used cooking oil, or UCO, which is used as a feedstock for biofuels and as a competitor to soybean oil.
“With fewer UCO imports, we expect stronger demand for domestically produced soybean oil as a feedstock for biodiesel.
Still, a ban would be seen as a net positive for companies such as ADM and Bunge because UCO imports have historically pressured domestic soybean crush margins, the analyst wrote.
Soybeans added another 7 cents as of 10:30 Friday morning after Trump appeared to take down the temperature in the U.S.-China trade battle, telling Fox News that proposed 100% tariffs on China probably weren’t sustainable.","Acronym-loving Wall Street traders this week sent shares of grain trading and processing giant Bunge Corp. soaring after President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration was considering “terminating business with China” when it comes to imports of cooking oil. That threw a spotlight on used cooking oil, or UCO, which is used as a feedstock for biofuels and as a competitor to soybean oil.

Trump’s ire was in response to China’s continued lack of U.S. soybean purchases and appeared to offer some support to soybean oil prices, with the December futures contract up 1.8% this week through Thursday’s close, while November soybeans were up 4 3/4 cents, or 0.4%, over the first four days of the week.

But it was Bunge that was off like a rocket, posting a week-to-date gain of 18% through Thursday’s close, with the move coming after Trump’s Tuesday announcement. Archer Daniels Midland also didn’t do too shabby, posting a 3.4% gain over the same stretch. It comes during a week that saw equities wobble in response to credit jitters surrounding regional banks, though major indexes remain on track for weekly gains as earnings season moves into full swing.

So what gives? China’s UCO exports to the U.S. have tanked after hitting a record high in 2024 at 1.27 million metric tons, according to USDA, accounting for around 43% of China’s total UCO exports. Since then, Beijing has eliminated an export tax rebate for UCO and the U.S. has dropped tax credits for foreign-sourced feedstocks and imposed tariffs.

“With fewer UCO imports, we expect stronger demand for domestically produced soybean oil as a feedstock for biodiesel. That said, the overall impact may be limited, since UCO imports from China have already declined over the past year due to less tax incentives and higher tariffs,” said Arun Sundaram, analyst at CFRA, in a note this week. China has been redirecting UCO exports to other regions like Europe, where tariffs are lower and demand for biofuels, particularly sustainable aviation fuel, is rising, he wrote.

Still, a ban would be seen as a net positive for companies such as ADM and Bunge because UCO imports have historically pressured domestic soybean crush margins, the analyst wrote.

It wasn’t just UCO that lifted Bunge shares. The rally also came after a revised full-year outlook from the company in the wake of its recently closed merger with Viterra. Bunge now sees full-year adjusted earnings per share between $7.30 and $7.60, below its previous guidance of about $7.75 but still better than the $6.99 Wall Street consensus, Sundaram noted.

Soybeans added another 7 cents as of 10:30 Friday morning after Trump appeared to take down the temperature in the U.S.-China trade battle, telling Fox News that proposed 100% tariffs on China probably weren’t sustainable. “I think we’re going to be fine with China, but we have to have a fair deal,” he said.",https://assets.farmjournal.com/dims4/default/e604715/2147483647/strip/true/crop/640x360+0+60/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffj-corp-pub.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2F2017-10%2Fgrain%20bins%202.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 14:56:51.985220

The addition of IndiGo’s latest firm order further strengthens Airbus’s position in one of the world’s most dynamic air travel markets.","IndiGo has finalized a firm order for 30 additional Airbus A350-900 aircraft, converting a Memorandum of Understanding signed in June 2025 into a binding agreement. The announcement, made by Airbus and IndiGo on October 17, 2025, brings IndiGo’s total A350 commitments to 60 aircraft as the airline prepares to expand into long-haul international markets.

Airbus said the order marks a significant step in IndiGo’s international growth strategy, providing additional range and efficiency for its planned expansion into new global destinations. Deliveries are expected to begin later this decade, though neither company disclosed a detailed schedule.

“Today is a special day for IndiGo as we solidify our commitment to expanding our international footprint and offering unparalleled connectivity to our customers,” said Pieter Elbers, CEO of IndiGo. “The conversion of this MoU into a firm order for 30 additional A350-900s is a testament to our confidence in the future of Indian aviation and our strategic partnership with Airbus.”

Elbers said the A350 will play a central role in IndiGo’s future fleet as the airline prepares to launch long-haul flights for the first time. The aircraft will be powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB-84 engines under a long-term TotalCare support agreement that includes continuous engine health monitoring and maintenance services throughout the life of the fleet.

Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, Executive Vice President of Sales for Airbus Commercial Aircraft, said the order highlights IndiGo’s ambitions to expand beyond its traditional short-haul markets. “The A350’s fuel efficiency, range, and passenger comfort align perfectly with IndiGo’s growth plans and long-haul network strategy,” he said.

The new commitment converts 30 purchase rights into firm orders, building on IndiGo’s initial order for 30 A350-900s placed in April 2024. The first 30 were IndiGo’s initial widebody purchase and marked the airline’s entry into the long-haul segment. With the latest agreement, IndiGo now holds firm orders for 60 A350-900s, all powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB engines.

The A350-900 is Airbus’s most advanced twin-aisle aircraft, seating between 300 and 410 passengers depending on configuration. It is designed for long-range operations and uses lightweight composite materials that reduce fuel consumption and emissions by about 25 percent compared with older widebody models. The aircraft can operate on up to 50 percent sustainable aviation fuel, with Airbus targeting full compatibility by 2030.

IndiGo, based in Gurugram, is India’s largest airline by fleet size and passenger numbers. It operates more than 400 aircraft and runs about 2,200 daily flights, connecting 90 domestic and 40 international destinations.

Founded in 2006, IndiGo has built its business around a low-cost, high-frequency model using primarily Airbus A320 and A321neo aircraft, along with ATR 72 turboprops for shorter routes. Its move into long-haul service marks a strategic expansion into new markets connecting India with Europe, East Asia, and North America.

India’s fast-growing aviation sector has fueled record aircraft orders in recent years, driven by economic expansion and rising demand for international travel. Airbus maintains a long-standing presence in the country, with its A320 family serving as the backbone of India’s domestic fleets.

At the end of September 2025, Airbus had received more than 1,400 orders for the A350 from 63 customers worldwide. The addition of IndiGo’s latest firm order further strengthens Airbus’s position in one of the world’s most dynamic air travel markets.

U.S. and Singapore Urge UN to Postpone Vote on Carbon Pricing for Shipping

The United States, Singapore, Liberia, and Saudi Arabia have collectively called on the U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO) to suspend enforcement of a proposed carbon price on shipping after a period of talks in London concluded without agreement. Washington and Riyadh continue to strongly oppose a carbon price in the maritime sector, while the European Union continues to support the measure as part of its global decarbonization strategies.

U.S. President Donald Trump called on IMO member states on Thursday to vote no, stating on his Truth Social platform that Washington would “not stand for this global green new scam tax on shipping and will not adhere to it in any way, shape or form.” “This week’s IMO meeting in London … appears to be on the verge of collapse,” Jefferies analyst Omar Nokta wrote in an investor note on Friday.

Daylight Secures $75 Million to Expand Residential Solar Power Network

Daylight Energy, a start up based in New York, has secured $75 million funding to develop its decentralized power network that allows homeowners to generate and share energy. Daylight was founded in 2022 and has since created an alternative to the traditional way by providing homeowners with solar panels and a battery system through a subscription model. The system allows homeowners to save money on their utility costs, have backup power during outages, while allowing them to provide excess energy back into the grid.

Daylight pools the energy capacity from all participating customers, allowing Daylight to sell energy during high demand. Daylight then gives a share of the profits back to the participating customers. The raised $75 million will enable Daylight to accelerate its vision of decentralizing power through homeowners as part of a more resilient and community-based energy grid. To keep up with more industry updates, businesses can rely on ESG solutions.

The new facility will form part of a broader “SAF Superhighway,” providing producers and importers with access to aviation fuel markets serving approximately 40% of flights departing the UK. By blending SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the project is expected to increase the availability of lower-carbon jet fuel at major airports in southern England and Wales, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

Construction at Redcliffe Bay will involve upgrading Exolum’s existing aviation fuel infrastructure to handle and blend SAF. Planned improvements include converting current storage tanks, installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves, and adding blending technology to meet technical standards for drop-in aviation fuels.

Unblended SAF will be delivered by ship to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock and transported via pipeline to Redcliffe Bay, where it will be stored and blended with conventional jet fuel before entering Exolum’s national distribution system. The facility is expected to begin operations in 2026.

Exolum said the investment will support the decarbonization of up to 64,000 flights from London to New York annually and provide a key route to market for future SAF production plants expected to open later this decade.

Stephen Land, Exolum’s North West Europe Lead, said the Redcliffe Bay project will help make greener flights a reality while strengthening the UK’s role in sustainable aviation.

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill—introducing new subsidies to promote SAF production—continues to progress through Parliament. Aviation Minister Keir Mather MP said the government’s ongoing investment in SAF production and mandates to increase SAF use will “drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.”

Regional leaders, including North Somerset MP Sadik Al Hassan and Bristol Airport CEO Dave Lees, also welcomed the development, citing its potential to support local jobs and contribute to the aviation sector’s long-term sustainability goals.","https://img.aviationpros.com/files/base/cygnus/cavc/image/2025/10/68f250187a4caef9c5bd5fcb-rcb_3.png?auto=format,compress&fit=fill&fill=blur&w=1200&h=630",N,,2025-10-17 13:00:25.172469

Accurate moisture measurement in such demanding environments requires a robust, sensitive, and reliable analyzer system.","Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is gaining global traction as a critical solution to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. SAF can be produced from various feedstocks via different conversion technologies. One technology is Alcohol-to-Jet Fuel (ATJ) which converts alcohols like ethanol or isobutanol into hydrocarbon jet fuel. ATJ involves multiple catalytic steps that are sensitive to moisture. Accurate and reliable moisture measurement is therefore essential to maintain catalyst activity, protect equipment, and ensure product quality.

In the ATJ process, ethylene or other light hydrocarbons are intermediates during the dehydration, oligomerization, and hydroprocessing steps.

Moisture must be tightly controlled in:

Feed gas purification

Dehydration reactors

Oligomerization or hydrocracking units

Final fuel refining or blending stages

Excessive moisture (greater than 1 ppm) in ethylene production processes can lead to catalyst deactivation, corrosion in high-pressure systems, trigger premature reactions, and reduce overall yield and product quality. To maintain moisture levels below the alarm threshold (<1 ppm), molecular sieve dryers are required to remove moisture from the process gas feeds. It’s essential to measure moisture downstream of the process outlet.

The SAF production environment presents the following measurement challenges:

Low Moisture Concentrations: Measurement is often required at ppm or sub-ppm levels.

High Pressure/Temperature: Process streams can operate at pressures 15- 50 barg and temperatures >100°C.

Process Contaminants: Risk of fouling or contamination due to residual catalyst, particulates, or condensables.

Accurate moisture measurement in such demanding environments requires a robust, sensitive, and reliable analyzer system.

Panametrics’ HygroPro II and HygroPro XP aluminum oxide-based moisture transmitters are ideally suited for moisture measurement in SAF production processes due to the following capabilities:

Measurement Range: Detects from ambient to subppm moisture levels.

Sensitivity: Ensures tight process control.

Fast Response Time: Real-time monitoring of moisture changes for proactive control.

Area Classification: Certified for hazardous areas.

Rugged Construction: IP66/IP67 rated for harsh industrial environments.

Versatile Output: 4–20 mA analog + HART protocol for seamless integration with control systems.

Sampling Systems: Packaged solution like pro.IQ or a custom solution to meet application needs for a turnkey solution.

By integrating HygroPro II or HygroPro XP into key points in the SAF process, such as after dehydration reactors or before final blending, operators can prevent costly moisture-related issues and ensure compliance with aviation fuel quality standards (e.g., ASTM D7566)

@IndiGo @Airbus #A350 #LongRangeLeader","New Delhi, India, October 17, 2025 - IndiGo, India’s largest airline, has finalised a commitment for 30 Airbus A350 aircraft, converting a Memorandum of Understanding signed in June into a firm order. This brings the airline's total A350 orders to 60 aircraft. The expanded order marks a strategic shift for IndiGo as it prepares to enter the long-haul international market, leveraging the A350’s long range and efficiency to support its global ambitions.

“Today is a special day for IndiGo as we solidify our commitment to expanding our international footprint and offering unparalleled connectivity to our customers,” said Pieter Elbers, CEO, IndiGo. “The conversion of this MoU into a firm order for 30 additional A350-900s is a testament to our confidence in the future of Indian aviation and our strategic partnership with Airbus, further reinforced by the strong start of our long-haul operations. In line with India’s vision of becoming a global aviation hub and our aspiration to establish ourselves as a leading global aviation player by 2030, IndiGo is taking decisive steps forward. These aircraft, as they join our fleet in the years to come, will play a pivotal role in enabling IndiGo expand its reach, connect India with more destinations across the globe, and offer our customers new international travel opportunities.”

“The A350’s unparalleled fuel efficiency, range and passenger comfort perfectly align with IndiGo’s ambitious growth plans and international long-haul network ambitions. This milestone reinforces our strong partnership with one of the fastest-growing airlines in the world, and we look forward to supporting their expansion into new long-haul markets,” said Benoît de Saint-Exupéry, EVP Sales of the Commercial Aircraft business at Airbus.

India, the world’s fastest growing aviation market, is witnessing a surge in international travel as the economy grows and household incomes rise. The A350 is perfectly positioned to serve the country’s aspirations for long-range travel.

Bound in a strategic relationship of growth with India for more than half a century, Airbus products and services have catalysed the growth of the country’s civil aviation sector. While the A320 Family aircraft are supporting the democratisation of air travel in India, the A350 has become the reference aircraft to unlock the potential of the international market for the Indian carriers.

The A350 is the world’s most modern and efficient widebody aircraft in the 300-410 seater category. The A350’s includes state-of-the-art technologies and aerodynamics delivering unmatched standards of efficiency and comfort. Its new generation engines and use of lightweight materials bring a 25 per cent advantage in fuel burn, operating costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, compared to previous generation competitor aircraft.

As with all Airbus aircraft, the A350 is already capable of operating with up to 50% Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Airbus aims for all its aircraft to be 100% SAF-capable by 2030.

At the end of September 2025, the A350 had won more than 1,400 orders from 63 customers worldwide.

“While direct competitors are expanding at the gates of the EU, European network airlines are experiencing structural competitive disadvantages,” it said.
Lufthansa pointed out that, for example, on flights from Germany to Asia, 37% passengers flew directly, while another 25% transferred in Europe.
“European airlines operate in one of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions in the world.
Departures from Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO), where Lufthansa Group’s newest hub airline, ITA Airways, is based, are taxed €2,180 ($2,551).","Lufthansa has continued to advocate for changes in European and German legislation that would, in its view, enable European airlines to compete more effectively against incumbents in other countries and states.

The German airline group’s monthly Policy Brief (Politikbrief) newsletter detailed that while airlines should welcome around 5 billion passengers in 2025, profit margins are still low (3.7%). “While direct competitors are expanding at the gates of the EU, European network airlines are experiencing structural competitive disadvantages,” it said.

Lufthansa pointed out that, for example, on flights from Germany to Asia, 37% passengers flew directly, while another 25% transferred in Europe. The remaining 38%, split evenly, were transferred in the Gulf, Turkey, or another country before reaching their final destination in 2010.

By 2024, that had fundamentally changed: 34% passengers now transfer in the Gulf or Turkey, with another 23% stopping elsewhere. 25% travelers are flying non-stops, and the remaining 17% fly with a transfer in Europe.

“Without an active aviation strategy, Germany and Europe are facing increasing pressure in global competition.”

According to the company, airlines from the Gulf region, such as Emirates or Qatar Airways, thrive in the European Union (EU) without having to adhere to the bloc’s regulations. Comparing the operating conditions for Germany, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Lufthansa highlighted that while airlines have to pay aviation taxes in Germany, the same could not be said about Qatar and the UAE.

The same regulatory asymmetry between Germany and Qatar and the UAE is observed in fees (airport or air traffic control (ATC) charges), environmental and consumer protection (such as sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) quotas or EU261 regulation), and labor protections, including the fact that Germany has employment protections, and citizens can join unions and strike.

Though notably, Qatari law permits Qatari citizens to join unions and strike, yet the country’s working-age population in 2023 comprised 2.3 million non-Qatari citizens and around 229,000 Qatari citizens.

“European airlines operate in one of the most heavily regulated jurisdictions in the world. Constantly new environmental regulations, emissions trading, fragmented airspace, and strict passenger compensation rules are driving up costs for EU airlines ever higher.”

Lufthansa stated that regulatory expenses rose by 11% per year between 2014 and 2024, while passenger numbers increased by only 4% annually during the same period. This includes sustainability-related costs, with the German airline group pointing out that tackling climate change is “a global task.”

While SAF is still scarce and expensive, the current “EU climate policy weakens European airlines and hubs in international competition, as it unilaterally increases the cost of transfers in Europe,” resulting in traffic and emissions shifting to other jurisdictions, rather than being reduced.

For example, as part of the ‘Fit for 55’ package, which aims to reduce the EU’s 2030 emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, the ReFuelEU Aviation regulation has mandated a minimum SAF blend of 2% of SAF from January 1, 2025, growing to 5% from January 1, 2030.

As a result, because only departing flights from the EU have to adhere to the mandate, transfers in Frankfurt should be at least €180 ($210) more expensive at Frankfurt Airport (FRA) than at Istanbul Airport (IST) in 2035.

Lastly, Lufthansa pointed out the discrepancy between taxes in Germany and the rest of Europe. For example, an Airbus A320 flight with 150 passengers departing FRA to any EU destination is taxed (aviation tax, security fees, and ATC charges) €4,850 ($5,675). Departures from Rome Fiumicino Airport (FCO), where Lufthansa Group’s newest hub airline, ITA Airways, is based, are taxed €2,180 ($2,551).

Lufthansa’s Policy Brief newsletter has been primarily focused on these issues. The newsletter’s September edition said that aviation taxes are the highest in Europe, while in July, the group stated that “no other European country imposes a greater tax burden on flights than Germany.”

When it published its H1 2025 results on July 31, the opening statement of Carsten Sphor, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Lufthansa Group, read that the “disproportionate burden on European airlines due to unilateral EU regulations also continues to put us at a disadvantage in global competition.”

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill, which creates new subsidies for SAF production, progresses to its next stage in Parliament. SAF is a ‘drop-in’ biofuel that is blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aeroplanes without modification, to reduce the carbon emissions of flying.

By blending customers’ SAF into Exolum’s national aviation fuel pipeline network, the investment will boost green aviation fuel supplies to airports across southern England and Wales, including those at Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The company is also announcing that the facility will be the first of a new UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs it plans as part of its 2,000km pipeline network, creating a SAF Superhighway that will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to the jet fuel for 40% of flights leaving the UK’s airports.

Expected to be operational from 2026, the initial investment at Redcliffe Bay will support the greening of the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York a year, supporting the UK’s position as a global leader in green aviation.

The plans will enable long-term green investment in SAF production plants across the UK and, in the case of Redcliffe Bay, south-west of England and southern Wales, by providing a crucial, independent route to market for when they become operational, which is expected later this decade.

Unblended SAF will initially be delivered by ships to Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock, before being transported to Exolum’s Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. It will then be stored and blended on-site with conventional aviation fuel, to create the ready-to-use ‘drop-in’ fuel that is then distributed by Exolum’s national pipeline system.

The project includes several infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station at Redcliffe Bay, on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The plans include:

Conversion of existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, before it is blended with conventional aviation fuel.

Within the existing tanks, the installation of a state-of-the-art SAF blending infrastructure, which will ensure that SAF is blended with conventional aviation fuel to the correct technical standards.

Modifying existing systems by installing new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves to circulate SAF between storage tanks and to pump into the pipeline network.

Exolum North West Europe Lead, Stephen Land, says, “Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s world-leading position at the forefront of global sustainable aviation.

“The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

UK Department for Transport Aviation Minister, Keir Mather MP, says, “I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another major vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading.”

“We’re also investing £63 million to support the production of homegrown SAF which, alongside our mandate to increase the supply of SAF in aviation fuel to UK flights, will drive demand for greener fuels and support jobs in the UK.”",https://theenergyst.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/RCB-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:57:50.229976

Together with these three corporations, we are contributing to the reduction of part of the emissions generated by certain corporate trips and cargo flights operated by Iberia, promoting the use of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) on these flights. This means a reduction in global emissions in the aviation sector, contributing directly to the fight against climate change, with an estimated reduction of between 10% and 30% in Scope 3 emissions from companies in their activity with Iberia.

What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?

SAF is an alternative to traditional fuel to reduce the carbon footprint of flights

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is an alternative fuel for flights. It is produced from agricultural or forestry waste, or from renewable hydrogen, CO2 captured from the air or industrial processes. Compared to traditional kerosene, SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by around 80% in terms of life cycle, according to the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).

The great advantage of SAF is that it can be used without making any changes to aircraft engines or airport infrastructure. It is therefore currently the viable alternative for reducing part of the emissions in the aviation sector.

Why are we joining this initiative?

In addition, Wagner Sustainable Fuels has become Australia’s first RSB (Roundtable of Sustainable Biomaterials) certified SAF company. This gives customers a world-leading accounting process and guarantees chain-of-custody and SAF authenticity.

“This is a defining moment for sustainable aviation in Australia and underscores Wagner Sustainable Fuels’ commitment to provide solutions today for the challenges of tomorrow,” said Matt Doyle, CEO Wagner Sustainable Fuels. “The launch of our Toowoomba Terminal is the start of our plans to deliver decarbonization benefits and meet the aviation sector’s growing demand through flexible, efficient and scalable SAF blending.”

“With the support from Boeing, we’re focused on bringing large scale SAF and renewable diesel production to Australia and integrating it into the global supply chain through the Brisbane Recycling and SAF Facility, which is currently under planning and development,” said Doyle.

Unlike conventional jet fuel, SAF is produced from renewable or non-fossil fuel sources – like municipal solid waste, agricultural waste, animal fats and vegetable oils – and significantly reduces carbon emissions over the fuel’s lifecycle, making it a more sustainable alternative for powering aircraft.

SAF blending is the controlled mixing of “neat” SAF with conventional fossil jet fuel that, once tested and certified, is a pure drop-in aviation fuel acceptable within current airport and aircraft infrastructure.

“Current global regulations permit commercial aircraft to use up to a 50/50 blend of SAF and fossil jet fuel. This will continue to rise as additional production pathways are certified,” said Dr. Kimberly Camrass, Boeing head of Asia Pacific Sustainability.

“Wagner’s commercial blending terminal is a powerful step forward in aviation decarbonisation, boosting regional employment and opening new export markets. It will also provide important learnings to support the development of robust and scalable SAF supply chains within Australia.”

According to the Boeing CSIRO SAF Roadmap, jet fuel demand in Australia is projected to grow by 75% by 2050. Wagner Sustainable Fuels partnered with FlyORO to deploy advanced and scalable SAF blending technologies in Australia for commercial, general aviation and defence customers.

“FlyORO’s modular SAF blending system, AlphaLite, doesn’t just help reduce emissions - it creates a scalable platform for collaboration, co-investment, and transparency across the fuel value chain,” said Jonathan Yeo, FlyORO’s Chief Executive Officer.

“This integrated model complements FlyORO’s broader deployment strategy, including standalone facilities such as the one operating in Singapore.” “This is how we unlock speed and scale. We’re excited to partner with the leadership of Wagner Sustainable Fuels and Boeing to pioneer a more sustainable flying ecosystem in Australia.”",https://www.asdnews.com/NewsImages/b/94248/101932_O.jpg,N,,2025-10-17 10:58:29.696511

European airline CEOs have called on EU leaders to launch a strategic dialogue for aviation, warning that regulatory inertia and rising operational costs are undermining competitiveness and the sector’s ability to decarbonise. In a joint letter coordinated by Airlines for Europe (A4E), the CEOs stress that fragmented airspace management, outdated passenger rules and uneven SAF policies are driving traffic and investment outside Europe.

The letter highlights persistent inefficiencies in air traffic management, with passengers experiencing over 12 million minutes of delay this summer due to limited capacity and strike disruptions. A4E urges EU institutions to mandate arbitration before industrial action, require 21 days’ notice of strikes and guarantee protection for overflights to reduce operational uncertainty. The group also calls for reform of compensation rules, arguing that the current three-hour threshold forces airlines to cancel flights unnecessarily and that a five-hour limit would improve flexibility while maintaining consumer protection.

On sustainability, A4E says the Sustainable Transport Investment Plan must focus on de-risking sustainable aviation fuel production and lowering its price. The organisation proposes a European SAF intermediary to aggregate demand, multi-year SAF allowances, a book-and-claim system and reinvestment of ETS revenues in decarbonisation projects. A4E also calls for a CBAM-style mechanism to ensure parity between EU and non-EU airlines. Without these measures, it warns, the current mandates will raise fares, distort competition and slow progress towards net zero.

The CEOs stress that the European airline sector supports more than 12 million jobs and contributes 4 per cent of EU GDP, yet continues to face rising taxes, capacity bottlenecks and fragmented regulation. They argue that maintaining accessibility and connectivity requires coherent reform linking competitiveness with decarbonisation, not additional regulatory burdens.

US-led pressure on shipping deal an attack on EU sovereignty, says T&E

Transport and Environment has accused the United States, the UAE and Saudi Arabia of attempting to weaken global maritime decarbonisation rules by pressing the EU to abandon its own measures in exchange for a diluted global deal at the International Maritime Organization. The NGO warns that the proposed Net Zero Framework would remove key European safeguards and undermine the bloc’s leadership on shipping emissions.

According to T&E, the US-led group is seeking to block a global agreement that would introduce a modest carbon price for shipping while pressuring Europe to dismantle its ETS and FuelEU Maritime law. The organisation says the draft framework would exempt 85 per cent of Europe’s shipping emissions from carbon pricing and encourage large-scale use of crop-based biofuels associated with deforestation and food insecurity.

T&E argues that the EU must not sacrifice its climate and industrial sovereignty to foreign oil interests. It warns that abandoning the ETS would deprive the EU of €10 billion in annual revenues currently earmarked for green investment, while surrendering control of policy design to the IMO could lock in weaker standards for years.

Executive director William Todts said the negotiations mark a decisive test of Europe’s credibility as a climate leader. “This is a shameless attempt to undermine Europe’s sovereignty,” he said. “EU negotiators must not cave into efforts to dismantle vital climate measures that have been negotiated and adopted at home.”

EU vehicle emissions review exposes split over carbon-neutral fuels and 2035 targets

The European Commission’s consultation on revising CO₂ standards for new cars and vans closed on 10 October, drawing nearly 1,000 submissions and exposing deep divisions over the future of Europe’s light-duty vehicle framework. The outcome will determine whether the EU maintains its 2035 phase-out of combustion engines or integrates carbon-neutral fuels into the compliance regime.

The Federation of German Industries argues that Europe’s automotive sector faces dual challenges from decarbonisation and digitalisation, compounded by weakening EV demand and international competition. It calls for revising the 2035 target to a 90 per cent reduction, lifting the de facto ban on combustion engines and creating new categories for carbon-neutral fuel (CNF) vehicles and advanced plug-in hybrids. CNFs are defined as fuels whose lifecycle emissions are fully offset through renewable production.

Électricité de France takes the opposite view, calling the 2035 target essential for investor confidence and the expansion of Europe’s electrification ecosystem. It argues that weakening the framework would slow infrastructure deployment, increase costs and undermine industrial strategy. EDF supports corporate fleet mandates, social leasing schemes and second-hand market incentives to accelerate EV adoption.

The International Road Transport Union highlights grid and infrastructure constraints as major obstacles to electrification, warning that delays in grid upgrades threaten the viability of commercial operators. It calls for binding EU rules to ensure grid expansion, an enforceable right to plug and recycling of ETS and Eurovignette revenues into road transport decarbonisation. The European Biodiesel Board adds that tailpipe-only accounting excludes biofuels’ proven contributions to emission reduction, calling for the introduction of a carbon correction factor and a CNF-only vehicle category.

Consumer and environmental groups, including BEUC, e-Mobility Europe and T&E, defend the current regulatory framework as the cornerstone of Europe’s industrial and climate strategy. They argue that electrification remains the most effective route to affordability and emissions reduction, warning that attempts to reopen the 2035 agreement would damage investor confidence and delay the transition. BMW supports flexibility through CNF recognition and digital verification but calls for long-term adoption of life-cycle assessment to reflect material and production emissions.

E-fuel producers call on IMO to strengthen Net Zero Framework

Twenty e-fuel producers, including European Energy, Liquid Wind and HIF Global, have called on the International Maritime Organization to adopt the Net Zero Framework with targeted incentives for green fuels. In a joint letter, the group urged delegates to send a clear policy signal for investment in hydrogen-based fuels, arguing that the current draft lacks the ambition needed to drive large-scale decarbonisation.

The producers propose an “e-fuels multiplier” that would allow certified fuels to count multiple times towards compliance obligations, helping early-stage projects reach final investment decisions. They warn that without such incentives, the framework will reinforce dependence on transitional fuels such as LNG and first-generation biofuels.

Transport and Environment’s Alison Shaw said shipping could become a major offtaker for hundreds of projects worldwide but only if the IMO provides a credible regulatory structure. “The current framework leaves e-fuels competing against cheaper, higher-emission alternatives,” she said. The signatories argue that adopting the framework without a clear prioritisation of e-fuels risks stalling the maritime transition before it begins.

Study finds European bike-sharing generates €305 million in annual benefits

A study commissioned by EIT Urban Mobility and Cycling Industries Europe, conducted by EY, has quantified for the first time the economic and social return on investment from bike-sharing systems across Europe. The report estimates €305 million in annual benefits, confirming shared cycling as a key component of sustainable urban mobility.

Bike-sharing now operates in more than 150 cities, from Paris to Brussels and London, with a combined fleet of over 430,000 bicycles. According to the study, shared bikes prevent 46,000 tonnes of CO₂ emissions and 200 tonnes of air pollutants each year while avoiding 1,000 chronic diseases, equivalent to €40 million in healthcare savings. They also ease congestion and support 6,000 full-time jobs across the continent.

EIT Urban Mobility’s Bernadette Bergsma said the study shows that bike-sharing delivers measurable economic and environmental returns, while CIE’s Lauha Fried described it as “an investment that pays back cities and citizens alike.” The report concludes that consistent policy support and stronger integration with public transport could raise benefits to €1 billion a year by 2030.",https://ibexpub.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Sustainable-transport-news-and-pol-intel-22-07-25.png,N,,2025-10-17 08:56:10.518701

Rolls-Royce confirmed that the Pearl 10X has successfully completed its full test envelope, including durability runs, environmental assessments, performance validation, and airborne trials aboard its 747-200 flying testbed. The programme also verified the engine’s ability to operate on 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

“The test phase has confirmed the maturity of the product,” Rolls-Royce said, while declining to forecast when EASA certification will be granted.

The company is now assembling final reports and technical data for the regulator’s evaluation.

Bharat Forge to manufacture Pearl 10X engine components for Rolls-Royce

On 16 October, Rolls-Royce signed a new agreement with Bharat Forge Ltd. to manufacture and supply fan blades for the Pearl 700 and Pearl 10X engines, deepening its collaboration with one of India’s leading aerospace component manufacturers.

The deal, signed at Rolls-Royce’s Dahlewitz facility near Berlin, supports the company’s goal of doubling its supply-chain sourcing from India by 2030 and building local manufacturing capacity under the Make in India initiative.

Bharat Forge has been a key supplier to Rolls-Royce’s business aviation programmes since 2020 and delivered its first zero-defect fan blade for the Pearl 700 in 2024. It will now expand into producing precision components for the new Pearl 10X.

Pearl 10X: powering Dassault’s next-generation Falcon 10X

The Pearl 10X is the exclusive powerplant for the upcoming Dassault Falcon 10X, making it a pivotal element in the aircraft’s ultra-long-range performance ambitions.

The first Falcon 10X prototype is in final assembly at Dassault’s Bordeaux-Mérignac facility, though no first flight date has been publicly confirmed. Rolls-Royce says it remains “on track to support Dassault’s programme, including the upcoming flight-test campaign.”

To prepare for service entry, Rolls-Royce has opened a customer support centre in Mérignac, adjacent to Dassault’s final assembly line, to provide maintenance and technical assistance once operations begin.

Inside the advanced design and technology of Rolls-Royce’s Pearl 10X engine

Rolls-Royce describes the Pearl 10X as the most powerful member of the Pearl family. It combines the Advance2 core with a high-performance low-pressure system, delivering over 18,000 lbf of thrust and around 5% better fuel efficiency than previous models.

A standout innovation is the use of 3D-printed combustor tiles: the first time Rolls-Royce has deployed additive manufacturing at this scale in a commercial engine. The design allows more complex geometries, improved cooling, and enhanced durability.

Other technologies include a blisked fan, efficient high-pressure compressor, and shroudless high-pressure turbine, optimising both weight and aerodynamics.

How the Pearl 10X compares to rival business jet engines

In the ultra-long-range, large-cabin business jet segment, engine performance is a critical differentiator.

The Rolls-Royce Pearl 700, rated around 18,250 lbf, powers Gulfstream’s G700 and G800, with over 70 units delivered.

GE Aerospace’s Passport engine, producing roughly 18,900 lbf, powers Bombardier’s Global 7500 and the upcoming Global 8000.

For the Falcon 10X, the Pearl 10X must not only match these rivals in thrust and efficiency but also exceed them in sustainability, lifecycle costs, and aftermarket support.

Next steps: EASA certification, flight testing and entry into service

With testing completed, Rolls-Royce will now submit its data to EASA for detailed evaluation of airworthiness, emissions, safety margins, and durability.

The regulator’s review timeline remains uncertain, but certification is a prerequisite before Dassault can begin full flight testing.

Once airborne, the Falcon 10X prototype will undergo an extensive campaign covering systems integration, structural loads, performance validation, and operational readiness.

Dassault and Rolls-Royce are targeting 2027 for Falcon 10X entry into service, positioning the aircraft to compete directly with Gulfstream’s G700/G800 and Bombardier’s Global 8000 in the top tier of business aviation.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) has emerged as a key solution to decarbonizing the aviation sector, but scaling production efficiently and cost-effectively remains a hurdle. OXCCU, a spin-off from the University of Oxford, is tackling this challenge head-on with its innovative Fischer–Tropsch-based technology that converts CO2 and waste feedstocks directly into jet fuel.

In a recent interview, Andrew Symes, CEO and Co-founder of OXCCU, shared insights on the company’s latest $28 million Series B funding, their breakthrough technology, and how SAF production can scale sustainably to meet global demand. From differentiating their approach from other SAF pathways to addressing feedstock, cost, and regulatory challenges, Symes provides a clear roadmap for the future of aviation fuel.

Find the conversation below:

Q1: Could you tell us about your recent funding round and how you plan to expend this investment?

A: We’ve announced a $28 million Series B to build our second demonstration plant next to our existing facility at Oxford Airport. The new site is seven times larger and will help us scale production, expand lab facilities, and accelerate commercialization, aiming for a commercial-scale SAF plant by the end of the decade.

Q2: How does OXCCU differentiate itself from other SAF companies?

A: Our core innovation lies in our Fischer–Tropsch (FT) catalyst and process. Unlike traditional FT systems that only convert carbon monoxide (CO) and often produce heavier fuels, our technology can directly convert carbon dioxide (CO2) and CO into jet fuel-range hydrocarbons — eliminating additional conversion steps and improving efficiency.

Q3: For the layman, how is the Fischer–Tropsch process different from HEFA or ATJ pathways?

A: HEFA uses waste oils like used cooking oil or soybean oil, which are hydrotreated to make jet fuel, but feedstock availability is limited.

ATJ converts ethanol (from corn or other crops) into jet fuel but isn’t fully scalable since it relies on food-based feedstocks.

In contrast, our FT process can use genuine waste sources (biogas, lignin, cellulose, or captured CO2) and directly produce jet fuel with fewer steps, lower emissions, and better economics.

Q4: Would you call this an upgraded version of Fischer–Tropsch?

A: Exactly. It builds on traditional iron-based FT catalysts used historically for coal-to-liquids, but we’ve adapted it to handle high CO2 streams and target jet fuel selectively — making it far more efficient and sustainable.

Q5: Beyond aviation, what other industries could use your CO2-to-fuel technology?

A: Our process also produces naphtha, which can be used in chemical and plastic manufacturing. This helps decarbonize both aviation and petrochemical sectors, promoting carbon circularity.

Q6: Can CO2 captured from industrial sites be used for SAF production?

A: Yes, but it depends on regulatory approval. In the UK and EU (until 2041), industrial CO2 is acceptable. Using it doubles carbon utilization — giving each carbon atom two uses before release. Purity and source matter; ethanol, ammonia, and natural gas plants provide the best CO2 streams, while post-combustion CO2 is too impure and costly to purify.

Q7: Your process uses electricity for gasification. How sustainable is that if the grid isn’t fully green?

A: Even partial electrification reduces emissions compared to burning fossil fuels. The greener the grid, the better — but even moderate renewables significantly improve carbon intensity.

Q8: So, your technology is scalable only in regions with abundant renewable energy?

A: Not necessarily. It depends on the feedstock. For biogas-to-SAF, electricity use is relatively low, so it’s feasible even in regions without a fully green grid.

Q9: From an operator’s perspective, how do airlines choose between different SAF pathways?

A: They don’t need to. All SAFs are blended and must meet ASTM safety standards. Airlines receive Jet A-1 fuel that performs identically, regardless of the production route.

Q10: Will aircraft require modifications to use 100% SAF in the future?

A: No major changes are needed. Current engines can already use SAF. The only potential adjustment may be to reduce aromatic content in fuels, but that’s minor compared to retrofits in other industries like shipping.

Q11: Global SAF demand is expected to fall short by 23 million tonnes by 2035. What’s driving this gap?

A: Two main challenges: feedstock availability and technology cost. We need scalable solutions using genuine waste — not crops — and efficient processes that reduce conversion steps and capital costs.

Q12: Which of these challenges can be solved fastest?

A: They must be solved together. Once we have cost-effective technology for real waste feedstocks, financing and regulation will naturally follow.

Q13: Do you think the UK SAF mandate announced last year will be as strict as the EU SAF mandate?

A: RefuelEU is a fairly stringent regulation, but its impact depends on the buyout prices. If those prices are too low, the policy may not deliver the desired results. However, the mechanism that increases penalties over time should help strengthen its effectiveness.

Overall, it’s a significant piece of regulation that sends a strong signal to the industry: aviation needs a solution, and we must start scaling SAF technologies now. Delaying action would make it much harder to reach higher blend targets later.

Q14: How do you envision the aviation industry in the next decade?

A: SAF will start small — around 1–5% blend ratios — but scale rapidly. The availability of waste CO2, wood, straw, and biogas gives massive potential. Like wind and solar, SAF will grow from niche to mainstream and eventually reshape the petrochemical landscape.

China's Ministry of Commerce, which is responsible for quota issues, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Shandong Haike Chemical, Shandong Sanju Bioenergy and Bain Capital-backed EcoCeres were awarded export quotas for a total of 788,000-828,000 metric tons a year, according to three industry and trade sources, and Chinese commodities consultancy JLC in a report.

Shandong Sanju Bioenergy was allotted around 158,000 tons and Shandong Haike Chemical 370,000 tons, while EcoCeres received 260,000-300,000 tons of export permits, the sources and JLC said.

This brings the total amount of SAF quotas issued so far in 2025 to around 1.2 million tons, including the first such permits alloted to Zhejiang Jiaao Enprotech.

It is not compulsory for the new recipients to fully utilise the allotted permits by the end of 2025, according to the JLC report, but it is also unclear if the companies need to re-apply for quotas next year.

Singapore’s groundbreaking approach to sustainable aviation fuel could well serve as a model for other countries looking to make similar strides in the pursuit of a greener, more sustainable aviation industry.","In a groundbreaking move to promote sustainability in aviation, Singapore has introduced a historic flight levy aimed at accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by airlines. This levy, approved on October 14, 2025, will fund the procurement of SAF for all airlines operating at Changi and Seletar airports. The initiative is part of Singapore’s broader strategy to reduce the aviation industry’s carbon footprint, with the goal of making SAF account for 1% of all jet fuel used at the two airports by 2026, and increasing it to 3-5% by 2030. The move positions Singapore as a global leader in sustainable aviation practices, setting a precedent for other nations to follow.

On October 14, 2025, Singapore passed a historic piece of legislation that introduces a levy on all flights departing from the city-state. The move aims to accelerate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by airlines operating at Changi Airport and Seletar Airport, marking a significant milestone in the country’s commitment to a greener aviation industry.

The bill, which is the first of its kind globally, will see airlines contributing to the fund, managed by the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS). The revenue generated from the levy will support the large-scale procurement of SAF and help manage demand for this eco-friendly alternative to traditional jet fuel. The initiative underscores Singapore’s forward-thinking approach to sustainable aviation practices, aligning with its broader environmental goals.

The primary aim of the legislation is to facilitate a transition toward using sustainable aviation fuel. As part of its target, Singapore has set a goal for SAF to make up 1% of the total jet fuel used at Changi and Seletar airports by 2026. Looking ahead, the government plans to ramp up this figure to 3% to 5% by 2030. This ambitious target is part of the country’s broader efforts to reduce the aviation sector’s carbon footprint and contribute to global sustainability.

While this levy will affect passengers departing from Singapore, the additional cost is expected to be relatively modest. Passengers flying on economy tickets may see a slight rise in fares, depending on the distance of their journey. Short-haul flights to destinations like Bangkok will see an increase of approximately S$3 (US$2.20), while mid-haul flights, such as those to Tokyo, will incur an additional S$6. For long-haul routes, like those to Europe or North America, the increase could be as much as S$16. These increases are seen as necessary to ensure that the aviation sector can transition toward more sustainable practices without placing undue strain on airline operations or passengers.

A key feature of the new system is the centralised procurement of SAF. By pooling the demand for sustainable fuel across all carriers operating in Singapore, the CAAS will be able to negotiate better commercial terms with fuel suppliers, ensuring cost efficiency. This centralised model is expected to streamline the process, making it more cost-effective for airlines to adopt SAF as a standard practice.

This approach also allows for greater control over the distribution and availability of sustainable fuel. By managing the bulk purchase and allocation of SAF, Singapore aims to ensure that its airports maintain a steady supply of this crucial resource, thereby supporting airlines in their environmental goals.

In an effort to ensure that Changi Airport remains competitive as a global air hub, the government has stated that passengers in transit or transfer will not be subject to the levy. This exclusion is designed to maintain the appeal of Changi as a stopover destination for international travelers, a key component of its global air traffic flow. By focusing the levy only on departing passengers, Singapore is able to balance its environmental objectives with its strategic goal of retaining its position as a leading international aviation hub.

The new levy is expected to have minimal impact on passenger travel behavior, with only a slight increase in the overall cost of air travel. The Singaporean government has reassured travelers that the rise in airfares will be small and will not have a significant impact on their travel plans. Despite the increase, the initiative is seen as a positive step forward in reducing the carbon footprint of the aviation sector.

This initiative aligns with Singapore’s broader environmental ambitions and contributes to the global effort to decarbonize the aviation industry. The city-state has long been a leader in promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility, and the introduction of this levy is another testament to its commitment to building a more sustainable future. By encouraging the widespread adoption of sustainable aviation fuel, Singapore is positioning itself as a key player in the green aviation movement, setting an example for other countries and airports around the world to follow.

Looking ahead, the success of this policy will depend on the widespread adoption of SAF by airlines and the continued collaboration between the government, fuel suppliers, and the aviation industry. As the world continues to grapple with the challenges posed by climate change, initiatives like this will be crucial in helping the aviation sector reduce its environmental impact and meet its sustainability targets.

The company added that it still hopes to develop its South Dakota site.

Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.

Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.

Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.

“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.

Company previously broke ground in SD

Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide captured from ethanol plants in five states to an underground storage site in North Dakota.

But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance, which has contributed to two rejected Summit permit applications in South Dakota and a ban on eminent domain for carbon pipelines adopted by the Legislature and signed into law by Gov. Larry Rhoden.

North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

In 2022, Rhoden attended and spoke at Gevo’s groundbreaking near Lake Preston, where it proposed to build its plant in South Dakota. Rhoden was lieutenant governor at the time. Then-Gov. Kristi Noem said in a press release on the day of the groundbreaking that “businesses are choosing South Dakota because we are ‘Open for Business,’ and we give them the opportunity to succeed.” The press release described the Gevo project as the “largest economic investment in South Dakota history.”

On Thursday, Rhoden’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In Iowa, where Summit is based, the company is seeking to change its pipeline permit. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.

A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.

He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.

Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain time at WIX Barn near Richardton.

ND location provides access to oil industry

Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.

“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.

Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.

Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.

Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.

“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.

Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.

‘Matter of when’ with SD site

Gruber said he was grateful that the Department of Energy is working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.

As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.

“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”

But the Gevo officials said the demand for sustainable aviation fuel meant the company could not wait for the Summit pipeline. Summit had hoped to be operating in 2024 but has yet to start construction as it tries to secure all the permits it needs.

“We can’t sit around for that,” Gruber said. “We’ve got a mission here.”

“We’ve got a mission here.” Reach North Dakota Monitor Deputy Editor Jeff Beach at jbeach@northdakotamonitor.com.","A sustainable aviation fuel developer plans to shift investment from South Dakota to North Dakota, in part because of delays in the development of the multi-state Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline.

Colorado-based Gevo had obtained a $1.46 billion loan through the U.S. Department of Energy to build a jet fuel plant at Lake Preston, South Dakota. Company officials told the North Dakota Monitor on Thursday that it instead will push ahead with making jet fuel at the Richardton, North Dakota, ethanol plant it bought last year. Gevo is working with the Department of Energy to transfer the loan to expand the North Dakota site.

Red Trail Energy at Richardton in 2022 became the first ethanol plant in the country to capture and store carbon dioxide, taking advantage of its location in an area with the right geology for permanent underground storage.

Gevo plans to expand the North Dakota ethanol plant, which turns corn into fuel. It would convert the ethanol into higher-value aviation fuel in a process it calls alcohol to jet. Carbon capture is a key part of making sustainable aviation fuel.

“We don’t have to share pipelines. We don’t have to wait. We’re already doing it,” CEO Pat Gruber said of carbon capture at the North Dakota site.

Gevo’s South Dakota site relied on the planned Summit Carbon Solutions pipeline to take carbon dioxide to an underground storage site in North Dakota. But the future of that project in South Dakota is in doubt because of landowner resistance and state permitting hurdles.

North Dakota attorney general says legal action against South Dakota pipeline law not an option

Iowa-based Summit is seeking to change its pipeline permit in that state. Summit wants to remove North Dakota as the designated end point for the pipeline.

A spokesperson for Summit said Friday the change “keeps open the option to transport CO2 west through Nebraska or north through South Dakota,” reported the Iowa Capital Dispatch.

Gruber said the jet fuel production in North Dakota would be 30 million gallons of jet fuel a year, half of what was planned for South Dakota. But he said the 500 acres at Richardton could allow for expansion.

He said the jet fuel plant would cost about $500 million. Gruber noted that is substantially less than $2.6 billion it planned to spend on the South Dakota site.

Gevo is hosting a meeting Monday to answer questions for farmers and others in the Richardton area. The meeting will be from 6 to 7:30 Mountain Time at WIX Barn near Richardton.

Gruber said building in North Dakota also opens the door to Gevo selling its carbon to the oil industry. North Dakota oil producers could buy the carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery — pumping gas into the well to help the well produce more oil.

“This is a great opportunity for us, and we sit right next to Bakken,” Gruber said, referring to the Bakken Formation. North Dakota is the nation’s No. 3 oil producing state, with most of it coming from the Bakken.

Oil industry and state leaders have touted enhanced oil recovery as a way for North Dakota to sustain oil production for decades to come and continue to provide the state with tax revenue.

Gruber said Gevo has started discussion with oil companies, but he said the infrastructure to make enhanced oil recovery possible is still years away.

Ethanol plants are seen as a prime source for carbon dioxide because the gas is captured from the fermentation process of turning corn into ethanol instead of from the burning of fuel.

“It’s pure, concentrated CO2,” Gruber said.

Another benefit of carbon capture for Gevo is the ability to sell carbon credits to other industries with high carbon emissions. Gevo in September announced it is partnering with Biorecro North America on carbon credit sales generated at the North Dakota facility.

Gruber said he was grateful the Department of Energy for working with Gevo on transferring the federal loan, though there are steps remaining to complete the process. Gevo filed a document with the federal Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday of its intent to use the loan money in North Dakota.

As for the future of the eastern South Dakota site, Gevo officials said it remains a great industrial location and will be developed.

“The are other things we can do at that site,” said Paul Bloom, Gevo’s chief business officer. “It’s a matter of when.”

Las Vegas, NV, Oct. 16, 2025 – The National Business Aviation Association Business Aviation Convention & Exhibition (NBAA-BACE) supercharged an industry driven by strong growth and a blazing pace of innovation.

From a packed exhibit hall and standing-room-only crowds, to a dazzling NBAA Aircraft Connection and nearly nonstop announcements, the 2025 NBAA-BACE showcased an industry ready to take on the future.

Business aviation’s most powerful event, NBAA-BACE took place Oct. 14-16, 2025, at the Las Vegas Convention Center and Henderson Executive Airport (HND).

“From the moment we opened the doors, it was clear this NBAA-BACE would be a monumental gathering for our industry,” said NBAA President and CEO Ed Bolen. “With boundless energy and great vibes, this show captured all that is unique and exciting about business aviation.”

The 2025 show led off with an unforgettable performance by multiplatinum artist, pilot and aviation champion Dierks Bentley, who shared how his career in music-making has been interwoven with his love of aviation. On the keynote stage, Bolen presented aerospace visionary Steuart Walton with business aviation’s highest honor, NBAA’s Meritorious Service to Aviation Award.

A dizzying array of new technologies, never-before-seen aircraft and business ventures were unveiled at NBAA-BACE, including the world debut of Textron Aviation’s new Cessna Citation Ascend midsize jet and Otto Aerospace’s Phantom 3500 business jet, featuring advanced laminar-flow design.

Newly formed company BOND chose NBAA-BACE for its launch as a fractional provider, announcing its large order of 50 Bombardier Challenger 3500 and Global 6500 jets. Real Jet, a business aviation brokerage firm, also made its rollout at the show.

Blockbuster deals and innovation milestones marked the convention from start to finish. Bombardier announced its Global 8000 had achieved a max operating speed of Mach 0.95, becoming the world’s fastest subsonic civil aircraft.

With an all-new format this year, the NBAA Aircraft Connection buzzed with the full diversity of high-tech business aircraft, from pistons to turboprops and jets. Gulfstream exhibited nearly its entire line, with a mockup of the just-revealed G300 making its NBAA-BACE debut.

The new Tribute to Flight Pavilion hosted vintage airplanes from a Learjet 23 and World War II aircraft to the Jet Age alongside cutting-edge models, such as Game Aerospace’s aerobatic GB1 GameBird.

In the convention center’s entryway atrium, Archer Aviation showed off its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) Midnight. Next to the futuristic eVTOL, the all-new NBAA-BACE Creator Studio, powered by Signature Aviation, provided a venue to connect with some of the most high-profile social media influencers and podcasters in business aviation.

On the show floor, Boom Supersonic, the startup developing a faster-than-sound jet, exhibited at NBAA-BACE for the first time. Skyryse demoed its simplified flight control system to enhance safety and make aircraft easier to operate. Attendees had a chance to see uAvionix air traffic management systems for safely integrating advanced air mobility into the nation’s airspace.

At a timely newsmakers lunch on the show’s media day, Rep. Sam Graves (R-6-MO), Congress’ lead transportation policymaker, spoke about the urgent push in Washington to modernize the nation’s air traffic control system. Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), spoke about the importance of the industry’s unified collaboration on safety leadership.

CNBC’s Phil LeBeau moderated a discussion with the CEOs of Bombardier, Embraer Executive Jets, Flexjet and Textron Aviation on business aviation’s future, the role of AI and ongoing workforce challenges.

NBAA-BACE provided countless opportunities to foster connection and promote new ideas.

The interactive NBAA Flight Deck hosted conversations with top leaders on the next generation of airspace, safety and the fast-moving business aviation market. In a year of intense focus on aviation safety, NBAA hosted the association’s latest National Safety Forum, NBAA Single-Pilot Safety Standdown and NBAA Small Operators Symposium.

The inaugural NBAA-BACE Military Connect presented a special program designed for veterans, by veterans, for those exploring a civilian career in business aviation. Military Connect offered a full slate of sessions, networking opportunities, job search tools in the Career Zone and access to hundreds of potential employers.

At an overflowing and exuberant YoPro Networking Reception and Helpy Hour, the NBAA Young Professionals (YoPros) celebrated their annual hands-on community service project. NBAA Collegiate Connect gave students a firsthand look at jobs in business aviation, with advice from industry pros at a range of career stages and tips for breaking into the industry.

At the show’s Awards Luncheon, NBAA’s 2025 Top 40 Under 40 were recognized and Aviation Personnel International CEO Sheryl Barden received business aviation’s highest honor, the NBAA Meritorious Service to Aviation Award, to a standing ovation.

In total, there were more than 75 education sessions at NBAA-BACE on hot topics, from the latest thinking about leadership, maintenance, operations, regulations and more.

Before and after the show, NBAA-BACE offered five Professional Development Program (PDP) courses to help people in the industry level-up their careers. The show also held its inaugural “Maintenance Track,” which allowed participants to qualify for up to eight hours of inspection authorization (IA) renewal credit.

The 2025 NBAA Tax, Regulatory and Risk Management Conference gave a timely look at aircraft transactions in a shifting tax-and-tariff environment.

The Business Aviation Sustainability Summit charted the industry’s mission to net-zero emissions, innovations and the market for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which can reduce aviation’s lifecycle carbon emissions by as much as 80%. Las Vegas-area airports also made SAF available throughout 2025 NBAA-BACE.

“The 2025 NBAA-BACE fired the imagination, inspired an industry and highlighted the breakthroughs and pioneers ushering in a bright new era in business aviation,” Bolen said. “Business was conducted and connections made. This show had a tremendous vibe.”

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R.
1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.","H.R. 1, the so-called “One Big Beautiful Bill” Act (OBBBA), enacted on July 4, 2025, expands the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit (45Z) by extending it through 2029 and loosening eligibility requirements associated with transportation fuels’ carbon intensity (CI). Simultaneously, amendments to the 45Z credit within H.R. 1 dramatically reduce the maximum per-gallon credit value available to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) producers: from $1.75/gallon to $1.00/gallon. Together, these and other changes to 45Z are expected to: (1) cost taxpayers $25.7 billion from FY25-34 (despite repealing the higher credit value for SAF), (2) expand tax credits for conventional biofuels that already benefit from other federal support and have limited greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential, and (3) limit federal incentives for domestic production of innovative fuels like SAF. 45Z as modified will not decrease GHG emissions of domestic fuel or promote production of domestic clean fuels.

Background

Congress created 45Z in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. The IRA set the maximum credit value at $1.00/gallon for eligible clean fuels, which included those with a CI of less than 50 kg CO2e/mmBTU produced in calendar years 2025-2027. Additionally, SAF was granted a higher maximum credit value of $1.75/gallon. Congress also required the tax credit to be adjusted annually for inflation. Fuels that earned other tax credits, like 45V (hydrogen production) or 45Q (carbon sequestration), were not allowed to stack these credits with 45Z. When the IRA was passed, the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the 45Z credit (in place from 2025-2027) would cost about $2.9 billion over FY25-28.

The IRA made other changes to federal biofuel tax credits, including eliminating the biomass-based diesel credit, the second-generation biofuel credit, and other alternative fuel tax credits with the intent of replacing them with the technology-neutral 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit. In addition, the IRA created the standalone 40B SAF tax credit, available in calendar years 2023-2024 (i.e., the two-year period before 45Z became operative). Fuels that reduced lifecycle GHG emissions by at least 50% could earn a credit of $1.25/gallon, up to $1.75/gallon on a sliding scale for each percent reduction in GHG emissions. Beginning in 2025, 40B was folded into 45Z, maintaining the maximum rate for SAF of $1.75/gallon.

Table 1: IRA fuel tax credits

Significant H.R. 1 Amendments to 45Z

One of the most significant changes to 45Z within H.R. 1 is a provision excluding emissions associated with indirect land use change (ILUC) from a fuel’s CI score. Ignoring ILUC can decrease CI scores of certain land-intensive conventional biofuels like corn ethanol and soy biodiesel by ignoring up to 20-25 g CO2e/MJ, yielding higher per-gallon tax credits for these fuels. ILUC-related GHG emissions are generated from land use conversion (e.g., clearing grasslands or forests – releasing carbon in the process – to replace food production on lands converted to biofuel crops) and other market-mediated effects not directly related to the biofuel crop. ILUC-related GHG emissions of biofuels derived from feedstocks that do not require dedicated land, such as agricultural and forestry residues and wastes, or feedstocks that may improve land systems (e.g., winter crops on seasonally fallow land, perennials on marginal land) may be more favorable and may be indirectly affected by this change if it encourages the continued reliance on conventional biofuel feedstocks.

In addition, H.R. 1 stripped the special SAF rate of $1.75/gallon, dropping it to $1.00/gallon to match all other clean fuels. This modification limits the incentive for domestic investment in new or expanded SAF facilities. SAF is still expensive to produce, as it is a nascent industry, and requires more support than other clean fuels to reach commercial scale. Many SAF producers factored the $1.75/gallon credit value into their business models and are now facing serious risks to investment and production capacity with the newly lowered credit value. SAF production facilities are currently positioned in states ranging from California to Montana with expansion planned in the West, South, Northwest, and Midwest in coming years. However, it is not clear how much of the planned expansion will proceed, as project developers around the country reckon with these changes.

The Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated that the new 45Z, including H.R. 1 changes, will cost taxpayers $25.7 billion through its expiration in 2029. When the IRA was passed, JCT estimated that 45Z would cost about $2.9 billion over four years. The significant expansion in cost from the 2022 estimate to the 2025 estimate is not tied to an increase inpublic benefits (such as reduced emissions); rather, the order-of-magnitude increase in cost results from Congress’s decisions to weaken the law’s carbon accounting requirements and allow a broader set of conventional biofuel producers to claim the credit.

Table 2: Summary of 45Z modifications in H.R. 1 compared to the IRA

Impacts of 45Z Modifications

The changes made to 45Z will cost taxpayers more while undermining U.S. competitiveness, innovation, and climate progress.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will benefit:

Domestic corn ethanol and soy biodiesel industries, with more gallons of current conventional biofuel production eligible for the tax credit at higher per-gallon tax credit rates compared to those under the IRA version of 45Z, mainly due to the new version’s directive against counting ILUC emissions. Increased production of corn ethanol and soy biodiesel could occur at the margin due to 45Z incentives, but domestic corn ethanol consumption growth is constrained by infrastructure, limited purchases of high-ethanol fuel blends, and flat or declining gasoline consumption nationwide. The corn ethanol industry could experience growth if domestic alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel production scales, however the new 45Z disincentivizes this industry, which is still in early stages of development. Even without significant volumetric growth, these industries will benefit from higher per-gallon subsidies.

Soy-based renewable diesel production is especially likely to benefit from higher per-gallon tax credits. As a mature and expanding industry, soy-based renewable diesel does not need taxpayer funding. Biodiesel and renewable diesel are also more expensive than diesel fuel, so unless oil prices increase significantly, production will likely be dictated largely by existing biofuel policies mandating a certain level of consumption each year, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS), not by the availability of 45Z credits. As a result, taxpayer dollars are not actually needed to incentivize production of these fuels, making changes to 45Z a windfall for conventional biofuels.

H.R. 1 changes to 45Z will disadvantage:

Taxpayers, since billions of dollars are expected to be spent annually on duplicative tax credits for carbon-intensive, mature biofuels that would be produced anyway under policies like the RFS and LCFS, which already mandate biofuel consumption. 45Z’s expansion and extension is unlikely on its own to spur additional job growth or economic investment in new production facilities nationwide.

Industry investment in innovative fuel production, including companies investing in high-paying jobs across the country to produce fuels for growing markets such as SAF and fuels utilizing clean hydrogen to produce clean ammonia, methanol, etc.

U.S. competitiveness and economic growth, since financial incentives will be shifted toward existing, mature industries like soy-based renewable diesel – an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars – instead of toward new, innovative fuels that generate significant economic growth, business investment, and international investment opportunities.

U.S. positioning as a global leader in SAF production, because companies will likely shift planned SAF investments to other countries, given the decreased financial incentives for domestic SAF production and uncertainty around federal policy.

Climate and environment, with less stringent carbon intensity reduction requirements for 45Z-eligible fuels and less funding directed at much-needed clean alternatives like SAF. The statute no longer requires consideration of the emissions resulting from the potential conversion of carbon-rich land like forests and wetlands which could occur withincreased corn- and soybean-based biofuel production. The production of conventional biofuels now subsidized by 45Z is also associated with worse water, air, and soil quality and diminished wildlife habitat.

Issues to Watch

With statutory changes to 45Z included in H.R. 1, the next step is for the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to issue new guidance relating to the implementation of those statutory changes. Some issues to watch over the coming months include:

How the removal of ILUC considerations within 45Z carbon intensity scores will be implemented at Treasury/IRS.

Whether and how Treasury/IRS or Argonne National Lab’s GREET model will incorporate certain farming methods (known as Climate Smart Agriculture, or CSA) such as no-till farming into CI scoring for 45Z. This is generally a way for biofuels to reduce their CI scores. There is a lot of uncertainty around the impacts of certain CSA practices, while others can be accurately estimated. Depending on the type of CSA practices that are credited, the implementation of those practices, and their incorporation into CI scores, the environmental benefits of biofuels could be improved or further eroded. Nothing in H.R. 1 authorizes Treasury to reduce a fuel’s carbon intensity score based on CSA practices. The biofuel industry has advocated for their broad inclusion in 45Z. CATF supports the inclusion of highly certain practices with quantifiable impacts, such as enhanced nitrogen efficiency fertilizers and reduced fertilizer use.

Final Renewable Volume Obligations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency for calendar years 2026 and 2027, which will dictate U.S. biofuel consumption as part of the RFS mandate. In June 2025, EPA proposed significantly higher mandates for biomass-based diesel consumption for 2025 and 2026.

Investment in clean, innovative fuels such as SAF, methanol, and ammonia with 45Z SAF tax credit maximum value reduced by 43% in H.R. 1. SAF production expansion announcements across the U.S. may also be affected by H.R. 1’s drastically shortened availability timeline for the 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit.

U.S. fuels policy should support innovative fuels to reduce emissions and grow the U.S. economy. H.R. 1’s changes to 45Z fail to deliver either of those objectives. Instead, they will cost taxpayers billions to subsidize mature industries with limited public benefit.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/02115443/airplane-runway-web.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:32.762806

Myth one: Regional aviation is a homogeneous segment

Reality: The segment is diverse in terms of aircraft types, missions, and operator uses

Regional aviation is a remarkably heterogeneous sector. For instance, it relies on a variety of aircraft types, which can be grouped into several distinct categories. At the smaller end of the spectrum are turboprops holding fewer than 50 seats, typically used for shorter and lower-demand routes. Larger turboprops, with more than 50 seats, provide greater capacity and range. Regional jets can be divided into three main classes: small regional jets (about 48 seats on average), intermediate regional jets (about 74 seats on average), and large regional jets (about 108 seats on average). In addition, a new generation of small narrowbody aircraft (examples include the Airbus A220 and the Embraer E195-E2) has emerged. These models extend the mission profile traditionally served by regional jets, offering improved efficiency, greater range, and more passenger comfort, and thereby expanding the potential role of regional aircraft in airline networks.

With regard to missions, regional aviation can serve a wide range of roles. For instance, smaller aircraft can service less trafficked routes, either connecting to a hub as feeders or providing the foundation of a point-to-point, regional operation. The smaller gauge of these aircraft allows for more frequent service to small markets when compared with larger aircraft—enabling a more robust schedule and improved connectivity—because airlines can spread demand across more departures while maintaining stable load factors. Regional aircraft are also less expensive to operate, with lower costs per trip compared with larger narrowbody aircraft, translating into better economics for lower-traffic markets with limited demand. What’s more, regional aircraft service can provide vital access to remote locations—flying what are typically referred to as Public Service Obligations (PSO) routes. Finally, because smaller aircraft need less runway length, they are sometimes better suited for flying in and out of constrained airports (including inner-city airfields with tightly bounded footprints, such as London City Airport).

Regional aircraft are popular with a variety of operator types:

Network airlines use regional aircraft to enable hub feeding from secondary cities, and to provide service on thinner short-haul routes outside larger hubs.

Point-to-point specialists, such as independent regional airlines, often stock their fleets with smaller aircraft. Some might sign franchise agreements with larger airlines to benefit from their better-known brands and wider reach.

Contract carriers operating regional flights on behalf of other airlines—using a capacity purchase agreement (CPA) in which the CPA carrier does not assume commercial risk—often rely on smaller aircraft. In many cases, crew contractual provisions called “scope clauses” set boundaries on the types of aircraft, routes, and crew that can be included under these agreements.

Airline operators flying PSO routes (which are typically subsidized by governments) often use smaller aircraft to service remote or underserved regions where demand would not sustain a purely commercial route.

Myth two: Regional aviation’s postpandemic recovery has been uniformly sluggish

Reality: Certain subsegments, such as small narrowbodies, have had stronger recoveries than others

Global aviation has, in aggregate, fully recovered to prepandemic capacity levels. Regional aviation has, as a whole, lagged a bit behind. There is nuance, however, within regional aviation subsegments.

Regional service using small narrowbodies has fully recovered (with 19 percent more flights in 2025 than in 2019)—possibly as a result of the versatility and positive unit economics that these newer platforms can provide for carriers. Service using large and intermediate regional jets is inching toward prepandemic levels (still down 11 percent and 6 percent, respectively, when compared with 2019). But service using smaller regional aircraft and turboprops has experienced a much slower recovery—lagging significantly behind 2019 levels in total number of flights (Exhibit 2). Pilot shortages, aging fleets, and limited manufacturer investment may have all played a role in these results.

The precise shape of recovery varies by region. In North America and Europe, smaller regional jets and turboprops make fewer flights than they did in 2019, but during the same time frame, small narrowbody flights are up 63 percent in North America and 27 percent in Europe. Growth in Asia–Pacific and Central and Latin America has been limited to narrowbodies. Africa is the only region in which the segment has fully recovered across all aircraft types.

Myth three: Most regional city pairs are adequately served

Reality: Even within mature markets, there are significant opportunities for expansion

About 85 percent of regional aircraft services operate on routes shorter than 1,000 kilometers. From 2005 until the onset of the pandemic, the number of such routes steadily increased across most regions. Since the pandemic, however, this growth has stalled, with many regions flattening or even reversing the trend (Exhibit 3).

Some routes may have lost travelers to other modes of transportation, such as rail. Rising airport charges, or taxes, may have also played a part. (Looking at the three largest airports in each country, airline charges rose 67 percent from 2019 to 2025 in Germany, 35 percent in France, and 12 percent in the United Kingdom.) Whatever the cause, the drop in connectivity in some markets is striking. The German domestic route count is at just 38 percent of what it was 20 years ago.

In some regions, low connectivity could present opportunities. Underserved markets are not always easy to identify, but a simple proxy could be to look for city pairs where there is connecting traffic but no nonstop service (Exhibit 4). Many such markets show up in each region. While the majority of these are thin markets with fewer than ten daily passengers each way, some have more substantial traffic.

Our analysis indicates that there are still significant opportunities to directly connect underserved domestic European or intra-European city pairs that offer sufficient demand—particularly in places where low-cost airlines are absent and rail infrastructure falls short in terms of either capacity or quality. The individual business cases, however, depend on achievable ticket prices and associated costs (such as airport fees).

Myth four: Network carriers benefit from up-gauging their short-haul operations to improve economics

Reality: Using smaller-gauged regional aircraft on feeder routes can improve yield and offer other advantages

For larger airlines, regional and short-haul connections are essential to feed long-haul operations—bringing in the passengers that fill those widebody intercontinental aircraft. Using aircraft with larger capacity (a practice often described as “up-gauging”) on feeder routes can help network airlines capture economies of scale and lower the cost per available seat kilometer (CASK).

But on those short-haul routes, network carriers face intense competition from alternatives such as low-cost airlines, rail connections, and highways. The use of large feeder aircraft can result in too many empty seats if there is insufficient demand for regular connections. To fill these larger feeder aircraft, ticket prices for the “back of the plane” are often reduced.

This creates significant pressure on margins and can produce unwanted behavior: Some passengers will take advantage of those low fares to connect domestically through larger hubs instead of flying nonstop. This can lead to an increase in low-yielding, short-haul-to-short-haul connections. The resulting additional passengers at larger hubs can also overload airport operations and exacerbate the challenges of delays and operational irregularities. The larger the gauges of the aircraft in the feeding network, the more intense these effects can become.

Using smaller-gauge aircraft could provide a few different advantages for network airlines. Regional aircraft can be used to provide direct, point-to-point connections, addressing customer needs while easing pressure on congested hubs. Smaller aircraft can also help optimize capacity and yields for feeder flights into hubs, especially on lower-demand routes. Lastly, smaller aircraft can allow network carriers to operate in markets where there are infrastructure limitations (such as short runways) or economic challenges (resulting in fewer travelers who can afford to fly).

Myth five: Regional aircraft have an inherent cost disadvantage versus narrowbody aircraft

Reality: Newer regional jets have shrunk the gap in unit costs, while maintaining lower costs per trip

Smaller aircraft have fewer seats, but some costs—such as landing fees, fuel consumption, and pilot salaries—don’t reduce proportionally in line with aircraft capacity. The pilot of an aircraft with 200 seats isn’t paid 2.5 times more than the pilot of an aircraft with 80 seats.

New-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft deliver about 3 percent lower CASK compared with older standard narrowbody models, but they have a roughly 16 percent disadvantage relative to the latest-generation standard narrowbodies. Despite this, new-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft could remain a better choice for less-trafficked city pairs, as their per-flight operating costs are nearly 50 percent lower than those of newer standard narrowbodies.

The implication of closing per-seat cost gaps is that regional aircraft might be deployed more flexibly. They could potentially be used to increase the frequency of flights, or to connect additional city pairs, without creating an unacceptable increase in unit costs.

Myth six: Regional aircraft can’t compete with narrowbody aircraft when it comes to customer experience

Reality: Larger aircraft have some comfort advantages, but regional aviation also offers customer experience benefits

Larger aircraft typically offer roomier cabins, more washrooms, and quieter rides. Jets can also operate at higher altitudes that allow pilots to overfly bad weather, unlike turboprop aircraft that might need to take longer paths around weather or pass directly through turbulent air.

That said, an air traveler’s customer experience can be affected by many touchpoints along the journey—not just the flight itself. While larger aircraft often get preferable airport gate positions and can use more comfortable jet bridges, it’s also true that security, boarding, and deboarding can be faster and less chaotic at the smaller airports that are often frequented by regional aircraft.

Some newer turboprop aircraft also offer quieter and more comfortable rides. Nico Neumann, CEO of Deutsche Aircraft, says new technology allows turboprop aircraft to operate at up to 30,000 feet, with cabin insulation that reduces noise to 78 decibels—similar to cabin noise levels in regional jets. And despite the higher average age of regional aircraft, there can be opportunities to upgrade cabin interiors. American Airlines recently announced plans to retrofit some regional jets with in-seat power and satellite Wi-Fi, and to develop larger overhead bins.

André Alves, network planning director at Iberia, says that the airline’s regional operations often achieve customer satisfaction levels that are comparable with narrowbody operations. He says smaller aircraft are preferred by some customers, who find it more comfortable to not have a middle seat and appreciate the shorter boarding and deboarding processes. Alves adds that regional operations can also excel at reliability and punctuality, which are among the major factors that determine customer satisfaction.

Myth seven: Regional operators are just as exposed to exogenous shocks and downturns as the rest of the aviation industry

Reality: Regional aviation as a whole is less vulnerable to industry volatility, though some regional airlines face elevated company- and region-specific risks

Regional aviation often experiences relatively limited volatility, reducing risk for shareholders. This is especially the case when regional carriers operate under CPA-type agreements.

Globally, 54 percent of regional aircraft are used to provide network connectivity for major network airline partners, often under CPA agreements. In these collaborations, the major airline partner sells tickets while the regional aviation company focuses on operations. The regional operator earns revenue based on block hours flown or completed flights (often using a cost-plus arrangement) instead of tickets sold, so the commercial risk is transferred to the network airline.

Because of factors such as these, profit variability among CPA operators is significantly reduced, and profit variability for regional operators as a whole appears lower compared with the broader commercial airline sector (Exhibit 5).

Volatility can also be limited on PSO routes (such as those providing connectivity to remote areas) that a government deems essential and thus chooses to subsidize. About 23 percent of regional aircraft serve these routes. Because demand is tied to political priorities instead of fluctuating passenger traffic, these services are less affected by economic downturns or changes in the route’s market profitability.

While CPAs can provide stability and reduce risk, they can also limit profitability. And despite lower overall volatility—driven largely by CPA agreements—the smaller size of regional operators, and the region-specific risks they face, mean that the chances of volatile financial performance, bankruptcies, bailouts, and M&A activity increase. Exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can significantly disrupt the regional aviation landscape, just as they disrupt other aviation segments. Smaller fleets and a narrower network can result in considerable company- or region-specific risks, given that there are fewer options to redeploy capacity to capture better returns than there would be in a more global network. What’s more, regional operators aren’t able to hedge returns by leaning on more profitable long-haul operations. No model is perfect, but regional aviation could benefit from new thinking about its commercial and operational approaches.

Myth eight: Shifting regulations and consumer sentiment regarding sustainability will create significant hurdles for regional flying

Reality: Regional aviation can lead the way in sustainable flying

Sustainability is an important issue for aviation stakeholders. Regulatory requirements, customer demand, and corporate commitments to decarbonization could all push regional aviation companies to prioritize sustainability in their long-term business models.

Several factors contribute to regional aviation’s environmental impact. For one, carbon emissions are proportional to jet fuel consumption: Given that smaller aircraft consume more fuel per seat, it follows that their carbon emissions will be proportionally higher than those of larger aircraft. On the other hand, conventional turboprop aircraft typically operate at 8,000 meters or below, an altitude at which the formation of contrails—which can contribute to global warming—is minimized.

New-generation small narrowbody aircraft burn, depending on the mission, approximately 15 percent less fuel per available seat kilometer versus previous-generation standard narrowbodies that are still widely in service, thus producing lower emissions. New-generation standard narrowbodies are more efficient on a per-seat basis (because they contain more seats), with approximately 4 to 7 percent lower fuel burn per available seat kilometer versus new-generation regional jets and small narrowbody aircraft. But on a per-trip basis, newer-generation standard narrowbodies burn 3 to 6 percent more fuel than newer-generation small narrowbodies and regional jets. Because smaller aircraft are easier to fill with passengers, changes can be amplified by higher load factors.

Regardless of how regional aviation’s environmental impact is measured, many feel that the segment can become a lighthouse for sustainable flying. Maarten Koopmans, managing director of KLM Cityhopper—a regional subsidiary airline of KLM—projects that new technologies (such as alternative powertrains) and fuels (such as sustainable aviation fuel) could first reach scale in regional aviation. It’s worth noting that using a fuel mix that includes 10 percent or 20 percent sustainable aviation fuel on a short-haul flight incurs a premium that can be less than $10 per passenger—much lower than the premium on long-haul flights.

Myth nine: Regional aviation is a driver of innovation

Reality: There is much opportunity for innovation with smaller aircraft—including using new propulsion technology—but the sector could benefit from bolder experimentation

At an average age of approximately 17 years, the regional passenger aircraft fleet (including turboprops, regional jets, and smaller narrowbodies) is significantly older than fleets in other aircraft categories. Standard narrowbodies are on average 11 years old. The average age of widebodies is 12 years.

The regional aviation sector is due for new aircraft—ideally, powered by innovative technology. Hybrid-electric, battery-electric, or even hydrogen-fuel-cell powered engines could help address rising concerns about sustainability and decarbonization (in the same way that electric and hybrid powertrains have helped decarbonize the automotive sector). The aircraft manufacturer ATR has announced plans to complete the first flight of a hybrid-electric regional aircraft by 2030. Other major OEMs have shared plans to introduce alternative powertrains, but exactly when these new platforms will take flight remains unclear.

Longer aviation innovation cycles can result from the intense effort and high costs involved in securing certification for a new model. These costs can reach $300 million to $500 million for small aircraft with 19 or fewer seats; for larger aircraft, the certification costs can easily be ten times more. Because smaller aircraft are less expensive to get certified and have lower energy needs (they weigh less even when full of passengers and generally travel shorter distances), regional aviation is well positioned to become the segment in which alternative propulsion first reaches scale. Regional aviation can seek to identify and capture demand opportunities that will enable more innovation.

It's important to note that innovation can also be applied to business models. The US charter airline JSX operates smaller-gauge regional aircraft in North America and advertises “private air travel, booked by the seat, at attainable fares.” As a public charter operator, JSX benefits from less onerous security screening standards and can use general aviation terminals, with check-ins as late as 20 minutes before departure. The focus on streamlined processes and elevated customer experience includes hangar-to-hangar satellite Wi-Fi, low-density seating, and complimentary snacks and drinks.

Myth ten: eVTOL and electric regional aircraft could replace traditional regional aviation

Reality: eVTOL air taxis are more likely to disrupt conventional helicopter and high-end road mobility services, and electric regional aircraft still need to prove their applicability

The electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft segment has attracted about $16.5 billion of investment since 2018. Multiple eVTOL vehicles now in development could potentially offer safe, quiet, convenient, and sustainable air taxi service.

The battery capacity technology of today’s eVTOLs limits their payloads to about four passengers, and they can only carry those passengers for relatively short distances. These limitations mean that, in the near term, eVTOLs are unlikely to challenge regional aviation. Instead, eVTOLs are more likely to disrupt conventional helicopter service and high-end road mobility services (such as luxury buses or black-car SUVs).

Electric conventional takeoff and landing (eCTOL) aircraft could potentially address demand for short hops from smaller regional airports. Lower-demand, point-to-point connections between regional airfields that are unprofitable using turboprop aircraft today could become viable with the lower CASK figures promised by future eCTOL aircraft. The lower price of electricity compared with fuel and the reduced maintenance costs for electric powertrains could enable cost savings for the operator, similar to the operating cost savings of electric vehicles versus internal combustion engine vehicles. McKinsey research indicates the market for flights that could be suited for eCTOLs could exceed $100 billion by 2035.

However, eCTOLs’ range and payload will be limited, their offer competes with rail in many locations, and eCTOL technology still needs to prove its readiness for adverse weather and winter operations.

Regional aviation plays a critical strategic role within the airline industry. Regional aircraft are indispensable for providing connectivity, flexibility, and cost-effective solutions in thinner markets, while also alleviating congestion at major hubs. Although the pace of regional aviation’s recovery has varied across regions and subsegments, advancements in technology, evolving business models, and shifting network strategies could help to secure the enduring importance of regional aviation within the broader ecosystem.

For stakeholders across the value chain, opportunities are significant. Operators can harness regional fleets to strengthen network reach and profitability. OEMs can tap into growth in emerging markets and next-generation platforms. Lessors can unlock value through strategic life cycle management. As the industry faces mounting sustainability demands, regional aviation is uniquely positioned to serve as a proving ground for alternative fuels and propulsion technologies. Far from being a peripheral player, the sector is poised to be at the center of adaptation and innovation—while continuing to improve reliability and customer experience to meet travelers’ ever rising expectations.",https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/travel%20logistics%20and%20infrastructure/our%20insights/small%20planes%20big%20changes%20the%20evolving%20business%20of%20regional%20aviation/small-planes-big-changes-2091789481-thumb-1536x1536.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:37.512369

Yet, it also comes with a heavy environmental cost. The industry is responsible for nearly 3% of global carbon emissions a figure expected to rise as air travel grows. To address this challenge, Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) have emerged as a critical solution for reducing aviation’s climate impact.

What Are Sustainable Aviation Fuels?

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are alternatives to traditional fossil-based jet fuel. They are made from renewable feedstocks such as waste oils, agricultural residues, municipal waste, or even advanced processes like capturing carbon directly from the air. Unlike conventional fuel, SAF can cut lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80%, depending on the feedstock and production method.

What makes SAF particularly appealing is its compatibility. It can be blended with existing jet fuel and used in today’s aircraft without the need for modifications. This makes SAF a practical, immediate pathway for decarbonizing aviation while longer-term solutions, such as hydrogen or electric aircraft, are still being developed.

The Industry Shift Toward SAF

Major airlines and aviation hubs around the world are increasingly committing to SAF adoption. Carriers such as United Airlines, Lufthansa, and KLM have already begun incorporating SAF into their operations. Airports in Europe and the U.S. are setting up dedicated supply chains, while governments are introducing incentives and mandates to accelerate production.

For many stakeholders, SAF is not only an environmental necessity but also a business opportunity. Investments in SAF production facilities are growing, driven by the rising demand for low-carbon air travel from both passengers and regulators.

Benefits Beyond Carbon Reduction

While emissions reduction is the most widely recognized advantage, SAF offers other benefits too. Using waste and residues as feedstock reduces reliance on fossil fuels and helps build a circular economy. SAF production also opens doors for regional job creation, particularly in areas with strong agricultural or bio-based industries.

Additionally, SAF supports airlines in meeting global climate targets, such as the International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) commitment to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Challenges on the Horizon

Despite its promise, SAF is not without hurdles. Production costs remain higher than conventional jet fuel, and current supply is limited. Scaling SAF requires significant investment in infrastructure, technology, and policy support. Ensuring that feedstock sourcing is sustainable, without competing with food supply or causing deforestation, is another critical factor.

Yet, the momentum is undeniable. With technological advancements, supportive regulations, and collaborative industry efforts, SAF production is expected to grow rapidly in the coming decades.

Looking Ahead

Sustainable Aviation Fuels are not just an alternative fuel they represent a shift in how the aviation industry approaches its future. By combining innovation with environmental responsibility, SAF provides a bridge between today’s reliance on fossil fuels and tomorrow’s cleaner aviation solutions.

Takeaway Point: Sustainable Aviation Fuels are a game-changer for the aviation industry, offering a realistic and scalable path to reducing carbon emissions while keeping the world connected. Their success depends on collaboration across industry, government, and communities to ensure a cleaner, more sustainable future for flight.

This paper argues that rising aviation emissions, which are disproportionally driven by the wealthy, pose a serious threat to climate goals. Using the UK’s Jet Zero strategy as a case study, it explores how policymakers and industry promote speculative technologies—efficiency gains, electric and hydrogen aircraft, sustainable aviation fuels, carbon capture, and offsetting—to justify continued aviation growth. We critically assess these claims: electric aircraft are limited to short routes; hydrogen faces major storage and infrastructure barriers, and green hydrogen remains scarce. SAFs, often derived from land-intensive crops, risk deforestation, biodiversity loss, and higher net emissions. Second generation SAFs, such as used cooking oil, are scarce, and power-to-liquid is speculative and prohibitively expensive. Carbon capture is unproven at scale, and offsetting enables airlines to claim reductions without cutting actual emissions. These “solutions” align with a political agenda that prioritises economic growth and airport expansion. We argue that this techno-optimism delays real action. Rather than gambling on future breakthroughs that may never materialise, policymakers should pursue immediate demand-reduction strategies and support a just transition—ending frequent-flyer incentives, shifting short-haul flights to rail, removing aviation fuel subsidies, and retraining workers for low-carbon sectors.

Introduction: aviation and the climate crisis

It is no longer necessary to watch a Hollywood movie to imagine what a climate disaster might look like; glancing at the newsfeed will often suffice.Footnote1 2024 was the hottest year on record, and the first to exceed 1.5°C warming above pre-industrial levels. It brought catastrophic flooding to West Africa and Valencia, and drought to southern Africa. In southern California, where a perfect tinderbox had been created by extreme wet-then-dry conditions known as hydroclimatic whiplash, the start of the new year saw wildfires wreak havoc (Kolbert, Citation2025). 2025 also saw destructive floods in Pakistan, Colombia, Venezuela, northern China and Texas, while in Britain many crops failed due to drought. Climate breakdown is proceeding more quickly than previously anticipated (Hansen et al., Citation2025). We are, warns UN secretary-general António Guterres, on the ‘highway to climate hell’ (United Nations, Citation2024). And climate is only one among many vectors of environmental breakdown. ‘Planetary boundaries’ are being crossed at a rate of knots – seven out of nine at the latest count (Gayle, Citation2024).

Against this backdrop, the need to rapidly decarbonise could not be more pressing. Britain is currently off track to meet its target of ‘net zero’ by 2050 (CCC, Citation2024), and three quarters of its primary energy still comes from fossil fuels (Energy Institute, Citation2025). Nowhere is the scale of the deficiency clearer than in aviation. According to the 7th Carbon Budget of the Climate Change Committee (CCC), an advisory body to the British government, in 2023 UK aviation emissions were 69% higher than in 1990; they account for 8% of UK emissions, with international flights the principal driver of expansion (CCC, Citation2025, p. 222).

In this paper, we scrutinise aviation decarbonisation strategies, with Britain’s Jet Zero plan as the case study. We read Jet Zero as a gamble predicated on a series of technologies and policies that are highly unlikely to achieve their goals. We assess the prospects for electric and hydrogen aviation, efficiency savings, carbon capture and storage, offsets, and sustainable aviation fuel. We then tease out the implications for policy.

Our focus is on Britain, due in part to its historic responsibility for the climate crisis. In cumulative CO2 emissions Britain ranks eighth in the world, but if we factor in its empire (ruled from London) the position is higher, and it reflects Britain’s pivotal role in the dissemination of fossil-fuel use worldwide (Evans & Rydén, Citation2005; Ritchie & Roser, Citation2020). Against this fossil-imperial backdrop, Britain’s Nationally Defined Contribution (NDC) to reducing emissions falls short of an equitable share (Civil Society Equity Review, Citation2023; Gabbatiss, Citation2023). In part, too, our focus on Britain relates to its legal commitment to a target of ‘net zero’ by 2050, following a law passed in 2008 when Labour’s Ed Miliband was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change. Ever since, it has positioned itself as a ‘climate leader’ (DESNZ & Miliband Citation2024). The increasing climate-impacting significance of aviation and the role the sector plays in the government’s vision for making Britain ‘the world’s best-connected place to do business’ makes its ‘Jet Zero’ programme an exemplary lens through which to study the friction between ‘growth’ and sustainability (Stewart, Citation2025b).

Jet Zero was set up under Boris Johnson’s premiership, the declared aim being to steer the aviation industry toward ‘sustainability’. With particular clarity that programme manifests the ‘technological solutionism’ and ‘technofixes’ that dominate policymaking on decarbonisation, and above all on aviation. Technofixes refer to questionable claims regarding what technology can achieve in order to reduce the pressure to address social and ecological problems in other ways. There are obvious reasons that governments succumb to this way of thinking (e.g. line of least resistance regarding potentially unpopular behavioural change) and obvious attractions for corporations in propagating it (the camouflage it offers for prioritising profits over the habitability of Earth).

Technological solutionism, similarly, recasts ‘complex social situations either as neatly defined problems with definite, computable solutions or as transparent and self-evident processes that can be easily optimised (Morozov, Citation2013, p. 5). Examples of technological solutionism abound in UK government pronouncements and policies today, be it the programme for ‘a digital health service powered by cutting-edge technology’ as a solution to an ailing NHS, or the quest to make Britain ‘the world leader’ in AI in order to ‘turbocharge growth’ (Department for Science, Innovation & Technology et al., Citation2025; Streeting, Citation2024). Jet Zero is cut from the same cloth. It seeks to sidestep politically difficult questions pertaining to the social purposes of transport, leisure and work, instead reaching for technological trump cards.

Those technofix range from the unproven to the unrealistic to the downright harmful. It is important that we strip back the futurist veneer of the promises and policies of sustainable aviation, debunk the obfuscatory language deployed, and carefully scrutinise the claims made.

We submit that ‘sustainable aviation’ represents a reckless gamble on new technologies, some of which are unproven and many of which are likely to be unscalable. It melds flimsy promises from the aviation industry, in its attempt to pre-empt government intervention, with empty bluster from governments keen to placate a climate-concerned electorate. Ultimately, its function, if not the motivation, is to provide a smokescreen, one that lingers until the current government is out of office, leaving its successors – not to mention human society and other fauna and flora – to face the heat. In short, in Britain, as is largely the case elsewhere, techno-utopian fantasy is writing the official script. The result is a diversion of attention from the practical changes needed, which we shall summarise in the final section.

Jet Zero and aviation emissions

Consultation for Jet Zero began in July 2021 under Boris Johnson’s premiership. It built upon the previous ‘Net Zero Strategy’ and ‘Transport decarbonisation plan’ to chart a course for aviation to reach net zero by 2050 (Department for Transport, Citation2021; HM Government, Citation2021a). With the aim of helping the aviation sector decarbonise, the consultation centred on a Jet Zero Council – ‘a forum bringing together government, industry and academia to speed up change’ (Department for Transport, Citation2022b, p. 4). In July 2022, the Jet Zero strategy document was published. It was constructed chiefly of assumptions and promises borrowed – naïvely, as we show below – from the aviation sector, in particular from the industry organisation Sustainable Aviation, mediated through government-industry partnership bodies (Department for Transport, Citation2022a, Citation2024a). Largely frozen out were climate scientists and the environmental groups and NGOs that seek to protect the interests of Earth and its inhabitants.

A key assumption that the Jet Zero strategy reproduces is that in its emissions calculations and scenarios CO2 emissions are foregrounded. This risks obscuring aviation’s true climate impact. As much as two-thirds of aviation’s global-heating impact stems from non-CO2 emissions and cloud formation. The actual impact of aviation on global heating may be tripled once these non-CO2 emissions are factored in (EUASA, Citation2020; Lee et al., Citation2021). To put this in perspective, a return flight from London to New York, generating one tonne of CO2 per passenger on average, has an actual impact equivalent to around three tonnes (Kommenda, Citation2019). According to the CCC (Citation2020), three tonnes is the total annual level of per capita emissions to which Britain must be restricted by the mid-2030s, if the 1.5C target is to remain even possible.Footnote2 We should also consider military aviation. Aviation makes up a third of the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) self-reported CO2 footprint, and the MOD accounts for 50% of UK government emissions (Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Citation2024).Footnote3 If we factor in the non-CO2 effects, military aviation alone could account for as much as a third of total UK government emissions. Military aviation emissions are forecast to rise, as Britain increases its military spending in line with the NATO-wide target of 3.5% of GDP. This target, if met, would lead to extra emissions across NATO member states estimated at 1320 million tCO2e over the next ten years – the equivalent of the annual emissions of Brazil (Parkinson, Citation2025).

Rather than exercise caution in a situation where underestimating impacts will generate real effects that cannot simply be ‘taken back’, the government’s response to the question of non-CO2 effects has been ‘wait and see’.Footnote4 It promises to channel some funds into research in the area, while refusing to incorporate any of the existing research into its calculations on the climate impact of aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). This is short-sighted and self-serving: it frames uncertainty as a reason for current lack of action and misrepresents what the ‘uncertainty’ is telling us. Consider by contrast the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). Although it has been widely criticised for its capture by the aviation industry (Carrington, Citation2025), even it takes care to point out the significant impact of non-CO2 aviation emissions on global heating. Its research shows that non-CO2 emissions’ effects increase alongside the projected growth in CO2 emissions (Lee et al., Citation2023). In other words, these obscured contributions of aviation to climate breakdown will only grow in significance unless the sector’s overall CO2 emissions are reduced.

As noted in the introduction, Jet Zero’s projections point to significant growth in numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown. For example, a 2020 government report projected that by 2050, passenger miles flown will be twice the 2017 figure and six times the 1990 figure (Department for Transport, Citation2020a). The picture is similar in Europe, with the latest figures suggesting that EU air traffic could reach more than 2.3 times the 2019 level by 2050 (T&E, Citation2025). Aviation, by the government’s own admission, is set to comprise fully a quarter of Britain’s GHG emissions by 2050, and will be the industry with the greatest carbon emissions (HM Government, Citation2018; Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020). This means that even if the proposed technofix were to work as promised, in 2050 the sector could be burning as much fossil kerosene as in 2023 (T&E, Citation2025).

Jet Zero and its technofixes: efficiencies, batteries, hydrogen

The Jet Zero report set 2019 as the peak year for aviation CO2 emissions, following which they would decline to 21 million tonnes (Mt) in 2050. At that point, aviation will be ‘net zero’ – assuming that those 21 Mt are captured and stored, or offset. Before we examine the proposals for reaching that goal, it is worth pointing out that airline emissions are already on track to exceed the 2019 peak (Topham, Citation2024). That the plan is already faltering is an early warning of its inadequacy. We predict that it will not get back on track. A key reason is that the strategy assumes that technology can be relied upon to solve the problem. This emulates the strategy of transition to electric vehicles in the road transport sector, but without the proven technologies that that sector can point to.

One prominent technofix is efficiency improvements. These, Jet Zero predicts, will account for a major share of aviation carbon savings by 2050. Such forecasts, however, are based on wishful thinking; the empirical evidence leans strongly against them. According to the International Council on Clean Transport (ICCT) the real-world fuel efficiency of aircrafts – otherwise known as block fuel – increased by 1.3% per annum (pa) between 1960 and 2024 (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2025; see also Kharina & Rutherford, Citation2015; Zheng & Rutherford, Citation2020). Over the same time period, the metric valueFootnote5 – which measures how efficient an aircraft is technically designed to be – increased by even less: only 1% pa.Footnote6 Almost all of the scenarios developed by major international aviation organisations in the last few years forecast efficiency savings at less than 1% pa (IATA, Citation2024). The 1.4% pa efficiency gain on which Jet Zero relies, Finlay Asher, a former aircraft engine designer at Rolls Royce, told us, is ‘wildly optimistic’. There are ‘no large step-changes in efficiency around the corner and it takes 10–15 years to certify a significant new aircraft and engine design. So, anything we do see in 2035 – e.g. new designs entering service – will not be the predominant aircraft in service in 2050, due to the 20–30 year lifetime of aircraft’.

A deeper problem with efficiency gains are their rebound effects (York et al., Citation2022). Improvements reduce costs which spur demand, leading to more miles flown. According to the CCC (Citation2020), if demand is not constrained, Britain’s aviation industry will grow at an average rate of over 2% pa over the coming decades. While there are different scenarios, there is a shared expectation that numbers of passengers, flights and distances flown will grow (Leggett, Citation2025). Globally, the sector is set to double by 2040, with growth at an average 3.5% pa (IATA, Citation2023). Needless to say, Earth’s systems care little that less kerosene is required per passenger if more in total is being burnt due to air travel’s overall growth (Dobruszkes & Ibrahim, Citation2022).

Other technofix look to alternative fuels. At the inception of the Jet Zero plan, Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, identified ‘biofuels and electric aircraft’ as a key focus (Department for Transport, Citation2020b). The model is similar to the electric vehicles (EVs) strategy for road transport: a ‘business as usual’ approach that assumes ever-growing sales, little or no demand management, and a high-stakes gamble on technology. In road transport, the strategy is fraught with problems, not least the emissions from extraction and manufacturing processes, and the capacity of renewable energy production: replacing all vehicles with EVs risks exceeding the global carbon budget (Morgan, Citation2020). But while decarbonising road transport is deeply problematic, it is technically feasible. Adopting a similar strategy for aviation is not simply problematic; it is, at least for the foreseeable future, delusional. Jet Zero’s promotion of electric planes is exemplary in this regard. Shapps’ claim that they offer ‘boundless possibilities’ (Department for Transport, Citation2019) is questionable, given the well-documented challenges they face. Due to the weight of batteries – which, unlike fuel, don’t burn off as you fly and are much less energy dense – electric flights will only be viable for short journeys with few passengers (Walker, Citation2019). The maximum range of the tiny nine-seater prototype ‘commuter plane’ developed by leading firm Eviation is 460 km – about the distance from London to Newcastle (Weitering, Citation2024). These aircraft remain a long way from commercial operation and the past five years for the sector has been a story of delays and tempered expectations (Kaminski-Morrow, Citation2020; Sampson, Citation2025), if not outright insolvency, as in the case of German electric aerospace company Lilium (Westerheide, Citation2025). The industry consensus is that for flights of 1,500 km or longer – which make up 80% of aviation emissions – battery-powered flight is unfeasible (Air Transport Action Group, Citation2021; Pfeifer, Citation2019; Schwab et al., Citation2021). In other words, electric planes are a substitute less for jet planes than for buses and trains: an airborne taxi service for well-heeled travellers seeking to avoid congested roads and trains.

Another technofix promoted by the Jet Zero consultation is hydrogen flight (HM Government, Citation2021b). Hydrogen doesn’t suffer from the problematically low energy density by mass of lithium batteries, but because its energy density by volume is far lower than jet fuel it requires much bigger and heavier onboard storage tanks. Hydrogen planes would also require very extensive modifications to airport infrastructure. The source of hydrogen is another concern. Only one percent is currently ‘green’ – i.e. produced with renewable energy. It is over thrice the price of ‘grey’ hydrogen, which itself is four times as expensive as kerosene (Henderson, Citation2021). Grey hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels, with CO2 released as a waste gas – around 830 million tonnes each year (Pirani, Citation2020). If those emissions are captured and sequestered, the hydrogen is known as ‘blue’. Recent studies warn that blue hydrogen could be worse for the climate even than burning fossil gas, due to methane loss during its production plus the high energy inputs – still, typically, from fossil fuels (Howarth & Jacobson, Citation2021; Schlissel & Juhn, Citation2023).

It is also worth noting that there are corporate and geopolitical pressures behind the push for some technologies over others (Balanyá et al., Citation2020). In Britain, oil companies have strategically misrepresented the costs of blue hydrogen whilst asking the taxpayer for billions of pounds in subsidies (Ambrose, Citation2021). The myth of a green transition to hydrogen-powered aviation serves the interests of states rich in oil and gas deposits and of the fossil-fuel companies that extract them, fearful that their assets will become stranded (Noussan et al., Citation2021). We are not using the word ‘myth’ lightly. Willie Walsh, Director-General of the International Air Transport Association, admits that no long-haul hydrogen flights will be possible until ‘beyond 2050’ (Topham, Citation2021). Airbus has ‘suspended’ its plans to develop hydrogen-powered commercial aircraft, citing ‘slower than expected developments in technology’ (Hepher, Citation2025). Boeing, likewise, sees little potential in hydrogen-powered flight before 2050 (Raymond, Citation2023), and other industry experts forecast the most optimistic date for its long-haul viability as the 2050s or 2060s (Transport Select Committee, Citation2022). Switching to hydrogen, moreover, would require astronomical sums for investments in energy, storage and infrastructure, and could add decades to the ‘net zero’ transition in aviation, according to a CCC spokesperson (Hollinger, Citation2021). Moreover, burning hydrogen releases much more water vapour than the equivalent jet fuel, meaning it would contribute to global heating via contrails (Forster et al., Citation2023). In short, hydrogen is only ‘green’ in prohibitively expensive form, it offers no realistic alternative to kerosene in the near to medium future, and even its medium-term applications are limited to short-haul flights. Green hydrogen production may be ramping up, but often in problematic ways. European-owned green hydrogen projects in north Africa, for example, stand accused of displacing local populations and occasioning serious environmental harms, whilst siphoning off tens of millions of litres of water in areas with high levels of water insecurity. The hydrogen produced is largely exported to Europe, rather than contributing to a green transition locally. These activities, according to a recent report, reflect a broader strategy whereby Europe is externalising ‘the climate costs of its energy consumption’ in ways that entrench ‘extractivist neocolonial structures’ (Greenpeace & MENAFEM, Citation2025, p. 44).

Take off for economic growth?

Jet Zero was the brainchild of a Tory government whose goals for aviation dovetailed with those of the industry itself. This was tacitly acknowledged in the way in which aviation industry representatives referred to government plans. An example was the 2018 reportThe Future of UK Aviation (HM Government, Citation2018), in which the then aviation minister, Liz Sugg, framed the expansion of aviation as a given for future development. The Minister of Transport under Rishi Sunak went further, stating in Parliament that the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) mandate (more on which below) ‘is part of our approach to ensure that the rationing of flights through ‘demand management’ is ruled out’ (Hansard HC Deb., Citation2024).

Expectations that the incoming Labour government of 2024 might take a different tack found support in the fact that its minister for Energy Security and Net Zero was (and at time of writing still is) Ed Miliband, while its prime minister, Keir Starmer, had voted against Heathrow expansion when it had been put to the Commons in 2018. Such predictions were quickly scotched, as environmental considerations found themselves trumped by the economic growth drive, centred on the expansion of energy infrastructure, IT infrastructure (such as data centres), housing, and, of course, aviation.Footnote7 The most vocal growth booster in government, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, explicitly stated at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos that in any conflict between growth and ‘net zero’, the latter ought to come second (Stewart, Citation2025a).

In relation to the Jet Zero plan, then, the new government opted for continuity. It established a Jet Zero Taskforce (Department for Transport, Citation2024b), formed overwhelmingly of the CEOs of aviation companies and oil companies, plus a smattering of representatives from the renewable fuels and carbon capture and storage (CCS) industries (HM Government, Citation2024b). And when the CCC, in its 2024 report to parliament assessing progress towards net zero, reiterated the call for a halt to all airport expansion (2024), the government doubled down on its commitment to increase aviation (HM Government, Citation2024a). The aviation sector responded warmly. Kenton Jarvis, CEO of easyJet, spoke for the industry as a whole when he praised Starmer’s government for its ‘recognition of the importance of aviation and the crucial role it plays as an enabler of economic growth’Footnote8 (Alexander & Reeves, Citation2025).

Under particular scrutiny in this regard has been the decision to support airport expansion, with a third runway at Heathrow already approved, along with a huge extension to City Airport (Department for Transport, Citation2025b). The extra flights would be considerable, potentially increasing from 480,000 a year to 720,000 at Heathrow alone (Leggett, Citation2025). Plans to almost double the capacity of London Luton Airport have been approved by the Transport Secretary – notably going against the recommendations of the Planning Inspectorate, whose report found that the environmental harms of the expansion outweighed the public benefits (Planning Inspectorate, Citation2025). Similar plans to increase the capacity of Gatwick by over 100,000 flights per year have received backing from the Transport Secretary (Topham, Citation2025). Amid protests from environmentalists, and from some prominent Labour supporters such as the ‘eco-entrepreneur’ Dale Vince, the government insists that there is no tension between expanding the aviation sector and meeting its carbon emissions targets. For the former Secretary of State for Business and Trade, Jonathan Reynolds – who, with Reeves, voted in favour of Heathrow expansion in 2018 – airport expansion and decarbonisation ‘go hand in hand’ (‘Today’, Citation2025). But how exactly might this work? Reeves provided the answer. When pressed on why Starmer had completed a U-turn on airport expansion, she invoked the rapid development of sustainable aviation fuels. SAF, she claimed, has become a ‘game-changer’ in the expansion debate – a technological ticket to guilt-free flying (Georgiadis & Pickard, Citation2025).

The government’s message, in short, is that a contradiction no longer exists between its commitments to economic growth and environmental sustainability. A growing aviation industry is compatible with the ‘net zero’ mission, thanks to efficiency gains and technological breakthroughs – in particular in SAFs.

The HEFAlump in the room

That government spokespeople such as Reeves extol SAF as the elixir of sustainable aviation comes as no surprise. As the prospects for electric and hydrogen-fuelled aviation have experienced a series of setbacks in the early 2020s, SAFs have returned to the forefront of debates around decarbonising aviation. On 1 January 2025, the government’s SAF mandate came into force which requires flights to be fuelled by two percent SAF, rising to ten percent in 2030 and twenty-two percent in 2040 (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). The mandate also includes a revenue certainty mechanism for producers, but this is yet to be implemented (Department for Transport, Citation2023). Despite being hailed a ‘game-changer’ by the Chancellor, there are considerable doubts around the sustainability, scalability and efficacy of SAF as an alternative to kerosene. After examining these issues in detail, it will become clear why this central pillar of the plan for sustainable aviation is so flimsy.

First of all, SAF is not ‘green’ in the way one might think. Burning it produces a similar amount of CO2 to kerosene. It is primarily in its production that the GHG savings are factored in. This green arithmetic should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, as SAFs have the potential, especially when land use is changed to produce crops for biofuel, to actually increase the net GHG emissions, thereby contributing more to global warming than burning fossil fuels (EUASA, Citation2025). The UK government defines three types of SAF. The first is called HEFA (hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids) – this is fuel made from animal fats and vegetable oils. The second is non-HEFA biofuels which can be produced from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW), alcohol from food crops (‘Alcohol to Jet’ (AtJ)), and from non-food crops, woody crops, and forestry and agricultural waste – this latter group is ‘second-generation biomass’. The third is power-to-liquid synthetic electrofuel (PtL), which is generated using captured carbon and hydrogen (BP, Citation2023; Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Of the three, HEFA is the most established and by far the cheapest of the three methods. However, it has some major downsides, as we shall see, which explains the government’s decision to include a steadily increasing cap on HEFA fuels in its SAF mandate.

The best-known HEFA-using aviation entrepreneur is Richard Branson. In the mid-2000s he arranged for coconut oil to part-fuel a flight from London Heathrow to Amsterdam. The event garnered a burst of media attention, but the sustainability implications were troubling. To have fuelled that short hop with 100 percent coconut oil would have required three million coconuts (Dale, Citation2008). The entire global crop would supply Heathrow for only a few weeks – and it is one of 18,000 commercial airports worldwide. Following this stunt, coconut oil was never used in a Virgin flight again. The Virgin flight drew attention to intrinsic problems of using HEFA. Energy crops such as palm oil or coconuts are not sustainable in any reasonable definition of the term. For energy production they’re a sub-par use of land: solar panels convert solar energy for human-use much more efficiently. In competing with agricultural crops, their downsides are legion (DeCicco, Citation2016). They contribute to GHG emissions from land-use change, and to land-ownership concentration; they cause food price rises, food insecurity, deforestation, peat burning, water shortages, and biodiversity loss. To give but one example, in 2019 alone, the palm oil suppliers to Neste, the world’s largest biofuel producer, were accused of deforesting at least 10,000 hectares and setting 13,000 forest fires (Milieu Defensie, Citation2020). The scale of the potential demand is radically incommensurable with the availability of land to produce biofuel. If 100% of global jet fuel in 2050 were to be produced from SAFs derived from seeds and oilseeds, it would require a staggering two billion acres to grow – five times the cropland area of the United States (Qualman, Citation2024).

Biofuel crops produce GHG emissions in other ways too (Dale, Citation2007). Their inputs include large quantities of energy and fertilisers, a major source of nitrous oxide, as well as hydrogen – largely from fossil gas – for the hydrotreatment of oil (Hughes, Citation2021). Biomass from plantation-grown trees is seen by many in the aviation industry as the new cornucopia, but it suffers from all the same drawbacks. Branson’s proposed solution after the coconut debacle was to pivot to algae, a solution which attracted sizable investment from major oil companies eager to give their polluting activities a green veneer. As a water-based crop, algae appealed in part because it was seen as a way to circumvent the issue of land use change. In 2008 we predicted that algae would not be a viable option (Dale, Citation2008), a forecast that was confirmed a decade and a half later when ExxonMobil was the final fossil-fuel investor to abandon the project (Westervelt, Citation2023).

Used cooking oil: flying on fumes and fraud

Britain’s government is well aware of the significant limitations of HEFA-based biofuels.Footnote9 This is reflected in its decision to impose a cap on HEFA-derived sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is set to fall from 71% in 2030 to just 35% by 2040. It has also ruled out fuel made from food, feed, or energy crops as eligible for designation as SAF (Department for Transport, Citation2024c). Yet even with these measures, the government’s consistently optimistic projections for new technologies fall short of what is needed to meet the SAF mandate. At present, Britain has only one operational SAF facility: the Phillips 66 Humber refinery (USDA, Citation2025).

This helps explain why, as of 2023, a staggering 97% of the UK’s SAF supply came from used cooking oil (UCO). Only 8% of this originated domestically (due to its limited total supply), with the bulk imported from Malaysia and China (Purvis, Citation2025). China, the world’s largest UCO producer, is already struggling to meet demand from Europe and the US, while Malaysia has reportedly exported more ‘used’ cooking oil than it actually produces (Goulding Carroll, Citation2022). These discrepancies have raised serious concerns about virgin vegetable oil being fraudulently mixed into the UCO supply (T&E, Citation2024). If confirmed, some UCO-derived SAF is in significant respects more damaging even than kerosene, especially where palm oil plantations – linked to deforestation – are used to meet the demand.Footnote10 Importantly, even where UCO is authentic (i.e. verified waste rather than virgin oil), it is not only a finite waste resource, for which demand is already outstripping supply, but its environmental cost remains high as it displaces use from other, arguably more important, sectors such as domestic biodiesel and animal feed – which in turn further drives deforestation (T&E, Citation2021b).Footnote11

For sustainable fuel, attention has consequently shifted to other sources. One is CO2 extracted from the air by Direct Air Capture technologies and converted into SAF, also called Power to Liquid (PtL) (Keith et al., Citation2018). This may offer potential in the distant future but currently is far too expensive at £94.50/gigajoule (GJ), compared with the £16/GJ it costs to refine jet fuel from crude oil (IEA, Citation2023b). The process is also extremely energy intensive. It would take 468–660 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy to replace the ‘UK’s fossil jet fuel consumption’(The Royal Society, Citation2023). To put that into perspective, in 2023 Britain’s total electricity consumption was 266 TWh (Statista, Citation2025).

Other sources include forestry residues – such as bark, branches, and sapling thinnings, municipal and business waste, and industrial offgases – but these are not a serious alternative. They compete with more pressing uses: decarbonising electric power, fuelling ground transport, and Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Waste and offgases, in contrast, do look potentially promising. In 2021 we spoke to two companies which together have received over £50 million in government funding to construct the first wave of non-HEFA SAF plants – Velocys and Lanzatech (Department for Transport, Citation2025a).

Velocys

Of the 27 million tonnes of waste collected annually by Britain’s councils and businesses, a Velocys representative told us, much consists of water, and recyclable substances such as metals and ‘inerts’. These are removed. The remainder is heated using the Fischer–Tropsch process (Steynberg, Citation2004). Contaminant gases are washed out and what remains, chiefly hydrogen and carbon monoxide, is converted to SAF. The Fischer–Tropsch process is a proven technology that dates back to the 1920s, but questions remain as to whether it is capable of delivering sustainable fuel in sufficient quantities, and in time to achieve the government’s Net Zero target. Several obstacles merit attention.

First, SAF from waste is expensive to produce – at least twice the cost of fossil jet fuel (The Royal Society, Citation2023). Producing fuel to meet the high quality and safety requirements necessary to keep a passenger jet in the air is more complex – and thus more costly – than producing biodiesel for buses, trucks or tractors. This leads to the second problem: the amount of municipal waste available is hugely insufficient. Even if all of the available Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) were converted, it would only meet about ten percent of UK jet fuel demand (The Royal Society, Citation2023). One might reasonably ask if this limited supply would not be better used to meet the needs of land vehicles without viable alternatives in sectors such as agriculture. Third, as with PtL fuels, the energy requirements are prohibitive. Britain is predicted to fall significantly short of its 2030 green energy target – despite having revised this down in December 2024 (Cornwall Insight, Citation2025). Globally, energy-transition investment actually declined in 2024, and currently stands at just over a third of the amount required to reach net zero by 2050(Corradi, Citation2025). There simply is not sufficient surplus renewable energy to warrant its diversion to SAF.

The recent development of SAF production, moreover, does not inspire confidence. None of the Velocys projects have reached commercial production. The promise was that its plant in Immingham would start supplying British Airways in 2024, but the site is still ‘a dusty field, empty but for a blue portable toilet lying on its side’ (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). If it does eventually open, it will presumably draw power from the national grid, fuelled to a very substantial amount by non-renewable energy, seriously denting any green credentials it may have had (NESO, Citation2025). On top of this, its direct GHG emissions will be considerable. Over its entire lifetime including combustion, SAF from municipal solid waste produces up to two thirds as much CO2 as fossil kerosene (The Royal Society, Citation2023).

In short, Velocys, like most alternative SAF projects, has not demonstrated commercial-scale viability and there are strong grounds for scepticism. Its case is not atypical. According to a Reuters investigation, of the 165 SAF projects announced by airlines worldwide over the past 12 years, only ten have produced commercial quantities of fuel (Plucinska et al., Citation2025). The oil giant Shell has scrapped construction of its SAF plants in Singapore and in Rotterdam (Almeida, Citation2025). In Britain, there are two other proposed MSW-to-SAF projects, both of which have received government funding (Department for Transport, Citation2025a). One, from the American firm Fulcrum, was set to be twice the size of Velocys’ Immingham facility. However, when their flagship plant in Nevada – the first of its kind – was finally opened after years of delays, it was beset by a multitude of problems including nitric acid corrosion of pipes, massive nitrous oxide emissions and a huge overestimation of the amount of fuel it would actually be able to produce (Howard, Citation2024). The fiasco ended with Fulcrum filing for bankruptcy in 2024 (Hussain, Citation2024). According to research by Andrew Rollinson, most large-scale commercial gasification plants fail. The technology, he notes, ‘has high risks associated with multiple pathways for fire, explosion, and the release of environmental toxins’ (Rollinson, Citation2018). Even if we were to set aside the criticisms of the technology raised above, there is little reason to believe that Velocys’ project will be the kind of success story the government is hoping for.

Lanzatech

LanzaTech’s core technology is ingenious: Clostridium bacteria combine carbon monoxide and hydrogen to produce ethanol, for conversion into jet fuel (AtJ). Its ideal locations are blast furnaces, the offgases of which include carbon monoxide and hydrogen. LanzaTech anticipated that its facility adjoining the Port Talbot steelworks would yield 80,000 tonnes of fuel annually. Although this sounds impressive, we learned from a LanzaTech representative that it represents ‘0.6 percent’ of Britain’s jet fuel usage. As steel production shifts away from fossil fuels in pursuit of its net zero goals, moreover, the supply of those offgases will dwindle – and indeed the last blast furnace in Port Talbot closed in 2024. Hence, LanzaTech has had to look beyond the steel industry, but the feedstocks they have found contain little or no hydrogen, which must then be manufactured. They are exploring DAC-to-SAF projects, but here, again, the energy needs are colossal, and the bottleneck is the availability of renewable electricity.

Other possible feedstocks would include forestry waste, which we discussed above, as well as sources of ‘second-generation bioethanol’, such as straw. These too face many competing uses, the available quantities are low, and the jet fuel would be expensive – perhaps two to four times dearer than kerosene. LanzaTech’s CEO, Jennifer Holmgren, notes that using recycled CO2 or CO costs far more than refining oil, and bringing the cost curve down could take ‘30 or 40 years’ (Gertner & Payne, Citation2021). Production cannot, needless to say, be scaled up at will: it takes three years, at minimum, to get a plant up and running, and only then can the efficiency improvements be transferred to future projects. Construction of LanaTech’s plant was due to commence in winter 2024, but this deadline was missed. The company hopes to begin production in 2026, but notes that this timeline is ‘subject to securing the legislation, investment and off-take agreements that are needed to move forward to a final investment decision’ (LanzaTech, Citationn.d.; Smith, Citation2025).

The aviation industry knows that synthetic fuels cannot be ramped up quickly. As to SAFs in general, in Britain, as the Sustainable Aviation group admits, annual production of 600 kt won’t be achieved until the mid-2030s at the earliest. Even the lowest usage scenario it envisages ‘would exceed globally available waste oils and fats’ and would require ‘substantial new volumes of oil crops’ (Sustainable Aviation, Citation2020).

Carbon capture and storage

Even if one were to set aside scepticism regarding the technological assumptions underpinning the Jet Zero strategy – to accept, for instance, that fuel efficiency will improve at an unprecedented rate, that electric and hydrogen aircraft will overcome existing technical and financial barriers to constitute a meaningful share of the fleet, and that SAFs can be scaled commercially without inflicting further ecological harms – the framework remains fundamentally reliant on negative emissions technologies. This reliance persists even under the most optimistic scenarios, raising critical questions about the feasibility and integrity of the Jet Zero pathway.

By 2050, the Jet Zero strategy anticipates that approximately 21 MtCO₂ will need to be removed annually for the aviation sector to achieve ‘net zero’. (The Sustainable Aviation group (2020) projects an even higher figure, estimating that at least 26 MtCO₂ will need to be either offset or removed each year; and the CCC (Citation2020) suggests that aviation will require around 40% of the UK’s total negative emissions capacity by mid-century.) This raises serious ethical concerns regarding the allocation of limited carbon removal resources to a sector characterised by extreme inequality in access and impact. Globally, just 1% of the population is responsible for half of all aviation emissions (Niranjan, Citation2025), while only 2–4% of people fly in any given year (Gössling & Humpe, Citation2020). In the UK, the disparity is equally stark: 15% of the population accounts for 70% of flights, and half of the population does not fly at all in a given year (Hopkinson & Cairns, Citation2021). Moreover, the wealthiest 10% of Britons generate more emissions from aviation alone than do the poorest 20% from all their activities combined (Baltruszewicz et al., Citation2023). Citizens of the Global South, meanwhile, typically take between zero and one flight per year. The disproportionate allocation of financial and carbon budgets to what is effectively a luxury activity for the affluent raises serious questions of environmental justice and equity.

Even if we leave morality to one side, there remain significant doubts regarding the storage capacity for CCS, and the yawning gap between the diminutive scale of monitored and verified carbon removal and the gargantuan scale required for the Jet Zero sums to add up (de Coninck & M. Benson, Citation2014; Ketan, Citation2021). There are currently forty-one CCS facilities in the world, of which 82.5% are used to aid the extraction of oil in mature wells (Zero Carbon Analytics, Citation2024). In most countries, CCS is unregulated. Those forty-one plants are expensive, potentially dangerous, and are failing to meet their targets (Weyler, Citation2022; Zoledziowski, Citation2022). A recent report on Norway’s Sleipner and Snøhvit pilot plants revealed unexpected behaviour of CO2 in even the most intensively studied of aquifers, a reminder that the danger of leakage is all too real (Hauber, Citation2023). In its most recent roadmap, the International Energy Agencynotes that the history of CCS is one of ‘unmet expectations’ and delayed deployment, that ‘removing carbon from the atmosphere is costly and uncertain’ and that the technology remains ‘unproven at scale’ (IEA, Citation2023a). Its entire efficacy has been called into question by the IPCC, with serious doubts raised over the technology and its claims to carbon neutrality (Robertson, Citation2022; Sekera & Goodwin, Citation2021).

While funding, especially from the polluting industries, should be invested into CCS research and trials, one should also recognise that its primary purpose, today, is as a technofix, built on insecure foundations and geared to short-circuiting difficult political decisions and supporting fossil-fuel giants (Anderson & Peters, Citation2016; Laville, Citation2021; Quiggin, Citation2024). Even the US climate envoy under the Biden administration, John Kerry, admits that CCS risks becoming a dangerous distraction from the need to reduce emissions, while former US vice-president Al Gore dismisses it as ‘an absolute fraud’ (Breeze, Citation2024; Harvey, Citation2023).

Offsets

The solutions discussed so far are vastly overestimated in the Jet Zero programme, manifesting a blasé disregard for scarcities, realistic timescales, and technical obstacles. Yet all are based on technologies that do, or might one day, function. Offsetting, by comparison, is an outright scam. That it is accorded a prominent role in Jet Zero – even in its ‘high ambition’ scenario, offsetting is billed as providing the second-largest ‘reduction’ in emissions, after CCS – is scandalous.

Offsetting is the right to pollute in one location purchased by certificates declaring its reduction in another, relative to ‘business as usual’ – certificates that can then be traded on carbon markets. The logic by which it functions is questionable, to say the least. It’s as if, when a factory poisoning a Malaysian river reduces its pollution ahead of a regulatory deadline, a factory in Liverpool were thereby licensed to discharge mercury into the Mersey. Of carbon offsetting, the great majority relates to protecting areas from future deforestation. Forests, alongside ocean and peatland, are vital carbon sinks that absorb half of human emissions; many of these are losing their ability to absorb carbon (Greenfield, Citation2024; IPCC, Citation2023). Halting deforestation plays, naturally, a vital role in climate change mitigation. But this should not give licence to corporations to continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere somewhere else (Milman, Citation2018). The carbon credit system into which offset certificates are poured, moreover, is ripe for corruption and fraud (Chan et al., Citation2023). This was made abundantly clear when multiple studies into the world’s largest carbon offsetting certifier revealed that ninety percent of their offsets were utterly worthless (Guizar-Coutiño et al., Citation2022; West et al., Citation2020, Citation2023).

Reforestation schemes may prima facie appear more justifiable, but they too are flawed. Crucially, they fail to take into account the fact that trees are not interchangeable units. Old forest is a complex ecosystem with dense understories; it cannot be ‘replaced’ by plantation silviculture (Monbiot, Citation2021). Moreover, trees take decades to grow and if they are then caught in wildfires for example, they release all the carbon they have been absorbing (Hodgson, Citation2021). People inhabit the places where the offset industry wishes to site plantations. Their fields, livestock and livelihoods are in the crosshairs of carbon offsetting projects. The quantity of land required is staggering – a forest the size of the Isle of Wight would need to be planted every year just to keep up with the carbon footprint of the Royal Air Force (Defence Committee, Citation2023; MoD, Citation2023; Moseman et al., Citation2025). Carbon credits concerned with reforestation and funding renewable energy have been linked to a litany of social and environmental harms. For example, projects connected to Chevron’s carbon offsets include planting rubber monocultures, which are disastrous for local ecosystems and are ineffective at carbon offsetting. A large portion of Chevron’s carbon offsetting schemes involved construction of large hydroelectric dams. These projects would in all likelihood have been constructed anyway, so their status as ‘offsets’ is risible; they have also been accused of undermining local communities, with use of violent methods to suppress resistance (Corporate Accountability, Citation2023). Critics have pointed to the neocolonial and exploitative nature of such relationships (Olúfẹ́mi, Citation2019). Ill-advised if not outright damaging practices of offsetting are taking place in the context of centuries-old unequal relationships of extractivism, sometimes by the very same corporations – as in the case of Chevron in Colombia. We are left with a troubling picture: ineffective carbon offsets threatening food security in the Global South in order to maintain the lifestyles of the world’s frequent flyers (Harvey, Citation2021).

The flaws of reforestation schemes are emblematic of the broader problems with carbon offsetting. These issues are not limited to individual projects but are systemic, as evidenced by the ICAO’s carbon trading scheme, CORSIA. The scheme, which Britain was instrumental in setting up, will account for the majority of the UK aviation sector’s offsets. Beyond the general issues raised above, CORSIA has come under significant criticism from experts. None of the offsetting programmes under the scheme address issues of double counting (where an area of, say, rainforest that was already protected under a national scheme is then counted again for offsetting). Neither do the price mechanisms work, due to oversupply: when buying credits is cheaper than buying SAF, it undermines the incentive to decarbonise. Finally, the entire scheme is beset by a lack of transparency and enforceability (T&E, Citation2021a). That the Jet Zero plan places such emphasis on offsetting seriously undermines its claims to be aiming for ‘net zero’. To repeat: with every fraction of a degree of heating, climate breakdown becomes more severe, unpredictable and irreversible, and the earth’s ecosystems deteriorate further. Carbon offsetting, by giving corporations the green light to continue emitting greenhouse gases, is detrimental to the future habitability of Earth.

Policy proposals

Travelling through an airport in Britain, you might be forgiven for thinking that today’s jetliners are as light as birds. From Gatwick to Bristol, advertisements proudly declare that the airport from which you are taking a flight halfway across the globe is ‘carbon neutral’. Despite the absurdity of such statements being summarily pointed out (Walker, Citation2021), the aviation industry’s attempts to paint a green image of itself are unending. From Ryanair’s banned advertisement that declared it was ‘Europe’s lowest emissions airline’ (ASA, Citation2020) to KLM’s green claims for SAF being ruled ‘misleading’ (Sterling & Plucinska, Citation2024), there are countless examples of aviation-industry ‘greenwashing’. Indeed, a recent study found that 44% of aviation industry publicity regarding carbon offsets was misleading (Guix et al., Citation2022). This is not a new development. ExxonMobil’s 2011 advert promoting biofuel from algae, to give one of many examples, was banned for making similarly dishonest claims (Euractiv, Citation2011). This example is particularly instructive given that the much-vaunted algae ‘solution’ culminated in a dead-end, as we discussed above. The aviation industry has a history of deliberately misleading the public in order to justify its unhindered expansion. To do this it relies on exaggerated, unrealistic and disingenuous claims put forward for a slew of technofix. However, it does not act alone. Obliging governments and compliant media organisations should be held accountable too.

Considering the body of research surveyed in this article, it is evident that the Jet Zero plan prioritises the wellbeing of the aviation industry over the environment. Were the habitability of the planet its driving concern, Jet Zero would recommend demand management measures, such as a ban on aviation advertising and frequent flyer programmes, and the removal of tax exemptions on aviation fuel. It would emphasise 2030 targets, not 2050. It would prioritise consultations with young people, environmentalists, and scientists, rather than aviation lobbyists. It would take seriously the Absolute Zero report from Cambridge University’s FIRES research group (Allwood et al., Citation2019). If Britain’s ‘net zero’ target is to be achieved by mid-century, the FIRES engineers have shown, the aviation industry ‘faces ‘rapid contraction’. This entails the phasing out of ‘all aviation activity’ within 30 years’, with the mothballing of all British airports except Glasgow by 2030, and Heathrow too by 2050 – and only then, if the necessary technologies and sufficient renewable electricity come onstream, could some reopening plausibly begin.

The case for aviation contraction is unlikely to be universally popular, and won’t be a vote winner, unless two conditions obtain. One is a meaningful shift in attitudes to climate breakdown. The other is that transport reforms are linked to proposals that address popular concerns. If campaigners are to bring the aviation industry back down to earth, the vision must be of a habitable planet together with feasible and appealing travel alternatives.

As discussed above, aviation is an elite activity both in the West and worldwide. An opinion survey from 2024 reports that, Rachel Reeves’ pronouncements notwithstanding, the British public does not see aviation growth as essential to economic growth, supports taxation of aviation fuel and raising ticket prices, and ‘strongly supports’ equalising the cost of train travel versus air travel – even if this requires higher taxes on aviation (Chapman, Citation2025b). While jet owners represent 0.0008% of the global population, in Britain private jets represent one in ten flights taking off (Collins et al., Citation2023; Vaughan, Citation2023). A passenger on a private jet travelling from New York to Washington DC – the same distance as London to Paris – is responsible for around 45 times the emissions of a passenger flying the same route on a commercial flight, and 1,100 times one travelling by train (Collins et al., Citation2023). The case for banning private jets, in short, is overwhelming. Business travel should be shrunk, too. The Covid-19 pandemic demonstrated that much of it can be replaced by online meetings. If even just those business trips deemed ‘unnecessary’ were curtailed, Heathrow’s traffic would, at a stroke, shrink by nearly a fifth (Statista, Citation2023). Meanwhile, a frequent-flyer levy could equitably reduce demand – without punishing once-a-year holiday goers – during the period in which alternatives to flying are rolled out. Such levies are popular among the British public (Chapman, Citation2025b), and should be imposed with particular priority on the luxury-ticket classes (first, premium, business), for these, while by far the most environmentally damaging, face relatively low taxation under Air Passenger Duty. Alongside the redirection of fossil fuel subsidies, these tax revenues could also provide ‘innovative sources of finance’ to provide ‘Loss & Damage’ assistance to populations most adversely affected by climate breakdown, on the basis of the polluter pays principle (Amnesty International & CIEL, Citation2022).

Beyond these reforms, short-haul and domestic flights should be rapidly phased out. A first step has been taken by France, with its prohibition on flights covering routes that could be travelled within 2.5 hours by train.Footnote12 Again, evidence suggests these policies are popular, with one EU-wide survey finding that two in three Europeans would support a ban on short-haul flights to destinations that could be reached in twelve hours by train (Garton Ash et al., Citation2020). To replace short-haul flights, investment in rail and battery-electric coach infrastructure could enable reliable and accessible public transport for all, at affordable prices or even free. Within Europe, night trains present a viable and convenient substitute and should be revived and upscaled. Surveys consistently demonstrate that people prefer train journeys to flying (Carn & William, Citation2021). Where rail offers a viable alternative, such as between London and Paris, we see passenger demand for aviation collapsing (Rowland, Citation2019). Cruising at a modest 125 mph, a train from London could, with stops, reach Barcelona in eight hours, Ankara in twenty.

The challenge of addressing emissions from long-haul flights remains particularly complex. Alternatives are less readily available than for short-haul travel, yet their significance is greater. A study of flights departing from 31 European countries revealed that those exceeding 4,000 km constituted only 6% of total departures yet were responsible for 47% of total fuel consumption. Similarly, a global analysis found that just 5% of flights – those longer than 3,000 km – accounted for nearly 40% of total aviation fuel consumed (Dobruszkes et al., Citation2024).

To date, there appear to be no viable proposals for long-haul aviation that simultaneously meet ecological sustainability criteria, uphold social equity, and remain politically feasible. What is certain, however, is that a single return long-haul flight from Britain can exceed an individual's entire annual per capita carbon budget, assuming adherence to the 1.5°C climate target. In this context, substantial reductions in long-haul air travel appear to be the only ecologically defensible course of action. While such measures may face resistance, the imperative to remain within the boundaries of a stable planetary system must surely take precedence. The alternative is to risk pushing the Earth system into a state incompatible with the complex societal structures developed over the past five millennia. As Al Gore aptly stated, ‘the maximum that is politically feasible, even the maximum that is politically imaginable right now, still falls short of the minimum that is scientifically and ecologically necessary’ (McKibben, Citation1995).

The absence of clear alternatives to long-haul aviation should not be used to justify the continuation of current practices. That said, we can take inspiration from the slow travel movement (Kieran, Citation2013). If legislation encouraged flexibility from employers, slow-moving zero-emission ships could offer an alternative for some long-distance journeys (Neale, Citation2021). And airships – we venture tentatively, aware that we may be afflicted by the techno-utopianism that this article cautions against – may offer an additional low emissions alternative to aeroplanes (Hall, Citation2024; Jolly, Citation2025).

All these initiatives, whether night trains, ships or airships, would create new jobs, for which workers departing the aviation industry should, in a ‘just transition’, be given priority. A report commissioned by Possible found that if British aviation shrank by two-thirds, around 200,000 jobs would be lost, but by replacing these journeys with alternatives (e.g. trains and ferries), together with the resulting growth in domestic tourism, a net gain of over 300,000 jobs would result (Meadway, Citation2022).

The ‘just transition’, as has been widely observed, is a contested concept. We follow Stefania Barca in her attempt to reclaim the just transition strategy from a simple jobs campaign yoked to a ‘green growth’ agenda, to a programme that, while centred on trade-union mobilisation for ‘green jobs’, simultaneously draws upon ‘Indigenous knowledges’ and advocates for disinvestment from the fossil fuel and nuclear sectors, coupled with energy democracy and food sovereignty at the community level (Barca, paraphrased in Rainnie & Snell, Citation2024, p. 38). International solidarity would be close to its heart; the risks of reinforcing neo-colonial and extractivist relationships with the Global South in the pursuit of ‘green’ policies are well documented (Abram et al., Citation2022; Ambrose, Citation2024; Bell, Citation2024; Hamouchene & Sandwell, Citation2023; Okpanachi et al., Citation2022).

As an embryonic example of a ‘just transition’ in aviation, consider the case of ‘A Green New Deal for Gatwick’. It was convened by eco-socialists and union officials from the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), a union that has been at the forefront of campaigning and policy work on ‘climate jobs’ and the just transition (Lethbridge, Citation2024), during the Covid-19 pandemic when aviation workers were facing mass layoffs. We asked Robert Magowan, one of the proposal’s instigators, what lay behind the Gatwick plan. ‘We know that aviation must degrow’, he replied, ‘and it was degrowing during the pandemic, but this must not come at the cost of workers. The pandemic response showed what governments can do when pressure is on – especially when the Broughton manufacturing site of Airbus was retooled to produce ventilators’.

Magowan and his colleagues surveyed the manifold ways in which Gatwick workers’ skills sets could be adapted to jobs elsewhere, in decarbonising industries. With PCS backing, they found support among the workforce, including from a pilot whose words eloquently sum up what is at stake:

It has been my lifelong dream to fly. To face up to losing this massive part of our lives is incredibly scary; to lose our job is like losing a part of ourselves. But as pilots, we use our skills to identify this existential threat to the natural world and our lives. If this was an emergency in flight, we would have diverted to a safe destination long ago. We can’t just fly blindly to the planned destination as the flight deck fills with smoke. Our industry’s impact on global emissions is irrefutable. The so-called solutions to ‘green’ the industry at its current scale are decades away and are not globally or ecologically just. With environmental consciousness rising, the aviation sector will either shrink by design, through a ‘Just Transition’ for workers, or by disaster. We must find a way to put workers at the forefront of the green revolution, to ensure we have the option to be retrained into the green jobs of the future (Latif et al., Citation2020, p. 24).

A just transition of this kind could have numerous positive impacts on local communities. €4 million is lost every hour by European governments because aviation is untaxed (T&E, Citationn.d.). This aid received by airports and the aviation industry could be redirected to fund local leisure and sustainable transport infrastructure. Even redundant airports could be transformed into community hubs, museums, or green spaces (as was done at the former Berlin airport at Tempelhof) (Magowan, Citation2022).

Conclusion

The Jet Zero plan, with its reliance on unproven technofix and industry-friendly policies, exemplifies a complacency that has underpinned climate inaction for decades. It not only fails to address the scale of the aviation sector’s contribution to the climate crisis, but risks exacerbating it. Its techno-solutionism would have us believe in the alchemical power of new technology: it can turn carbon into gold. But the evidence is clear: carbon capture and storage, sustainable aviation fuels, hydrogen-fuelled and battery-electric planes are not the silver bullets they are made out to be, and offsetting is a farce. These proposals serve chiefly as window dressing for the aviation industry, an alibi to provide cover for unchecked expansion while delaying the difficult decisions needed to mitigate global heating.

As the mercury continues to rise, governments, rather than working urgently to reduce aviation emissions, are placing their bets on yet-to-materialise technologies (Schleussner et al., Citation2024). The airlines, hand in glove with policymakers, are using these ‘solutions’ to carve out space to expand their operations. If such solutions, however, are false promises, as this paper argues, the aviation industry ought to be scaled down, and permitted to re-grow only if the lifecycle of aircraft can be designed to avoid GHG emissions entirely. The methods necessary to curb aviation emissions exist; what is lacking is the political ambition to implement them. They includes policies to equitably reduce demand for air travel, and investment in sustainable alternatives, with measure to ensure a just transition for workers and communities dependent on the aviation industry. The flaws of governmental responses to the Covid-19 pandemic notwithstanding, they hinted at the rapid, transformative change that can occur where the political will exists.

For the rising global temperature to be stabilised at 1.5°C, high-emissions industries must be rapidly reined in. This requires not only a radical reassessment of how we travel, but also structural transformations, with respect to the logics of economic growth and the goals of social justice and the habitability of the planet.

2 The CCC acknowledges the problem: ‘Aviation’s non-CO2 effects refer to the additional climate impacts from aviation not due to GHG emissions, such as line shaped contrails, high cloud increases, and the impacts from air pollution. Since 1990, the warming effect of non-CO2 effects has tripled’. (CCC, Citation2025, p. 223).

6 Average measures of fuel efficiency conceal substantial variation across periods. During the late 1960s, the replacement of first-generation with second-generation jets yielded significant efficiency improvements (5.6% annually in block fuel and 3.7% in MV). By contrast, from the 1990s through the early 2010s, the absence of major technological advances resulted in near-zero gains. The introduction of more efficient aircraft types in the 2010s, notably the Boeing 787, produced improvements of up to 3.5%. However, efficiency growth stagnated again in the early 2020s (Hameed & Rutherford, Citation2024). That average fuel efficiency has struggled to climb substantially above 1% pa is confirmed by the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO) which in 2019 admitted that while they aspire to efficiency gains of 2% pa, “today’s aircraft are approximately 80 per cent more efficient in use of fuel per passenger kilometre than that in the 1960s” – in other words around 1.1%pa (ICAO, Citation2019).

7 Recent research suggests that the energy demands of data centres may already exceed, globally, the electricity produced by renewables (Castro et al., Citation2024). This should be of concern to the Starmer government, given its commitment to a breakneck expansion of data centres (Gross et al., Citation2025).

8 It is important to point out that even if we were to put aside the environmental and social costs of airport expansion, its contributions to growth are debatable. A recent report carried out by the New Economics Foundation found that as expansion primarily increases outbound passengers, it is “highly unlikely” that it offers “any growth benefits to the UK” (Chapman, Citation2025a). And in an extensive analysis of the economic case for the expansion of Leeds Bradford Airport, a report found that it would in fact lead to a net loss for the region’s economy (Chapman & Postle, Citation2020).

9 The EU’s SAF mandate suffers from similar problems. Based on the projections of Boeing and Airbus, emissions savings from the EU’s 42% SAF mandate will be cancelled out by growth, with CO2 emissions in 2049 predicted to be just slightly lower than their 2019 level (T&E, Citation2025). However, given the low forecast for the availability of efuels, like Power to Liquid (PtL), we infer that a hefty portion of that SAF demand will be met by HEFA-based biofuel or similarly unsustainable sources. If this is accounted for then European aviation emissions would likely rise to a peak in 2049 (T&E, Citation2025).

10 Despite knowing of the concerns regarding authenticity of the oil, the British government has excluded SAF from its investigation into Chinese biodiesel imports (Hussain, Citation2024). Instead, it relies on industry-led certification schemes like the International Sustainability and Carbon Certificate to verify authenticity. These schemes depend heavily on self-reporting rather than independent verification, casting doubt on their reliability (Greenpeace, Citation2021).

11 In the UK, biodiesel is primarily used for road transport (DEFRA Citation2025), as well as agricultural machinery, and power generators.

12 Despite France’s ability to whisk passengers across vast distances in under 2.5 h thanks to its extensive high-speed rail network, Britain still sees multiple daily flights on routes that are easily covered by train. From London, you can reach all the major northern cities in less than 2.5 h. And yet, there are still around five flights a day from London to Newcastle, and a similar number to Manchester.",https://covers.tandf.co.uk/og/RSOC.png,N,,2025-10-16 20:00:48.264225

“If we want to bring more people to our side, we need to start talking about how SAF can build new markets for farmers,” Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor said Thursday at the annual SAF North America conference in Houston.

“We need to start talking about how SAF fits into this administration's goal of energy dominance, and we need to start talking about how this is a high-growth opportunity that America cannot afford to miss out on.”

While SAF production has increased in recent years, primarily in the form of fuel made from vegetable oil and waste fats and oils, it still represents a small fraction of aviation fuel. SAF can also be produced from ethanol. The first such operation, a LanzaJet facility in Georgia, has yet to start commercial operation.

Another company developing alcohol-to-jet SAF, Gevo, plans to produce the fuel at a 30-million-gallon-a-year facility in North Dakota. A larger project planned for South Dakota has stalled because of the struggles of Summit Carbon Solutions to build its carbon sequestration pipeline in that state.

The SAF industry suffered a setback when an extension of the 45Z clean fuel production credit that was included in the One Big Beautiful Bill removed an bonus incentive for SAF. The credit, which was authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022, also was revised to exclude feedstocks not produced in the United States, Mexico or Canada. The credit, which was originally supposed to sunset after 2027, was extended through 2029.

The Trump administration has largely been supportive of biofuels, including SAF, at the same time it is trying to uproot federal climate policies.

Skor noted that the Trump administration also scrapped the Biden administration’s SAF Grand Challenge, a goal supported by airlines to produce 3 billion gallons of SAF by 2030.

“The current administration is emphasizing American energy dominance while moving the focus away from climate and carbon performance,” Skor said.

Even though the 45Z SAF incentive was scaled back, Skor suggested that getting the credit extended by two years at the same time other IRA policies were being rescinded demonstrated the political clout of various sectors working together.

Speaking of the 45Z extension, she said, “That's huge. Why? Because of the coalition we helped build spanning aviation, energy, transportation, agriculture and rural interests. Each may be primarily driven by a range of different goals, from energy security to fuel affordability to economic development, yet all of our coalition understands the central importance of rural America and job creation. All of our coalition is invested in the American farmer's ability to compete well into the future.”

She also said that airlines globally were still committed to cutting their carbon footprint and face mandates outside the United States to do so.

“When we look out to see where the global economy is going, it's obvious that sustainability and low carbon are only growing more important. We can see airlines and logistics companies eager to find the supply they need to hit their SAF targets. We can see SAF mandates rolling out in the EU, the UK, and globally. We can see construction beginning on SAF plants in Asia.

“These are clear market signals, and we want to move where they're pointing us. We want to make sure American energy dominance includes dominance in the aviation market.”

A study led by former Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz for Growth Energy detailed the potential carbon impacts of ethanol-based SAF, based on sequestering carbon dioxide emissions, reducing energy usage in production, and implementation of cover crops and other lower carbon farming practices.

There are currently three domestic producers of SAF and production remains limited. The Energy Department has estimated that production capacity would be about 30,000 barrels a day this year.

SAF remains significantly more expensive for airlines than conventional jet fuel, with a cost premium of about $3.50 per gallon, according to Andea Moyes, global head of sustainability for Air bp.

The clean energy provisions in the inflation Reduction Act initially made the United States attractive to investors but that’s been reversed by passage of the OBBB and the United Kingdom’s creation of its own SAF mandate, said Prathama Nabi, who is with Barclays Investment Bank's energy transition group.

Soybean farmers could benefit from prohibiting Chinese used cooking oil. Soybean oil is the leading vegetable oil for biofuel production in the U.S., according to the USDA.

The U.S. could easily produce its own cooking oil and doesn’t need to buy it from China, Trump said in a Truth Social post Oct. 14.

“I believe that purposefully not buying our soybeans, and causing difficulty for our Soybean Farmers, is an economically hostile act,” he said. “We are considering terminating business with China having to do with Cooking Oil, and other elements of Trade, as retribution.”

The president’s post continued to put soybeans at the forefront of trade disputes with China. Soybean farmers count on China to take a large percentage of their crop. So far, China has not bought any of the new soybean crop, according to the USDA.

The Trump administration is reportedly preparing a $10 billion to $15 billion compensation package for farmers. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said the government shutdown needs to end before the administration can move ahead.

Asked about Trump’s remarks, China Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Oct. 15 that tariffs and trade wars have no winners. “The two sides need to address relevant issues through consultation on the basis of equality, respect and mutual benefit,” he said.

China’s exports of used cooking oil to the U.S. boomed for two years, but slowed considerably in the past year.

China exported a record 1.27 million metric tons of used cooking oil, worth $1.1 billion, to the U.S. in 2024. The volume was 775% more than in 2022.

China’s used cooking oil helped increase U.S. biofuels production. It also decreased soybean oil’s share in providing feedstock, according to the USDA Economic Research Service.

Last November, China took the initiative to reduce exports. It eliminated a tax rebate for U.S. importers. Used cooking oil exports declined by 60% in December, compared to the month before, according to the USDA.

China dropped the tax rebate to redirect how it uses the massive amount of used cooking oil it collects, according to a USDA analysis. Instead of exporting low-value used cooking oil, China will use the oil to produce high-value sustainable aviation fuel, the analysis stated.

By May, Chinese exports of used cooking oil to the U.S. were nearly zero. Besides the tax change, China’s exports were driven down by a 45.5% tariff and incentives in the One Big Beautiful Bill that favored domestic biodiesel feedstocks, such as soybean oil, over foreign feedstocks.

Exolum will store and blend the fuel on-site with conventional aviation fuel before distributing it through the national pipeline system.
Bristol Airport has committed to working with airline customers to meet the UK’s SAF mandate as part of its aim to achieve net zero operations by 2050.","Exolum has announced a £4.5 million investment to create the UK’s first independent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) blending facility at Redcliffe Bay in south-west England. The facility will supply airports including Heathrow, Gatwick, Bristol, Exeter and Cardiff.

The energy logistics company plans to develop a UK-wide network of SAF blending hubs across its 2,000km pipeline network. The infrastructure will provide SAF producers and importers with market access to jet fuel for 40% of flights departing UK airports.

The Redcliffe Bay facility is expected to become operational in 2026. Exolum estimates the initial investment will support the equivalent of up to 64,741 flights from London to New York annually.

The announcement comes as the UK’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill progresses through Parliament. SAF is a biofuel blended with conventional aviation fuel and used in aircraft without modification to reduce carbon emissions.

Unblended SAF will arrive by ship at Bristol’s Royal Portbury Dock before transport to the Redcliffe Bay site by pipeline. Exolum will store and blend the fuel on-site with conventional aviation fuel before distributing it through the national pipeline system.

The project includes infrastructure upgrades to Exolum’s existing aviation fuel pipeline storage and pumping station on the banks of the Severn Estuary near Bristol. The company will convert existing aviation fuel storage tanks to handle SAF, install blending infrastructure within the tanks, and modify systems with new pumps, filtration systems and segregation valves.

“Exolum’s investment at Redcliffe Bay is turning the UK’s ambitions for greener flights into reality, whilst helping secure the country’s position in global sustainable aviation,” said Stephen Land, Exolum North West Europe lead. “The UK’s twin commitments to airport expansion and to increasing SAF supplies have been crucial in ensuring that, and we’re looking forward to not only supporting greener aviation but also the growth of the UK’s sustainable fuels industry.”

The facility will provide a route to market for SAF production plants expected to become operational later this decade. The infrastructure supports long-term investment in SAF production across the UK, particularly in south-west England and southern Wales.

“I’m excited to see the rollout of Exolum’s SAF network, which will help support regional jobs across the country and is another vote of confidence in our SAF polices including the SAF Bill, which is back in Parliament for its third reading,” said Keir Mather, member of parliament and UK Department for Transport aviation minister.

The government is investing £63 million to support domestic SAF production. The investment accompanies a mandate to increase SAF supply in aviation fuel for UK flights.

“Exolum’s £4.5 million investment in their Redcliffe Bay facility marks a boost for North Somerset, helping support new technical jobs across the sustainable aviation supply chain in southwest England,” said Sadik Al Hassan, member of parliament for North Somerset and sustainable aviation champion.

Dave Lees, chief executive officer of Bristol Airport, said blending facilities form part of the future SAF supply chain needed to decarbonize aviation.

“Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties.
The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel,” he continued.
“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions.
“The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol.","In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (SAF), which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the Government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

But understanding SAF ‘s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector, and why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

“SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications,” Geoff said. “It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment. SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in new plant.

“Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel,” he continued.

“Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop. This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

“Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production,” he added.

“The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second the SAF bill currently going through parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost the excess is returned to the Government. Conversely if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the Government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the Government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

“These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The Government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up,” Geoff continued.

“The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel. The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen Government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year all jet fuel sold in the UK must by law contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040,” he said.

“The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

“The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap and with the support of CILT UK we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and Government,” he added.",https://nitravelnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sustainable-air-fuel-geoff-16-10-25.png?v=1171081330,N,,2025-10-16 17:01:49.613334

Abstract

Slashing warming pollution to the near-zero levels needed to stop global climate change will require massive investments in nearly every industry. However, nearly all of today’s clean industrial investment is focused on a few sectors where technologies and business strategies are relatively mature and thus risks are relatively low: renewable energy, electric grids with battery storage, and electric vehicles (1). In other industries that lag behind, investment in new technologies and business practices involves much larger risks that are harder for investors to fathom. The aviation sector is emblematic of the challenge. A new approach is needed that is more realistic about what is achievable and better aligned with how real-world investors balance risk and reward. We outline an approach that could help guide a pioneer group of research and development (R&D) programs alongside investors and airlines who are motivated to deploy new technology.

LPO will act as a guarantor for the reconductoring and rebuilding of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.
The loan, which had first been announced as a conditional commitment in the last days of the Biden administration, is the first LPO has closed since President Trump took office in January.

Trump and transmission Expanding transmission infrastructure is notoriously difficult, with some projects taking over a decade and having to go through multiple legal and regulatory hurdles before even starting construction.","The Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office has closed a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to a subsidiary of American Electric Power, it announced today. LPO will act as a guarantor for the reconductoring and rebuilding of around 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

The loan, which had first been announced as a conditional commitment in the last days of the Biden administration, is the first LPO has closed since President Trump took office in January. It comes after months of upheaval for the office, which has seen its work hampered by leadership turnover, mass layoffs, and paused and cancelled funding.

As Latitude Media reported in July, when the second Trump administration took the helm, LPO had 15 conditional commitments ready, totaling at least $30 billion. Since January, though, several projects have withdrawn from the negotiation process because of federal funding uncertainty.

During the first Trump administration, LPO closed just a single loan; it wasn’t until the Biden administration that the office got a big enough influx of funding and staff to become the juggernaut it was under director Jigar Shah. So when Trump took the helm for the second time, there was some question about whether his DOE would make use of the office at all.

But activity seems to be picking up. In addition to the AEP loan, earlier in October, DOE announced that LPO had restructured a previously approved loan with Lithium Americas Corp. to finance the construction of facilities for manufacturing lithium carbonate at Thacker Pass. And last week, it granted an extension to Gevo for its $1.46 billion conditional commitment for a sustainable aviation fuel project, until April 2026; the company said it is potentially revising the project’s scope to better match the Trump administration’s priorities.

The AEP loan is also the first closed loan under the Energy Dominance Financing Program, a new program established by the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that replaces the previous Section 1706 program within the LPO, eliminating the latter’s focus on emissions reduction and clean energy.

Trump and transmission

Expanding transmission infrastructure is notoriously difficult, with some projects taking over a decade and having to go through multiple legal and regulatory hurdles before even starting construction.

But building new lines is essential to ensure that the grid is able to support the enormous increase in energy demand that the country is experiencing. And upgrading old lines — including through reconductoring, which can up to double capacity on existing power lines — can be a less politically challenging way of making the most of the existing grid.

The PJM region, where the AEP project would bring much-needed capacity upgrades, is at the heart of the U.S. load growth conversation. PJM’s latest load growth forecast projects a peak load growth of 32 gigawatts from 2024 to 2030, with 30 of those coming from the booming data center sector; the grid operator’s its annual auction in July closed at the $329 per megawatt-day price cap, a 22% increase over last year’s auction, which was itself a record.

The Trump administration’s record on transmission has been mixed so far. Better grid infrastructure is essential to achieving its goal of “energy abundance,” as highlighted in its AI Action Plan. And even as DOE saw a massive exodus of staff including from the Grid Deployment Office, Latitude Media reported in April that Trump’s GDO director said that Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency “really liked” the office’s Transmission Facilitation Program — a $2.5 billion effort to build new transmission projects.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-10-16T140444.295.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 15:00:34.770098

The transmission system operator TenneT invited me and other experts to assist them with their Target scenario for 2050 to enable them to plan for transmission upgrades and space requirements in a country where land is so precious that they make their own, building entire provinces from sea beds, dykes, and massive pumps.

The TenneT core team were deep and broad in their own ways. Emiel van Druten, who led the charge on scenario planning, with a decade of modeling background in energy across Dutch economy, has a sharp-eyed view on where the football will be. Emmanuel van Ruitenbeek brought aerospace engineering, a masters in sustainability, and a decade of European energy trading to the table. Tim Gaßmann brought power engineering and a decade of energy planning to the room, along with a deep understanding of how the core scenario tool, the Energy Transition Model, and related external dashboard hang together.

A brief shoutout to the Energy Transition Model (ETM). This free, browser-based toolkit from Amsterdam’s Quintel puts you in the driver’s seat, letting you build future energy systems with a dizzying array of sliders, around 300 by the last count. Want to see what happens if your region doubles down on heat pumps or scraps coal by 2050? Just tweak the supply and demand bars and watch as charts, emissions figures, and costs update in real time. It’s transparent, open-source, and refreshingly honest, with no hidden assumptions, no techno-liturgical claptrap. Every EU country is baselined in it, but seemingly no non-European countries at this time. That should change. The TenneT team and the larger national scenario modeling team have been using ETM for years, and I was deeply impressed with it and that they were so familiar with the levers to pull as we explored options.

It aims to accelerate the commercial rollout of power-to-liquid technologies by bridging the gap between research and large-scale industrial production.
“The TPP is the basis for future industrial production and the extensive use of sustainable fuels, particularly in aviation,” said Bjorn Griesemann, CEO at Griesemann Group.
The platform will use Topsoe and Sasol’s integrated G2L e-fuels technology.
Analyses from the International Council on Clean Transportation highlight bottlenecks in capital intensity, feedstock availability, and first-of-a-kind technology deployment risks.","Denmark-based energy technology company Topsoe and global chemicals specialist Sasol have signed a cooperation agreement with the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and Griesemann Gruppe to build and operate a new e-fuels demonstration plant at the Leuna Chemical Complex in Germany.

Supported by €130m in funding from the German Federal Ministry for Transport, the facility – known as the Technology Platform Power-to-Liquid Fuels (TPP) – is slated to be the largest of its kind when it begins production in late 2027.

The plant, which has been under construction since 1 October 2024, is expected to produce around 2,500 tonnes of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) per year using biogenic CO2 and green hydrogen. It aims to accelerate the commercial rollout of power-to-liquid technologies by bridging the gap between research and large-scale industrial production.

“The TPP is the basis for future industrial production and the extensive use of sustainable fuels, particularly in aviation,” said Bjorn Griesemann, CEO at Griesemann Group.

The platform will use Topsoe and Sasol’s integrated G2L e-fuels technology. This combines Topsoe’s eREACT technology and hydroprocessing technologies with Sasol’s low-temperature Fischer-Tropsch system to convert captured CO2 and green hydrogen to e-fuels.

“[This project] will be an important step in enabling SAF production at scale, as well as supporting downstream application and flight testing to move us to a fully decarbonised industry,” said Sarushen Pillay, Executive Vice President for Business Building, Strategy and Technology at Sasol.

Independent studies and international agencies routinely estimate that SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions over their full life cycle by 50% to 80% relative to conventional jet fuel, depending on feedstock and process pathway.

For example, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) estimates that drop-in SAFs can reduce life-cycle emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel. Under its global framework, ICAO aims for a 5% reduction in the carbon intensity of international aviation by 2030 compared with a no-SAF scenario, achieved through wider adoption of sustainable fuels and cleaner energy sources.

The European Union has set even more ambitious targets, requiring a 2% SAF blend in jet fuel from 2025, rising to 70% by 2050 – targets that could deliver deep CO2 and non-CO2 reductions through the use of renewable feedstocks and advanced conversion technologies.

Yet despite the promise, scaling remains the industry’s most persistent obstacle. Analyses from the International Council on Clean Transportation highlight bottlenecks in capital intensity, feedstock availability, and first-of-a-kind technology deployment risks.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2024/02/shutterstock_2307717919.jpg",N,,2025-10-16 12:57:06.381831

Findings show Middle East aviation-related jobs to grow 134% between 2023-2043, the highest rate globally, while passenger movements will double

Growing populations, investments in infrastructure & airline development, and geographic position contribute to importance of regional aviation sector

Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; October 16, 2025 – The aviation sector in the Middle East is positioned for unprecedented growth over the next two decades, with total aviation-related jobs projected to increase by 134%, the highest growth rate of any region globally, according to a comprehensive white paper released by Aviation Business ME and GE Aerospace.

The report titled, ""Lifting Economies: The Impact of the Aviation Sector on Middle Eastern Economies,"" reveals that aviation's contribution to regional GDP will surge by more than 150% by 2043, reaching $730 billion and cementing the industry's position as a key driver of economic development across the region. More than 530 million passengers, twice the current number, are projected to travel through the region, with a 3.9% annual traffic growth rate.

Several key factors are fueling this growth trajectory. Middle Eastern governments have made strategic, long-term commitments to aviation through massive infrastructure investments, airline development, and supportive regulatory frameworks. This government-led approach, combined with the region's unique geographic position connecting major global markets, has created the right conditions for positive aviation sector impact.

The Middle East's location between Europe, Africa and Asia-Pacific also positions its airlines and airports to capture significant transfer traffic. Growing populations, coupled with rising regional prosperity and ambitious tourism targets in much of the surrounding region, create substantial demand. Today, two of the top 10 busiest airports for international passenger traffic are in the Middle East, with Dubai ranking first globally.

“As we look toward 2040, the countries that continue to invest strategically in their aviation ecosystems will reap outsized rewards in economic diversification, skilled job creation, and global connectivity,” said Ryan Harmon, Editor, Aviation Business Middle East. “What's particularly encouraging is seeing how governments across the region are embracing next-generation technologies and sustainable practices that will ensure this growth benefits both their economies and the planet.”

""The Middle East aviation story isn't just the scale of growth, but how the region is pioneering new models of industry development,"" said Aziz Koleilat, President and CEO – Middle East, Türkiye, & CIS at GE Aerospace. ""By simultaneously investing in airlines, airports, infrastructure, and MRO capabilities, countries are creating integrated aviation ecosystems that will deliver economic benefits far beyond traditional air transport metrics.""

A growth story in Saudi Arabia and beyond

This paper has a particular focus on Saudi Arabia, which stands out as one of the region's most dynamic growth stories. The Kingdom has seen the Middle East's largest percentage jump in aviation-related jobs between 2016 and 2023, rising 136% to 1.4 million positions. The country’s aviation sector GDP contribution increased more than 150% to US$91 billion during the same period. The Saudi Aviation Strategy, backed by $100 billion in investments, aims to triple annual passenger traffic to 330 million, extend connectivity to more than 250 destinations from 29 airports, and increase air cargo volumes more than five-fold to 4.5 million tons by 2030.

Elsewhere in the region, the UAE continues to demonstrate aviation's economic impact, with the sector contributing 18.2% to national GDP – more than five times the global average of 3.9%. The UAE employs one-third of all direct aviation jobs in the region.

Finally, the aviation sector in Qatar has been identified as a key enabler of the Third Qatar National Development Strategy 2024-2030, specifically by expanding its air transport activities and positioning its logistics cluster as a specialized e-commerce distribution hub.

A soaring future

Looking ahead, the white paper identifies several key trends that will shape the industry's future.

Regional investments in artificial intelligence will accelerate implementation across aviation operations, from predictive maintenance to fuel optimization by pilots.

Middle East governments and airlines are positioning themselves as adopters of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, with the UAE targeting 700 million liters of SAF production annually by 2030 and Saudi Arabia building infrastructure to support SAF development as part of megaprojects such as NEOM.

As regional space programs develop in countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Oman, they will create new opportunities for the aerospace sector through overlapping specialized manufacturing, IT, and engineering skills.

The paper also outlines several actions that can be implemented to further strengthen the sector's economic impact. These include:

Greater harmonization of the Middle East's regulatory environment to improve efficiencies for airlines and MRO operators facing multiple certification standards.

Improved coordination of airspace and traffic management through data sharing and expanded access for civilian aircraft to accommodate rising traffic volumes.

Expanded in-region training and educational programs to ensure a sufficiently skilled workforce across all aviation disciplines.

The future of flight is strong across the Middle East. As the aviation industry continues to grow, it will help to power the economic advancement of countries in the region.

The airline is testing locally produced sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of its flights. With an ambitious goal to integrate sustainable fuel solutions into its operations, Kenya Airways is not only contributing to global carbon reduction efforts but also aiming to create a cost-effective, locally sourced alternative to traditional jet fuel. This move aligns with the airline’s commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and supports the wider aviation industry’s shift toward more sustainable practices. By tapping into Africa’s vast agricultural resources, Kenya Airways is setting the stage for a new era in African aviation—one that combines economic viability with environmental responsibility.

Kenya Airways Plc is making a bold move to showcase that sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) can be produced and used in Africa, proving that the continent can contribute to the growing global demand for green aviation fuels.

The Nairobi-based airline has taken a significant step by operating four return flights between October 14 and 21, each using a blend of SAF, in an effort to explore the feasibility of producing the green fuel locally. This is a part of the airline’s strategy to reduce its carbon footprint and to find a cost-effective alternative to traditional jet fuel.

The first flight in this trial took off from Nairobi to Paris on Tuesday. This flight was part of a broader shift in Europe, where new regulations require at least 2% SAF to be included in all departing flights. For this journey, Kenya Airways combined conventional jet fuel with biofuel derived from drought-resistant crops like croton, which are grown in Kenya. The biofuel is a key element of the airline’s attempt to test locally sourced fuel and determine its performance on long-haul flights.

Kenya Airways had already made history in 2023 when it became the first African airline to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight. That flight used biofuel from an international supplier, Italy’s Eni SpA, which signified a major milestone in the airline’s sustainability journey. However, the airline is now keen to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers and focus on producing SAF locally, which could be more sustainable and cost-effective for the region.

The challenge with SAF, however, lies in its cost. While SAF is an important tool in reducing aviation’s carbon emissions, it comes at a price. SAF costs up to twice as much as conventional jet fuel, and for African carriers, it can cost up to five times more due to the complexities of logistics and the lack of a local supply chain. This financial burden is a significant hurdle for African airlines, as the cost of SAF can impact ticket prices and make the fuel less appealing to both airlines and passengers.

Kenya Airways is addressing this challenge head-on by looking into ways to reduce SAF production costs, aiming to find solutions that can make the fuel more affordable in the long run. The airline also hopes to attract subsidies from governments and international organizations to support the production and use of SAF. The airline’s CEO has emphasized that African passengers are not yet willing to pay extra for flights that use SAF, which adds a layer of complexity to the airline’s strategy.

To expand its SAF-powered operations, Kenya Airways plans to introduce SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to other major global destinations, including Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. While European airports will provide SAF refueling services for these flights, the return flight to Cape Town will be powered by conventional fuel. The airline intends to initially incorporate 2% SAF into its fleet and gradually increase this percentage to 10% by 2030. This ambitious goal aligns with Kenya Airways’ long-term sustainability plans, which aim to reduce the airline’s environmental impact and encourage the adoption of green fuels in Africa.

Local SAF production could also offer additional benefits beyond cost reduction. It could provide an opportunity for Kenyan airlines to meet future regulatory requirements as governments and international bodies push for greener fuel options in aviation. In addition, the development of a local SAF supply chain could open up financing opportunities from both African lenders and international climate funds. This financing could be critical in helping Kenya Airways and other African carriers scale up their SAF use and remain competitive as sustainability becomes increasingly important in global aviation.

Kenya Airways has partnered with Bleriot Group, a company that produces the biofuel used in the airline’s demonstration flights. Bleriot Group holds a 15-year lease on 6,000 acres of land that was previously mined by a major mining company. The land, which is not suitable for food crops, is now being used to cultivate plants for biofuel production. This sustainable land use provides a viable alternative to traditional agricultural activities and is an example of how Kenya can leverage its natural resources for green energy production.

Bleriot Group’s efforts to use this land for biofuel production highlight the potential for sustainable agriculture to play a significant role in the growth of Africa’s green economy. By using drought-resistant crops to produce biofuels, the initiative not only contributes to reducing the aviation industry’s carbon footprint but also supports local agriculture and rural economies.

This partnership between Kenya Airways and Bleriot Group represents a promising step in the future of sustainable aviation in Africa. As the airline continues to test the viability of locally sourced SAF and increase its green fuel usage, Kenya Airways hopes to serve as a model for other airlines across the continent. With the potential for cost reductions, increased financing opportunities, and a stronger local economy, the airline’s commitment to SAF could ultimately make it a pioneer in Africa’s sustainable aviation industry.

Kenya Airways is leading Africa’s sustainable aviation movement by pioneering the use of locally produced sustainable aviation fuel. This initiative aims to reduce both operational costs and the environmental impact of air travel, setting a new standard for green aviation in the region.

The results of these demonstration flights will provide valuable data that could help shape the future of SAF production and usage in Africa. If successful, this initiative could open the door to a broader adoption of SAF across the African aviation sector, helping the industry meet its carbon reduction targets and contribute to the global fight against climate change. The journey of Kenya Airways towards a more sustainable future is just beginning, but the steps taken so far show promise for both the airline and the region’s aviation industry.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Kenya-Airways-1.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:01:35.280797

The growing cross-sectoral appetite — and increasing global demand — for these same feedstocks is expected to exacerbate the feedstock supply conundrum.","Decarbonization challenges: The aviation sector has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, but it is hindered by the limited availability and high costs of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).

Policy and regulatory landscape: International cooperation and cohesive policy frameworks will be critical for advancing SAF adoption and establishing a viable offsets market.

Financial and operational implications: Airlines are navigating a high-risk environment while facing increased costs associated with decarbonization efforts, and the challenge of balancing investment in new technologies with managing ticket prices and consumer demand elasticity.

According to S&P Global Commodity Insights data, aviation accounted for around 3% of global energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2024, with this share on the rise as air passenger traffic continues to expand. The International Air Transport Association (IATA, an airline trade body) predicts that global air passenger traffic could more than double to reach 10 billion journeys per year by 2050. Many major airports around the world are planning to expand to accommodate the predicted growth in demand.

The decarbonization roadmap for a growing industry reliant on fossil-fuel-powered aircraft is undeniably challenging. Nevertheless, many airlines have pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Unlike the road sector, where electrification is more feasible, the aviation industry faces unique hurdles in transitioning to low- and zero-emission energy sources, particularly for long-distance flights. As a result, current decarbonization efforts primarily focus on scaling up the supply of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), enhancing aircraft efficiency — including investing in new-generation aircraft and optimizing route planning — and utilizing carbon offsets. New technologies such as electric and hydrogen propulsion systems face roadblocks in becoming long-haul solutions, due to factors such as battery weight, the hefty cost of new infrastructure required for hydrogen storage, and new regulations.

While ambitions surrounding SAF usage are high, SAF availability is currently extremely limited, leading to minimal average use by airlines. The most affordable SAF is currently about three times more expensive than conventional jet fuel, and feedstock availability poses additional challenges. Consequently, there are widespread concerns regarding the scalability of production to meet decarbonization targets.

Airlines operate within a highly unpredictable, cyclical trading environment, characterized by frequent disruptions, such as employee strikes, air traffic control issues, weather-related delays and geopolitical events. The sector is marked by high capital intensity and relatively thin profit margins due to intense competition, while revenue visibility is low, as customer booking windows are typically short, and costs such as fuel can fluctuate significantly. As such, and according to our S&P Global Ratings methodology, our Global Industry Risk Assessment for Transportation Cyclical industries (which includes airlines) is “High risk” (or “5”).

Given these conditions, credit ratings for much of the sector are relatively low, with over 70% of our global airline ratings falling into the non-investment-grade category (see figure below). The highest global airline rating is BBB+. Our airline ratings also factor in environmental risks and reflect uncertainties stemming from the pace of development of climate-related technologies, related market developments, and environmental regulatory and policy initiatives. Airlines with lower credit ratings will typically have higher costs of capital, making decarbonization investments more costly and maybe a lower priority versus shorter-term funding needs.

SAF adoption is central to IATA’s Net-Zero 2050 roadmap, which focuses on achieving net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. SAF solutions are expected to provide the largest share of aviation’s carbon abatement through to 2050, while offsets will also continue to play an important role. Decarbonizing aviation requires international cooperation and alignment. Yet policy, still in its initial stages, remains fragmented, with significant differences in approach and ambition across regions. Although policymakers initially focused on placing a carbon price on emissions from flights, they have more recently shifted efforts to include more direct incentives for SAF uptake.

Europe is leading the way in terms of ambition and progress on policy adoption. Domestic (intra-EU) aviation emissions have been part of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), a cap-and-trade framework designed to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, since 2012. Under this system, airlines are required to monitor, report and verify their emissions.

Initially, the EU ETS was designed to apply to all flights to, from and within the European Economic Area (EEA), but its scope has been temporarily limited to intra-EEA flights to support the development of the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This limitation in scope is in place until the end of 2026, but could be extended further, pending assessment from the European Commission. Recent revisions aim to enhance the system's effectiveness by phasing out free allowances by 2026, reducing the industry’s emissions cap and increasing the auctioning of emissions permits. Additionally, the EU is allocating funds from the ETS to support the adoption of SAF. The UK has a similar scheme in place, the UK ETS, which has been covering the aviation sector since 2021. Flights within the UK, as well as those departing to EEA countries, Switzerland and Gibraltar, are included in the scheme.

Suppliers can meet the main obligation and PtL obligation by supplying the required fuel or purchasing certificates to meet a shortfall through a certificate trading scheme. Certificates are awarded in proportion to energy content and GHG footprints, allowing suppliers to reduce their obligation by supplying SAF with lower GHG intensities. Alternatively, suppliers may buy out of their obligations by paying the buy-out price, although its level is prohibitive at £5,875 per metric ton for the main SAF obligation and £6,250 per metric ton for the PtL obligation. All eyes will now be on how the UK SAF market evolves and what lessons can be brought to the European Union’s first review.

In North America, the landscape for SAF policy has been characterized by fragility and uncertainty, particularly regarding supply versus demand dynamics that are increasingly influenced at state and provincial levels. In the US, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act introduced the Clean Fuel Production Credit, or 45Z, which initially offered credits ranging from $1.25 to $1.75 per gallon for SAF. However, delays regarding implementation led many fuel producers to abandon their SAF projects in favor of renewable diesel (benefiting from existing federal and state mandates) or even fossil diesel. This uncertainty deterred investors, as the renewable fuels market faced low margins and volatile feedstock costs.

At both US federal and state levels, various legislative efforts are underway to promote SAF. Illinois, Nebraska, Minnesota and Washington have introduced or are implementing tax credits to incentivize SAF production. California’s Low-Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program currently provides greater incentives to produce renewable diesel than to produce SAF, although treatment of SAF is developing in other state LCFS programs. Meanwhile, in Canada, British Columbia has set mandatory blending requirements for renewable fuel in jet fuel, aiming for a gradual increase through 2030. Canada’s Clean Fuel Regulations program also incentivizes SAF. Both the US and Canada are signatories to the CORSIA agreement, although the US's commitment is uncertain following shifts in political leadership and policy direction.

Other markets are also witnessing the development of regulations and policies that support the adoption of SAF. Countries in Latin America and Asia are beginning to set SAF targets, although these remain modest compared to levels in Europe. In Latin America, Brazil instated a 1% emissions reduction mandate for aviation by 2027, while Chile and Colombia launched SAF roadmaps to achieve a 50% SAF blend rate in 2050. Several Asian countries are targeting 1% SAF within the next two years, notably Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia by 2026, and India and South Korea by 2027. Some have set more ambitious SAF blend targets for international flights by 2030, with Singapore aiming for 3%-5%, Taiwan targeting 5% and Japan striving for 10%. Several other Asia-Pacific markets, such as Malaysia and Australia, are approaching demand-side measures with more caution but are expected to communicate their plans soon. Lastly, China has set a SAF consumption target of only 50,000 metric tons by 2025.

The Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was adopted in 2016 by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to offset the increase in international aviation emissions over a specified baseline, given that international bunker emissions (including from the maritime sector) are not attributed to any country under the Paris Agreement and thus are not covered under individual countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs). The scheme is to be implemented in phases to address industry and state concerns of feasibility and equitable burden-sharing. After an initial Pilot Phase between 2021 and 2023, the scheme entered Phase I as of January 2024, with 128 participating countries as of 2025. Participation in this phase remains voluntary for ICAO member states until mandatory compliance takes effect at the beginning of Phase II in 2027. In theory, CORSIA should cover 85% of the aviation industry’s international emissions.

To comply with CORSIA obligations, airplane operators are required to surrender carbon credits sourced from the voluntary carbon market (VCM) that comply with requirements set out by the ICAO’s Technical Advisory Board or use eligible SAF.

Credits must carry a corresponding adjustment (CA), an accounting adjustment created under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement that is applied to national emissions inventories reflecting the international sale or acquisition of emissions mitigations that occurred in a different jurisdiction. This condition significantly tightens the supply of credits that are eligible to be used for CORSIA compliance, given that, halfway through the current phase of the scheme, only one project has issued eligible credits.

Despite the scheme being in place for over four years, restrictions related to credit eligibility limit its feasibility. S&P Global Commodity Insights forecasts credit demand for the current phase to reach 155 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mtCO2e), against a current supply of only 16 million mtCO2e from the eligible Guyana REDD+ project, a mitigation effort that reduces emissions from deforestation. Moreover, our in-house forecast for Phase I eligible supply indicates that a volume of credits sufficient to cover demand for 2024–26 would only materialize after the end of the compliance deadline. Availability of suitable credits is one of the main issues that airlines face when trying to comply with the scheme, notably because the price divergence between CORSIA-eligible credits and alternative fuels would make the former a more attractive decarbonization option.

The average Platts CORSIA-Eligible Credits (CEC) price assessment was $20.97/mtCO2e in the first half of 2025, peaking at $22.25/mtCO2e in June. This is much higher than other credits in the VCM, which averaged $14.98/mtCO2e for afforestation and reforestation projects. However, CORSIA-eligible credits are still lower than achieving reductions using SAF, given current prices.

CORSIA is enforced at the state level, meaning that participating countries are responsible for establishing compliance rules and penalties for airline operators that fail to comply. In most cases, these penalties have not yet been set, with Brazil and the UK being notable exceptions. The discretionary nature of penalties introduced by member states poses significant risks of noncompliance. If countries like China and India (which are not participating in Phase I) do not create regulations to enforce compliance in Phase II, the effectiveness of CORSIA could be significantly undermined.

Importantly, the European Union’s position on CORSIA could threaten the future viability of the scheme. The EU ETS currently covers intra-European flights, with CORSIA to cover any flights from an EEA country to a third country (and vice versa). While this distinction was initially introduced to address fierce international opposition to coverage of all flights under the EU ETS, by July 2026, the European Commission will have to report to the EU Parliament and the European Council on CORSIA's environmental integrity. If the commission finds CORSIA inadequate for addressing international aviation emissions, the ETS may be extended to include flights departing from the EEA to third countries. This could potentially prompt other countries to withdraw from the scheme.

According to Platts (part of S&P Global Commodity Insights), SAF prices in Europe lost 39% of their value in 2024, falling from near $3,000/metric ton at the beginning of the year to under $1,716/metric ton in May as production increased but new demand failed to materialize. Such a price move may be helpful for airlines and their customers, but it directly impacts production margins and investments, with construction of several facilities canceled or paused, citing “challenging market conditions.” So far in 2025, SAF prices have fallen to record lows, with the global SAF market oversupplied, which is a notable shift for a market where lack of availability is a long-term theme. Over the second half of 2025, prices have rebounded as we head toward the first European compliance deadline, with outright prices reaching $2,260 per metric ton in September, more than three times the value of jet fuel.

The SAF market is currently very small, estimated at only 1.1 million metric tons (MMt) in 2024, which is less than 0.5% of global jet fuel consumption. Demand for SAF is primarily driven by policy incentives and voluntary commitments by airlines, with a significant concentration in Europe and North America, which together accounted for almost 90% of global consumption in 2024. Nearly 60% of that was consumed in Europe, where countries like Sweden, Norway and France had SAF mandates in place, and the largest local airlines have committed to replacing 10% of their jet fuel with SAF by 2030.

SAF production capacity is also increasing, and S&P Global expects it to reach 4.3 MMt by the end of the year, with about 25 dedicated SAF plants (plants designed to produce mostly SAF) in operation globally. There is additional SAF produced as a by-product of renewable diesel (RD) or from plants with a more balanced RD/SAF yield. Regional capacity/demand imbalances are already emerging and could be an indicator of future trade patterns. More than half of the existing dedicated SAF capacity (2.3 MMt) is in Asia, despite low levels of demand in the region, while only about 1 MMt is in North America (600,000 metric tons) and Europe (400,000 metric tons), the largest markets.

S&P Global expects strong growth in the SAF market over the coming decades, with demand projected to increase tenfold by 2030, to above 11 MMt, and then rise exponentially to almost 80 MMt by 2050. SAF is expected to account for 18.6% of the world’s aviation fuel in 2050. Europe will be the main driver, especially in the short to medium term. The high SAF mandates in the European Union and the UK will support SAF adoption in Europe, where demand is forecast to reach close to 5 MMt in 2030 and almost 28 MMt by 2050.

In Asia, SAF consumption will be slow to take off and initially will be driven by airlines and modest SAF blend mandates in a couple of markets. Consumption is thus expected to reach just 3.6 MMt in 2030 and be concentrated in OECD markets and aviation hubs. After 2030, demand growth will accelerate as mainland China and India significantly ramp up their SAF blends, bringing regional volumes to 30 MMt by 2050. Similar to Asia, SAF uptake in the US will be slower until the 2030s, due to weak policy support. In the longer term, demand will rise as state-level incentives expand alongside clean fuel programs, but North America will fall behind Asia and Europe, with demand expected to reach only 12.7 MMt by 2050. Adoption in other regions will remain limited.

One of the key challenges the industry faces is expanding capacity to meet this level of demand. S&P Global tracks RD and SAF plants and projects and has identified over 190 new dedicated SAF projects announced worldwide. If all of these projects come to fruition, SAF capacity could grow almost tenfold to more than 40 MMt by 2030. Most projects are in North America (15.8 MMt), Asia (13.4 MMt) and Europe (7.2 MMt). However, only a fraction of them, equivalent to 7.3 MMt of SAF capacity, have reached a final investment decision (FID), with 28.5 MMt of capacity still awaiting approval. With the world needing 80 MMt of SAF by 2050 according to S&P Global estimates, the scale of the task is significant.

Ramping up SAF capacity has its challenges. Nearly two-thirds of the planned capacity by 2030 (25.3 MMt) is HEFA. While this is a commercially mature and cost-effective SAF production technology, it is constrained by lipid feedstock availability. Biofuels mandates and decarbonization requirements are being extended beyond road transport to other transport modes (rail, shipping and aviation) and off-road sectors (heating, etc.). They are also being progressively rolled out and bolstered in developing countries. The growing cross-sectoral appetite — and increasing global demand — for these same feedstocks is expected to exacerbate the feedstock supply conundrum.

Other options beyond HEFA exist, but they will need to be developed for supply to meet projected demand. One fifth (8.4 MMt) of announced capacity by 2030 will rely on the Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathway, and the rest on Fischer-Tropsch (FT), Methanol-to-Jet (MTJ) and other newer pathways. However, these pathways are more nascent and costlier, and only a few have reached FID. Of the approximately 110 non-HEFA bio-SAF projects announced globally, the vast majority (105) are “speculative,” that is, currently in the feasibility or pre-FEED stage and have yet to reach FID. They face structural headwinds, namely technical challenges with integrating multiple early-stage conversion processes, high capex and production costs, reliable feedstock supply chains, and demand and price uncertainty.

Finally, Power-to-Liquids (PTL) is touted as the answer to these issues and the long-term solution to decarbonizing aviation. However, the e-SAF sector is also facing headwinds, with most planned projects yet to reach FID. The main hurdles are related to policy uncertainty, technology risks, reliance on other key value chains and project financing. Most e-fuel pathways are currently at a low level of technological maturity, with facilities only operating at pilot or demonstration scale. There remain technical risks associated with integrating multiple conversion technologies in a single process at full industrial scale. Moreover, limited visibility on long-term prices and penalties (particularly under RFEUA) results in challenges in attracting buyers willing to commit to long-term offtake contracts, which are crucial for developers to secure project financing. Lastly, e-fuel production requires a source of green hydrogen and captured CO2. While electrolysis and CO2 capture technologies are mature, projects and supply chains have yet to develop to the level required for large-scale e-fuel production.",https://spglobal.scene7.com/is/image/spglobalcom/corp_1014_sustainableaviationfuel?$responsive$,N,,2025-10-16 11:03:04.155751

As Europe’s ReFuelEU regulation comes into force, mandating minimum blends of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), airlines are under pressure to comply while also differentiating themselves in decarbonization efforts.

IBA’s Sustainability Watch: October 2025 provides a snapshot of how major European airline groups performed in 2024 in terms of SAF use on intra-EU flights.

How European airlines used SAF in 2024

According to IBA’s NetZero platform data, SAF adoption among European airlines is divided. Early movers that have integrated SAF into their fuel supply at measurable levels, but other carriers are still behind.

IAG (International Airlines Group) airlines lead the way in the adoption of SAF. In 2024, IAG achieved an average SAF blend of approximately 3.9% for its intra-EU operations, which makes it the most aggressive adopter so far.

Air France–KLM is not far behind, with an average blend of nearly 2.5%.

SAS recorded a blend of roughly 1.1 %, while Finnair’s uptake was modest at around 0.4 %.

Lufthansa Group airlines have been slow in SAF deployment, with a group-wide average of nearly 0.2% in 2024.

IBA describes the low-cost segment (Ryanair and Wizz Air) as having “very limited” use of SAF. Still, both carriers have set ambitious goals for 2030: 12.5% for Ryanair and 10% for Wizz. They have also inked supply agreements to help meet those targets as SAF availability improves.

Slow progress, but airline SAF strategy is developing

The numbers for 2024 show limited progress. With the EU’s SAF blending mandates, airlines across Europe will face mounting pressure to accelerate their efforts.

IBA describes early SAF adoption as “more tactical than reactive.” While carriers using SAF face higher costs than their peers who rely on conventional fuel, the advantage of early adoption is in securing a limited supply, building credibility for their sustainability claims, and taking advantage of the EU Emissions Trading System incentive.

“Groups such as IAG and Air France–KLM are already demonstrating how long-term contracts can deliver both compliance benefits and a foundation for scaling towards 2030,” IBA states. “For slower adopters, the risk is that supply constraints and carbon price pressures will narrow future options, forcing later procurement at higher cost.

“With the first ReFuelEU mandate beginning this year, 2025 credits will be a clearer test of execution. The advantage will rest with those treating SAF not as a short-term burden but as a strategic asset.”

Ensuring an adequate supply of SAF

Currently, even airlines eager to increase the use of SAF may encounter physical limitations in feedstock, production capacity, and logistics. A study by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and Worley Consulting demonstrated there is enough sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) feedstock to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

However, the study found that the diversity of SAF production sources is hindered due to a slow rollout of technology. Currently, the only commercial-scale SAF production facilities utilise HEFA technology, such as converting used cooking oil into SAF.

There is also competition to acquire SAF feedstocks for other potential users. IATA says government policies should allocate biomass feedstock to aviation to ensure an adequate supply.

According to IATA, the main challenges are:

Increasing supply chain infrastructure, identifying new sustainable sources, and providing the feedstocks identified for SAF production to the air transport industry.

Accelerating the adoption of new SAF technologies, including Power-to-Liquids (PtL), which require reliable access to low-cost renewable electricity, hydrogen, and carbon capture infrastructure.

Creating a fully functioning SAF market through coordinated government policies and investment.

Fostering regional leadership among North America, Brazil, Europe, India, China, and ASEAN to drive SAF output.

Inspiring energy industry investment in SAF capacity, supporting technology commercialisation, and aligning business strategies with global decarbonization goals.

For now, IAG and Air France–KLM lead the way in SAF adoption in Europe, but whether they can maintain or widen this lead will depend heavily on how the SAF market evolves, how policies develop, and how quickly lagging carriers can catch up.",https://aerospaceglobalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Air-France-Sustainable-aviation-Fuel.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 10:01:44.122394

“This project addresses two global challenges — waste management and transport decarbonization,” said Frederick Opoku Agyekum, Development Director at F&B Bio Recyclage. “Our Phase 1 completion shows we can turn trash into clean jet fuel at scale in Ghana, with clear environmental and economic benefits.”

According to the African Clean Cities Platform, over 90% of Africa’s waste ends up in uncontrolled dumpsites and is often burned in the open. Nineteen of the world’s 50 largest dumpsites are located in sub-Saharan Africa, releasing methane and black carbon that harm air quality and public health.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates aviation generates 2.5% of global CO₂ emissions, while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) says sustainable aviation fuels could provide up to 65% of the cuts needed for carbon neutrality by 2050.

Thanks to federal tax credits, biofuel producers will be able to pay farmers at least two times more an acre for crops than most food companies, finds a study by management consultancy Bain & Company — with the potential to disrupt agricultural markets.

The 45Z clean fuel production credit was introduced in 2025 under the Inflation Reduction Act to incentivise the domestic production of low-carbon transport fuels, including sustainable aviation fuel and biomass-based diesel.

While the Donald Trump administration revoked many of the IRA’s key tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, it extended the 45Z credit, which was set to expire in 2027, to 2029.

There will be “much greater competition” between food and fuel producers, particularly for major crops such as corn and soya, Bain partner Andrew Keech said in a statement.

This is not the first time US federal policy has reshaped agricultural markets, the report notes. Between 2005 and 2012, inflation-adjusted corn prices leapt up by 193 per cent, driven in part by a government mandate to blend gasoline with ethanol.

“Today’s potential biofuels boom may not unfold in the same way, but the strategic risks are familiar,” the report says.

Global demand for biofuels is set to rise exponentially in the coming years as hard-to-abate sectors such as aviation and shipping work to decarbonise.

More pressure on food companies

This comes as food companies are already facing pricing pressures, reduced supply chain resilience, and greater difficulty obtaining key ingredients, the report notes.

As biofuel producers are able to bid more aggressively for farmland acres, food companies could face “higher input prices, reduced access to sustainable ingredients, and challenges in meeting both sustainability commitments and supply chain ambitions”, it says.

Bain estimates that biofuel producers will be able to pay up to $180 an acre thanks to the tax credits. It contrasts that with the $15–$35 an acre food companies typically offer.

In 2025, just 9 per cent of US-grown corn is expected to enter the human food supply, compared with 38 per cent for animal feed, 35 per cent for ethanol production, and 18 per cent for exports, says the report. Eight per cent of US-grown soya will be used for human consumption this year.

Remedies available

Bain recommends that food companies start by mapping their most critical ingredients and where they are sourced from, quantifying how overlaps with biofuel demand could affect their ability to secure a sustainable supply. It also suggests that companies explore sourcing alternatives and develop contingency plans before problems emerge.

“As extreme weather events increase and temperatures rise, supply chain resilience will be mission critical,” says the report. “The food industry’s resilience will depend on how quickly companies adapt to this new reality.”",https://d2iztrg3kgqpue.cloudfront.net/production/c01d6497-e6da-405a-a779-d0a5fad456f0.jpg,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:02.699984

Produced from waste and renewable sources, SAF can power aircraft without modifications, helping airlines meet sustainability targets while creating green jobs and new industrial opportunities

Government mandates and financial guarantees are driving investment, lowering costs and accelerating adoption, positioning SAF as the key to a cleaner, more resilient future for aviation

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) represents aviation’s most promising and practical path to reducing carbon emissions and achieving 2050 sustainability goals. In May 2025, the UK Government introduced the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill (SAF), which has reached Report Stage in Parliament. The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT UK) is helping the Government with advice and guidance on SAF and how it can help the logistics and transport sector.

But understanding SAF ‘s workings and benefits is crucial for the aviation sector – and why it must be embraced sooner rather than later. Geoff Maynard, member of the Aviation Policy Group at CILT (UK), recently gave evidence in Parliament to the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Bill Committee as MPs further consider the Bill.

Geoff Maynard has worked in the aviation sector for over 25 years, undertaking a wide range of aviation related commissions, many with extensive environmental content. Educated at Queens’ College, Cambridge, with a degree in Natural Sciences, Geoff has held senior positions in both the private and public sectors. He has worked on many major projects including Heathrow’s T5, the Olympic Terminal in Beijing, and a new airport for Eswatini.

Geoff gives his expert insight into SAF, its benefits, challenges, future and why the sector must embrace it.

SAF is a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel that can power aircraft without engine or infrastructure changes. Produced from sustainable resources like agricultural waste, used cooking oil, and municipal solid waste, SAF is a “drop-in” fuel that can be used in existing aircraft engines and fuel systems without modifications. It performs identically to traditional jet fuel in terms of energy density, freezing point, and combustion characteristics, requiring no special training or new equipment. SAF can also be produced using green electricity, water and carbon dioxide extracted from the air. This SAF, also known as e-fuel, could be produced in very large quantities – constrained only by the investment in new plant.

Raw materials undergo treatments to remove impurities, then hydro processing, gasification, or fermentation are used to transform them into high-quality aviation fuel that mimics traditional jet fuel properties. The aim for the government is to blend SAF fuel with traditional fossil jet fuel and with time increase the SAF fuel ratio and thus lower the use of fossil jet fuel.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) offers significant environmental advantages, primarily through a substantial reduction in lifecycle carbon emissions. Unlike traditional jet fuel, which releases ancient carbon into the atmosphere, SAF is derived from materials that recently absorbed atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a closed carbon loop.

This process can lead to lifecycle carbon emission reductions of up to 80% compared to conventional fossil jet fuel.

Additionally, SAF contributes to waste reduction by repurposing materials such as used cooking oil, agricultural residues, and municipal waste into energy, fostering a circular economy in waste management and energy production.

The government is encouraging this trend by first, mandating the percentage of SAF that must be included in aviation jet fuel sold in the UK. Second the SAF bill currently going through parliament establishes a company that can contract with industry to produce SAF at an agreed cost. If the SAF is ultimately sold at a price more than the agreed cost the excess is returned to the Government. Conversely if the SAF is sold at less than the agreed cost, the Government reimburses the producer for the loss. In this way, the Government eliminates the uncertainty that private industry faces in producing SAF, ensuring they cover their costs but also ensuring sufficient SAF is available to meet the mandated percentage.

These measures will help SAF overcome its adoption barriers, primarily its high cost, which is two to five times greater than traditional jet fuel, impacting airline profitability and passenger pricing. The Government expects that as the mandated SAF percentage rises, volumes produced will rise and it will naturally bring the price down as demand goes up.

The development of SAF is creating new industries and economic opportunities, with companies investing in production facilities, research, and supply chains. This investment is generating jobs. For airlines, SAF is vital for achieving sustainability goals and meeting passenger demands for eco-friendly travel. The ability to hit sustainability targets by simply adding a fuel the mix is the biggest pull factor, but for this to happen Government must encourage and support the development and introduction of SAF. This year all jet fuel sold in the UK must by law contain 2% SAF, with the percentage rising linearly to 10% by 2030, and on to 22% by 2040.

The future of SAF looks promising due to advancements in technology and increased production. Researchers are creating new methods that lower costs and reduce environmental effects. Major airlines aim for net-zero, which means SAF will play a vital role. Aircraft are being designed for 100% SAF, and production capacity is set to grow.

The availability of fossil jet fuel will reduce as other sectors, notably road transport, move away from fossil diesel and petrol. SAF will fill this gap and with the support of CILT UK we are helping bridge the conversation between our industries, airlines and Government.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Page-4-copy.jpeg,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:08.145668

China this year placed no orders for soybeans from the U.S. amid the Trump administration’s ongoing trade war with the nation, which previously imported roughly two-thirds of the state’s crop.

The state produced just over $1.02 billion in soybeans last year, just under the $1.04 billion in hay and haylage. Corn led the state with $2.27 billion in production.

Sara Stelter, the former president of the Wisconsin Soybean Association, during a Farmers for Free Trade listening session in Westby said the ag industry is doing everything it can to find new opportunities for the market, and the soybean market decline is also impacting the prices of other crops.

“What people don’t understand … is when the markets crash for corn and soybeans, it crashes all our markets for everything,” Stelter said. “Because our contracts for vegetables are based off the grain markets. It doesn’t make sense, but they’re in competition with acres for grain, so that’s why they always follow the grain markets.”

Some new markets soybean farmers are looking at include sustainable aviation fuel, biodiesel for trains, wood glue and other industrial products, firefighting foam and replacing petroleum-based oil with soybean oil in more models of Goodyear tires.

“So we’re doing everything we can to look at our markets on a domestic level,” she said.

The United Soybean Board, which Stelter is a director on, is doing research to combat anti-seed oil rhetoric coming from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Make America Healthy Again effort, she said.

Sen. Brad Pfaff, D-Onalaska, said he’s backing a bill that would incentivize farmers to help build out the soybean-based aviation fuel industry.

“If you’ll remember in Wisconsin in the early 2000s, we really went gung-ho when it came to corn-based ethanol,” he said. “You, as farmers, helped build out that industry. The same idea [is] here as it comes to building out sustainable airplane fuel.”

But the Senate Agriculture and Revenue Committee member also noted the aviation fuel market alone is not going to replace the lost revenue from international exports.

Farmers for Free Trade Executive Director Brian Kuehl also noted the rising costs of steel, aluminum, fertilizer, chemicals, tractor parts and other farm inputs only adds to the difficult time Wisconsin farmers are having right now.

“You can’t keep doing that,” he said. “That’s a recipe for losing farms, and that’s what we’re starting to see.”

One way to help turn the situation around is to hold onto current major export partners, such as Mexico and Canada, and work on gaining new partners.

“That’s got to be the game plan,” Kuehl said. “Take the markets we have, open new markets. That’s how we get stronger. And this trade war, we need to bring it to a rapid end, because right now farmers are getting squeezed, and we’re hearing that all across the United States.”

— Sen. Rachael Cabral-Guevara is pushing back against concerns of government overreach during a public hearing on a bill that would require insurers to cover additional breast cancer screenings.

SB 264 would require insurers and the Medical Assistance program to cover additional screenings such as 3D mammograms, ultrasounds and MRI scans for women with dense breast tissue because normal mammograms often don’t catch breast cancer.

Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, was the sole “no” vote as the legislation cleared the Senate 32-1 earlier this week .

Kapenga told WisPolitics he understands the “financial pain” patients face when forced to pay out of pocket for treatments, such as additional breast cancer screenings.

But he said he voted against the measure because government mandates are “a major driver behind the skyrocketing health care costs that are hurting nearly all families across Wisconsin.”

“The insurance company should ultimately make the decision on which screenings to cover,” he added. “If there is a market demand, they will do it. But using the power of government to override free market forces—or interfere in the doctor/patient health discussion—not only contributes to a higher cost of living for everyone, it also violates the principles of limited government and Constitutional restraint.”

Bill author Cabral-Guevara, R-Appleton, during today’s Assembly Health, Aging and Long-Term Care Committee hearing pushed back on that concern. She said she also generally doesn’t support government mandates on businesses.

“The reason I say this is important, and the reason why I push for this, is because if we are going to say we are offering a service, it can’t be for 60%, only, of the women,” she said, referring to the fact that roughly 40% of women in Wisconsin have dense breast tissue.

She also argued covering late stage cancer treatment is likely more expensive for insurance companies than the cost of covering additional breast cancer screenings.

The American Cancer Society also visited the Capitol this week to bring light to the issue and work to convince lawmakers to pass Gail’s Law, named after Gail Zeamer, who died of breast cancer after several mammograms gave her a clean bill of health.

Tammy Brown, of Janesville, was part of the group of volunteers with ACS. She told WisPolitics she was fortunate enough to be able to pay $1,000 out of pocket in 2023 for an additional screening after a mammogram identified an area of concern, which turned out to be breast cancer.

“Putting off the health care that would enable early cancer intervention, when it can cost less for treatment and be less disruptive to a woman’s life is not a choice that any woman should have to make…ever,” she wrote. “This bill will save lives and ensure cost is not a barrier to early detection. My lawmakers were supportive today, but we need all lawmakers to turn this bill into law.”

— Gov. Tony Evers is urging the Trump administration to reconsider eliminating more than $1.5 billion in U.S. Department of Energy funding for clean energy in Wisconsin.

“Terminating these funding awards at a time of record-high energy demand and rising costs would be counterintuitive, reckless, and ill-advised,” the guv wrote in a letter to Energy Secretary Chris Wright.

Evers highlighted the potential impact in Wisconsin, including the elimination of funding through the Grid Resilience Innovation Partnerships program. Evers said the program supports grid flexibility and improving the resilience of power systems against extreme weather. He said cutting off the funding “will harm Wisconsinites and leave communities more susceptible to power outages and more costly repairs from future extreme weather events.”

The cuts put the Universities of Wisconsin at risk of losing more than $12 million, according to the guv’s office.

“Our state university system has long been a hub for advanced energy research, and federal funds support cutting-edge work in fields like battery storage, carbon capture, grid modernization, and biofuels,” Evers wrote. “These are areas that are critical for the future of U.S. energy independence, and losing this support will slow technological progress and hamper critical research into new and emerging technologies.”

A spokesperson for the state GOP did not return a request for comment.

— The Greater Green Bay Chamber of Commerce has named Lara Fritts its next president and CEO.

Fritts, who currently serves as director of the Frederick County Division of Economic Opportunity in Frederick, Maryland, starts in December and will be the second woman serving in the role. She takes the place of Laurie Radke, who stepped down at the end of August after 14 years in the role.

Fritts started her career in Wisconsin leading community development programs, such as being the first leader of On Broadway in Green Bay. She said she’s “honored to be selected to help lead the region’s next chapter of business and economic growth.”

“I’m excited to return home to partner with our public and private partners as well as the exceptional team at the Greater Green Bay Chamber to champion bold initiatives, strengthen our business community, and drive growth that delivers lasting value across the region,” she added.

— Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson appointed Benjamin Timm as the next Milwaukee Municipal Port director.

Timm has worked for the city government for 24 years and Johnson praised his record as notable, managing successful projects during his time at the Department of City Development. His budget management, lease negotiation and economic development skills make him a good fit, Johnson said.

“Benji Timm is a highly respected colleague who has taken on challenging projects such as Milwaukee Estuary Area of Concern cleanup, Northridge redevelopment and Century City reimagining,” Johnson said. “His professional strengths are a great complement to the talented Port staff he will lead.”

The job opening came after the port director of eight years, Jackie Q. Carter, took a promotion to lead the city’s Department of Employee Relations.

The first of these flights took off on Tuesday from Nairobi to Paris, where new European rules require at least 2% SAF on all departing flights. For this journey, the airline used a mix of conventional jet fuel and a locally produced biofuel made from drought-resistant plants such as croton.

Kenya Airways was the first African carrier to operate a long-haul SAF-powered flight in 2023, using biofuel supplied by Italy’s Eni SpA.

But importing SAF is expensive. The green fuel can cost twice as much as regular jet fuel, and up to five times more for African airlines due to logistics and lack of local supply, according to CEO Allan Kilavuka.

Passengers in Africa are not yet willing to pay extra for lower-carbon flights, Kilavuka said. “so we need to find a way to reduce SAF production costs and hopefully get subsidies from organizations or governments.”

Attracting green capital

Kenya Airways will also operate SAF-powered flights from Nairobi to Amsterdam, London, and Cape Town. At European airports, it will refuel with SAF, but the Cape Town return flight will use conventional fuel. The carrier aims to begin with 2% SAF across its fleet and gradually increase to 10% by 2030.

At the 41st Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in October 2022, states adopted a collective long-term aspirational goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. To put this ambitious vision into practice and quickly curb aviation emissions — expected to rise fast as the sector recovers from COVID-19 disruptions — the ICAO, national governments, airlines and industry will need to work even closer to reduce the climate impact of flying and associated ground operations.

A large share of aviation’s CO2 emissions arise from the combustion of kerosene, known as Jet A-1, in aircraft engines. To avoid this tailpipe CO2 completely, a range of solutions from hydrogen to batteries are possible, but these will require a full redesign of aircrafts and new refuelling infrastructure, and may therefore become widespread only after 2050.

Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is available today, and can be used without the need to develop new planes or engines.

These greener jet fuels deliver substantially lower greenhouse gas emissions than Jet A-1. These emissions are saved throughout the production process as feedstocks used to make SAF have lower lifecycle carbon emissions than fossil jet.

However, the current predominant SAF type (i.e. biofuels) faces real availability and scalability challenges, as well as supply chain bottlenecks and questions over the sustainability of feedstocks. With these barriers in mind, our view is that Power-to-Liquid (PtL) synthetic fuel, obtained from low-carbon hydrogen and CO2, represents the most scalable product for long-term use and an untapped solution for the aviation market.

As PtL fuel is significantly more expensive than other SAFs, realising its potential cannot be achieved without major investment in electrolysis and carbon capture technology development and deployment.

Voluntary demand for SAF among airlines is rising rapidly, driven by significant CO2 savings, corporate carbon reduction targets, mounting policy attention and passenger interest.

Many airlines are already seeking to secure supplies over multi-year periods. This demand will firm up during the 2020s as national SAF mandates come into effect, especially from 2025 onwards.

Mandates are likely to start low but tighten rapidly during the 2030s and beyond. EU regulators are leading the charge: jet fuel supplied to EU airports will need to consist of 2% SAF by 2025, increasing at 5-year intervals to reach 63% in 2050 — of which 28% will consist of e-fuel.

Where demand mandates do not yet exist, the industry is taking some voluntary initiative, with a number of partnerships announced between major airlines and fuel suppliers to trial or regularly use SAF. Governments are also aware that domestic SAF production offers fuel security as an additional benefit.

To meet increasing demand, SAF production facilities are being constructed, announced or developed around the world. At present, the dominant SAF feedstock is vegetable oil. GHG savings are achieved when the feedstock is grown, as it captures CO2 during the process.

The technology to convert vegetable oil into biofuel (synthesised paraffinic kerosene) through hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) is already commercial, and HEFA is the simplest and cheapest form of SAF, but its availability is limited by overall feedstock supply.

Feedstock prices, hard hit by the Ukraine war, currently represent the majority of the final SAF price. Their volatility can therefore create feedstock supply problems for producers.

Many HEFA feedstocks are monocrops, reliant on fertilisers that suffer from biodiversity reduction and are vulnerable to climatic and geopolitical price shocks.

In the lead-up to 2030, we expect to see a surge in the supply of fuel made from alternative biogenic and non-biogenic waste feedstocks, including agricultural residues, used tyres and municipal solid waste (MSW). These will be transformed into SAF through more advanced processes such as alcohol-to-jet, pyrolysis and Fischer-Tropsch gasification.

Greenhouse gas savings are more complex to assess in cases where non-biogenic waste is used, though other benefits can be realised such as avoided waste to landfill. However, feedstock constraints are once again a risk: wastes including MSW are sought by other sectors, such as incineration and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, making supply finite and competitive.

The constraints faced by these waste-to-fuel production pathways mean that the total SAF yield globally will increase but will still be relatively limited, especially in the coming decade.

To achieve significant SAF scale-up an exponential expansion of e-fuels or power-to-liquid fuels will be needed.

E-fuels are produced using low-carbon hydrogen (produced from biogas or renewable/nuclear electricity electrolysis) and captured CO2 and can achieve over 90% of lifecycle carbon savings compared with fossil Jet A-1.

In theory, e-fuels also have a far higher supply potential than other SAF types as electricity and CO2 are not restricted by feedstock availability in the same way. The catch is that e-fuels are highly energy-intensive to produce, very expensive and dependent on the rapid expansion of clean electricity production (renewable and/or nuclear) and carbon capture technology globally.

More positively, this interaction with electricity and CO2 sources potentially broadens the landscape for investors, with options to look along the value chain, from energy generation and hydrogen production to e-fuel synthesis.

Among the SAF types, PtL offers a great opportunity for decarbonisation at scale. It produces a high energy-density fuel that is more scalable and cleaner than other SAF types, when the energy used for the conversion processes is derived from low-carbon sources and the carbon from climate-neutral sources.

Importantly, PtL plants also offer an opportunity to hedge against the eventual likely demand for different fuel types.",https://kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmgsites/sg/images/2022/12/Aviation engine.PNG,N,,2025-10-16 10:02:55.280968
