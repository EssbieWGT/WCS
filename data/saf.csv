Weihenmayer is the only blind climber to ascend the Seven Summits – the highest peaks on each continent. A Time magazine cover story on his 2001 Mount Everest climb brought him worldwide recognition.

Weihenmayer has also climbed frozen waterfalls in Nepal and Canada, volcanoes in Ecuador and Chile, and long, difficult rock routes in his home in Colorado's Rocky Mountains and the towering cliffs of the Italian Dolomites. And in 2014, he kayaked the entire 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.

""As a blind climber, I have lived a life that no venture capitalist would have put money on, but I have been so lucky to have been a part of great teams, innovating through barriers and shattering people's perceptions of what is possible,"" Weihenmayer said. ""One of my greatest rewards is to be able to share a message of possibility, especially with young people as they shape the vision that will be the foundation for their lives.""

Born with a rare eye disease, Weihenmayer began losing his vision to retinoschisis when he was 14 years old. However, he resisted the idea that blindness would sweep him to the sidelines of life. He established himself as a formidable wrestler in high school, representing his home state of Connecticut in the National Junior Freestyle Wrestling Championship in Iowa. As a teenager, he also discovered rock climbing and a natural dexterity for the tactile aspects of scanning the rock with his hands and feet for holds.

Weihenmayer graduated from Boston College with a double major and in English and communications and earned a master's degree in education from Lesley University in Massachusetts. He later worked as a middle school math and English teacher at the Phoenix Country Day School in Arizona, using innovative tools like Braille seating charts and high-tech scanners to aid his teaching.

By challenging preconceptions about what it means to be blind, Weihenmayer has inspired people around the world. He is the co-founder of the nonprofit organization No Barriers, which offers transformative programs to help people with disabilities live a ""no barriers life."" The organization serves 10,000 people annually, living by its motto: ""What's within you is stronger than what's in your way.""

""I'm very glad we will be welcoming Erik to our campus as this year's Commencement speaker,"" said University of Arizona President Suresh Garimella. ""Erik is a world-renowned adventurer, educator and leader, who has dedicated his life to serving others. His achievements exemplify courage, resilience and the Bear Down spirit, and he is the perfect person to help inspire our graduates to continue to challenge themselves as they embark on the next chapters in their lives.""

Weihenmayer has appeared in several feature-length documentary films. He participated in a volcano research expedition to Vanuatu in the South Pacific alongside Will Smith, a trip that was chronicled in Disney's ""Welcome to Earth"" series, and most recently, he is featured in the short film ""Soundscape,"" which won a Creative Excellence Award at Banff Mountain Film Festival.

Weihenmayer is the author of the best-selling memoir ""Touch the Top of the World,"" which was made into a feature film, and he also wrote ""The Adversity Advantage"" and ""No Barriers: A Blind Man's Journey to Kayak the Grand Canyon.""

Honorary degree recipients

Weihenmayer will be awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the U of A College of Education. He is one of five honorary degree recipients.

Keir Starmer’s Government is facing growing calls to block investment from Chinese firms in the likes of Grangemouth oil refinery, new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C, plus other solar and wind projects.

It comes after Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said over the weekend that companies from China may have to be excluded from “sensitive” sectors after the Government stepped in to take control of the Scunthorpe steelworks from Jingye.

Downing Street appeared to try to defuse the simmering row with China on Monday by resisting pressure for a fresh crackdown on Beijing-linked companies in the UK.

Grangemouth oil refinery

But Starmer’s Government is now facing growing calls to go further and nationalise Grangemouth oil refinery – the under-threat plant near Falkirk partly owned by Chinese company PetroChina.

Several Labour MPs told The i Paper that they backed calls by the SNP to take control of the plant in central Scotland to secure its future.

Opposition MPs also called for the Government to block plans by Chinese company Mingyang to build a wind turbine factory in Scotland.

Hinkley Point C nuclear reactors

Experts also said it was time to examine how Chinese firms could be phased out from other major energy projects – including new nuclear reactors at Hinkley Point C.

However, they warned there was a limit on how much could be nationalised – warning that the Government may have to offer incentives to other private sector players to buy out Chinese firms.

Luke de Pulford, executive director of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, said Labour had been “naïve” and “desperate” in trying to encourage economic investment from Beijing.

“It’s wilful blindness because they know it’s compromising national security,” said the China hawk from IPAC, which brings together international politicians to examine the threats posed by China.

De Pulfold said ministers should do a full “audit” of existing Chinese ownership in key sectors. “We need to be rooting out Chinese investment from our critical infrastructure,” he said.

“It’s not going to be easy. But we need to protect our national security and increase our resilience. We have to accept there might be economic pain, but it’s a case of pain now over more pain later.”

In 2022 the Conservative Government forced China General Nuclear (CGN) out of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project in Suffolk, using £700m of taxpayer cash.

But CGN still owns a 33 per cent interest in the Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, with the French energy giant EDF owning the rest.

The Government should look at encouraging private companies – whether British or from allied companies – to buy out Chinese firms, De Pulford added.

“There has to be other ways of doing it than going around the country nationalising things all over the place. It’s not sustainable.”

The Chinese state ultimately holds £45 billion in UK assets, according to a 2023 ‘China List’ report in The Sunday Times.

China Investment Corporation (CIC), the country’s sovereign wealth fund, has a 10 per cent stake in London’s Heathrow airport, an 8.7 per cent holding in Thames Water, and is also part of a consortium that owns Cadent – the UK’s largest gas distribution network.

Wind farms in and off the coast of Scotland

There has been increasing Chinese investment in Britain’s renewable sector, primarily in wind and solar.

Offshore wind company Mingyang was recently chosen by a joint Italian-Norwegian-Japanese venture to provide the turbines for the Green Volt North Sea wind farm off the north-east coast of Scotland.

Mingyang are also thought to be in talks to build a turbine plant in Scotland. UK Treasury ministers reportedly overruled concerns from the Ministry of Defence about Mingyang’s involvement in the wind farm.

Labour’s investment minister Poppy Gustafsson met with Mingyang at the end of last year, shortly before Chancellor Rachel Reeves went to Beijing to try to drum up wider investment.

The Conservatives’ Shadow Energy Secretary Andrew Bowie said Chinese involvement should sound “alarm bells” – potentially leaving subsea communications vulnerable to Chinese spying attempts.

Bowie told The i Paper that Labour’s “arbitrary” net zero targets meant they had “no choice but to become more and more reliant” on China, accusing the party of “undermining our energy and national security”.

However, some investment decisions were taken while a Conservative government was in power.

Several left-wing Labour MPs, including Jon Trickett and Andy McDonald, have joined the SNP in calling for the Government to consider taking control of Grangemouth from PetroChina and its partner Ineos.

Scotland’s sole oil refinery is set to close by the end of June. The owners have plans to convert it to an import-only terminal, with around 400 of the 2,000 jobs at the site facing the axe.

A joint Scottish and UK Government project have set out a number of options for the future of the Grangemouth site – including the production of hydrogen and sustainable aviation fuel. However, it said that around £3.5 billion of private investment would be needed.

Brian Leishman, Labour MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, said no foreign power should have control over a “vital” asset like an oil refinery. “I don’t understand why the Government won’t do the same for Grangemouth as it did for Scunthorpe.”

He added: “Private, foreign capital is involved in the ownership in both. Losing refining capacity in Scotland will negatively impact our fuel security and therefore our national security.”

Ewan Gibbs, senior lecturer in economic and social history at Glasgow University, said it was “no bad thing” that the idea of nationalisation in heavy industry was back on the table – arguing that there was a good case for taking control of Grangemouth.

“Regardless of the country of origin, it’s clear we have private foreign ownership in key sectors who are not invested in the interests in the UK national or local economies,” said Gibbs.

“They are not committed to the welfare of workforces and capacity. It’s legitimate to be concerned about [security].”

George Magnus, economist and associate at the China Centre at Oxford University, said there should be a higher bar in allowing Chinese companies to invest in critical sectors.

“It’s reasonable to ask the Government that a rule is run over each company in question, and what the risk to Britain is. It’s naive to think if it’s not a state-run enterprise it will be fine,” he said.

However, Magnus warned that attempts to nationalise or force existing Chinese companies out would be difficult – and could lead to retaliatory action from Beijing when it comes to trade and British companies in China.

“I don’t think China will be very happy if the Government began extricating Chinese companies from nuclear and other sectors. There is still a fair bit of commerce that happens between us.”

Industry reactions to Tokayev’s directive

A current Airbus A320 captain, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the president’s directive as a «difficult task.» He noted that Tashkent Airport, located not far from Almaty, is also vying for regional hub status, a competition that Kazakhstan must be prepared to face.

«If Kazakhstan’s authorities manage to implement this project, it will provide a massive stimulus for the growth of local airlines and the broader aviation services sector,» the captain said.

Peter Foster, CEO of Air Astana, Kazakhstan’s flag carrier, said the airline supports the concept of transforming the country into a regional aviation hub. However, he admitted the details remain unclear.

Foster added that Air Astana would support placing the hub in the Almaty region, where most business travel is concentrated. He also speculated that a completely new site could be developed north of the city or even closer to Astana.

What is an air hub and how can it be built?

During an extended cabinet meeting on Jan. 28, 2025, President Tokayev described an air hub as an integrated ecosystem that includes passenger and cargo terminals, logistics centers and modern services.

However, aviation industry expert Abul Kekilbayev noted that the concept of an «air hub» is not clearly defined in current legislation, leading to varied interpretations. For some, it means a large airport handling over 10 million passengers annually. For others, it represents a fully developed transport and logistics center, including warehouses, rail connections, hotels, residential housing, schools, medical centers and facilities for cargo airlines.

Erlan Ospanov, co-owner of Sary-Arka International Airport in Karaganda, emphasized that an air hub is not just about physical infrastructure.

«An air hub requires close cooperation between an airline and an airport. The airline creates the passenger and cargo flows; the airport supports that flow with the necessary infrastructure,» he explained.

Kazakhstan’s law on airspace use and aviation activity defines an air hub as a key airport equipped with infrastructure for organizing connecting flights. It serves as an intermediate stop for airlines to transfer passengers, baggage, mail and cargo en route to final destinations.

How do air hubs operate in other countries?

Ospanov cited several classic examples of successful air hubs: Dubai International Airport with Emirates Airlines, Frankfurt Airport with Lufthansa and Istanbul Airport with Turkish Airlines.

The Airbus A320 captain also pointed to Istanbul as a standout model. He noted that Turkish Airlines now flies to 120 countries and operates a fleet of 347 aircraft.

«This creates enormous demand for their services and drives consistent growth,» he said. «Istanbul is one of the largest airports I’ve ever flown into; it operates thousands of flights each day to every corner of the world. Turkey has shown how to successfully manage transportation and logistics flows, create thousands of jobs and grow its national airline.»

Kekilbayev highlighted Frankfurt’s airport ecosystem as another strong example. Within its vicinity are three major airports: Mannheim, Frankfurt-Hahn and Frankfurt am Main, the latter of which is Europe’s top cargo hub. The entire region’s infrastructure is built around these air transport nodes.

He also pointed to Moscow, which operates four major airports: Sheremetyevo (a hub for Aeroflot), Domodedovo (S7 Airlines), Vnukovo (Utair) and Zhukovsky (Red Wings, technically located in the Moscow region). Each serves as a strategic base for a particular airline, optimizing efficiency and logistics in Russia’s capital.

The jet fuel problem

Foster of Air Astana identified limited access to jet fuel as the biggest challenge facing Kazakhstan’s aviation industry. Currently, the country produces only TS-1, a Soviet-era grade of aviation kerosene, and lacks the more widely used global standard Jet-A1. Transitioning, at least partially, to Jet-A1 has been necessary for years. But it still hasn’t happened.

President Tokayev has ordered that affordable jet fuel be made available by mid-2025. He acknowledged that kerosene prices at Kazakhstan’s airports are too expensive.

Although the production of Jet-A1 has been under discussion for years, a timeline remains unclear. Experts note that introducing the fuel will require new infrastructure, including dedicated storage tanks, because TS-1 and Jet-A1 cannot be mixed. Smooth logistics and fuel delivery will also depend on upgrades to airport infrastructure.

According to Kekilbayev, jet fuel in Kazakhstan costs about $1,000 per ton, compared to $700 to $800 in Europe. He says this pricing gap is a major deterrent to foreign investment.

«If it costs $1,000 a ton here, how are we supposed to attract anyone?» he said. «Investors won’t commit to the market until conditions are in place that allow them to recoup their investments.»

Complicating the issue, Kazakhstan heavily relies on imported jet fuel, primarily from Russia, increasing its exposure to price volatility and supply chain risks. Infrastructure is not yet in place to support imports from alternative suppliers, such as China or Turkmenistan.

However, Ospanov pushed back on the notion that Kazakhstan’s fuel is too expensive. He explained that only imported fuel comes with a high price tag, while domestic fuel — making up 60% to 70% of the total market — is significantly cheaper.

«Air Astana and SCAT purchase domestic fuel for 300,000 to 350,000 tenge (about $580 to $670),» he said. «You won’t find prices like that at any airport in the world. Plus, they pay almost nothing for storage.»

Ospanov argued that the high price of imported fuel is driven by value-added tax (VAT) and a monopolized supply chain dominated by Russian producers. He added that while imported fuel is technically sold to foreign companies at a zero VAT rate, the refund process can take up to two years.

«Accordingly, traders who import this fuel don’t expect to recover the VAT,» he said. «They write it off immediately and factor it into the fuel cost. On top of that, they add a risk margin, usually around 10% to 20%. As a result, imported fuel ends up being 40% to 50% more expensive than fuel refined in Russia.»

Ospanov explained that Russian suppliers can maintain this pricing power due to their monopoly in the Kazakhstani market. Fuel is not imported from other countries because a 5% import duty, while modest in theory, effectively acts as a trade barrier rather than a fiscal tool.

He emphasized that reducing airfares — a key factor in boosting passenger volumes — will require solving the fuel affordability problem. There are two potential solutions: ensure domestic availability of jet fuel or introduce a 6% preferential VAT rate.

«This isn’t about helping airlines; it’s about helping passengers,» he added. «Airlines will benefit anyway through increased traffic. But competition also needs to grow, and we’re hopeful the acquisition of Qazaq Air by Vietnam’s Sovico Group will help drive that.»

Infrastructure limitations and lack of investment

Experts also cite underdeveloped infrastructure, limited investment and a shortage of qualified personnel as major barriers to hub development.

Kekilbayev noted that Kazakhstan’s two largest airports, Almaty and Astana, are now hemmed in by private developments, leaving little room for expansion. The new terminal in Almaty is already overloaded and struggling to manage growing passenger demand.

Ospanov agreed, stating that airport infrastructure suffers from chronic underinvestment due to poor profitability. He pointed to a significant imbalance between the financial performance of airlines and that of airports.

«All the income and profit go to the airlines. Air Astana, for example, reported an EBITDA of $300 million in 2023. In contrast, the combined EBITDA of all 25 airports in Kazakhstan is less than $100 million,» he said.

Kekilbayev added that the low tariffs for aircraft maintenance further discourage private investment. There is also no clear mechanism to recoup infrastructure investments through tariffs or state-backed compensation programs. Additionally, the sector is experiencing a talent drain, particularly in aviation management, as professionals seek opportunities abroad.

«Unfortunately, we have very few experienced practitioners in aviation leadership,» Kekilbayev said. «The people in charge are smart managers, but many lack specialized training or practical industry experience.»

The cargo opportunity: untapped potential

President Tokayev noted that the global air cargo market is valued at around $140 billion, yet no Kazakhstani airline significantly participates in it.

Kekilbayev argued that Kazakhstan urgently needs a national cargo carrier. Unlike Azerbaijan, where Silk Way Airlines plays a leading regional role, Kazakhstan is still in the planning stages.

Ospanov highlighted the critical difference between passenger and cargo operations: cargo cannot wait.

«Companies like DHL, FedEx and UPS operate with flight schedules precise to within two minutes,» he said. «Kazakhstan’s current infrastructure simply can’t meet those standards.»

He also noted that Karaganda holds strong potential as a future cargo hub due to its central location and available space. However, he cautioned that it must operate without delays to be viable.

«Look at Liege in Belgium or Cologne in Germany. Those are examples of how to do it right,» he said.

Reform is essential for a functional hub

Kekilbayev stressed that Kazakhstan must urgently develop a comprehensive aviation strategy and modernize its airports if it hopes to create a functioning air hub.

«Despite the president’s initiative, there is still no state program specifically focused on air hub development,» he said. «The Ministry of Transport is more concerned with automobile roads and railways.»

He highlighted that Kazakhstan lacks a dedicated civil aviation policy.

«We’re still operating under a general transport strategy that doesn’t address the unique needs of the aviation sector,» Kekilbayev said.

Ospanov echoed the need for structural reform, calling it a prerequisite for real progress.

«Only through reform can we give this industry room to breathe,» he said. «Without that, there’s little chance of building an international hub. Our airports were never designed to be large transit centers. The master plans and development projects must be overhauled from the ground up.»

Ospanov said that a strategic misstep was made in the early stages of Kazakhstan’s aviation sector development. According to the classic model, airports should generate revenue through both aviation services — such as takeoff, landing and aircraft handling — and commercial, non-aviation services, including fuel sales, terminal leasing and catering.

«Due to regulated airport tariffs and unregulated airfare prices, we’ve seen a dramatic income imbalance,» he said. «All the revenue and profits go to the airlines. They’re thriving while airports are struggling to stay afloat. That imbalance has to be fixed. Someone deliberately drove a wedge between airlines and airports, and they began developing separately. That was a strategic mistake.»

Ospanov argued that Kazakhstan should focus on developing just one international air hub, warning that the market cannot sustain more than one. To support hub development, he recommended cutting VAT on aviation and fuel imports, encouraging a competitive fuel market, deregulating airport operations and overhauling the industry’s master plan and development strategy.

«We’re going to have one air hub. You can’t have two at an international level, not in this market,» Ospanov said. «We need to make a firm decision on where it will be based.»

Kekilbayev added that, realistically, Kazakhstan will not see a true international air hub for another five to ten years.

«First, there needs to be a shift in mindset,» he said. «Until that happens, it’s very difficult to even talk about building something of that scale.»

Ministry plans multiple hubs based on six key airports

Despite industry skepticism, Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Transport is moving forward with plans to develop multiple air hubs. The strategy centers around six airports: Astana, Almaty, Aktau, Aktobe, Karaganda and Shymkent.

The cabinet has outlined five primary focus areas for air hub development:

Infrastructure modernization: Runways, logistics terminals and warehouses will be upgraded in partnership with investors. Foreign capital will fund improvements in Astana, Almaty and Aktau, while domestic investors will handle Karaganda and Shymkent. Aktobe is still seeking an investor.

Jet fuel availability: The government is amending fuel supply regulations to expand the list of acceptable fuel types, oils and lubricants. This includes allowing purchases outside the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU) and enabling alternative production standards. In mid-2024, KazMunayGas, the national oil and gas company, announced it was ready to begin producing Jet A-1 fuel. The ASTM D1655 standard, the international benchmark for jet fuels, has already been registered and is being incorporated into legislation. The company also plans to produce sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in partnership with Japan and the U.S.

Creating special economic zones (SEZs): Designed to attract investors, increase traffic and support manufacturing, SEZs are already in place. One has been active at Aktobe Airport since Jan. 8, 2025, while the others are still in development.

Streamlined customs and tax benefits: The government is considering tax incentives and simplifying customs procedures to support air hub growth.

Automation of cargo processing: All airports will be linked to the E-freight digital information system, which reduces bureaucracy and corruption risks, shortens cargo processing time and increases efficiency. The system will be integrated with Kazakhstan’s customs and agriculture management platforms for seamless logistics coordination.

The government is also exploring partnerships with global cargo giants such as Cargolux, Turkish Cargo and China Airlines Cargo. Currently, cargo transit through Kazakhstan accounts for just 2% of volume, but 22% of the total cargo value, a figure the authorities hope to grow.

«These measures will increase cargo volumes at domestic airports and lay the groundwork for developing regional air hubs that offer a full range of services,» the Ministry of Transport stated.

In his September 2024 state-of-the-nation address, President Tokayev reaffirmed the importance of aviation reform, calling the development of air hubs a critical national task. He stressed the need to leave future generations a legacy of efficient highways, railways, seaports, train stations and fully operational air hubs.",https://cdn-kz.kursiv.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/8f51a58af879faf2599d.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 13:56:30.652862

How SAF Credits Help Airlines and Corporates Cut CO2 The aviation industry is aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.","Gevo and Dublin-based Future Energy Global (FEG) have signed a breakthrough offtake agreement that supports airlines and other companies in slashing their carbon footprints. Under this multi-year deal, FEG will buy Scope 1 and Scope 3 carbon abatement credits tied to 10 million gallons per year of Gevo’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) from its upcoming ATJ-60 facility.

This deal also gives FEG the option to expand its SAF purchase volume later. This will help airlines and corporations meet net-zero targets more quickly.

Dr. Patrick R. Gruber, CEO of Gevo said,

“Gevo has always planned to leverage SAF market economics to scale our business, and a Book and Claim market that enables the trading of SAF environmental attributes can accelerate SAF production even faster. Future Energy Global is building just such a market, spanning corporate customers, airlines, and aircraft lessors. Aircraft lessors own about half of all commercial aircraft worldwide, and Book and Claim is a critical enabler to allow them and their airline customers to adopt SAF faster.”

Gevo’s ATJ-60 Plant Set to Take Off with 60M Gallons of Low-Carbon SAF

EIA revealed that at the beginning of 2024, the U.S. SAF production capacity was only around 2,000 b/d.

Now, as per the press release, Gevo’s new ATJ-60 plant in Lake Preston, South Dakota, will produce 60 million gallons of SAF annually, which will significantly suffice the demand.

The cost will be comparable to conventional jet fuel, but the fuel will have much lower emissions. The project received a $1.63 billion conditional loan guarantee from the U.S. Department of Energy, which will help finance the construction of the ATJ-60 plant and speed up operations.

Key highlights of ATJ-60:

Gevo’s proprietary tech and “pay-for-performance” model reward emissions reductions. Through its Verity platform, the company ensures full transparency and accountability across the SAF supply chain. Additionally, the company rewards low-carbon practices while delivering real value to local communities.

Paving the Way for a Low-Carbon Future

Gevo is a pioneer of low-carbon fuels and chemicals from renewable sources. Its advanced technology creates Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), motor fuels, and eco-friendly materials that work with existing engines and infrastructure. It ensures an easy switch from fossil fuels.

Thus, cutting carbon emissions through renewable fuels and chemicals is their top priority. The company operates one of the largest dairy-based renewable natural gas facilities in the U.S. and an ethanol plant equipped with carbon capture technology.

Future Energy Global (FEG) Boosts Europe’s Aviation Decarbonization with SAF Credits

FEG’s business model connects investors, suppliers, and buyers to enhance sustainable aviation fuel production worldwide. By monetizing carbon credits tied to SAF, FEG creates extra revenue streams that boost the scale-up.

Natasha Mann, CEO and Co-Founder of FEG, noted,

“FEG’s collaboration with Gevo strongly enhances the portfolio of Book and Claim solutions we can offer our airlines, our lessors, and our corporate customers. It’s crucial to scale SAF production, and our business model lets us unlock the capital to do so. We’re impressed with Gevo’s pipeline, which combines technology ready for today’s market and additional technologies far along in development that could increase production efficiency and accelerate the trajectory of SAF scaling.”

To accelerate Europe’s aviation decarbonization, FEG supports Electro-based Sustainable Aviation Fuel or E-SAF. It’s a scalable, very low carbon, and drop-in fuel option with greater potential than many bio-based alternatives. On April 10, FEG became one of the first signatories of the Bodø Declaration, uniting airlines, tech firms, airports, and policymakers to push for climate-neutral aviation.

The Declaration urges:

Long-term SAF regulations through 2050 to unlock investments

Market incentives like the EU ETS to encourage fossil fuel shifts

Support for long-term offtake deals between producers and users

A Europe-wide book & claim system to maximize emission cuts

Last month, FEG signed a deal to supply Microsoft with Scope 3 SAF certificates from airline purchases. This is part of Microsoft’s ambition to be net-zero by 2030.

How SAF Credits Help Airlines and Corporates Cut CO2

The aviation industry is aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. SAF is expected to deliver two-thirds of the required emission cuts. This means that SAF production has to increase by 400 times. But SAF is not available everywhere. That’s where FEG comes in.

Through this deal, FEG will distribute SAF-derived Scope 1 credits to airlines unable to access physical SAF at their home airports. Corporates can also purchase Scope 3 credits to offset emissions from employee business travel. This “Book and Claim” approach separates fuel from its carbon savings, lowering logistics costs and unlocking access to global SAF markets.

Scope 1 means direct emissions from airline operations, and Scope 3 is indirect emissions from corporate air travel.

Annual SAF demand range over the main and accelerated cases compared with capacity potential, 2020-2026

This is how FEG amplifies SAF demand by turning carbon credits into revenue. This gives producers like Gevo a steady income and helps buyers attain their climate targets. Though FEG started with aviation, it now offers sustainable fuel credit solutions for land and marine transport as well.",https://carboncredits.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/shutterstock_2409429949.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 12:56:59.415108

Ainda assim, fundos imobiliários agrícolas — conhecidos como Fiagros — seguem confiantes na valorização de longo prazo das terras produtivas como forma de diversificação patrimonial.

Marconi Silva, gestor de operações agro da 051 Capital, responsável pelos fundos FDZA11, FZDB11 e FLEM11, reconhece o cenário adverso no curto prazo, com quedas nas cotações da soja e desafios financeiros enfrentados pelos produtores. Porém, ele sustenta que as bases fundamentais de valorização imobiliária das terras agrícolas permanecem sólidas.

""O mercado físico de commodities sempre foi sujeito a solavancos, mas os fundamentos do investimento imobiliário agrícola são estruturais e permanecem firmes"", diz Silva. ""A demanda mundial crescente por alimentos e biocombustíveis precisa ser suprida em um volume limitado de terra produtiva.""

Fiagro da 051 Capital aposta na valorização das terras

Segundo o gestor, a combinação entre aumento da renda global e mudanças nos padrões de alimentação — que exigem mais grãos na base da cadeia — tende a manter a pressão estrutural sobre a demanda. Ele também menciona fatores como a regulação ambiental da União Europeia, que prevê a adoção obrigatória do Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), como vetores adicionais de demanda por soja e milho.

A estratégia do fundo está centrada na aquisição de fazendas consolidadas com desconto e posterior arrendamento a grandes operadores, com contratos indexados à soja. Embora a receita anual dos fundos dependa das cotações da commodity, o principal retorno — segundo Marconi Silva — vem da valorização imobiliária dos ativos ao longo do tempo.

A valorização vista nos ativos geridos pela 051 é significativa. Entre os casos emblemáticos da carteira, a Fazenda Xingu, principal ativo do FDZA11, foi adquirida em junho de 2022 por R$ 150,7 milhões (incluindo custos transacionais) e, mesmo com a queda das cotações da soja em 2024, foi avaliada em abril deste ano em R$ 276,7 milhões — uma valorização de 84%.

No FZDB11, a Fazenda Tabuleiro I foi comprada por R$ 348,9 milhões em março de 2023 e avaliada em R$ 598 milhões pouco mais de um ano depois, segundo o último relatório gerencial — alta de 71% no período.

""Terra sempre foi um ativo de proteção patrimonial no Brasil e nos Estados Unidos. Quem investe entende que a valorização ocorre em platôs, não de forma linear. Por isso, mesmo com menos liquidez, há grupos querendo aumentar exposição.""

Sunos Asset reforça tese dos Fiagros com safra acima da média

A tese da valorização imobiliária também é defendida por outros players do setor. A Suno Asset, gestora do Fiagro SNFZ11, projeta um aumento relevante na receita de locação da Fazenda Coliseu — seu principal ativo — impulsionado pela produtividade acima da média da safra de soja 2024/25. Segundo João Vitor Franzin, analista da casa, a produção em Mato Grosso superou a média dos últimos cinco anos, o que deve gerar um bônus adicional sobre o valor mínimo previsto em contrato.

""Quanto maior a produtividade da fazenda, maior será o valor que o fundo receberá pela locação. E como a produtividade do Estado superou a marca de 65 sacas por hectare, há uma expectativa de bônus no pagamento"", afirmou Franzin, em live no canal da Suno Asset.

Na visão do analista, o avanço da produtividade e a adesão crescente de investidores à tese de valorização de terras reforçam a atratividade de longo prazo do segmento.

Certifiés depuis 2020, les avions Elixir représentent une flotte de 30 appareils de formation en Europe. Elixir Aircraft a choisi la fiabilité du moteur Rotax afin de répondre immédiatement aux besoins des écoles de pilotage. L’Elixir est un avion de 4e génération, le plus vertueux de sa catégorie, grâce à sa structure composite et sa faible consommation de 12 litres par heure.

Ainsi, Elixir Aircraft poursuit le développement technologique vers la décarbonation selon trois étapes :

La production actuelle d’avions à moteur thermique ultra frugaux, alimentés en carburant sans plomb, réduisant déjà de 70% les émissions de CO2.

Le développement de la turbine TP-R90 et son alimentation en carburant d’aviation durable (CAD ou SAF, Sustainable Aviation Fuel), dont le premier vol est prévu pour 2025. Cette version réduirait les émissions de CO2 de plus de 70%.

À plus long terme, la propulsion hydrogène de cette même turbine. Cette version réduirait les émissions de CO2 de 90%.

Le premier démarrage sur avion va valider la possibilité de certification de la turbine et sa sécurité de fonctionnement conformément aux exigences CS-23. Avec ce programme de recherche et sa recherche d’innovation permanente dans la conception de son avion de 4e génération, Elixir Aircraft se prépare pour l’avenir.

The collaborative industry consortium has applied to the UK Advanced Fuels Fund, for support to accelerate its Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) project.

The GRAMM SAF project will catalyse decarbonisation of the UK aviation industry, while delivering significant economic benefits locally and nationally.

GRAMM’s Sustainable Aviation Fuel cuts carbon emissions fourfold beyond the UK SAF Mandate requirements. That enables the project to deliver 53.5% of the UK’s 2035 SAF target. Apart from its positive environmental impact, GRAMM says it will create 850 jobs in the North West, bringing economic revitalisation to communities that need it most.

Alexander Peschkoff, GRAMM consortium lead, said: “Advanced Fuels Fund support will propel UK sustainable aviation forward.

“Meeting a significant part of the UK aviation sector’s net zero obligations will establish GRAMM as a leading sustainable aviation fuel producer. This project also proves that decarbonisation can tackle climate challenges while driving regional economic growth.”

GRAMM’s vision has attracted strong industry backing, particularly from BioTfueL, a proven end-to-end technology platform developed by global energy leader TotalEnergies, technology licensor Axens, and industrial solutions provider, Thyssenkrupp.

The proposed location for the project is the Royal Port of Barrow, for which Associated British Ports (ABP) announced an ambitious development masterplan to create an advanced engineering cluster.

The port is also home to another GRAMM project partner, Centrica-owned Spirit Energy, which is planning to repurpose the depleted Morecambe Bay Gas Fields in Barrow into the MNZ carbon store.

Regional support for the GRAMM SAF project has been equally robust, with assistance from the North West Net Zero Hub, a regional programme dedicated to promoting investment in energy projects,Net Zero North West (NZNW), an industry-led collaboration driving industrial decarbonisation across the North West, and Enterprising Cumbria, the newly-established body working to boost economic development throughout Cumbria county.

James Johnsonb, head of regional programme, North West Net Zero Hub, said: “GRAMM has assembled a very strong consortium to progress their proposals for a first-of-a-kind large-scale SAF production facility.

“Support from the Aviation Fuel Fund, if approved, would help the project progress. The North West Net Zero Hub has been pleased to support GRAMM.

“We recognise the importance of the national policy framework for sustainable aviation fuel, and if successful, the GRAMM project could be a transformative opportunity for the North West, creating substantial job and supply chain opportunities throughout its delivery phases.”

Jane Gaston, CEO NZNW, said: “As the home to two of the UK’s airports, Net Zero North West recognised in our manifesto the importance of providing a resilient supply of significant volumes of sustainable fuel to support the aviation industry.

“Our own work in developing the North West Industrial Cluster Plan shows that the North West is uniquely placed to deliver transformational projects such as this. It’s, therefore, no surprise that GRAMM have chosen to target delivery of this project in our region.”

She added: “With a combination of expertise driven by our industry and the people who work there, our natural geological assets both on and off shore, and our transportation links, including our ports, this project could further enhance the £30bn pipeline of projects already identified across carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, renewables, nuclear and battery which will not only deliver significant carbon reductions, but, critically, support industry in the North West to continue to make a positive contribution to the UK’s economic growth whilst operating in a more sustainable way.”

The funding from the UK Advanced Fuels Fund, if the application is successful, will enable the GRAMM consortium to move from planning to implementation, making this project a reality.

Ans: Novonesis innovations, particularly in relation to enzymes and yeast, aid in higher ethanol yield for ethanol producers, which, in turn, support the Government of India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP).
On the other, our biofuels solutions enable ethanol plants to produce byproducts which could be monetised to ensure robust profitability.
Que: What has been Novonesis’ approach to working with ethanol producers, OMCs, and technology providers in India?
For the ethanol-to-jet-fuel route to SAF, Novonesis has solutions for increasing ethanol and by-product yields, and for the reduction of carbon intensity of bioethanol.","Que: Can you elaborate on the company’s journey, its global presence and its key contributions to the biofuels industry?

Ans: Novonesis is the result of the successful merger in 2024 between two leading Danish biosolutions leader - Novozymes, and Chr. Hansen. As a company, we prioritise having a global presence with local reach, enabling localised innovation that is suitable for the regions we operate in. We have close to 40 R&D and application centers around the world and over 20 manufacturing sites.

Novonesis’ pioneering research in biofuels is turning the promise of agricultural feedstocks including grains and biomass into tangible clean energy solutions. Our integrated solutions enable bioenergy producers to access the latest innovations and thereby be competitive, efficient, and above all, sustainable. Our biosolutions (enzymes and yeast) have helped the ethanol industry increase yield by over 3 percent all over the world in the recent past. These gains are accompanied by superior plant efficiency and lower energy consumption. Globally, our biosolutions have supported the reduction of >60 million tons of CO2 emissions annually. Through collaboration, we are nurturing an ecosystem that thrives on innovation and dedication to a greener future.

Our commitment extends beyond research, we continue to work hand-in-hand with technology providers, ethanol producers, and oil marketing companies to strengthen the biofuel ecosystem. Our goal is clear: to contribute significantly to India's energy security and the global pursuit of sustainability by extending our efforts across the farm-to-fuel value chain.

Que: Can you shed light on how Novonesis bioenergy solutions are being implemented in markets like the USA, and Brazil?

Ans: In the US and Brazil, growth has been driven by positive policy support, enhanced industrial capabilities and the use of cutting-edge technologies (including robust digitalization) to boost industrial yield and process efficiency. These markets are evolving towards advanced biorefining models that integrate the conversion process to produce fuel, energy, and chemicals. The success story of the Brazil bioenergy markets is particularly similar to that of India, wherein blending mandates by government have provided a fillip to the growth of the sector.

Within Brazil, Novonesis collaborates with a leading biofuels producer, Raizen, to produce 2G ethanol more efficiently. The partnership works to reduce the production cost, increase capacity and reduce the carbon intensity of biofuels to enable companies and countries to meet their global decarbonisation targets.

A significant way in which both Brazil and the US have been able to leverage bioenergy, is also the way in which they have diversified co-products of biofuels such as Distiller’s Corn Oil (DCO) which has its use cases in home and personal care products, as well as in the production of renewable diesel/biodiesel, and Distillers’ Dried Grain Solubles (DDGS), which is a useful source for animal nutrition. Both DCO and DDGS have been monetised significantly in the US and Brazil. Within India, DCO and high protein DDGS continue to be nascent and niche segments that hold tremendous potential.

Que: India has set ethanol blending targets under the National Policy on Biofuels. How is the company contributing to achieving these goals?

Ans: Novonesis innovations, particularly in relation to enzymes and yeast, aid in higher ethanol yield for ethanol producers, which, in turn, support the Government of India’s Ethanol Blending Programme (EBP). In the context of grain based or 1G biofuels, we provide advanced enzymes and yeast solutions to optimise fermentation processes and enhance the conversion of starch-based grains into ethanol. These solutions are tailored to work across grain feedstocks such as rice, corn, sorghum and biomass feedstocks like rice straws, bagasse and bamboo – equipping ethanol plants with all avenues to produce biofuels basis availability/ accessibility and costs of these feedstocks.

There are two critical factors to solidify the biofuels program – ensuring feedstock availability and optimising producers’ profitability. We are proud to cater to both ends of the spectrum. On one side, Novonesis’ plant health solutions improve crop yield and thereby strengthens availability of feedstocks suited for biofuels production - enabling opportunity to support higher blending rates. On the other, our biofuels solutions enable ethanol plants to produce byproducts which could be monetised to ensure robust profitability. In addition, Novonesis is continuously strengthening its supply operations to cater to the exponential ongoing demand and the elevated projected elevated of Biosolutions – ensuring robust capacity utilisation and reliability of ethanol plants.

Our focus continues to be on further strengthening our first generation (1G) portfolio, while expanding our contributions in 2nd generation (2G) bioethanol production, utilising technological advancements and collaborations that enhance production efficiency.

Biodiesel is another critical biofuel that could be efficiently produced using advanced enzymes, even with alternating feedstocks. This allows for agile, cleaner and sustainable production processes. Our solutions are already being leveraged in producing biodiesel across India. By using innovative enzymes, we can also catalyse the conversion of oils and fats into biodiesel. Our enzymatic process offers a cleaner, more sustainable alternative to traditional chemical methods, thereby also furthering India’s sustainability and net-zero targets.

By driving the adoption of innovative bio-based technologies and fostering collaboration across various sectors, Novonesis is not only aiding in the global battle against climate change but also establishing benchmarks in the bioenergy sector that demonstrate how economic growth, and environmental stewardship can be seamlessly integrated. This approach positions Novonesis as a key player in reshaping energy strategies for a sustainable future, both in India and globally.

Que: What has been Novonesis’ approach to working with ethanol producers, OMCs, and technology providers in India?

Ans: We offer easy and seamless access to Novonesis technologies, supported by robust technical services to ethanol producers, to ensure that producers can maximise their plant’s potential. In our recent collaboration with a leading corn-based ethanol producer in South India (250 KLPD capacity), we were able to enable plant throughput improvements by 20 percent thereby supporting upto 2 percent increased yield in ethanol. The improved throughput and increased yield resulted in savings for the producer of approximately INR 4.5 crore per annum.

We also continuously evolve and fine-tune our portfolio to changing market and customer needs. For instance, with the introduction of corn as a feedstock for ethanol production, Novonesis has introduced an advanced portfolio so that producers get the best output from their investment. In conjunction with technology players, Novonesis has also been able to tailor enzyme blends for second generation (2G) ethanol production using feedstocks such as rice straws, bamboo, amongst others- a classic example of how we innovate and customise for local needs.

Finally, we partner across the value delivery ecosystem to complement each other’s strengths. We understand that our strength is also derived from our ability to partner effectively, and we therefore collaborate with like-minded, highly agile and solution-oriented companies to enable better reach for our most advanced biosolutions.

Que: How does your innovation Innova® Eclipse, enhance fermentation processes and bioethanol yield?

Ans: Our Innova range of yeast solutions are designed to deliver 2 percent+ ethanol yield, relative to standard market products, and offers reduction in glycerol and organic acids. Depending on the process needs, our Innova range could either fast-track fermentation, thereby allowing more ethanol production without adding commensurate fermentation capacities or improve throughput with more complete fermentations.

In essence, our Innova range of products helps ethanol producers improve substrate and carbon conversion efficiency to consistently increase ethanol yields (+1-2 percent with up to 40 percent less glycerol), improve plant throughput and achieve more complete fermentations with industry leading tolerance to fermentation stressors.

Que: Is Novonesis exploring any advancements in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other next-gen biofuels beyond 1G and 2G ethanol?

Ans: Beyond 1G and 2G ethanol, our solutions are well established in biodiesel and renewable diesel production and are being leveraged globally. Biosolutions drive values in today’s biofuels industry but can also be a platform for opening new value streams in SAF, bio-derived chemicals and maritime fuel.

In relation to SAF, there are currently multiple pathways towards the transition to SAF, each of which has increasing relevance for Novonesis technologies. In the context of SAF from vegetable and waste oils (HEFA: currently the most mature technology for SAF at scale), Novonesis provides the biosolution to pretreat Fats, Oils, and Grease (FOGs) with enzymes, preparing them for conversion by chemical catalysis to jet fuel. For the ethanol-to-jet-fuel route to SAF, Novonesis has solutions for increasing ethanol and by-product yields, and for the reduction of carbon intensity of bioethanol. Novonesis is also exploring alternative biological routes to chemical intermediates that may be suitable to produce SAF, and other chemicals needed in refineries and downstream processes.

Pakistan SAF technology developments are positioning the agricultural-rich nation as a potential dark horse in Asia’s race toward aviation decarbonisation. As Asian airlines face mounting pressure to reduce emissions amid global climate imperatives, Pakistan’s unique approach of converting agricultural waste into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could offer a regional model worth examining.

Converting an environmental problem into economic opportunity

The smog that blankets major Pakistani and neighbouring Indian cities each harvest season has become an annual crisis, driven largely by the burning of agricultural residue. The practice, particularly prevalent in Punjab province, releases particulate matter that compromises air quality across borders.

However, this challenge presents a technological opportunity that Pakistan’s emerging SAF sector aims to capitalise on. “Crop residues burned during both winter and summer in Pakistan represent an underutilised resource with immense potential for SAF production,” noted experts in an April 2025 report by The Express Tribune, highlighting a practical technological solution to an entrenched environmental issue.

The technology equation

Pakistan SAF technology implementation focuses on two principal conversion methods, each suited to different agricultural inputs:

Hydroprocessing Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA): For lipid-based feedstocks including used cooking oil and non-edible oils

Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ): Optimised for converting sugar-based inputs like wheat straw and rice husks

The technologies produce aviation fuels chemically identical to conventional jet fuel, requiring no aircraft modifications, and deliver substantially improved carbon profiles. A third technology using carbon dioxide capture remains in development but holds promise for further emissions reductions. Dr Adeel Ghayur, described by The Express Tribune as an “eminent energy scientist and expert in circular economy,” indicated that commercial SAF technologies can scale from 100,000 to one million tonnes of annual production capacity, with corresponding economic impacts.

Asia’s first private SAF project

The December 2024 announcement of a $121 million SAF facility in Sheikhupura represented a milestone not just for Pakistan but for all of Asia. According to Pakistan Today, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has committed $86.2 million to the project, with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) providing $35 million. What makes this development particularly noteworthy in the Asian context is its designation by the ADB as “the first private sector-led SAF project in Asia and the Pacific,” excluding China.

For a region where state involvement typically dominates energy infrastructure, this private-sector approach merits attention from investors and policymakers across Asia. The facility is operated by SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited and owned by Taimur Shaikh and Ali Shaikh, and presents compelling environmental and economic metrics: projected annual production of 200,000 tonnes of SAF, reduction of 500,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide yearly, creation of 300 direct jobs, and facilitation of approximately 20,000 indirect employment opportunities in the supply chain and tertiary industries.

The regional competitiveness question

While Pakistan’s SAF ambitions are technologically sound, important questions remain about its competitiveness in an Asian market where Singapore, Japan, and South Korea have already established advanced biofuel capabilities.

The price difference remains substantial, with SAF currently commanding approximately $2,500 per metric tonne versus $700 for conventional jet fuel. For price-sensitive Asian carriers navigating post-pandemic recovery, this cost gap presents significant challenges to adoption.

Dr. Ghayur said in The Express Tribune that “strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia.” The acknowledgement reflects awareness of the technological race underway in the region.

For Asian nations with similar agricultural profiles – Bangladesh, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia – Pakistan’s SAF initiative offers a potential template for converting agricultural waste into aviation biofuels and addresses seasonal air pollution events. The multiplicative benefits – enhanced energy security, emissions reductions, rural economic opportunities, and foreign direct investment – align with development priorities across South and Southeast Asia.

Four-dimensional solution

Pakistan SAF technology implementation addresses four interconnected challenges that resonate in developing Asian economies:

Energy security: Reducing petroleum import dependence via domestic production

Economic development: Creating value-added manufacturing with substantial job creation potential

Foreign direct investment: Attracting capital for industrial-scale bioprocessing operations

Environmental mitigation: Addressing agricultural burning emissions and aviation carbon footprints

Critical path forward

For Pakistan’s SAF sector to achieve its potential, several hurdles will need to be surmounted. First, continued investment beyond the initial Sheikhupura facility will be necessary to achieve meaningful scale. Second, as SAF technologies evolve, Pakistan will need to maintain technological competitiveness through sustained R&D investment. Finally, efficiency improvements in agricultural waste collection and transportation will be essential to maintain favourable economics.

The byproduct potential enhances the business case further, with SAFCO’s facility projected to produce 18,000 tonnes of bionaphtha annually for sustainable plastics production, according to Pakistan Today.

As Dr Ghayur concluded in The Express Tribune, “The comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.”

While significant challenges remain in scaling production, optimising costs, and matching competitive alternatives, Pakistan’s SAF technology trajectory represents a distinctive approach to circular economy implementation with potential regional application across all of Asia’s agricultural economies.",https://techwireasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dreamy-robin-6QpvHGaXFhg-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 13:56:46.926243

As the morning sun rises over Punjab’s golden fields, farmers continue a generations-old practice: burning vast swathes of crop stubble to prepare for the next planting season. The flames, while clearing fields efficiently, send plumes of smoke into the sky, adding to Pakistan’s challenges around its air quality. But what if these agricultural leftovers – “waste” products – could instead power the jets crossing the country’s skies?

Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel production from crop waste isn’t just an environmental daydream. According to economic and energy experts, alongside ecological activists, it represents a tangible pathway for Pakistan to transform its vast agricultural abundance into a position of leadership in the rapidly expanding sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) market.

The untapped potential of agricultural waste

Every year, millions of tonnes of crop residue are burned in Pakistan’s agricultural regions, particularly in Punjab. The practice, primarily employed to clear fields for the next planting season, creates significant air pollution and wastes valuable biomass resources.

According to experts quoted byThe Express Tribune, these residues – including rice husks, wheat straw, and bagasse – represent an underutilised resource with “immense potential for SAF production.”

A four-pronged solution

The development of Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel infrastructure offers a unique approach to address four important national challenges simultaneously:

Enhanced energy security: By producing aviation fuel domestically from agricultural waste, Pakistan could reduce its dependence on imported petroleum products.

Large-scale economic activity: Commercial SAF facilities can generate thousands of direct and indirect jobs. Dr Adeel Ghayur, an “eminent energy scientist and expert in circular economy,” explained that larger refineries “require multi billion-dollar investments but have the potential to generate thousands of […] jobs, boosting economic activity in their regions.”

Foreign direct investment: The growing global demand for SAF presents significant investment opportunities. According to Pakistan Today’s December 2024 report, the recent $121 million financing deal for Pakistan’s first SAF facility in Sheikhupura – supported by the Asian Development Bank ($86.2 million) and the International Finance Corporation ($35 million) – demonstrates viability.

Environmental benefits: Converting crop waste to SAF addresses two environmental problems simultaneously: reducing air pollution from crop burning and decreasing aviation carbon emissions. The aviation industry and the scientific community consider that SAF can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 94% compared to conventional jet fuel.

The technology behind SAF

Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel production relies primarily on two key technologies:

Hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA): Used for lipid-based feedstocks like used cooking oil, animal fats, and non-edible vegetable oils.

Alcohol-to-jet (ATJ): Best suited for sugar-based feedstocks like wheat straw, rice husks, and bagasse waste.

The technologies produce “drop-in” fuels that are fully-compatible with existing jet engines and aviation infrastructure. A third emerging technology that utilises carbon dioxide as feedstock shows promise but is not yet commercially available.

Economic viability and market potential for Pakistan’s sustainable aviation fuel sector

While SAF currently commands a premium price – approximately $2,500 per metric tonne compared to $700 for conventional aviation fuel – regulatory frameworks globally are increasingly mandating its use.

Dr Ghayur told the Express Tribune that commercial SAF technologies offer production capacities ranging from 100,000 tonnes to one million tonnes annually.

The SAFCO Venture Holdings Limited facility in Sheikhupura is expected to produce 200,000 tons of SAF annually, according to Pakistan Today, and demonstrates the scalability of such projects.

The facility is projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 500,000 tonnes each year and create approximately 300 direct jobs and an estimated 20,000 indirect jobs in the waste-to-fuel value chain, as detailed in the same report.

The path forward: A strategic approach

For Pakistan to capitalise fully on its sustainable aviation fuel potential, experts recommend a comprehensive strategy focused on:

Attract foreign investment: Building on the success of projects like the Sheikhupura facility to bring in additional capital and expertise.

Knowledge and infrastructure development: Equipping local industries with the necessary capabilities to participate in SAF production and distribution.

Indigenous R&D capabilities: In his interview with The Express Tribune, Dr. Ghayur emphasised that “strengthening R&D is essential for Pakistan to remain competitive in the global SAF market, secure its position as a hub for innovation, and maintain leadership as SAF adoption rises across Asia.”

As global aviation fuel demand exceeds 250 million metric tonnes annually and mandates for SAF usage increase in the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States, Pakistan faces a limited window to establish itself in this growing market.

The successful development of Pakistan’s first SAF facility, described as “the first private sector-led SAF project in Asia and the Pacific” by the ADB, marks a significant first step.The facility will not only produce SAF but also 18,000 tons of bio naphtha annually, a raw material for sustainable plastic production.

Pakistan has rare opportunity to transform an environmental problem – crop waste burning – into a solution that addresses multiple national challenges.

With appropriate investment, policy support, and strategic planning, Pakistan can use its agricultural abundance to become a significant player in the global green aviation transition and create domestic economic growth and better environmental conditions.

As Dr. Ghayur concludes, “The comprehensive policy roadmap will serve as both a blueprint and a catalyst to propel Pakistan to the forefront of the global SAF revolution.”",https://sustainability-news.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/linkan-yadav-B45__9a17ss-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 11:57:21.506898

CO280 is committed to delivering the highest quality, permanent carbon dioxide removal while supporting the economic and environmental health of the communities we serve. We’re incredibly grateful to Microsoft for their collaboration, leadership, and commitment to CDR excellence.”

The agreement is the latest in a series of large-scale carbon removal deals for Microsoft, forming part of the tech giant’s initiative to become carbon negative by 2030, although most of the company’s larger deals to date have focused on nature-based solutions.

The company’s highlighted some of the key benefits to CO280’s approach, including its potential scalability, given the large pool of GHG-emitting mills and CO280’s strategy to standardize project design, business model, and financing, the use by the vast majority of U.S. mills of wood with Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI) certification, the ability of CO280 projects to use excess waste heat and waste biomass to power the carbon capture plants, and the proximity of many U.S. mills to geologic storage sites.

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.","Scientists and aviation leaders including Airbus are studying how to reduce aircraft non-CO₂ emissions. Options include operational contrail avoidance, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) and in the longer term, hydrogen propulsion. What are the most promising projects?

Non-CO₂ warming effects could be as significant as CO₂ in aviation’s total climate impact. However, non-CO₂ emissions aren’t yet regulated in the same way. Scientists and industry leaders including Airbus are studying ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions.

Discussions are heating up over whether and how to regulate non-CO₂ emissions. It is a major aviation policy debate that affects airlines, governments and climate targets, as well as air traffic management due to scheduling and capacity constraints.

What are contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions, and why do they matter?

Burning jet fuel always creates both carbon dioxide (CO₂) and non-CO₂ emissions. In certain conditions, water vapour and some non-CO₂ emissions such as soot or other particulate matters combine to form condensation trails. Commonly known as contrails, these are the white streaks visible behind aircraft at altitude.

On average, contrails heat the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. However, some contrails can have a cooling effect, depending on when and where they form and how long they last. It’s thought that a relatively small number of flights create the majority of warming contrails.

The overall climate impact of non-CO₂ emissions is complex and hard to measure. Scientists are still working to fully understand their long-term effects.

What is the aviation industry doing about contrails and other non-CO₂ emissions?

There are three principal ways to mitigate and reduce non-CO₂ emissions. They are using different fuel types (SAF, hydrogen), propulsion technologies and operational mitigation. The latter involves modifying flight paths in real time to avoid areas where warming contrails are most likely to form.

Airbus is working with scientists, policymakers and the wider aviation industry on some 20 projects linked to these mitigation concepts. Some are funded externally while others are funded internally or with specific partners willing to share the cost of the project with Airbus.

The projects fall into three broad categories:

Studying contrails and testing fuel alternatives, including sustainable aviation fuels and hydrogen. Projects include PACIFIC and CRYSTAL, which were announced at the Airbus Summit 2025. Both continue Airbus’ research into fuel compositions using A350 and A220 aircraft.

Operational avoidance: Exploring optimisation of flight paths to minimise persistent contrails. Live projects include CICONIA, which focuses on forecasting contrail-prone weather, climate impact modelling, and on defining the best concept of operations. CICONIA's early results indicate that, assuming appropriate procedures are put in place, operational mitigation could be applied to many flights, thus effectively reducing their contrails impact, and without significant air traffic disturbance.

New technologies: Investing in hydrogen-powered flight and innovative propulsion systems. Live projects include Blue Condor, whose flight test results are due in late 2025. Blue Condor is a joint project between Airbus and the German Aerospace Centre DLR. Of the seven test flights, four resulted in the formation of contrails from the hydrogen engine. The aim of the investigations was to compare their microphysical properties with those of conventional contrails.

Promising technologies including humidity sensors could help aircraft to avoid weather conditions favourable to contrail formation. Humidity sensors feed weather forecasting models, so flights can benefit from improved forecasts of conditions favourable to contrail formation. Yet like climate impact models, they are in their infancy.

Nonetheless, the projects and collaborations led by Airbus and its partners are helping to accelerate the development of mitigation strategies for non-CO2 emissions and subsequent integration into flight operations.",https://www.airbus.com/sites/g/files/jlcbta136/files/styles/airbus_608x608/public/2025-04/contrails_a350.png?itok=GT4OaLsS,N,,2025-04-14 11:57:42.000614

At the Malaysian campus of China’s Xiamen University, located in Kuala Lumpur, researchers are pioneering cutting-edge uses for waste biomass generated by two of Malaysia’s most iconic crops: durian and palm oil. The initiative is a key component of the Malaysia-China comprehensive strategic partnership, designed to deepen scientific and academic collaboration.

In one standout project, discarded durian husks—often treated as waste—are being transformed into a material stronger than steel. By grinding the husks into a fine powder and processing it through multiple stages, the research team produces an ultra-light nanocellulose with exceptional strength and sustainability.

“This nano material is not only sustainable, but it’s significantly stronger than many conventional materials in the market,” said Dr. Tan Khang Wei, Associate Professor at Xiamen University Malaysia. “It’s also much lighter—even lighter than aluminum composites, by half.”

Potential applications for this nanomaterial span aerospace, automotive, and robotics, promising new pathways for lightweight, high-performance components. The project is supported by Chinese investment, with a Chinese company set to commercialize the product.

“They see that maybe they can do something greener and more sustainable using Malaysia’s biomass resources,” Dr. Tan added.

Meanwhile, a second team is focusing on upcycling palm oil biodiesel byproducts. In partnership with colleagues from Xiamen University’s main campus in China, researchers are converting crude glycerol—a common waste product—into 1,3-propanediol through microbial fermentation.

However, according to Achampong, the conversation around fuel procurement has shifted dramatically to prioritise availability and sustainability.
“Fuel is at the top, and you have to ensure your fuel procurement is much more resilient against several factors,” he says.
“You need to consider sustainable aviation fuel, even though it’s in shorter supply,” Achampong says, emphasising the advantage held by supply chain leaders who reliably source these scarce resources.
From price obsession to supply security Before COVID-19, aviation procurement was largely driven by cost savings.","Resilience takes centre stage

Achampong emphasises that the era of viewing procurement merely as a transactional function—focused primarily on cost—is definitively over. “The push for procurement leaders right now is to make sure they’re able to instil a bit of resilience in the organisation,” says Achampong. “Procurement supply chain leaders need to make organisations more resilient to withstand disruptions.”

According to Achampong, the pandemic sharply exposed the aviation industry’s vulnerabilities because it wasn’t limited to geographic disruptions. Instead, the crisis reshaped the procurement landscape entirely. “COVID was a universal disruption, which meant it didn’t matter whether you focused your supply chain in China or not; the whole world was disrupted, so you couldn’t have really mitigated it,” he explains.

Yet, the subsequent crises highlighted the need to protect aviation organisations against repeated disruptions even more clearly. Achampong adds, “After COVID, you had the Suez crisis and the Ukraine war. Everyone realised that you won’t avoid disruptions if they happen. You must ensure your organisation is as cushioned as possible.”

Today, procurement departments are evaluated not merely by their cost efficiencies but by how quickly and effectively they can respond to unexpected disruptions. Achampong points out that the real test of resilience is recovery time, stating, “The key is that well-prepared organisations don’t necessarily get affected by unforeseen events as materially as others, and are able to recover the quickest.”

This strategic shift toward resilience in aviation is particularly critical because the consequences of procurement failures are immediate and severe. Achampong illustrates this vividly, “Every category of spending can ground an aircraft. If you have a catering shock on a long-haul flight, you won’t take off because you can’t.”

Fuel procurement becomes a balancing act

Among all procurement challenges faced by aviation leaders, none is more critical—or complex—than fuel. Traditionally fuel has been viewed primarily through the lens of cost control. However, according to Achampong, the conversation around fuel procurement has shifted dramatically to prioritise availability and sustainability.

As Achampong explains, fuel remains aviation’s largest expenditure and places enormous pressure on procurement departments to safeguard supply. “Fuel is at the top, and you have to ensure your fuel procurement is much more resilient against several factors,” he says. “One of them is price, but the other one is availability, and then sustainability.”

Today, the aviation industry is increasingly driven by commitments to sustainability, bringing Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) into sharper focus. However, securing supplies of SAF remains a significant procurement hurdle. “You need to consider sustainable aviation fuel, even though it’s in shorter supply,” Achampong says, emphasising the advantage held by supply chain leaders who reliably source these scarce resources. “The smarter supply chain directors are the ones who are able to secure a regular supply of some sort of sustainable aviation fuel so they can demonstrate sustainable intentions.”

Yet, Achampong highlights that the challenge of fuel procurement goes beyond sustainability alone. Price shocks remain an ever-present threat, and managing this volatility is crucial for airlines’ survival. “You’ll always have an element of supply. But how will you control the costs?” Achampong asks, underscoring that “a huge part of resilience is how resilient you are to price shocks because they have a material effect on your organisation.”

The pandemic and subsequent disruptions intensified the scrutiny placed on fuel procurement, forcing airlines to rethink their strategies entirely. The most successful procurement leaders are those who can secure consistent and sustainable fuel supplies and anticipate and adapt rapidly to market fluctuations. Achampong argues this agility is a defining factor for competitive advantage in today’s aviation landscape.

From price obsession to supply security

Before COVID-19, aviation procurement was largely driven by cost savings. Yet the pandemic dramatically reshaped priorities, triggering an urgent shift from cost reduction to securing stable supply chains. Achampong emphasises how drastically these conversations have changed.

“Speaking to chief procurement officers and airline supply chain directors there’s a marked change in the conversation,” Achampong says. “People are not talking about pricing anymore. All they care about is supply.”

As suppliers faced new pressures and disruptions, procurement leaders quickly discovered that low prices were irrelevant if critical components weren’t available. Achampong describes this new reality, “In some cases, the supply isn’t there, so it’s about who’s able to get guarantees for that supply. Regular supply became key. Price hasn’t gone out the window, but the consideration is, ‘Well, it doesn’t matter how much it costs—can we actually get it?’”

The lesson from recent disruptions, Achampong argues, reinforced the necessity of strong, strategic supplier relationships. Organisations that had prioritised these connections emerged stronger and recovered faster. He highlights a striking statistic from recent surveys by CIPS, “During COVID, around 60% of organisations did not know their goods would be supplied late until they arrived late. There’s only one reason for that—they didn’t have strategic relationships with their strategic suppliers.”

Achampong draws an instructive historical parallel to illustrate the importance of these relationships. Recalling the competitive edge held by Japanese automakers decades ago, he explains, “The interesting thing was just one simple insight: the Japanese companies treated their suppliers as partners. That’s where the whole concept of Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) came from.”

He firmly believes that adopting a partnership-oriented approach, as opposed to adversarial interactions dominated by price negotiations, provides lasting benefits. “Rather than having a standoffish relationship with your supplier—having a contract and beating them up about price—you put in place measures to ensure you have a strategic relationship,” Achampong says.

But how can aviation companies practically implement SRM? Achampong outlines clear steps, “First, ensure you have lines of communication at different levels—managerial level, senior management level, and board level—between the two organisations. Then, have regular meetings and align on strategy, branding, and innovation. Organisations must work in tandem rather than apart.”

This alignment not only prepares companies to withstand disruptions but also fosters collaborative innovation and mutual growth. Achampong notes that when crises strike, “You’re helping each other. It’s not a standoff. During something like a pandemic, everyone’s losing money, so instead of sending your suppliers letters demanding discounts, you sit down together and ask, ‘How can we to get through this together?’”

When asked if aviation in the Middle East excels in this area, Achampong offers measured optimism, especially in critical sectors, “In certain sectors, such as fuel, the strategic relationships are practically there. Whether individual airlines have perfected this approach across the board is less clear, but the principles are the same.”

Core procurement principles reaffirmed

Amid the unprecedented disruptions of recent years, aviation procurement strategies might appear dramatically transformed. Yet, according to Achampong the fundamentals of effective procurement haven’t changed—instead, their value has been powerfully reaffirmed.

“Procurement has always been surrounded by supplier relationship management, contract management, and category management. These aren’t just technical terms—they’re critical,” he emphasises. Achampong notes that companies hit hardest by COVID-19 often neglected these basics, particularly the critical principle of maintaining strategic supplier relationships.

Achampong also addresses misconceptions around procurement philosophies such as ‘just-in-time’ (JIT). Despite common belief, he clarifies that JIT was never meant as a universal approach. “No one ever advocated ‘just-in-time’ as a broad-brush statement—certainly not us,” he explains. “It’s a concept that’s relevant when it’s relevant. If you’re securing medical supplies, you wouldn’t apply a just-in-time philosophy. It simply doesn’t make sense.”

The pandemic revealed that organisations adhering closely to foundational procurement principles—like diversifying their supply chains and proactively managing risk— were best prepared to absorb and swiftly recover from disruptions. As Achampong emphasises, “Risk management or risk mitigation is a key part of your procurement strategy. Having that in place would have allowed you to emerge from COVID much quicker than others.”

Tech and AI’s role in procurement

While AI-driven solutions hold promise, Achampong notes that the industry has yet to witness a fully end-to-end automated procurement system that delivers.

Nonetheless, Achampong acknowledges substantial progress in specialised AI applications, particularly in areas such as category management and supplier analysis. “There are some excellent AI tools capable of selecting suppliers from myriad places or analysing large chunks of data to achieve the right commercial outcome,” he says.

He also highlights blockchain technology’s increasing importance, especially within aviation’s highly sensitive supply chains. “Blockchain technology helps traceability of all sorts of goods,” Achampong points out, citing aviation’s intricate catering supply chain as a key example. “For example, airlines like catering firms who own farms in Australia where cattle are raised specifically for first-class catering. Digital tools enhance traceability and efficiency, which is critical in maintaining quality and compliance.”

Yet Achampong is clear that real innovation typically occurs within the supplier base itself, emphasising the importance of robust partnerships. “Largely, technology sits with the partners rather than the airlines or OEMs,” he observes. “If your relationships are strong, you encourage your partners to develop solutions—including technological ones—that overcome problems or make your processes more efficient.”

Bridging the talent gap

As aviation procurement races toward resilience, strategic relationships, and digital innovation, one challenge remains: talent.

“The talent gap in procurement and supply chain is huge,” says Achampong. “There’s a huge demand for procurement and supply chain personnel, but not just anyone—organisations are looking specifically for professionals who have experience, qualifications, or ideally both.”

Achampong highlights a striking reality revealed through CIPS’ annual salary surveys: qualified procurement professionals consistently command a premium in the job market. “There’s about a 30% salary differential between people doing the same roles who are qualified procurement professionals and those who aren’t,” he notes. “Companies recognise the significant impact a procurement professional can have.”

To address this talent gap, CIPS has actively collaborated with regional airlines to nurture and expand procurement expertise. Achampong shares successful examples, such as the partnership with Emirates Flight Catering, “Kieran Dowd, who runs procurement at Emirates Flight Catering, is very invested in developing his people’s capability to ensure they add value strategically, not just transactionally.”

Similarly, Achampong references Etihad Airways’ pioneering approach by describing how the airline group created the region’s first dedicated procurement academy, “Etihad had the first academy covering all Etihad Airways-affiliated companies. Procurement personnel from all their airlines came to Abu Dhabi to go through this academy.”

These dedicated academies and training initiatives play a crucial role in closing the skills gap. “We’ve probably got about 25 study centres across the region,” Achampong says. “Our mission is simple: we aim to build the procurement and supply chain talent pool. We do this by licensing centres to teach our globally recognised curriculum and by working closely with corporate organisations.”

Procurement priorities in aviation

Looking ahead, procurement leaders in aviation face a landscape shaped by volatility, uncertainty, and the relentless pursuit of efficiency. Ultimately, procurement’s future success lies not in reactive crisis management but in proactive foresight. “The procurement leaders you don’t hear about are the most effective,” Achampong concludes. “They are quietly mitigating risks, managing costs, and positioning their organisations to thrive no matter what comes next.”",https://www.aviationbusinessme.com/cloud/2025/04/14/Untitled-1200-x-900-px-2025-04-14T150854.784.png,N,,2025-04-14 08:56:13.194979

S&P Global Ratings' Christa Clapp and Alexandra Dimitrijevic explain how investors can get a consistent picture

Environmental Finance: What impact do you see geopolitical headwinds having on companies' progress towards climate transition and resilience?

Alexandra Dimitrijevic: The CERAWeek conference in Houston in March is always a good place to take the temperature of the energy markets, and one of the key phrases we heard there was 'climate pragmatism'. Since the Glasgow COP in 2021 and the invasion of Ukraine a few months later, global priorities around energy have shifted from decarbonisation towards security and affordability.

There is also a link here to artificial intelligence. AI is not only critical in terms of technological competition, it is also critical for security. It also brings additional demand for energy to power data centres. Meanwhile, there is enormous need in emerging markets for more energy, and for that energy to be affordable.

This focus on the need for secure, additional and affordable energy means the energy transition is going to take longer. But it is also important to note that climate change isn't going away. Companies recognise this, and are placing an increased focus on adaptation and resilience in the face of growing physical risks.

EF: Transition financing has, thus far, lagged behind other parts of the sustainable debt market. Why do you think that has been the case?

Christa Clapp: The challenge is that there are very different starting points and paces of transition in different parts of the world, depending on natural resources, politics and how they prioritise the trilemma of security, affordability and decarbonisation. That means that investors do not have an agreed definition of a credible transition. That has made it difficult for companies and governments to raise transition finance.

In response, we have developed a Climate Transition Assessment (CTA) that applies our Shades of Green approach to offer a globally consistent picture. Our scale runs from dark green, for activities aligned with net zero by the middle of the century, down to red, for activities that are inconsistent with or likely to impede the net-zero transition, such as direct fossil fuel investment.

The Shades of Green scale also addresses regional differentiation. For example, we assessed Rwanda's Sustainable Finance Framework last year. We shaded its financing for the use of liquified petroleum gas for cooking as light green. In other regions, we wouldn't have judged the use of fossil fuel for cooking as light green but, in Rwanda, it delivers carbon reductions compared with the current practice of using wood, as well as significant improvements in indoor air quality. The Shades of Green scale thus allows global comparisons of regionally specific progress towards transition.

EF: How does your Climate Transition Assessment address issues with credibility and transparency?

CC: A lot of companies have long-term net-zero targets, but investors find it difficult to understand how credible those targets are. In addition to companies' long-term targets, the CTA focuses on the specific near-term actions, over the next five to 10 years, that companies are taking to put themselves on a pathway to meet their ambitions. What policies are they implementing? How are they engaging with their supply chains? Are they relying on developments, such as in sustainable aviation fuel, that might not deliver at the scale necessary?

We then apply our shading to look at companies' existing revenues and business models – it might be a carbon-intensive firm shaded yellow or orange, for example.

We examine their near-term actions and investment plans to project that shading forward to the future, to consider whether they are credibly moving to greener business models. Again, that provides a globally consistent assessment of a company's planned transition.

EF: How are market participants applying the CTA?

CC: Every investor has its own mandate, risk tolerance and approach to managing sustainability in its portfolio. When an investor is looking at the early stages of the transition of heavy emitting industries, for example, it might be comfortable holding yellow or orange companies, whereas another might be focused on the greener part of the spectrum: the CTA provides them with the transparency and lets them decide how to apply it.

We're also seeing some companies use the CTA in their annual reports, to publicly share our assessment of the progress of their transition, while we are seeing lenders use the CTA as an element in their lending assessments.

The CTA is also being used in green equity designation programmes at three exchanges – NASDAQ, B3 in Brazil and SIX Swiss Exchange. These programmes identify listed companies that meet green criteria, largely based on the World Federation of Exchanges' Green Equity Principles, but with local specificities. If one of their listed companies is interested in having a green label, we apply our shading to their revenues and investment plans, and provide a CTA report – and, if it meets the requirements, the exchange can give it greater visibility.

It's an interesting space to watch. It's a pretty nascent market, but I can see parallels with how the green bond market started, in that it provided a very visible way of identifying a green company. It began slowly but soon snowballed. We're very interested in contributing to transparency in this emerging area.

Muss sie auch sein, denn genau das ist ihr Job: Dafür zu sorgen, dass auf die Minute genau der Flieger abhebt, mit einem Service, der nichts zu wünschen übrig lässt. Und zwar dorthin, wohin es der Kunde wünscht - und sei es bis ans Ende der Welt. Seit zehn Jahren organisiert die Geschäftsfrau aus Bergisch-Gladbach mit ihrem Luftfahrtexperten-Team von ""PAS- flights"" maßgeschneiderte Flüge. Und das 24/7.

Flugzeuge im Bauch

Flugzeuge im Bauch hatte Birte Kipke schon seit ihrer Kindheit. Dass sie sich einmal beruflich in die Welt des Fliegens begeben würde, das stand für sie schon lange fest. Die Leidenschaft dafür lag eindeutig in der Familie, genauer gesagt beim Vater. Denn wenn er nach Hause kam, hatte der Hobbypilot und Geschäftsführer großer Fluggesellschaften immer die große, weite Welt im Gepäck. Heute ist Birte Kipke (53) Geschäftsführerin der ""PAS-Professional Aviation Solutions GmbH"". Das Unternehmen ist 9001-ISO-zertifiziert und neben Deutschland weltweit mit Standorten u.a. in Italien, der Schweiz, Portugal, der Türkei, Malta sowie Singapur vertreten.

Emanzipation

Mehr als zehn Jahre ist es her, dass Birte sich vom mächtigen Broker-Übervater in London gelöst hatte, um schließlich nach einer kurzen Auszeit als Mitgesellschafterin und Geschäftsführerin von ""PASflights"" einzusteigen. Doch wofür steht das Unternehmen? ""Dafür, dasss wir den perfekten Flug organisieren"", antwortet die Geschäftsfrau prompt. Und perfekt ist für sie all das, was maßgeschneidert und mit der notwendigen Sicherheit und Transparenz auf die persönlichen Kundenwünsche abgestimmt ist.

Das gewisse Etwas

Sie möchten ihre Mitarbeiter mit einem extravaganten Flug belohnen? Oder Sie sind selbst der Star mit einem eng getakteten Eventkalender? Vielleicht brauchen Sie als Erstligist die nötige Ruhe und Konzentration zur Vorbereitung aufs nächste Spiel? Manchmal auch müssen Menschen aus Erdbebengebieten geborgen, Geflüchtete in Sicherheit gebracht werden…? Ist das der Fall, kommen Charterflüge ins Spiel. Und die organisiert ""PASflights"" ganz nach Bedarf.

Gut gemacht ...

Schulterklopfen, lobende Worte und als Prämie einen Charterflug. Viele Firmen, darunter große Banken und Versicherungen, greifen zur Belohnung gerne auch mal tief in die Tasche, um besonders erfolgreiche Mitarbeiter zu belohnen. Ein Charterflug ist dann genau das richtige. ""Incentives zeigen die Wertschätzung für den Mitarbeiter"", weiß Kipke aus Erfahrung. ""Das kommt immer sehr gut an."" Das Erlebnis beginnt bereits am Flughafen. ""Der erste und der letzte Eindruck, das sind wir"", verweist die Chefin auf die 24/7-Selbstverpflichtung.

Eine gute und ausreichende Betreuung ist ebenso wichtig wie die persönliche Boardansprache, Catering, Boardgetränke in den Farben der Firma oder auch gebrandete Kopfstützen. ""Nur wenn gewünscht"", schränkt Birte Kipke ein. ""Manche mögen's lieber inkognito.""

Ben Stiller & Co.

Natürlich - auch dieses Image stimmt: Promis chartern gerne, denn für sie ist Zeit Geld. Lange Wartezeiten, Verspätung oder Flugausfälle können sie sich nicht leisten. Bei eng getakteten Auftritten soll wenigstens die Reise stressfrei sein. Der US-amerikanische Schauspieler und Filmproduzent Ben Stiller, Olympia-Sieger Florian Hambüchen und Eishockey-Legende Felix Schütz wissen es zu schätzen, wenn sie erholt aus dem Flieger ins nächste Abenteuer steigen können. Und nicht nur sie. Für Manager, die morgens zum Meeting nach Mailand müssen und abends zum Event nach Berlin, gibt es nur eine Alternative zu Linienflügen: Sie müssen chartern.

Die andere Seite

Was Chartergesellschaften alles leisten, haben sie in der Coronazeit gezeigt und zeigen sie immer wieder bei Flügen in Katastrophengebiete. Um die Menschen aus dem Erdbebengebiet von Nepal zu holen, hatten die Deutsche Regi rung und SOS International über ""PASflights"" technisch besonders ausgestattete Maschinen mit extra geschulten Piloten gebucht, die unter erschwerten Bedingungen in den engen, von Bergen umgebenen Flughafen von Kathmandu fliegen konnten.

Auch für Flüge in den Sudan, um Flüchtlingsfamilien an Bord zu holen, wird ""PAS- flights"" seit Jahren angefragt. ""Diese Aufträge können nur Fluggesellschaften mit einer Kriegs-Risiko-Versicherung annehmen"", klärt Kipke auf. ""Manche Airlines sind so feinfühlig, dass sie sogar Extras für Babys und Kleinkinder organisieren"", sagt sie anerkennend. Dass ihr Expertenteam auch Linienflüge als Zubringer für Charterflüge organisiert hatte, um Arbeitern in der Coronazeit die Rückkehr von den Ölplattformen nach Hause zu ermöglichen, darauf ist die 53-Jährige besonders stolz. ""In Saudi-Arabien beispielsweise hatten alle Flughäfen geschlossen"", erzählt sie. ""Die Menschen hätten ansonsten ein ganzes Jahr auf den Plattformen verbringen müssen.""

Die Coronazeit war aber auch eine Zeit, in der die Nachfrage nach Privatjets boomte. Denn wer mit seinem Tier zum Ferienhaus oder zum Zweitwohnsitz ins Ausland wollte, hatte keine andere Chance. ""Man braucht schon ein sehr gutes Netzwerk"", sagt sie. Das hat sie - und muss es haben im Hinblick auf die vielfältigen Aufgaben, die ihr Expertenteam zu bewältigen hat.

Nachhaltigkeit ist gefragt

Ein Thema, das ihr besonders am Herzen liegt, ist die Verantwortung, die ein Unternehmen im Hinblick auf Nachhaltigkeit für die nachfolgenden Generationen hat. ""Nachhaltigkeit ist in unserer Unternehmensphilosophie verankert"", erläutert Kipke. ""Neben der Umwelt-Management- Zertifizierung ISO 14001 bieten wir mit ClimatePartner die Möglichkeit, einen CO2- Ausgleich zu leisten. Zusätzlich können Kunden Flüge mit SAF-Betankung buchen. Das ist allerdings nur in ausgewählten Flughäfen möglich.""

This type of synthetic fuel is created using renewable electricity sources such as wind, solar, or hydropower. What sets e-SAF apart is its carbon neutrality—it releases only the amount of carbon that was initially captured during its production, making it a key tool in aviation’s shift away from fossil fuels.

Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President of Public Affairs at SAS, emphasized the importance of collaborative progress, stating, “Moving away from fossil-based fuels isn’t just important—it’s essential. At SAS, we believe real change is possible through cooperation and a shared roadmap for transformation.”

This shared vision was solidified at the international SAF seminar held in Bodø on April 9–10, which culminated in the launch of the Bodø Declaration. The event convened key stakeholders from across the aviation ecosystem—including industry experts, researchers, NGOs, and representatives from the European Commission. It underscored the urgent need for stable regulatory frameworks, secure investment environments, and cross-sector collaboration to achieve a meaningful transition to cleaner aviation fuels.

The Bodø Declaration builds on efforts like Project SkyPower—a joint letter submitted to the European Commission in February 2025. Spearheaded by SAS, the initiative was supported by a broad network of aviation and energy players who recognize the critical role e-SAF will play in decarbonizing air travel. Signatories to the declaration include fuel producers, technology developers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airport operators, policymakers, and academics, all united in their goal of maintaining aviation’s essential societal role while minimizing its environmental impact.

Strategic collaboration lies at the core of SAS’s sustainability strategy. The Bodø Declaration is a clear example of the kind of joint action required to meet rising demand and accelerate the transition to cleaner aviation. This vision was further reinforced in November of the previous year when SAS signed a partnership agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport to promote e-SAF production in Denmark. This collaboration is part of the Fjord PtX project, a national initiative aimed at producing synthetic fuels using renewable energy. The project not only advances Denmark’s leadership in sustainable aviation but also contributes to job creation and the broader decarbonization of the aviation industry.

Fuel costs represent a substantial portion of total operating expenses for cargo carriers, and with rising fuel price volatility, driven by increasing global uncertainty, controlling these costs is becoming more challenging. Jet fuel can rise to as much as 35 percent to 50 percent of an air cargo company’s operating costs. For cargo carriers in a low-margin industry, tackling this issue is key to long-term financial sustainability.

Unique challenges

Unlike passenger airlines, cargo carriers operate under a different set of financial constraints. Because passenger airlines face costs such as cabin crew and frequent flight schedules, fuel represents a smaller proportion of overall expenses – typically, 20 percent – 35 percent of operating costs. In addition, passenger planes usually fly lighter and more frequently, making them more fuel-efficient and allowing them to benefit from economies of scale – advantages that cargo carriers don’t have.

For cargo carriers fuel is therefore, a much greater proportional expense, and managing fuel costs critical for the survival of cargo airlines.

Price volatility

One of the most pressing concerns for cargo airlines is the unpredictable volatility of fuel prices, which is largely driven by: fluctuations in crude oil prices, geopolitical instability, and constraints within the refining market. In recent years, the ongoing Ukraine war, global supply chain disruption, and refining capacity limitations have all contributed to price spikes.

Covid-19, as well as market shifts such as the OPEC price war, have exposed the air cargo sector to even more erratic fuel price movements. Fuel price volatility has become more frequent, complicating financial planning and pricing strategies.

Another challenge the industry faces is compliance with evolving sustainability regulations. Carbon pricing schemes such as the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), add a layer of complexity, and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) mandates, further drive fuel expenses. While SAF holds promise for reducing the carbon footprint of aviation, it comes at a significantly higher cost compared to conventional jet fuel.

Currency fluctuations are another issue for carriers operating in regions with weaker currencies, as jet fuel is quoted in USD. This means that for these carriers, fuel becomes an even larger proportion of total expenses. Without a strategy to manage these rising and volatile fuel expenses, many carriers will struggle to remain competitive, and it may threaten their long-term viability.

Cost strategies

In response to these challenges, cargo carriers turn to a variety of strategies to mitigate the impact of fuel price volatility. One such approach is hedging with derivatives. Hedging can stabilise fuel costs but carries risks if prices move unfavourably. What’s more, derivatives hedging is a complicated task which demands substantial financial expertise.

Improving operational efficiency is another avenue. Cargo carriers are increasingly investing in weight-reduction measures, such as lighter materials and more streamlined aircraft, to lower fuel consumption.

Optimising flight routes to minimise unnecessary fuel burn is a key strategy for managing costs. However, this becomes increasingly challenging in the face of geopolitical disruptions, such as Russia’s ban on Western carriers from its airspace, which force airlines to take longer, less efficient routes.

Additionally, the renewal of fleets with next-generation aircraft designed for better fuel efficiency plays a crucial role in long-term cost savings – but demands significant upfront investment.

Risk management is key

The growing difficultly of managing fuel costs underscores why addressing fuel price risk should be a top priority for cargo airlines.

While fuel efficiency requires investment, risk management offers a more immediate solution. One means of doing this which avoids the downsides of derivatives hedging, is energy price risk insurance, which needs far less upfront investment and protects balance sheets by insuring against swings in the fuel price.

By hedging fuel costs and strategically navigating market risks, cargo carriers can better control the financial impact of fuel price volatility. Ultimately, integrating robust risk management strategies with a focus on fuel efficiency will help cargo airlines weather the storm of rising costs, ensuring their long-term success in a highly competitive industry.

Conclusion

The challenges of rising fuel costs and price volatility are nothing new for the airline cargo industry, but they are becoming increasingly difficult to navigate. As fuel comprises a significant portion of operating expenses, cargo carriers must take proactive steps to mitigate these costs. By combining operational improvements, and fleet renewal, the industry can better cope with financial pressures. However, the critical role of fuel price risk management cannot be overstated – it is the key to safeguarding the financial stability and future viability of cargo carriers.",https://aircargoweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/shutterstock_2351268771-1-1-1080x720.jpg,N,,2025-04-14 08:56:53.103744

New Delhi: Global oil demand is flattening, diesel growth in India is stagnating, and the world is sitting on a 9 million barrels/day surplus—these were some of the key signals from India’s top oil and gas executives at a high-powered panel marking the 24th Foundation Day of Petroleum Planning & Analysis Cell (PPAC).

Speaking at the panel titled ‘Future-Ready Oil & Gas Industry: Challenges & Opportunities on the Road to 2047’, ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Arun Kumar Singh said: “Diesel is virtually stagnant this year. Gasoline saw 4–5 per cent growth, but diesel is less than 1 per cent . Had China not done EV conversion, global demand would have been up by 3 million barrels already.”

He said global oil growth was under 1 million barrels/day last year, with downward corrections each month. “World has 9 million barrels/day of surplus capacity. Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Canada, the US, Brazil—together are sitting on this. It’s a man-made problem of plenty.” Singh added, “The world is walking on multiple legs—demand is shifting. For India, this trajectory will continue, but the rest of the world will behave differently.”

The panel brought together key energy leaders including A.S. Sahney, Chairman of Indian Oil Corporation; Dr. Ranjit Rath, CMD of Oil India Ltd; Harish Mehta, CEO & MD of Jio-bp; and Prasad K Panicker, Chairman of Nayara Energy, moderated by ET Energy World Editor Sudheer Pal Singh.

Indian Oil Chairman A.S. Sahney said energy transition and energy security were not separate agendas. “If the industry moves away from fossil fuels, we are also strengthening energy security,” he said. “Refining capacity of OMCS will increase by over 20 per cent in the next 18 months—from 250 to 300+ MTPA.”

Sahney said Indian Oil has already deployed 10,000 EV charging stations, with the industry total crossing 15,000. “We are putting up India’s largest green hydrogen plant—10,000 tonnes per annum—at Panipat. The bidder will be announced this month,” he said.

On retail, Sahney said, “Today’s customer wants more than fuel—differentiated products, grocery, grooming, servicing, EV charging, multiple payment options—retail outlets are becoming energy and service hubs.”

Oil India CMD Dr. Ranjit Rath said India was opening up 1 million sq. km of previously restricted areas, mainly in deep and ultra-deep waters. “Drilling today targets 7,500 metres in waters up to 3,000 metres deep. These are high-risk, capital-intensive zones,” he said. He added that global collaboration was critical. “We’ve signed an MoU with Petrobras for joint bidding in OALP-10. We are also exploring partnerships in Andaman-Nicobar waters.”

Jio-bp’s Harish Mehta said India, with its $30 trillion economy target by 2047, will drive 75 per cent of incremental global energy demand over the next decade. “Gasoline demand will peak by 2035, diesel by 2041. India has 1 lakh fuel stations—many are unproductive. There is clear space for differentiated networks,” he said.

On EVs, Mehta said, “Renewable energy prices are dropping. Battery tech is evolving. Solid-state batteries and five-minute charging are no longer science fiction.” He added that hydrogen fuel adoption in heavy vehicles is also gaining ground. “ICE-to-hydrogen conversion is already on trial. 25 vehicles in Jamnagar have clocked 3 lakh km.”

Nayara Energy Chairman Panicker emphasised profitability and energy affordability. “Our core business must fund transition. Affordability is critical for India’s economic rise. Without low-cost energy, growth targets will be hit,” he said. On sustainability investments, he said, “The green shift involves heavy costs. These either need government support or other funding structures. Industry cannot pass this on to the consumer.”

He also flagged concerns over the incoming carbon market. “Carbon trading starts soon, but pricing will decide the real impact. Too high a price will hit downstream players.”

ONGC CMD Singh also touched on the role of technology in exploration and production: “In exploration, AI improved one well’s prediction accuracy to 98.9 per cent . Oil recovery is still only 30–35 per cent —technology can double it. We live in a ‘30 per cent world’. Value extraction is inefficient across the chain.”

On the regulatory environment, Singh said: “No country gives the kind of gas price India gives today. For new fields, producers are getting $12 per MMBTU. Globally, producers are capped at $3 in many markets.” He said India now offers one of the most liberal regimes for oil and gas exploration. “The government expects only production. Royalty and tax burdens are minimal in new fields.”

Closing the session, the panel turned to biofuels. Indian Oil’s Sahney said, “India can be among the top three global biofuel producers, along with the US and Brazil. This is one area where we can lead.” He added, “Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is a huge opportunity. India’s aviation fuel demand will grow at 10–12 per cent CAGR. SAF can make India a hub for international airlines.”

The panel concluded with consensus that India’s oil and gas sector must adapt to rapid shifts in fuel mix, technology, and global trends—while ensuring affordability, domestic production, and energy security remain top priorities.

The role of a charter broker has remained largely the same, however, the industry has been faced with different challenges and developments during this time and the role of the broker has grown. The range of clients using charter services is becoming increasingly diverse, with a broader range of people realising its value and efficiency. Increasing levels of regulation being implemented by governments and civil aviation authorities around areas such as border security, trade, safety, the environment and more, have made the air charter broker a hugely valuable asset as they provide the professional expertise and knowledge to guide travel bookers and advise on the most suitable, legal and competitive solutions. The process checks and arrangements that need to be made to coordinate a charter flight have significantly increased in recent years, making the broker a vital part of the process. Working with operators to make all the necessary arrangements, when things go wrong—which they frequently do, including inclement weather, technical failure, government permit issues and busy airport slots, the broker is able to support with solutions to ensure travellers are still able to reach their destination. As a leading industry association, The ACA works to advise member companies when regulatory changes arise, or are planned, and what will be required, which allows our members to effectively support their clients.

What have been the most significant changes in charter customer demographics and demands over the past 15 years?

Although formal figures are difficult to identify simply due to the confidentiality our industry prides itself on, feedback from our members show there have been changes to the demographics. Overall, a trend has been an increasing number of younger travelers utilizing air charter. This is not unexpected as the vast majority of air charter flights are for business travel and the demographics mirror business changes, with technical industries developing younger c-suite executives who are using air charter to support their business travel.

Access is a big driver of this business travel and business aviation serves twice as many city pairs compared with scheduled services – which have not recovered their networks post-pandemic, often meaning air charter is the only solution to fly directly to a specific destination.

How has The ACA’s role in the industry evolved during the last 15 years?

The ACA has transformed in recent years from being a networking organization to becoming the leading global trade body for air charter. We have taken a more proactive role with a focus on growing the Association’s international presence and expanding its contribution to the wider air charter industry. Over the past ten years, membership has grown significantly and as of February 2025, it now has 435 member companies, with 53% of members outside the UK. This was a key part of our strategy, providing a network of accredited professional member companies across the world.

The ACA rebranded in 2019 to reflect the Association’s increasing drive towards being seen as a global entity, capable of delivering value to members in countries around the world. At the point of the rebrand in 2019, The ACA had just 250 members. Following this, we have created member resources on sustainability and international regulations as well as developed professional training qualifications. Last year, we made the first part of this available as an online course available to all members worldwide.

We have seen our role develop in the industry, with an increased focus on supporting and developing the next generation of young professionals and helping them to understand the variety of opportunities and careers available within the air charter sector. The ACA has delivered increasing outreach via engagement with colleges and universities, alongside our internship program which offers both theoretical training and practical work experience, and which we are confident will continue to grow.

With the rise of various booking platforms and apps, how do you see the role of traditional charter brokers evolving?

Technology and booking platforms play an important part in growing the industry and provide a familiar access point for younger generations of travel bookers.

While the development of platforms and apps make the charter process more efficient, technology will never be able to replace the essential human touch that charter brokers bring to arranging aircraft charters. Booking charter flights is a complex travel management function with a large number of moving parts, and technology cannot substitute an individual’s wealth of knowledge and expertise. These are irreplaceable when it comes to assessing the technical requirements with permits, NOTAMS, weather conditions, taxation and complex itineraries, alongside multiple time zones and fine details such as bespoke catering. As legislation has made air charter more complex in recent years, the role of the traditional broker as a professional advisor has never been more valuable.

How is the charter sector addressing sustainability concerns?

Sustainability is a hugely important topic for the industry. The air charter sector has been leading the change and process to sustainable aviation for many years now. The UK DfT Jet Zero Consultation in 2021 confirmed that between 2010 and 2019, the industry achieved a 20% reduction in emissions due to efficiency improvements and is continuing at a 2% reduction per annum. The air charter industry has led technology development to improve sustainability, with the first use of composite materials and winglets to improve fuel efficiency. In November 2023, the first transatlantic flight using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) was operated by Gulfstream.

The Net Zero 2050 targets and SAF mandates which have come into force across many countries, including the UK, continue to be an industry focus. For example, from 2025 the UK government has mandated that 2% of all jet fuel must be sustainably sourced. The emergence of SAF could be an effective means of helping the aviation sector to decarbonise, however, one of the main barriers to achieving this is a lack of reliable supply. To make SAF a viable alternative to traditional jet fuel, significant investment into SAF production and infrastructure is required, in order to create a reliable supply chain that ensures SAF is widely available at all airports. The Powering up Britain: Net Zero Growth Plan published in 2023 highlights the potential for creating 65,000 jobs by the UK SAF industry by 2050, bringing a £1.9 billion direct GVA per annum to the country.

One of the immediate tools the industry has in place to address sustainability concerns is carbon offsetting. The majority of our members have an emissions offsetting scheme, starting with an opt-in policy where clients have the option to pay to offset the CO2e footprint of their journey. Over the past several years, The ACA has been encouraging the concept of opt-out, where offsetting is included as a standard within the charter contract, and it is specifically up to the client to choose to opt out. Some of our members have also gone a step further and offset all charter flights as standard, some even by 200%. Additionally, many charter companies employ full time sustainability officers and are looking to reduce their energy consumption, environmental footprint at their facilities and most importantly, aircraft emissions.

The ACA has taken steps in recent years, through its sustainability and innovation working group to ensure it presents a positive example to the charter industry and is a carbon neutral company. Working with sustainability partner 4AIR, The ACA has been offsetting all events and company operations. We also joined the UK DfT led Jet Zero Council and supported the work done to plan the continued transition of aviation to a zero-emission future.

What changes do you anticipate in charter broker qualifications and standards over the next 15 years?

The ACA is keen to ensure that the already high standards maintained by member companies continue long into the future, which is why the Association felt it was important to launch its accredited Air Charter Broker Qualification, back in 2021. Since then, The ACA has hired a full-time training manager to oversee and deliver this course, all whilst ensuring the Association has greater capacity to expand its training offering. The course is designed to provide individuals with the knowledge they will need to succeed as an air charter broker and ensures that brokers are aware of the industry best practices as set out by The ACA. The training resources delivered within the Air Charter Broker Qualification provide excellent value in supporting members to upskill new staff, as well as allowing more experienced brokers to refresh their knowledge. In 2024, the Association launched the first stage as an online training course to allow global member access to this training, and is working on additional courses this year that will support other types of members.

Over the next 15 years, I think training and best practice will remain a key priority for member companies and the industry. As more and more brokers achieve The ACA qualification, it will grow in recognition, and I expect it to become a requirement for professional development in the industry.

What role do you see The ACA playing in shaping the future of air charter?

The ACA provides an important role in advising and educating the industry. We lead industry self-regulation, promote the best supply chain relationships and our members are accredited as experienced and trustworthy professionals. The ACA is the “go-to” source of industry information, proactively representing our members to government and regulators, providing expert guidance, support and training, and organising unrivalled networking events.

As The ACA’s membership continues to grow internationally, we will be able to employ more resource to expand our reach and influence and deliver even greater value to our members. Currently, we have 435 member companies in over 60 different countries and are growing at between 5 and 8 new member companies every month. This growth will enable us to connect professionals in the industry, support them with training and information, while growing the industry through our continued efforts to encourage young professionals, both in the industry and the next generation, to understand the opportunities and look at a career in air charter, through college and university engagement as well as our internship program.

How have charter industry standards evolved, and what further developments do you anticipate?

The charter industry has very high standards as a whole, due to the highly regulated operational side of aviation. There are many restrictions and rules that must be followed in planning and operating flights. Operators must be commercially licensed, have aircraft insured and with certified maintenance. These requirements are the core structure that underpins the safety of the industry.

There are occasions where individuals and companies break the rules and operate illegal charter flights, a dangerous practice which although rare, continues. We created ‘Fly Legal Day’ every January to focus attention on this and educate travellers of the dangers as well as provide a reporting tool for anyone to report suspicions which we then take to the relevant authorities.

Conclusion: Lifting Off Towards Sustainable Leadership The choices Europe makes today will shape the legacy of its climate ambition.","Introduction: An Opportunity to Soar Higher

Europe finds itself at a remarkable crossroads. With climate policies for aviation poised to transform the sector, there is a genuine opportunity to accelerate towards a future that is cleaner, more resilient, and globally influential. Rather than seeing resistance as a setback, it should be recognised as a sign that real change is happening. By standing firm, Europe can turn ambition into action and strengthen its leadership in sustainable aviation.

Building Momentum: Industry Dialogue Reflects Progress

Calls from parts of the aviation industry to slow down climate measures reflect the magnitude of the transformation underway. The European Union Emissions Trading System and the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandates represent meaningful strides towards decarbonisation. These policies, co-developed with industry, reflect a shared recognition of the need for urgent action.

As voices rise in debate, they highlight that these initiatives are not symbolic gestures but real catalysts for change. Rather than viewing these discussions as obstacles, they can be seen as valuable dialogue that sharpens focus and strengthens resolve.

Strengthening Investor Confidence: A Path to Clean Tech Leadership

Staying the course sends a powerful message to investors and innovators. Confidence in policy frameworks encourages greater investment in the technologies that will define aviation’s future. From advanced e-fuels to cutting-edge electrolyser solutions, Europe has an enviable head start. By maintaining momentum, the region positions itself as a leader in the global race towards clean technology.

Clarity and consistency will attract the capital needed to scale up production, driving job creation and stimulating regional economies while delivering tangible climate benefits.

Unlocking Sustainable Growth: Enhancing Fuel Policies

Extending the EU ETS funding for sustainable aviation fuels beyond its current horizon provides an exciting opportunity to boost certainty and accelerate deployment. By focusing future funding towards advanced e-kerosene and other scalable solutions, Europe can move beyond first-generation biofuels and ensure that sustainable aviation becomes mainstream.

Expanding emissions coverage to include all departing flights from European airports is another positive step. This approach would generate fresh resources for innovation while addressing emissions on key international routes, reinforcing Europe’s role as a climate pioneer.

Learning from Experience: Progress Through Persistence

Europe’s history with climate policy reveals an encouraging trend: persistence pays off. The EU ETS has already achieved a 47 percent reduction in emissions in the sectors it covers since its inception. This progress is a testament to the power of well-designed, forward-thinking policy.

Rather than revisiting past compromises, this is the moment to build on those successes. Europe can confidently lead the way, turning its experience into inspiration for global efforts to decarbonise aviation.

Positive Signals: Empowering Clean Aviation Innovation

By maintaining a strong policy stance, Europe provides clear direction to the market. This certainty inspires companies to invest, innovate, and scale up green technologies. With enhanced penalties for non-compliance and stronger incentives for fuel suppliers, the supply chain can be guided decisively towards sustainable solutions.

The transition is already underway. By embracing it fully, the aviation sector can become a showcase of European innovation and environmental leadership.

Embracing the Future: A Shared Vision for Success

Sustainable aviation is no longer an abstract goal. It is a fast-approaching reality. Strengthening current policies aligns Europe with the vision of cleaner skies, competitive industries, and thriving communities.

Governments across the region have an opportunity to act decisively, helping industry partners not only to comply but to flourish. With proactive support and clear direction, Europe can deliver a future where environmental integrity and economic prosperity go hand in hand.

Conclusion: Lifting Off Towards Sustainable Leadership

The choices Europe makes today will shape the legacy of its climate ambition. By remaining resolute and positive, the European Union has the power to chart a path that benefits future generations while bolstering its position as a global leader in sustainable innovation.

This is more than a policy decision. It is an invitation to build a cleaner, stronger, and more prosperous future together. By embracing the opportunities before us, Europe can rise to meet the moment and inspire the world to follow.",https://vurdhaan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Copy-of-Sustainable-Aviation-Fuel-10-1024x576.png,N,,2025-04-14 09:56:34.982308

Dr. Michael Engel, Geschäftsführer des BDF, erklärt: „Der Koalitionsvertrag von CDU/CSU und SPD markiert eine wichtige Weichenstellung für den Luftverkehrsstandort Deutschland. Die Rücknahme der Luftverkehrsteuererhöhung ist ein erster Schritt in die richtige Richtung und sendet ein wichtiges Signal an die Branche. Doch um wirklich effektive Wachstumsimpulse für die Luftfahrt zu setzen und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit Deutschlands auf europäischer Ebene zu sichern, bedarf es weitergehender Maßnahmen. Nur mit einer spürbaren Reduzierung der staatlichen Standortkosten und einer echten Entlastung der Luftfahrtunternehmen können wir langfristig den Luftverkehr stärken und die Position Deutschlands als attraktives Luftverkehrsdrehkreuz sichern.“

Positiv bewertet der BDF die Ankündigung der neuen Bundesregierung, die wettbewerbsverzerrenden Sonderbelastungen abzubauen. Insbesondere die geplante Abschaffung der über die europarechtlichen Vorgaben hinausgehenden PtL-Quote (Power-to-Liquid) noch im Jahr 2025 sowie das angekündigte Gleichbehandlungsprinzip bei Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) schaffen Planungssicherheit und entlasten deutsche Fluggesellschaften im internationalen Vergleich.

Zudem begrüßt der BDF die angestrebte Modernisierung in der Luftfahrtindustrie und des Luftverkehrs im Sinne der Dekarbonisierung und des fairen Wettbewerbs.

„Diese Maßnahmen weisen in die richtige Richtung“, so Dr. Engel. „Jetzt kommt es darauf an, die angekündigten Vorhaben zügig und ambitioniert umzusetzen. Der Luftverkehr ist Rückgrat der deutschen Exportwirtschaft, fördert den Tourismus und verbindet Menschen weltweit.

The findings of the Project Willow study highlight several options that can drive the development of a new hub for sustainable industries. Split into three areas – waste and recycling projects, bio-feedstock initiatives and renewable energy – this collection of projects are anticipated to create up to 800 skilled jobs, offering potential new avenues for the current workforce, as well as creating additional economic opportunities. A recent appearance at the Scottish Affairs Committee by the report’s authors suggests the preferred priority project is the production of sustainable aviation fuel, with others to follow.

One of the perennial challenges, however, in terms of translating small-scale innovation to manufacturing on a commercial scale must be tackled head-on. At its core, Grangemouth has always been a manufacturing site, rather than a research and development facility, so there will need to be some adaptation to help these ideas come to fruition.

Infrastructure, funding and skills must all be part of the plan, but it could be a valuable opportunity to provide an additional injection of drive into the ecosystem, with innovative biotechnology companies and the Grangemouth manufacturing operations working together to carve out the next chapter and deliver change.

Importantly, the new opportunities for the site should not rely on one single technology, as has been the case with petrochemical refining, but the challenging incorporation of a range of sustainable processes at significant scale. The plans for using bio-feedstocks are particularly exciting. We have existing biotechnology skills and expertise that can play a significant role in the transition, while also being integrated with the renewable energy and recycling projects. Scotland has a vibrant cluster, which the Industrial Biotechnology Innovation Centre has supported over the last decade alongside other partners, laying the foundations for an economy that can eventually move away from fossil fuels.

The Scottish Bioresource Mapping Tool developed by IBioIC, Scottish Enterprise and Zero Waste Scotland, for instance, helps to identify the availability of different feedstocks for new products and processes, from agriculture and forestry waste to food and drink co-products, industrial carbon dioxide and seaweed.

We also have a network of more than 300 organisations that can feed into the new projects, depending on what is required for each of the three focus areas, as well as the capabilities to support skills development – including involvement with the Skills Transition Centre at Forth Valley College already kicked-off. With some reskilling, the people who have prior experience at Grangemouth could become the powerhouse we need for implementing new sustainable technologies.

Defossilising Grangemouth as an enormous undertaking and collaboration is perhaps the most critical element in making that happen. Scaling-up to establish new industries and supply chains is full of complexity and hurdles, and in this case, we cannot afford for that to be the barrier that halts progress before it has gained any momentum.

It will take years to transition away from petrochemicals to bio-based processing but the scale of the task requires immediate action. The legacy of Grangemouth may have impacted Scotland’s carbon footprint so far, but its reinvention could make a significant contribution to reaching net zero before it is too late.","https://www.scotsman.com/webimg/b25lY21zOmQ3Yzc3Yzk3LTMzZWQtNGE2Yy05ZmQxLTc0NGI1YzhiN2I2ZDo5MWY1OGU0NC05M2YwLTQ2OWItODcyMS05OGFjNDJkNWRmNmY=.jpg?width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75&crop=3:2,smart&trim=",N,,2025-04-14 01:56:41.436289

“We aim to expand the SAF supply chain and strengthen domestic production,” the companies said in a joint statement.
This project aims to boost Japan’s SAF self-sufficiency and support a circular economy by building the nation’s first domestic SAF supply chain.","Iwatani Corporation has joined forces with Cosmo Oil, JGC Holdings, Revo International, and SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY to support Japan’s first large-scale domestic production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made entirely from used cooking oil (UCO).

Iwatani, a leading Japanese conglomerate specialising in energy and industrial gases, has signed a contract to identify sources of waste cooking oil across Japan. The aim is to help secure feedstock for the new SAF production facility being constructed within Cosmo Oil’s Sakai Refinery. The SAF plant, the only commercial-scale SAF plant in Japan, will commence production this month. It will be operated by SAFFAIRE SKY ENERGY.

As part of the initiative, Iwatani will leverage its extensive LPG customer base and industrial network—serving more than 3.3 million households—to identify and collect waste oil. Revo International, a Japanese company specialising in waste oil recycling and environmental solutions, will be responsible for the collection and transportation of the oil to the SAF plant.

The project also includes the involvement of Cosmo Oil Co., Ltd., one of Japan’s largest petroleum companies with strong expertise in refining and fuel distribution, and JGC Holdings Corporation, a global engineering firm with significant experience in energy infrastructure and plant construction.

Together, the six companies aim to establish a fully domestic SAF supply chain—from feedstock procurement to fuel production and airline delivery—supporting Japan’s national target of achieving 10% SAF usage by 2030.

This initiative is supported by the Japanese government’s New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).

“We aim to expand the SAF supply chain and strengthen domestic production,” the companies said in a joint statement. They also confirmed their participation in the “Fry to Fly” Project, a national campaign promoting SAF derived from used cooking oil.

The SAF produced at the Sakai plant will comply with international sustainability standards under the ISCC CORSIA certification. Once fully operational, the facility will produce approximately 30,000 kilolitres of SAF annually, cutting lifecycle CO₂ emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel.

Currently, around 30% of Japan’s used cooking oil is exported, while high-priced SAF is imported.

Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov.
Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten.","Letalski promet se je lani po vseh kazalnikih robustno povečal, podobno statistika kaže letos. Ob tem pa predsednik svetovnega panožnega združenja opozarja, da tej transportni panogi v prizadevanjih za ničelne emisije ne gre dobro, da so zelo negotovi tudi vmesni cilji na tej poti, s prstom pa kaže predvsem na dobavitelje goriv.

Letalski promet je po podatkih mednarodnega združenja letalskih prevoznikov IATA lani dosegel nove rekordne ravni. »V letu 2024 je postalo popolnoma jasno, da želijo ljudje potovati. Povpraševanje po poletih se je povečalo za deset odstotkov, njihovo število je doseglo rekord tako na področju poletov med državami kot znotraj njih. Kar 83 odstotkov vseh ponujenih sedežev je bilo zapolnjenih, kar je rekord, je v poročilu o lanskem letu dejal prvi mož IATA Willie Walsh in dodal, da se rast (sicer nekoliko manjša) nakazuje tudi za letošnje leto, kar so potrdili podatki za januar in le nekoliko manj za februar.

Manj zadovoljen je Walsh z izpolnjevanjem okoljskih zavez letalskega prevoza. Dejal je, da so letalske družbe vložile rekordne zneske v nakup trajnostnega goriva, ki pa so ga dobavitelji dobavili komaj kaj, lani manj kot 0,5 odstotka vsega potrebnega. V pogovoru za agencijo Reuters je dejal, da dobavitelji s tovrstno dobavo zavlačujejo.

V letalski industriji se že dolgo uporablja kerozin, pridobljen iz nafte, trajnostno letalsko gorivo (angleška kratica SAF – sustainable aviation fuel) pa je mešanica običajnih fosilnih goriv in sintetičnih komponent, izdelanih iz vrste obnovljivih »surovin«, kot so rabljena jedilna olja, maščobe, rastlinska olja, komunalni, kmetijski in gozdarski odpadki.

Letalski prevozniki so se leta 2021 zavezali, da bi leta 2050 dosegli ogljično nevtralnost. Z uporabo celostnega pristopa, ki upošteva vse emisije v življenjski dobi goriva, naj bi se emisije toplogrednih plinov v celotnem življenjskem ciklu z uporabo trajnostnih letalskih goriv zmanjšale za kar 70 odstotkov ali več kot 90 odstotkov v primerjavi s fosilnim letalskim gorivom.

Postavili so tudi vmesni cilj, da bi do leta 2030 emisije zmanjšali za pet odstotkov. Walsh, ki je tudi nekdanji direktor British Airways, je za Reuters dejal, da je ta vmesni cilj nedosegljiv, predvsem pa da preostali udeleženi v izpolnjevanju tega cilja ne prevzemajo svoje vloge. Vse skupaj malo spominja na avtomobilizem, kjer so bile dane prav tako velike tovrstne zaveze, ki se zdaj majejo.

»Vsi so za stvar, dokler mi plačamo račun, kar je preprosto nesprejemljivo,« so bile Walsheve besede. Dvom, da je vmesni cilj dosegljiv, pomeni precejšen preobrat glede na mnenje s srečanja IATA pred komaj desetimi meseci, ko je Walsh dejal, da je ta cilj »eksistenčno nujen«. Zdaj je drugače, prst je uperil predvsem v dobavitelje goriva, češ da ignorirajo dane obljube, pa čeprav bodo za goriva, ki bodo imela manj emisij, letos letalske družbe namenile 3,8 milijarde dolarjev. Reuters je za komentar prosil panožno združenje proizvajalcev goriv Fuels Europe, a od njih ni dobil dogovora.

Razogljičenje letalstva

Evropsko združenje letalskih prevoznikov A4E (Airlines for Europe) je v zapisu konec marca navajalo, da sicer ostajajo popolnoma zavezani razogljičenju letalstva, zmanjševanju emisij in doseganju ogljične nevtralnosti do leta 2050, a so tudi oni dodali, da so za doseg tega cilja ključna cenovno dostopna trajnostna goriva. Kot so zapisali, so globoko zaskrbljeni, da zakonodaja s tega področja ne ustvarja cenovno dostopnega trga tovrstnih goriv. Navedli so tudi poročilo analitične družbe Boston Consulting, ki napoveduje, da bo do leta 2030 primanjkljaj teh sintetičnih goriv 45-odstoten. A4E dodaja, da morajo zdaj odgovornosti prevzeti evropska komisija in države članice, ker dobavitelji ne dostavljajo goriva. Brez nujnega ukrepanja v prihodnjih mesecih bo tudi po njihovem mnenju verodostojnost zaveze močno omajana – in potrebna ponovna presoja.

IATA pač še navaja, da jih v smeri manjšega okoljskega odtisa ovira dejstvo, da dobave novih letal zamujajo. Predstavniki proizvajalcev so menda Reutersu odgovorili, da so povsem zavezani k proizvodnji bolj učinkovitih letal, a da jih bremenijo stalne težave v dobavnih verigah sestavnih delov. Pri tem le omenimo, da ima evropski konzorcij Airbus v načrtu, da bi do sredine prihodnjega desetletja na trgu uvedel naslednika svojega najbolj prodajanega modela 320 neo, ki naj bi imel od 20 do 30 odstotkov manjšo porabo goriva, kar naj bi med drugim dosegli z izdelavo drugačnih kril, motorji z odprtim rotorjem in lažjimi materiali trupa.

Kritike Walsha, da ne prispevajo dovolj k skupnem cilju, sta za Reuters zavrnili tudi krovni združenji letališč (ACI Europe) in kontrolorjev zračnega prometa (CANSO). Prvi so dejali, da prispevajo »več kot pravičen delež pri razogljičenju letalstva, in obtožili IATA, da ona prelaga odgovornosti. Tudi krovna skupina za nadzor zračnega prometa CANSO je dejala, da je močno zavezana k razogljičenju in povečanju učinkovitosti zračnega prostora, da bi pripomogla k manjši porabi goriva.",https://www.delo.si/media/images/20250409/2070005.2e16d0ba.fill-1200x630.format-webp.webp?rev=1,N,,2025-04-13 23:56:30.616186

Business travel, a sector historically associated with significant environmental impact, is now at the forefront of this change. With growing awareness of the ecological footprint caused by excessive travel, companies like BCD Travel are exploring ways to make business travel more sustainable. BCD Travel’s 2024 Survey on Reimagining Corporate Travel Policies, which surveyed 211 travel buyers, highlighted that sustainable travel is now a significant theme, with 64% of travel buyers incorporating it into their policies. Flexibility is also gaining traction, as companies adapt to hybrid work environments and evolving traveller needs. However, issues like managing local regulatory differences and balancing global consistency remain hurdles. This article explores the impact of traditional travel practices, highlights the importance of mindful travel, and outlines some sustainable options for business travellers.

The Environmental Impact of Business Travel

Business travel contributes heavily to greenhouse gas emissions. Air travel is a significant source of global emissions and is predicted to account for 12 to 27 per cent of 2050 global emissions. Air travel emissions are increasing 70 per cent faster than initially expected by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It is estimated that business travel represents about 15 to 20 per cent of that global travel. Not only does excessive travel affect the environment but also increases carbon emissions. Furthermore, hotel stays, rental vehicles, and meals on the go all add to resource consumption, while single-use plastics and disposable items at airports, hotels, and meeting spaces exacerbate waste issues.

The 2024 BCD survey also highlights several specific strategies that organisations are implementing to promote sustainable travel. Around 59% of companies reporting reduced travel budgets, cost control is critical. Popular measures include encouraging virtual meetings, optimizing trip lengths, and limiting luxury travel perks. Despite these constraints, there is recognition that well-structured travel policies can enhance talent retention and satisfaction.

Among the many measures is public transportation, wherein rather than relying on taxis or ride-hailing services, companies are encouraging the use of public transportation, which not only reduces carbon emissions but also cuts down on travel costs. Business travellers can consider travelling light and reducing luggage weight. Travelling without checked-in luggage or reducing its weight minimizes the fuel burden on flights, making air travel slightly more eco-friendly. Or even, opting for hybrid or electric vehicles is gaining traction. Many companies now prioritise electric or hybrid vehicles for ground transportation, marking a shift towards renewable energy use in business travel. Other practices include carpooling to reduce individual vehicle use, encouraging economy class over business class, and choosing direct flights over connecting routes to cut down on unnecessary emissions.

Being Mindful

With sustainability now a critical consideration, business travellers and companies need to adopt mindful travel practices. Implementing more strategic travel planning and opting for greener options can reduce the negative impact of travel on the environment.

Companies committed to sustainability enhance their brand image, appealing to eco-conscious clients and partners with specific eco-conscious campaigns. Increasingly, organizations are choosing to participate in carbon offset programs that fund projects like reforestation, renewable energy, or conservation to offset the carbon footprint of their travel.

Beyond individual travel choices, travel managers are also rethinking how they organise meetings. Sustainable group activities, focusing on low-impact or eco-friendly experiences, are increasingly part of the meeting agenda.

The Shift toward Sustainable Travel Programs: Insights and Innovations

In an industry first, BCD has developed a comprehensive sustainability solution for corporate travel programs. This innovation, developed with climate-tech partner SQUAKE and experts at global corporate travel consultancy Advito, helps businesses set sustainability goals, manage carbon emissions, and encourage greener travel choices. Key features include automated carbon tax applications, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) procurement, and compliance tools for regulations like the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Piloted with Siemens, the solution will be available in early 2025, offering consistent sustainability guidance and reporting across booking platforms. It aims to simplify integrating sustainability into corporate travel processes and reduce travel-related emissions.

The future of corporate travel is increasingly dependent on innovative initiatives that prioritise sustainability while ensuring operational efficiency. A notable example is Microsoft’s collaboration with Advito, which centred around limiting the growth of their Scope 3 emissions and aligning their travel team with this objective. Advito’s Sustainable Collaboration team analysed Microsoft’s travel footprint to identify opportunities to transition from air to rail travel, along with quantifying the potential savings in carbon emissions. The analysis uncovered numerous opportunities for Microsoft to make significant changes; specifically, by shifting 50% of travel from air to rail on viable routes, the company could achieve a reduction of approximately 4,438 tons of CO2 emissions annually.

Another pioneer in building a sustainable travel program was global fintech firm Finastra, who sought reduce internal travel, enhance employee productivity, and optimise their program savings. In early 2019, Finastra announced an ambitious sustainability initiative to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. With the guidance of experts from Advito, the Finastra Travel Team worked to reduce internal travel from 43% at the beginning of the campaign to just 9.8% in just four months, reducing travel spend by 50% in the process.

What Lies Ahead for Sustainable Business Travel?

BCD Travel and other industry leaders are expected to innovate further, encouraging the use of low-emission flights, promoting sustainable suppliers, integrating dynamic meeting location choices and encouraging the use of train travel over air where applicable. The rise of eco-certifications, regulations on sustainability, such as the EU’s CSRD, and ongoing research into sustainable travel technologies will likely make sustainable travel the norm in the corporate world.

While business travel is essential, it doesn’t have to come at the cost of our planet. Companies and travellers have a role to play in making more sustainable choices. By being mindful of travel impacts and embracing green practices, we can pave the way for a more sustainable, responsible future in business travel. Furthermore, sustainable travel is no longer a niche concern, but a growing priority for organisations worldwide. As more companies adopt these practices, the travel industry will likely witness a shift towards more sustainable and responsible travel solutions. For organisations still on the fence, adopting even a few of these initiatives could lead to substantial benefits for both the environment and the bottom line.

As businesses worldwide adapt to a new travel paradigm, the message is clear: sustainable travel is not just a responsibility—it’s an opportunity to lead.",https://storage.googleapis.com/stateless-www-live-traveldailymedia/2025/03/e17118a5-annie-spratt-iqwnr00mfqm-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 22:56:07.831956

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team.
Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards.
We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.” SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution.
The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050.","DAEJEON, South Korea, April 14 (Korea Bizwire) — At SK Innovation’s Environmental Science & Technology Institute in Daejeon, a powerful scent of used cooking oil hangs in the air, signaling an ambitious transformation: converting waste oil into sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).

Within the facility’s pilot plant, dark brown waste oil is refined through high-temperature, high-pressure reactors into a clear liquid—an eco-friendly fuel that can cut carbon emissions by up to 80% compared to traditional jet fuel.

The shift comes as SAF gains momentum globally, driven by regulatory mandates and growing pressure on the aviation sector to decarbonize.

“With SAF blending mandates expanding, demand is rising rapidly,” said Jeong Ho-seung, head of SK Innovation’s Sustainable Fuel Technology Team. “The global SAF market is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 46%, reaching 108 trillion won ($80 billion) by 2034.”

SK Energy, a subsidiary of SK Innovation, began commercial SAF production last September at its Ulsan Complex, marking a domestic first.

The facility, with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons, uses a co-processing method that integrates bio-based feedstocks into existing petroleum production lines. This dual-input system allows for continuous SAF output alongside other low-carbon products like bio-naphtha.

Much of SK’s progress is underpinned by its in-house R&D. Engineers at the Daejeon institute developed the co-processing technology and validated it through pilot testing before scaling it to commercial operations.

Jeong emphasized the challenges of meeting stringent safety standards: “Aviation fuel is heavily regulated, and SAF must meet one of eight ASTM standards. We’re also developing technologies that allow us to use lower-grade, cost-effective waste oils.”

SK has now established a full SAF value chain—from feedstock procurement to production and global distribution. The company became the first Korean refiner to export SAF to Europe in January.

In March, it signed a bulk supply deal with Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific, and has since begun supplying domestic carriers including Air Busan and Korean Air.

Governments worldwide are tightening SAF mandates. The European Union now requires a minimum 2% SAF blend in jet fuel, with targets rising to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050.

The United States has set a goal to fully replace conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2050. Korea, meanwhile, announced last August that all international flights departing the country must blend SAF starting in 2027.

Still, industry insiders warn that Korea’s policy support lags behind other nations. The EU offers carbon credits to airlines using SAF, while the U.S. provides tax credits of up to $1.75 per gallon for SAF producers. Japan also offers tax deductions of up to 40% for SAF-related investments and sales.

“To meet growing market demand, multi-trillion-won investments are required,” said one industry source. “Without government support, such investments are unfeasible. Proactive policy measures are essential to advance this strategic industry.”

Myanmar 7.7 Earthquake Recovery

Myanmar is grappling with the aftermath of a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck on March 28, devastating its central region. The disaster claimed over 3,600 lives and caused widespread destruction, toppling everything from modern condominiums to historic pagodas.

More than nine million people across 58 townships have been impacted, with thousands of buildings, including schools and hospitals, reduced to rubble. The situation remains unstable as aftershocks continue to shake the worst-affected areas, worsening an already critical humanitarian crisis.

In response, UN agencies are requesting an additional $241.6 million to support those in the hardest-hit areas. They are also reallocating $134 million from Myanmar’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan, published in December 2024.

The updated plan highlights two million newly affected people in urgent need of aid. This adds to the 4.3 million who had already been relying on assistance before the earthquake struck.

Even before this tragedy, Myanmar faced severe challenges. Nearly 20 million people—about a third of the population—were already in need of humanitarian support.

David Steffen and Sens. Romaine Quinn and Patrick Testin. Lawmakers believe Wisconsin has an edge both geographically and because of its strong agricultural output.

The anticipation from bill authors is that SAF will produce a new market for the farming and timber industries.

At a time when the agricultural sector is facing a myriad of challenges, Wisconsin can support its farmers and timber producers by seizing opportunities for our growing biofuels industry, the authors wrote in a memorandum.

Wisconsin’s biofuels industry adds $4.2 billion to the state’s economy and directly employs over 19,000 people. The SAF tax credit is on the priority lists for both the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation and the Wisconsin Biofuels Association for this legislative session.

In a shocking and dramatic turn of events, American Airlines Flight AA154, en route from Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW) to London Heathrow (LHR), was forced into an emergency diversion to Memphis International Airport (MEM) on April 10, 2025, after smoke mysteriously began to fill the forward cabin just an hour into the flight. The Boeing 777, a massive and normally reliable aircraft, became the center of an unexpected emergency, sending waves of panic throughout the cabin as flight attendants and crew scrambled to handle the crisis. The fact that the plane was less than an hour from its scheduled destination raised significant concerns over the safety of the aircraft and the airline’s preparedness for such incidents.

A Nightmarish 40 Minutes in the Sky

This incident unfolded with all the drama of a high-stakes thriller. After taking off from Dallas at 2:31 UTC, everything appeared to be running smoothly for the 200 passengers aboard the Boeing 777. But the calm was short-lived. Just over an hour into the flight, smoke began seeping into the forward cabin, sending the crew into action mode. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the pilots made the quick decision to divert the flight to Memphis International Airport, a move that may have been a matter of life or death.

As the aircraft made its descent into Memphis, passengers were left on edge, unsure of what was happening in the chaos above them. According to reports from FlightRadar24, the aircraft made a safe but urgent landing at runway 36C in Memphis, touching down at 4:22 UTC—nearly 40 minutes after the initial diversion was initiated. The plane was met with emergency vehicles on the ground, and the passengers’ long ordeal finally came to an end, but not before sparking alarm bells across the aviation world.

The Boeing 777’s Age and Reliability Under Scrutiny

The plane involved in this heart-stopping emergency was a Boeing 777-200ER, registered N761AJ, a 23.1-year-old aircraft powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 800 engines. While these aircraft are usually considered reliable, their age and potential for mechanical wear-and-tear could be a factor in this terrifying scenario. Despite American Airlines’ claims of ensuring “top-notch” maintenance, this incident raises alarm about the true safety of older aircraft in the fleet, especially when faced with unexpected mechanical failures mid-flight.

A History of Alarming Similar Incidents

This emergency landing isn’t the only high-profile incident involving American Airlines aircraft recently. On April 1, 2025, a different American Eagle flight, AA5406, operated by PSA Airlines, was forced into a dramatic evacuation at Augusta Regional Airport (AGS) after smoke filled the cabin following its landing. Passengers were forced to evacuate via the aircraft’s wings, while footage captured by one of the passengers quickly went viral.

The similarities between these incidents are disturbing—both flights involved a smoky cabin and swift actions by the crew to mitigate a major crisis. What’s even more unsettling is the fact that both incidents involved aircrafts operated by American Airlines, raising the question: How many other flights are at risk of similar problems? Could this be a sign of systemic issues within American Airlines’ maintenance protocols?

The FAA’s Investigation: A Deep Dive into Safety Standards

In the aftermath of the dramatic Memphis diversion, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) swiftly launched an investigation into what went wrong with American Airlines Flight 154. Was this simply an isolated mechanical malfunction, or does it point to a deeper problem with the airline’s maintenance practices? As the FAA probes further, the airline’s reputation is at stake, especially with passengers now questioning the airline’s commitment to ensuring flight safety.

This FAA investigation will not only examine the cause of the smoke in the cabin but also scrutinize American Airlines’ overall safety and maintenance procedures. The findings of this investigation will surely have significant implications for the airline industry as a whole—particularly for major carriers like American Airlines, which faces mounting pressure to maintain their safety record after such incidents.

Passenger Panic and Airline Accountability

While the airline’s crew responded swiftly and efficiently to the smoke-filled cabin emergency, it’s hard to ignore the panic and fear passengers experienced during this harrowing ordeal. Many passengers on board have recounted their terrifying experiences, with some saying they could smell something burning as the cabin quickly filled with smoke. “It felt like a scene from a disaster movie,” one passenger said in an interview after landing. Others noted that the cabin’s air was becoming increasingly difficult to breathe, exacerbating their anxiety.

However, like many major airlines, it has faced challenges regarding customer service, especially during periods of high demand or operational disruptions. Nonetheless, it remains committed to maintaining customer satisfaction as a core aspect of its business.

Environmental Initiatives and Sustainability

In recent years, American Airlines has placed a significant emphasis on sustainability and reducing its environmental footprint. The airline has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, pledging to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This initiative includes fleet modernization, sustainable aviation fuel, and eco-friendly operational practices. Additionally, American Airlines works to reduce waste and improve fuel efficiency across its operations.

American Airlines continues to be a global aviation giant, adapting to the changing dynamics of the airline industry. With its vast network, diverse fleet, and commitment to customer service and sustainability, American Airlines remains a cornerstone of air travel, ensuring passengers can connect to nearly every corner of the world. Its ongoing efforts to innovate and provide reliable service reinforce its position as a leader in the competitive airline industry.

The Stakes: One-Upmanship in the Airline Industry

The American Airlines Flight AA154 crisis is not just another emergency incident; it’s a high-profile debacle that puts the airline industry’s safety practices under a microscope. And with competitors like Delta Air Lines and United Airlines continuously updating their fleets with state-of-the-art aircraft, American Airlines is facing increasing pressure to match up. The public is watching closely, and the stakes have never been higher. Every misstep in safety will inevitably be exploited by rival airlines seeking to claim the crown for the most reliable fleet in the skies.

It will supply the fuel to Japanese airline companies for a cleaner alternative to traditional air travel.

As Reuters reported, Cosmo planned production at its Osaka-based Sakai refinery earlier this year. It aimed to produce 30,000 kiloliters of sustainable aviation fuel per year by April.

The company supplies eco-friendly fuel to Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways. This commitment is significant because it is Japan's first domestically produced green fuel for airlines.

Cosmo's sustainable fuel is made from cooking oil and is the first large-scale production of its kind in the country. The refiner worked with two other companies to produce it but declined to provide details about the fuel's price and volume.

The news from Japan is encouraging worldwide because of how sustainable aviation fuel can reduce the harmful air pollution associated with traditional plane travel.

The aviation industry is responsible for about 2% of global energy pollution. This contribution impacts our planet's overheating and leads to public health risks and extreme weather events.

In other parts of the world, sustainable aviation fuel companies like LanzaJet have been creating millions of gallons of alternative fuel to offset air travel pollution. That company's fuel is made from low-carbon intensity ethanol, or grain alcohol, using corn.

Another company, OXCCU, has been creating jet fuel from air pollution using renewable energy and a combination of hydrogen and carbon dioxide.

As a traveler, you can look into flying on planes powered by sustainable fuel and support airlines' efforts to embrace fuels with lower carbon impacts. For example, Delta has been actively working to use sustainable fuels to reduce the environmental impact of its flights.

Until sustainable fuel flights become more readily available, you can change the way you travel by embracing train travel and vacationing close to home in places that don't require a flight. When you do fly, consider eco-friendly travel destinations to help minimize your adventures' overall environmental impact.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/sustainable-aviation-fuelimage-reci36GfcI80PaIDy.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 13:56:07.584302

Three of the Port Authority of NY & NJ’s major airports may have gotten there before us!

Most travelers are aware that air travel is a major contributor to carbon emissions, and airports themselves can also be massive hubs of energy use with in- and out-going vehicle traffic, bright lighting 24/7, air conditioning and heating, as well the production of vast amounts of waste. The aviation industry, including airports themselves and the planes actually flying, contribute around 2.5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, some airports are taking steps to reduce these emissions and become a part of the solution.

All over the planet, airports are embracing sustainability and recognizing the need to make more eco-friendly choices. This includes three of the major airports in the United States’ largest and most famous city, New York – John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), and Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), all operated by the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.

These three airports are going through major redevelopment projects to embrace renewable energy, move away from fossil fuels where they can, and strategically reducing the volume of waste they produce.

NY Metropolitan Airports Cleared for a Green Landing

JFK and LaGuardia airports collectively serve over 90 million travelers annually — JFK alone handles 63.3 million passengers, and LaGuardia sees 33.5 million. And at Newark Airport, 49 million travelers were served in 2023.

In 2024, a total of 145.9 million air passengers flew through JFK, LaGuardia, Newark, and New York Stewart airports, according to initial estimates. That total surpassed the previous record of 143.8 million set in 2023. To support this level of traffic, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey is responsible for managing a significant portion of the region’s transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, seaports, and airports, all within its designated geographical area. Spanning 1,500 square miles and centered around New York Harbor, it covers parts of 17 New York and New Jersey counties, making it the largest employer in New York State. The Port Authority’s goal is to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

One of the most exciting projects helping them get there is the recently upgraded electric charging station at JFK. This station has added 24 brand-new EV chargers, bringing the total number of chargers at JFK to 46, open 24/7 to the public to quickly charge their passenger vehicles.

Even better, the chargers are being used for the airport’s own ground fleet of EV vehicles at the airport as well. This aligns with the Port Authority’s net-zero emission goals, which have seen it commit to electrifying its entire light-duty fleet by 2028 and its ground service equipment fleet by 2035.

Gas-powered ground operations and light-duty fleets require enormous amounts of fossil fuel, but by transitioning all their vehicles to electric, that will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Imagine, if you will – security vehicles, concessions, baggage carousels, kiosks – all run on electricity generated by renewable energy like solar. That is what New York is working towards. Here’s how: solar-powered terminals.

Running on Sunshine

A brand new, solar-powered sustainable terminal at JFK is already underway and is due to open in 2026.

“The development of the New Terminal One is rooted in resiliency and sustainability, extending from our design and construction to operations and maintenance after we open our doors in 2026. We are building the terminal to withstand challenges posed by climate change and extreme weather events, so we remain fully operational no matter the environmental conditions,” says Uzoamaka N. Okoye, Chief of Staff, The New Terminal One (NTO) at JFK.

Okoye explains that NTO is committed to reducing its environmental impact through innovative energy systems. Their state-of-the-art microgrid, built in partnership with AlphaStructure, is key to these efforts. Featuring the largest solar array in New York City and on any U.S. airport, the microgrid will enable them to function independently of the power grid with locally generated and lower carbon energy.

Reducing Waste, Elevating Sustainability

Vehicle carbon emissions are where our minds go when we think of waste at airports. Unfortunately, that is just one part of the problem. Airports also generate huge amounts of waste every single day, from plastic food packaging to lavatory water, uneaten food to deplaned waste to oil, grease spills to single-use plastic bottles. This list is long and daunting. When was the last time you made it through an airport without throwing something away?

But for most travelers, sustainability is not top of mind when we are rushing to a gate or trying to fill up on food between flights. For most of us, convenience is always going to win out over reducing waste.

Fortunately, the Port Authority is taking steps to mitigate this and make it easier to dispose of our trash properly. Revamping their recycling policy is the first step, by having clear and separated receptacles for different recyclable items helps to make sure waste is at least handled properly at the airport and “to get the most use out of waste-bound materials as possible in order to avoid landfilling,” says Alexandria Cassidy, lead on zero-waste at the Port Authority.

She is absolutely right!

One of the more significant issues with our recycling system in the United States is improper waste sorting and insufficient facilities to handle the waste, especially plastics. These clearly labeled bins are a start in helping to keep the waste in the right place while maintaining convenience for passengers. Ultimately, EARTHDAY.ORG would like to see a drastic reduction in the use of single-use plastics at airports, across the U.S., and globally, and a move towards more eco-friendly alternatives like water refilling stations, bamboo cutlery, paper, and reusable glass bottles.

With the redevelopment of the new Terminal 6 at JFK, “Sustainability is a top priority for us and has been built into the design of T6, with floor-to-ceiling windows, over 6,000 rooftop solar panels, energy-efficient baggage systems, and graywater collection and reuse throughout the terminal,” said Rishali Chaplot, Manager, Environment and Sustainability at JFK Millennium Partners. “Both during the construction of T6 and its operation in 2026, we aim to divert as much waste as possible by implementing various waste recycling and composting guidelines across all our products and vendors. Through January of this year, our waste diversion rate at the construction site was 98.87% — a figure we are very proud of.”

Doing the Right Thing = Saving Money

LaGuardia Airport’s newly developed $5.1 billion Terminal B stands as a prime example of sustainable design that ultimately is good for the bottom line as well. The Terminal earned a LEED v4 Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC). This recognition makes it the world’s first airline terminal to meet these advanced environmental standards, highlighting the airport’s commitment to sustainability.

Its design has allowed LaGuardia to save more — reducing its water bills by 43% and its energy costs by 18%. This has been achieved through reduced window glazing, installation of a specialist roof that reflects solar heat, using solar water heaters, and light-sensitive artificial lighting control. Every aspect of Terminal B is designed to maximize efficiency and minimize waste. This ambitious project reflects LaGuardia Airport’s ongoing efforts to lead in both eco-conscious infrastructure and innovation.

In November 2023, the Port Authority announced that Newark Liberty International Airport’s Terminal A achieved LEED Gold certification by the USGBC for leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), the most widely used green-building rating system in the world and an international symbol of environmental responsibility.

The one-million-square-foot Terminal A at Newark Airport features a variety of sustainable design elements, including the largest solar rooftop installation at any U.S. airport atop the terminal’s parking deck, new electric buses to support shuttle operations, water-efficient fixtures reducing potable water demand by more than 45 percent, a cool roof designed to reflect sunlight, absorbing less solar energy and reducing the heat gain on the building, and energy-efficient indoor lighting and controls. In achieving LEED Gold, the project meets the Port Authority’s goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by reducing annual energy costs by an estimated 30 percent.

“The LEED Gold designation exemplifies the agency’s commitment to environmental sustainability and being a good neighbor,” said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O’Toole. “By establishing rigorous building standards and adopting aggressive measures to reduce our carbon footprint, we are creating a healthier environment and striving to improve the quality of life for those in the region we serve.”

Newark Liberty also provides charging and electrical infrastructure to enable airlines to transition to electric ground-support equipment (GSE) across the terminal. The agency’s 2022 Zero Emission Airside Vehicle Rule mandates the conversion of all GSE to electric models by 2030, where commercially available. It’s satisfying to see major airports taking responsibility and recognizing their role in cutting carbon emissions and reducing waste.

Like the Port Authority, we see the shining benefits of renewable energy—whether through solar, wind, or other sustainable sources. Beyond their environmental impact, renewable energy helps to lower operational costs, proving that sustainability and financial savings go hand in hand. As more airports and industries embrace these green technologies, they not only contribute to a healthier planet but showcase that renewable energy is both a smart financial decision and a critical step toward a sustainable future for all.",https://metroairportnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Creating-a-Green-Sky.jpg,N,,2025-04-13 15:56:33.314719

MOPCO has also recorded a 7.2% increase in working capital, reaching EGP 12.360 billion. Total investment has increased by 6.5%, amounting to EGP 53.840 billion.

In addition, the company’s equity saw notable growth, reaching EGP 45.380 billion, a 4.9% rise from 2023 and an astounding 800% increase since 2015.

The results were announced during the company’s general assembly meeting, held in the presence of the Minister of Petroleum and Mineral Resources Karim Badawi, along with officials from the petroleum sector.

In the meeting, Badawi underscored the importance of the petrochemical industry for the petroleum sector, given its added value to natural resources. He pointed out that investors’ interest in petroleum projects is a true reflection of the attractiveness of its investment climate.

For his part, Ahmed Mahmoud, the Chairman and Managing Director of MOPCO, reviewed the company’s primary results in line with the pillars of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources (MoPMR). He highlighted the company’s commitment to occupational safety and health standards, boosting production efficiency, and adopting sustainable practices to achieve Egypt’s vision in sustainable development goals.

The company recorded four million hours of work with no injuries during 2024, increasing total number of safe working hours to 19 million since 2018.

Mahmoud said that MOPCO was able to increase 10% of the production capacity of its MOPCO 3 plant, located in the Damietta Industrial Complex. Coming earlier than expected, the increase was the result of replacing the HPCC unit, leading to a $2 million boost in the company’s revenues.

In the area of urea and ammonia production, MOPCO has surpassed its targets, with sales amounting to 1,741,000 tons and 116,000 tons respectively. The company exported 947,000 tons of urea and allocated 795,000 tons to the local market. Notably, the European market is the largest destination for MOPCO’s urea exports, accounting for 89%. For ammonia, the company exported 48,000 tons and allocated 68,000 tons to the local market.

Mahmoud explained that MOPCO is currently implementing several projects, including a project focused on upgrading and developing its plants’ efficiency to increase production and rationalize natural gas consumption. The company has also started its production of ADBlue–a urea-based solution to reduce diesel engine emissions.

Moreover, MOPCO is developing a green ammonia production project in cooperation with the Egyptian Petrochemicals Holding Company (EGPC) and the Norwegian company Scatec, collaborating with Damietta Green Ammonia Company, and holding 25% of the shares. It has also signed a 15-year purchase agreement with the Norwegian company Yara Clean Ammonia.

MOPCO also holds 20% of the shares in the Egyptian Sustainable Aviation Fuel (ESAF) Company. Additionally, it is implementing a carbon dioxide recovery unit from the smokestack of plant 1–the first project of its kind in Africa and the Middle East to significantly reduce carbon emissions.

The company will be taking part in two projects in El Alamein: one of them to produce soda ash and its derivatives, and another to produce silicon products. It is also expected to produce technical-grade urea to help reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In addition to that, it is installing solar panels that generate 4 megawatts by 2026, Mahmoud said.

In respect of social responsibility, MOPCO allocated EGP 39 million throughout the year to supporting numerous initiatives and projects across Egypt, particularly in Damietta, where it implemented a range of infrastructure development projects, and participated in initiatives supporting education, health, and civil society. MOPCO has also been awarded the ISO 26000 certification for social responsibility.

MOPCO places a strong emphasis on developing human capital, offering a total of 1,710 training opportunities annually across a wide range of fields, as highlighted by Mahmoud.

막대한 투자 규모에 정유사 선뜻 못 나서

정부 ""SAF 의무화 비율 및 R&D 준비 중""

10일 찾은 대전 SK이노베이션 환경과학기술원. 식용유보다 맑고 노란 빛의 기름병을 여니 주유소 기름 냄새가 코를 찔렀다. SK에너지가 만든 지속가능항공유(Sustainable Aviation Fuel·SAF). 폐식용유 같은 바이오원료를 석유 원료와 섞어 뽑아낸 비행기용 연료다. 환경 보호를 위해 전 세계적으로 SAF 도입 의무화 바람이 불면서 정유사 간 시장 선점 경쟁이 치열한데 SK에너지가 출사표를 던졌다.

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

정호승 SK이노베이션 지속가능Fuel 기술팀 팀장은 ""바이오원료를 섞으면 불순물 종류나 함량, 촉매 반응 결과, 저장 안정성 등이 달라져 R&D가 필요했다""며 ""바이오원료의 저장, 반응, 제품 생산까지 밸류 체인을 단계별로 연구했고 생길 수 있는 문제의 해법을 만들어 대량생산을 해냈다""고 설명했다.

에쓰오일·HD현대오일뱅크·GS칼텍스 등 다른 정유사들도 기존 생산 설비에서 코 프로세싱 공정으로 SAF를 만들어 국내외로 판매 중이다.

시장 커지는데 국산 100% SAF 생산은 언제쯤

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 12:56:25.706343

The fund will focus on innovations in the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) but will also invest in other technologies which will help decarbonise the aviation sector. The fund will mainly invest in Australia but will have capacity to invest globally.

According to a joint announcement by Qantas and Airbus on April 7, the new fund will offer early-stage technology companies mentorship and strategic support as well as investment capital.

Qantas chief sustainability officer Fiona Messent said: “Sustainable aviation fuel is the most effective tool we have to decarbonise aviation and, with Airbus, we’re investing significantly in ways to make it more available and accessible.

“As well as funding, this partnership will help provide a vote of confidence in new technologies so they can be developed, scaled and integrated into the SAF supply chain while also providing companies with access to Qantas and Airbus as they develop and test their solutions.”

The investment capital will be drawn from the 2022-established $US200 million ($318 million) Qantas-Airbus SAF partnership fund.

“For Australia, an onshore SAF industry will mean improved national fuel security, more jobs and economic benefit, so it’s fantastic to be collaborating across industries to accelerate local production,” Messent added.

Airbus chief sustainability officer Julie Kitcher said: “Decarbonising aviation at speed and scale requires bold action and collaboration across sectors; from airlines, manufactures and airports to regulators, governments and investors.”

She said she believed Australia was well positioned to be a leader in low carbon fuels and investment in the sector could generate new jobs.

Co-founder of Climate Tech Partners Patrick Sieb said: “Working with global leading aviation and aerospace companies allows us to not only make more deeply informed investment decisions in this complex area but attract and support the best companies by helping them accelerate through industry engagement.”

Sydney and Melbourne firm Climate Tech Partners was set up Sieb and Tom Kline last year. The pair previously raised a Climate Tech Fund for Investible. They launched fundraising for Climate Tech Partners’ main fund early this year and have attracted initial commitments, including from Daniel Besen’s family office.

According to Sieb and Kline, Climate Tech Partners Fund I is close to achieving a first close above $45 million. The fund will invest primarily at Series A stage across the energy and power, transport and logistics and industrials and resources sectors.",https://www.privateequitymedia.com.au/static/images/img/og_image.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:57:38.125918

Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.
“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.
“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.","THE Sarawak government will continue to pursue research on microalgae on its nutritional and medical benefits, and is looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications.

Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg said the microalgae offers potential for innovative and sustainable product development in the food industry.

“There are many algae species that have been found to have tremendous health benefits, and spirulina is a good example of a superfood. Spirulina is packed with essential nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, which make it a popular supplement for health-conscious individuals.

“But beyond spirulina, we are also looking into other algae species for their potential medical applications. For instance, some algae have been found to have antibacterial and antiviral properties, which can help in the fight against infectious diseases,” he said.

Abang Johari who is also Minister for Finance and New Economy was delivering his ministerial winding-up speech at DUN yesterday (May 24).

He said, additionally algae may be used to reduce inflammation, detoxify the body, boost the immune system, and even aid in weight loss.

He told the august House that there are two facilities cultivating algae with different technologies, with the first facility, on solar platform, which is a collaboration between Sarawak Energy, Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, Eneos Corporation and Chitose Group from Japan at Sejingkat.

“The other facility is employing the use of tanks and sea water. This is a collaboration between Sarawak Economic Development Corporation (SEDC) Energy and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) in Demak Laut,” he said.

Sarawak, he said, has also taken a progressive step to explore microalgae as a potential source of renewable energy, where Sarawak Biodiversity Centre, in collaboration with Sarawak Energy Berhad as well as Chitose Laboratory and Eneos Corporation from Japan has established the world’s largest mass microalgae biomass production facility, Chitose Carbon Capture Central (C4), spanning about five hectares in Sejingkat, Kuching.

“The C4 will tap into the exhausted gas containing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Sejingkat Coal Power Plant to grow algae in a carbon circular economy.

“This is the first of its kind in Malaysia to demonstrate the industrial-scale utilisation of flue gas to enhance algae production. This 5-hectare facility will act as ‘liquid trees’ to capture CO2 while functioning as a natural purifier by releasing oxygen through photosynthesis,” he said.

Abang Johari believed that microalgae is an industrial crop that could help to expand and grow the state’s economy and serve as a model to achieve our aspirations while preserving the environment.

“This facility will also serve as part of net zero emissions efforts with an expected 700 tonnes of CO2 that can be absorbed by the algae biomass, and will produce around 350 tonnes of algae biomass annually. This will be transformed into high- quality products such as food and feedstock, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical ingredients,” he said.

He added the commercialisation of algae has only just begun.

“We anticipate significant growth in this industry with the planning of the Chitose group to expand the farm to 100 hectares in the next three years and to achieve 2,000 hectares by 2030 in Sarawak.

“We expect to create up to 5,000 new job opportunities and decarbonisation of about 200,000 tonnes of carbon annually,” he said.

On a related note, he said Sarawak has the capacity to provide a green fuel solution from a sustainable source.

“Microalgae offer great potential to produce Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), which is crucial to the aviation industry to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

“I just came back from Langkawi International Maritime and Aerospace (LIMA) exhibition using aircraft powered by SAF, from a joint venture between PETRONAS and SEDC Energy. It is the world’s first SAF produced using algae. This clearly proves Sarawak is able to produce safe and reliable SAF for commercial use.

“I believe microalgae is a renewable source that can offer us a sustainable solution that does not compete with food sources.

“Here in Sarawak, there is enough sunlight, warm tropical climate and abundance of seawater that provides the right conditions to continuously farm the oil source sustainably,” said Abang Johari.",https://www.sarawaktribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/8adeb426-f85a-4e2e-8570-85e3755c3237.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:57:59.530303

치킨 튀긴 식용유가 비행기 연료가 된다... SAF가 뭐길래?

SAF로 항공유 전체를 대체하기에는 무리가 있어 현재는 SAF를 항공유와 섞어 쓴다. 두 가지 방법이 있는데 하나는 100% SAF를 만든 다음 항공유에 원하는 만큼 물리적으로 섞는 것이고 또 하나는 생산 설비에 바이오원료와 석유 원료를 함께 넣고 공정을 거쳐 원하는 비율의 SAF를 생산하는 식으로 '코 프로세싱(Co-processing)'이라 불린다.

이를 커피에 비유하면 전자는 원두(바이오원료)로 에스프레소(100% SAF)를 만든 다음 물(항공유)을 섞어 아메리카노를 만드는 식이라면, 후자는 원두(바이오원료)와 물(석유원료)을 시작부터 한 번에 넣고 우려내 콜드브루를 제조하는 식에 가깝다.

SK에너지는 자체 코 프로세싱 방식으로 시장에 뛰어들었다. 대전 기술원에서 연구개발(R&D)을 통해 공정을 설계하고 2024년 9월 국내 최초로 울산에 150억 원을 들여 전용 생산 라인을 갖췄다. 폐식용유를 중국·인도 등에서 들여와 연간 10만 톤 수준의 5% SAF를 만들고 있다. 이 SAF는 유럽·캐세이퍼시픽항공·에어부산·대한항공 등에 보내진다.

정호승 SK이노베이션 지속가능Fuel 기술팀 팀장은 ""바이오원료를 섞으면 불순물 종류나 함량, 촉매 반응 결과, 저장 안정성 등이 달라져 R&D가 필요했다""며 ""바이오원료의 저장, 반응, 제품 생산까지 밸류 체인을 단계별로 연구했고 생길 수 있는 문제의 해법을 만들어 대량생산을 해냈다""고 설명했다.

에쓰오일·HD현대오일뱅크·GS칼텍스 등 다른 정유사들도 기존 생산 설비에서 코 프로세싱 공정으로 SAF를 만들어 국내외로 판매 중이다.

시장 커지는데 국산 100% SAF 생산은 언제쯤

탄소중립 움직임에 발맞춰 SAF 시장은 연 평균 46.2%씩 크게 성장해 2034년 746억 달러(108조 9,600억 원) 규모가 될 것이란 예측이 나온다. 특히 유엔 산하 국제민간항공기구(ICAO)의 국제항공 탄소상쇄·감축제도(CORSIA) 의무화에 따라 2027년부터 한국 등 193개 회원국은 국제 항공 온실가스 배출량을 2019년의 85%로 줄여야만 해 SAF가 필수적이다.

유럽연합(EU)은 올해 의무 비율을 2%로 시작해 2050년에는 70%까지 올린단 계획이다. 미국은 2050년까지 항공유 전체를 SAF로 대체한다는 목표다. 아시아에서는 일본이 2030년부터 10% 의무화를 로드맵을 발표했다.

업계에서는 전통 항공유 수출 1위 국가인 한국이 100% SAF 생산 설비를 갖추는 등 시장 경쟁력을 키워야 한다는 목소리가 나온다. 하지만 정유사들은 조 단위 투자가 필요해 적극 뛰어들기를 망설인다. 정부 지원이 필요하다는 얘기가 나오는 이유다. 일본은 석유화학기업인 이데미쓰고산의 생산 설비에 2,570억 원을 투입하고 생산 세액 공제 제도도 마련했다.",https://newsimg-hams.hankookilbo.com/2025/04/10/f701202c-6bab-438a-a4bf-2ef6b5ff09c3.jpeg,N,,2025-04-13 11:58:06.192737

Stephen Murphy, CEO of AV AirFinance, said: “We are delighted to be a long-term strategic partner of Vietjet. This new commitment reflects our strong relationship and willingness to support Vietjet’s resurgent growth in the Asia-Pacific region via new generation aircraft.”

In 2025, Vietjet will begin taking delivery of the first batch of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft from its landmark order of 200 aircraft, valued at over US$24 billion. The deal was originally announced on February 27, 2019, in Vietnam, in the presence of U.S. President Donald Trump. As part of its global growth strategy, the airline is currently in discussions to further expand this historic order.

In addition to its collaboration with Boeing, Vietjet has established long-term strategic partnerships with several major U.S. corporations, including GE, Pratt & Whitney, and Honeywell, with total contract values reaching approximately US$50 billion. Ongoing negotiations are expected to add a further US$14 billion. Notably, Vietjet’s engine and technical service agreements with GE and Pratt & Whitney alone now exceed a combined value of US$10 billion. The airline is also deepening its technology partnerships with leading U.S. firms such as Microsoft, Apple, and Google, while exploring collaboration with SpaceX to integrate advanced technologies across its fleet. These high-value contracts are poised to contribute significantly to reducing the trade imbalance between Vietnam and the United States in the near future.

Dr. Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao, Chairwoman of Vietjet, congratulated the signing event and affirmed: “I am steadfast in my commitment to working tirelessly and fostering global partnerships that help bridge cultures, economies, and technologies between Vietnam, the United States, and the wider world.”

With a strategic focus on developing a modern fleet and a global flight network, Vietjet currently operates a fleet of over 115 new, fuel-efficient aircraft, with more than 400 additional aircraft on order.

Sustainability Drives Fleet Strategy Norwegian's decision to focus solely on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is primarily driven by sustainability goals.
That goal assumes the entire fleet is composed of MAX 8s, thanks to the model’s lower fuel consumption and emissions.
Despite slower deliveries, the fleet upgrade remains on track, with the MAX 8s gradually replacing older 737-800 NGs, the carrier said.
The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order.","As spotted by ch-aviation, Norwegian Air has announced plans to transition to an all- Boeing 737 MAX 8 fleet by 2030, according to its 2024 annual report released on April 10. The low-cost airline aims to meet its climate goal of reducing CO₂ emissions by 45 percent by that year, a target that hinges on using a fleet of exclusively MAX 8 aircraft powered by a 20 percent blend of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). The 737 MAX 8s are an important part of Norwegian's long-term sustainability and cost-cutting plan since they are more fuel-efficient than the older 737-800 NGs that are already in service.

The shift to a single aircraft type supports operational efficiency, environmental performance, and financial flexibility, the carrier said. Norwegian began ordering the MAX 8s in 2022, with 50 aircraft on the way between 2025 and 2028 and options for 30 more, according to the report. The transition marks a move toward owning more of its fleet rather than leasing, which helps lower costs over time. The airline says SAF and fleet modernization are critical to reaching climate goals, assuming an 80% reduction in life-cycle emissions from SAF.

Sustainability Drives Fleet Strategy

Norwegian's decision to focus solely on the Boeing 737 MAX 8 is primarily driven by sustainability goals. According to the airline's annual report, ""Norwegian's 737 aircraft can fly on up to 50 percent certified SAF today,"" with a 20 percent blend needed to meet its 2030 emission reduction target. That goal assumes the entire fleet is composed of MAX 8s, thanks to the model’s lower fuel consumption and emissions.

These planes are equipped with advanced LEAP-1B engines and winglets that significantly improve fuel efficiency compared to older models, according to Norwegian's website. The B737 MAX 8 also offers Norwegian operational benefits such as lower fuel costs, better environmental performance, and improved passenger experience.

In response to Simple Flying's inquiry, the airline referred inquiries back to the investor relations webpages for additional details.

Fleet Expansion Slows Due To Boeing Delays

While Norwegian is committed to growing its fleet, delivery delays from Boeing have impacted short-term expansion plans. The airline now expects to operate 88 aircraft by summer 2025, slightly below its earlier estimate of 90, according to FlightGlobal. Despite this, CEO Geir Karlsen remains optimistic, noting that three new MAX 8s have already been delivered this year, and production rates appear to be improving.

""We do anticipate to take delivery of 11 to 13 aircraft during 2025,"" Karlsen said in a recent earnings call in February, which would bring the total fleet size to between 94 and 96 aircraft by the end of the year. Most of the MAX 8s are set to replace older Boeing 737-800 NGs, which currently make up the majority of Norwegian's mainline fleet.

Karlsen has stated that the production rate at Boeing is improving, allowing Norwegian to better plan for the peak travel season. Despite slower deliveries, the fleet upgrade remains on track, with the MAX 8s gradually replacing older 737-800 NGs, the carrier said.

Financial Stability Supports Long-Term Goals

In Q1 2025, Norwegian acquired 10 Boeing 737-800s previously on lease, furthering its plan to own more of its aircraft, according to the annual report. The company noted it secured the best financing terms in its history for the first 25 MAX 8s on order. Even with capacity growth slowing to 4 percent in 2025, compared to 13 percent the year before, Norwegian is prioritizing profitability and fleet efficiency over rapid expansion. A profitability program is also underway to manage rising costs, currency impacts, and prepare for the future.

With an operational profit of NOK 1.87 billion in 2024, the second-highest in the company's history, Norwegian maintained a strong financial position.

US President Donald Trump tariffs are now threatening to significantly impact the premium inflight offerings of major U.S. carriers, Delta and United Airlines. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, including luxury French Champagne, passengers flying in premium cabins may soon find that their favorite bubbles are no longer available at 35,000 feet. Both airlines, known for their investment in high-end passenger experiences, have long relied on prestigious French Champagne to elevate their service in business and first class. This shift in policy could redefine luxury travel for high-end passengers, forcing airlines to reassess their premium service offerings.

Delta and United Airlines have cultivated their reputation by offering premium products, such as Taittinger Brut Reserve and Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée, to attract affluent travelers. These signature brands have helped distinguish these carriers in a competitive market, where service quality is paramount. However, the proposed tariffs threaten to increase costs, potentially forcing both airlines to swap these renowned labels for more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines. If the tariffs proceed as planned, this could alter the premium travel landscape, challenging the airlines’ ability to maintain the luxury experience that high-end travelers expect.

Delta Air Lines (DL) and United Airlines (UA), two of the largest US carriers, are facing a challenge to their premium inflight service offerings, specifically regarding the high-end Champagne served in their business and first-class cabins. With the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European imports, including luxury French Champagne, Delta and United might be forced to rethink their inflight beverage offerings. These tariffs, which initially set at 20% before being temporarily paused, have raised significant concerns in the aviation industry. For airlines that have invested heavily in their premium cabins to attract affluent international travelers, the tariff-induced price increases could threaten partnerships with prestigious Champagne houses and undermine the luxury experience they offer to premium passengers.

Impact of Trump’s Tariffs on Luxury Inflight Offerings

The tariffs on French wines, including Champagne, come as part of the broader economic policies promoted by the Trump administration, which seeks to reduce dependence on foreign imports while boosting domestic production. However, these tariffs threaten to disrupt one of the key selling points for premium cabins on international flights — luxurious inflight dining experiences. For Delta and United, whose business models rely on offering an upscale experience to attract high-value international travelers, the removal of premium Champagne could affect their competitive positioning.

In February 2025, Delta introduced Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in its Delta One cabins, and United Airlines followed suit in January 2025 with Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in its Polaris Business Class. These Champagne selections are associated with European sophistication and elegance, helping to differentiate these airlines from their competitors in a highly competitive market. Emirates, Singapore Airlines, and Qatar Airways, all major players in the luxury travel segment, have long been known for their exceptional inflight service, including fine wines and Champagne. By serving renowned French Champagne, Delta and United positioned themselves as rivals in the luxury market, catering to travelers who value exclusive in-flight experiences.

Tariffs on European Goods and Potential Consequences

The tariff proposals, which initially imposed a 20% duty on European products, threaten the very foundation of the high-end service that both airlines have worked to develop. Although the 20% tariff was paused for 90 days, a potential 10% tariff remains a significant concern. If the tariffs move forward as planned, Delta and United may face cost increases on the French Champagne they serve, which could lead to substantial financial strain. These price hikes may force the airlines to reconsider their premium drink offerings, particularly as they balance profitability with customer satisfaction.

Airlines like Delta and United may have negotiated favorable deals with Champagne producers in the past, securing reduced prices in exchange for brand exposure to affluent passengers. However, the introduction of tariffs could unravel these partnerships, as the price increase would make it difficult for the airlines to absorb the added cost. As the cost of serving luxury French Champagne rises, the airlines may look to more cost-effective alternatives, such as domestic sparkling wines from California’s Napa Valley. While wineries like Schramsberg and Domaine Carneros produce high-quality sparkling wines, they lack the same global recognition and allure as prestigious Champagne brands like Taittinger and Laurent-Perrier.

Luxury Inflight Service and Airline Competitiveness

The decision to serve premium Champagne is not simply a matter of taste; it is a critical differentiator for airlines looking to attract premium-paying customers. Business and first-class passengers are not just paying for a seat; they are purchasing an experience. The inclusion of French Champagne has long been seen as a symbol of luxury, class, and international sophistication. In a crowded marketplace where airlines compete to offer the best service, losing such a signature luxury offering could diminish the perceived value of an airline’s premium cabins.

For Delta and United, the stakes are particularly high. Both airlines have made significant investments in their premium services in recent years, hoping to capture more of the lucrative international business market. Delta’s Taittinger Brut Reserve and United’s Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée have been central to their efforts to create a luxurious, world-class inflight experience. However, with the tariffs in place, the airlines may be forced to reduce their focus on high-end, international luxury, shifting towards more affordable domestic products. This shift could dilute the premium experience, impacting brand perception and potentially alienating loyal passengers who expect top-tier offerings.

Economic Impact and Cost-Cutting Measures

Delta and United Airlines are already grappling with cost-cutting measures due to softer demand for domestic travel. The broader economic environment, marked by inflation and changing consumer behavior, has created additional pressure on airlines to remain profitable while maintaining their premium services. Although international premium travel remains relatively stable, the uncertainty in global economic conditions has led both carriers to assess their inflight offerings carefully.

A major concern for both airlines is the broader impact of the tariffs on inbound international traffic. In recent months, data has shown a significant decline in the number of visitors to the United States, with a 17% decrease in visitors from Western Europe in March 2025 compared to the previous year. This reduction in inbound travel, coupled with high tariff costs, could make it more difficult for airlines to maintain profitability on their international routes, particularly in premium cabins.

For United, the situation is even more pressing. The airline is expected to release its Q1 financial results soon, which will shed more light on how tariffs and changing travel patterns are impacting revenue from its high-margin Polaris business-class product. With fewer international passengers traveling to the US and higher operational costs, airlines may need to rethink their pricing strategies and make tough decisions about how to balance luxury service with financial sustainability.

Policy Impacts on Airline Strategy

The Trump administration’s policy of imposing tariffs on European goods, including Champagne, could have long-lasting consequences on the competitive positioning of US airlines. Premium cabin passengers—corporate travelers, frequent flyers, and affluent tourists—are often willing to pay a premium for the added luxury and comfort of international flights. By removing the prestige of French Champagne from inflight service, US carriers like Delta and United risk losing a key differentiating feature in a market where Middle Eastern and Asian carriers offer unparalleled luxury experiences.

In this context, the tariffs are not just an economic issue but a branding challenge for US airlines. For Delta and United, the presence of luxury French Champagne is part of their strategy to appeal to high-spending international travelers who expect top-tier service. Removing these signature items could lead to a decline in brand perception, especially among travelers accustomed to exceptional service and luxury offerings. Without these distinctive touches, these airlines may find it harder to justify their premium fares, particularly on international routes where competition is fierce.

Looking Ahead: Strategic Decisions for Delta and United Airlines

As both Delta and United evaluate the impact of the Trump administration’s tariffs, they face a strategic dilemma: should they absorb the cost increases associated with tariffs or redefine luxury for the post-tariff era? The future of luxury inflight service hinges on how airlines choose to respond to these challenges. While serving domestic sparkling wines may be a viable cost-saving solution, it is uncertain whether it will meet the expectations of discerning passengers who value European sophistication.

In the coming months, both airlines will likely need to make critical decisions about how to balance the cost of premium products with the overall luxury experience they offer. The tariffs have forced airlines to reevaluate their offerings and adjust to a new economic reality. As Delta and United adapt, they must continue to innovate and offer an exceptional travel experience to retain their competitive edge in the global aviation market.

Conclusion

The proposed Trump tariffs on European goods present a significant challenge to the luxury inflight offerings of Delta and United Airlines. With the potential removal of premium French Champagne from business and first-class cabins, these airlines face tough choices regarding how to maintain their competitive edge in the premium travel market. As they navigate these challenges, their ability to balance cost-efficiency with luxury service will be critical to maintaining their standing in the global aviation sector. The coming months will be crucial as these carriers evaluate how to adapt to a post-tariff world and continue to attract high-value passengers.

Delta Airlines and United Airlines: A Comparative Analysis of Two Aviation Giants

Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two of the largest and most influential carriers in the global aviation industry. With extensive networks, a focus on premium services, and a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, these airlines have shaped the evolution of modern air travel. However, despite their shared prominence, Delta and United have followed distinct strategies to maintain and grow their businesses, especially in an increasingly competitive landscape marked by economic challenges, changing consumer preferences, and evolving industry regulations.

Delta Airlines: A Focus on Customer Experience and Operational Excellence

Delta Air Lines, headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, has long been recognized for its operational excellence and customer-centric approach. The airline, which traces its origins back to 1924, has consistently ranked highly in terms of customer satisfaction and service reliability. Delta operates a massive domestic network, but its international reach is also impressive, with key hubs in cities like New York (JFK), Los Angeles (LAX), and Atlanta (ATL).

One of the cornerstones of Delta’s strategy is its focus on improving the passenger experience. The airline has made substantial investments in its fleet, with modern aircraft featuring advanced amenities such as larger cabins, more comfortable seating, and in-flight entertainment. Delta’s premium services, particularly in its Delta One business class, have been key to attracting high-value international passengers. For example, the recent introduction of Taittinger Brut Reserve Champagne in Delta One is a testament to the airline’s commitment to offering a premium travel experience for its business-class customers.

Delta has also been a leader in customer loyalty programs, particularly with its SkyMiles program. By offering a wide range of benefits for frequent flyers, such as access to exclusive lounges and priority boarding, Delta has solidified a loyal customer base. Additionally, the airline has focused on improving its operational efficiency, with a strong emphasis on on-time performance, a critical factor in maintaining customer satisfaction.

In terms of sustainability, Delta has set ambitious goals, including a pledge to become carbon neutral by 2030. The airline has invested in more fuel-efficient aircraft, adopted sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) initiatives, and implemented various eco-friendly practices within its operations.

United Airlines: Global Expansion and Market Leadership

United Airlines, based in Chicago, Illinois, is another aviation powerhouse with an extensive global network. Like Delta, United has deep roots in the American aviation industry, tracing its origins to 1926. However, United’s approach to growth has often been more focused on strategic alliances and global expansion.

One of the major strengths of United Airlines is its international network. The airline operates more transatlantic flights than any other US carrier, with key hubs in Chicago (ORD), Newark (EWR), and San Francisco (SFO). United’s presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has been bolstered through numerous codeshare agreements and partnerships, such as those with Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. This global reach makes United a strong contender in the international market, particularly among corporate travelers and international tourists.

United’s premium cabin, Polaris Business Class, is another area where the airline has worked to compete with top-tier carriers. The introduction of high-end Champagne like Laurent-Perrier La Cuvée in Polaris was a key move to attract luxury travelers and set the airline apart from its competitors. This premium service, paired with newly designed cabins featuring flat-bed seats, luxury bedding, and state-of-the-art entertainment options, has been a significant part of United’s strategy to regain market share in the lucrative international business class market.

United Airlines also places a strong emphasis on technology and innovation. The airline was one of the first to integrate mobile check-ins, in-flight Wi-Fi, and biometric screening at select airports. United’s commitment to improving its digital infrastructure and providing more convenience for passengers has made it a leader in the tech-driven transformation of the airline industry.

In terms of environmental initiatives, United has been a vocal advocate for sustainability. The airline has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 50% by 2050 and has made significant investments in fuel-efficient aircraft and sustainable aviation fuel. United also partners with various sustainability-focused organizations to explore alternative technologies, such as electric aircraft.

Challenges Faced by Both Airlines

While Delta and United have been successful in many areas, both airlines face their own unique set of challenges. The aviation industry as a whole is dealing with rising fuel costs, fluctuating demand for air travel, and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For Delta, the challenge lies in balancing its premium service offerings with cost-cutting measures in response to economic uncertainty. Similarly, United has had to contend with its reputation for service reliability, as issues with delayed flights and overbooked planes have occasionally tarnished its customer service record.

Moreover, both airlines are facing the fallout from the Trump administration’s proposed tariffs on European goods, which threaten to disrupt the premium service they offer, including the possibility of removing luxury French Champagne from inflight menus. These tariff-induced price increases could force both airlines to reconsider their premium offerings, particularly in business and first-class cabins, where luxury and high-end service are key to attracting affluent travelers.

The Future: A Competitive and Evolving Industry

As the airline industry continues to recover and evolve, Delta and United will need to adapt to the changing demands of passengers and the realities of global competition. Both airlines are working hard to maintain their strong positions in the market, with a focus on premium service offerings, digital innovation, sustainability, and global expansion. Their success will depend on how well they navigate challenges such as rising costs, shifting consumer preferences, and new regulations.

In the coming years, Delta and United will need to focus on retaining their premium customers while attracting new ones. For Delta, continuing to invest in customer service and loyalty programs will be crucial. For United, its global expansion and tech innovations will be key to sustaining its competitive advantage. Both airlines will also need to place a greater emphasis on sustainability, both to meet environmental goals and to appeal to increasingly eco-conscious travelers.

In conclusion, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are two giants in the aviation industry, each with its own strengths and strategies. While Delta focuses heavily on customer experience and operational excellence, United has carved out a competitive edge with its global reach and technological advancements. As the airline industry faces continued challenges and transformation, both carriers are likely to play a critical role in shaping the future of global air travel.

In recent years, private air travel has experienced a striking surge in demand. Once viewed as an exclusive luxury for celebrities and top executives, private aviation is now more accessible and appealing to a broader audience of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. One major development is the notable increase in interest in private jets for sale, as more travelers decide to invest in ownership rather than rely on chartering.

The shift from renting to owning is being driven by multiple factors, including changing perceptions of luxury travel, concerns over health and convenience, and the increasing ease of finding planes for sale through trusted online platforms. These changes have transformed how people approach private aviation, making it a functional, cost-effective solution instead of a mere status symbol.

A Pandemic-Driven Shift in Travel Habits

The COVID-19 pandemic acted as a significant turning point in the private aviation industry. With global travel restrictions and mounting health concerns, many travelers who had never flown privately began exploring safer, more flexible alternatives to commercial airlines. Private jets offered a controlled environment, personalized service, and the ability to avoid crowded airports—attributes that quickly attracted a new wave of users.

While many of these users initially opted to rent or charter jets, their experiences often revealed limitations such as scheduling issues, high seasonal demand, and limited customization. This exposure planted the seeds for long-term commitment to private travel, leading many to explore ownership opportunities.

Ownership as a Smart Investment

One of the most compelling reasons people are purchasing private jets today is the realization that ownership is often more practical and financially sound in the long run—especially for frequent travelers. Owning an aircraft eliminates the recurring costs of rentals, gives complete scheduling freedom, and adds a layer of flexibility that’s hard to match with charter services.

For businesses, the time saved and productivity gained from seamless air travel justifies the initial investment. Executives can travel between multiple cities or countries in one day, conduct meetings in privacy, and remain productive throughout. Jet ownership is increasingly seen as an essential tool for business efficiency rather than an extravagant expense.

Personalization and Prestige

Owning a private jet offers unmatched customization. From cabin layout and interior design to in-flight menus and entertainment, owners can curate every detail of their flying experience. This level of control and consistency is impossible to achieve with rented jets, which often vary in quality and features.

Beyond the practical benefits, ownership also carries a strong sense of prestige. For many affluent individuals and companies, having a branded aircraft reflects their success, attention to quality, and commitment to excellence.

Supply Chain and Aircraft Availability

Another trend fueling the increase in purchases is the tightening supply of charter jets and growing backlogs with manufacturers. As more buyers enter the market, demand is outpacing supply, especially for popular aircraft models. Pre-owned jets are selling faster than ever, often within days of being listed.

This urgency has led prospective buyers to act quickly and decisively. Many are turning to digital marketplaces where they can easily compare prices, configurations, and specifications, allowing for informed purchases with minimal delays.

Global Wealth and New Buyers

The world is witnessing a significant expansion of global wealth. New millionaires and billionaires are emerging not just from traditional financial hubs like the U.S. and Europe, but also from fast-growing economies in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. These buyers, particularly younger entrepreneurs and tech-savvy investors, are bringing new energy into the private aviation space.

Unlike older generations who may have preferred renting, these younger buyers are more inclined toward ownership, driven by a combination of practical needs and lifestyle aspirations. For them, having a private jet is not just about luxury—it’s about control, flexibility, and being able to operate on their own terms.

Evolving Business Needs

Companies are also becoming major players in the private jet ownership boom. In a competitive global marketplace, time-sensitive decisions often require face-to-face meetings, sometimes in remote or underserved areas where commercial flights are limited. Private jets allow teams to travel efficiently and execute deals faster, helping businesses maintain an edge.

Moreover, many organizations are now viewing private aircraft as a strategic asset. Aircraft management services have made ownership easier than ever by handling maintenance, staffing, logistics, and compliance, making it a turnkey experience for busy professionals.

A Greener Future for Private Aviation

Sustainability concerns are beginning to shape private aviation as well. Newer aircraft models are more fuel-efficient and compatible with sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Environmental responsibility, once a concern for critics of private flying, is becoming a focal point for manufacturers and owners alike.

Tech innovation is also leading to developments in hybrid and electric propulsion, suggesting a future where private jet travel could be both luxurious and eco-conscious. Buyers today are more informed and are selecting jets with better emissions profiles, advanced avionics, and quieter engines.

Final Thoughts: The Future of Jet Ownership

The increase in private jet ownership marks a significant evolution in how people view air travel. What was once reserved for the elite few is now a realistic option for a wider group of high-net-worth individuals and businesses. With safety, convenience, efficiency, and control being top priorities, ownership delivers where renting often falls short.

As platforms continue to make the acquisition process more accessible and options easier to compare, the private aviation market is only expected to grow. Buyers are no longer simply investing in a mode of transportation—they’re investing in autonomy, opportunity, and an enhanced way of life.

Whether it’s the dream of avoiding commercial airport chaos, building a personalized luxury travel experience, or maximizing business potential, private jet ownership offers unmatched value. The sky isn’t the limit—it’s just the beginning.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte.

La solution la plus rapide serait d’utiliser du carburant vert compatible avec les moteurs actuels mais qui émettent moins de CO2.
Imed Dérouiche","L’enjeu est de taille avec un choix cornélien qui prévaut : Faut se soucier du développement du tourisme avec son impact sur l’économie et les emplois ou se préoccuper de l’ampleur du trafic aérien avec la multiplication des vols et les conséquences sur le climat et l’environnement ? Peut-on concilier essor touristique et préservation écologique ? Existe-il une alternative à l’avion, moyen de transport énergivore et extrêmement polluant ?

Autant de questions qui interpellent les climatologues qui prônent un SAF avec des carburants d’aviation durables et les acteurs du tourisme mondial dont le transport aérien est un pilier incontournable et indispensable pour la pérennité et le développement de l’activité.

Entre les détracteurs du transport aérien et ses farouches défenseurs, la guerre des arguments est ouverte. Et si les premiers avancent l’empreinte carbone élevée du transport aérien comme argument irréfutable de sa grande pollution, les climato sceptiques rétorquent que le calcul de l’empreinte carbone est calculée sur la base d’un trajet d’un point A à un point B sans pour autant tenir compte du nombre de passagers. L’empreinte carbone ne doit pas être calculée sur la base d’un avion mais sur la base de nombre de passagers.

L’équation est certes, inextricable mathématiquement entre un développement croissant du transport aérien avec ses répercussions économiques d’un côté et les aspirations écologiques et environnementales qui appellent à une taxation de l’aérien pour réduire le trafic, décongestionner les autoroutes du ciel et purifier la planète.

La tendance générale est à un allégement du trafic aérien et d’ailleurs plusieurs propositions sont à l’étude comme celle de l’ONU qui préconise de réduire de 20 % le trafic aérien afin de diminuer les émissions de CO2 ou de certaines ONG écologistes qui proposent une sur–taxation du transport aérien avec pour conséquence immédiate une augmentation exponentielle du prix des billets d’avion et la disparition de facto des compagnies Low-Cost qui ont, certes démocratisé les voyages mais aussi et surtout augmenté le trafic et par conséquent l’émanation de CO2.

La mobilité aérienne risque de devenir inaccessible et j’invite les amoureux des découvertes à faire le plein des voyages avant 2030 car au-delà de cette date, nous allons avoir une flambée des prix et une disparition pure et simple des compagnies Low-cost qui vont se transformer en High -cost exclusives à une niche comme ce fut le cas dans les années 70.

L’autre conséquence de cette tendance verte du transport aérien est l’impact sur le tourisme et j’appelle les professionnels du secteur à anticiper avec une refonte totale de la stratégie réceptive et au modèle économique car avec des prix d’avion élevés, le tourisme de masse et l’hôtellerie simple ne seront plus viables et l’alternative serait un tourisme de qualité basé sur l’excellence du service, la qualité des prestations, les découvertes patrimoniales et culturelles et l’aventure.

Pour atténuer l’empreinte carbone de cette mobilité aérienne, les alternatives au kérosène paraissent complexes et difficile à atteindre car électrifier les moteurs des avions est domaine de l’impossible à l’heure actuelle et les remplacer demanderait des années de recherche et de développement. La solution la plus rapide serait d’utiliser du carburant vert compatible avec les moteurs actuels mais qui émettent moins de CO2.

Et parmi ces carburant l’alternatif , le SAF ( Sustainable Aviation Fuel) et j’appelle les avionneurs et compagnies aériennes à opter pour ce carburant dont l’avantage est double : il est issu de matières premières renouvelables comme l’huile de cuisson, résidus de biomasse, déchets agricoles et algues et il ne nécessite pas un changement ou une transformation de moteur et d’ailleurs la compagnie Virgin qui s’est inscrite dans le programme SAF a réalisé un vol transatlantique New-York-Londres 100% SAF pour montrer l’exemple et en faire des émules même si la production de ce fuel propre soit encore limitée et incapable de répondre aux besoins des compagnies.

Le eSAF pourrait à mon avis représenter une opportunité pour la Tunisie, si nous décidons d’en créer une unité pour fournir tous nos Aéroports et ceux de nos voisins pour en faire un Hub du carburant Vert comme point de ravitaillement pour notre compagnie aérienne et les compagnies étrangères qui desservent nos aéroports et aussi comme fer de lance pour notre tourisme qui pourrait se prévaloir du Label Vert.

Tout est réuni pour faire de la Tunisie le Hub du eSAF avec comme point d’ancrage la transformation de la raffinerie STIR de Bizerte dont les équipements sont obsolètes avec un rendement insuffisant qui entrave ses équilibres financiers, en une unité de production de Green Fuel qui pourrait générer des millions de Dollars de bénéfices et servir comme exemple de l’engagement de la Tunisie pour l’environnement et une planète verte.

Ainsi le eSAF parait la réponse idoine à cette équation inextricable et une réponse à ce choix cornélien entre liberté de mouvement, démocratisation des voyages et préservation de la planète en offrant à la fois cette latitude de se déplacer librement, ce besoin de se développer, cette appétence à de nouvelles aspirations et ce droit inaliénable de l’humanité à un environnement sain et propre.

Via dit ‘frequent flyer’-programma sparen reizigers met elke vliegreis punten, die vervolgens kunnen worden ingeruild voor kortingen of extra’s. Het spaarprogramma, dat populair is onder zakelijke reizigers, beloont ‘veelvliegen’ en is volgens de actievoerders daarom ‘hét symbool van een industrie die weigert de klimaatontwrichting onder ogen te zien’.

Exctinction Rebellion kreeg toestemming om te demonstreren voor de deur van Schiphol, een van de grootste luchthavens van Europa. Desalniettemin betraden tientallen activisten de terminal. Dat deden ze naar eigen zeggen met een vliegticket dat zij konden annuleren en waarvan de boardingpass meermaals kon worden gescand. Daardoor konden meerdere activisten op één ticket de vertrekhal in, de ruimte achter de paspoortcontrole. Daar demonstreerden ze onder meer bij de KLM-lounge.

Gebiedsverbod

Schiphol wil uit veiligheidsoverwegingen niets zeggen over het voorval. Ook zegt het niet hoeveel activisten destijds zijn binnengekomen. Wel stelt de luchthaven dat de beveiliging inmiddels is aangescherpt. De koninklijke marechaussee, die de orde handhaaft op de luchthaven, hield uiteindelijk 67 mensen aan. Dat waren activisten die waren gevraagd om de luchthaven te verlaten, maar dit weigerden.

Uiteindelijk werd aan 38 activisten een gebiedsverbod opgelegd. Dat bevestigt een Schiphol-woordvoerder na publicatie van een opiniestuk in Het Parool, waarin de activisten de maatregel hekelen. Sommigen kregen een verbod van 5 jaar opgelegd, anderen kregen een verbod van 10 jaar aan de broek, omdat zij ‘meerdere andere personen zouden hebben geholpen om ongeoorloofd toegang te krijgen’.

Het gebiedsverbod komt de facto neer op een vliegverbod vanaf de luchthaven, omdat activisten niet langer de terminal mogen betreden. Wel mogen ze nog op het plein voor Schiphol en op Schiphol Plaza komen, het publiek toegankelijke winkelcentrum van de luchthaven.

Demonstratierecht

Extinction Rebellion noemt de straf in het opiniestuk bij monde van Simone Wiegman een ‘gevaarlijke onderdrukking van het demonstratierecht en een disproportionele beperking van de bewegingsvrijheid’. Wiegman is oud KLM-werknemer en nu klimaatactivist. ‘Het demonstratierecht houdt in dat je mag demonstreren op een afstand binnen zicht en gehoor van het onderwerp van je demonstratie, ook wanneer dat zich op privéterrein bevindt. In dit geval is de Frequent Flyer Lounge – waar KLM ‘elite’-passagiers die veel vliegen verwent met gratis hapjes en drankjes – de meest logische plek om te demonstreren.’

De klimaatclub noemt de maatregel disproportioneel, maar daar is Schiphol het niet mee eens. ‘Je demonstreert in beveiligd gebied, en dat is niet de bedoeling. Je overtreedt de huisregels, en als je geen eigen ticket hebt ook gewoon de wet.’ De luchthavenwoordvoerder kon zaterdagmiddag niet zeggen of activisten nog in beroep kunnen gaan tegen het verbod.

Gratis tickets

Exctinction Rebellion zegt een advocaat in de arm te nemen, maar liever ziet de organisatie dat de luchthaven zich bedenkt. ‘Het zou Schiphol sieren als het de toegangsverboden intrekt en in plaats daarvan de huurcontracten van de KLM-lounges opzegt.’",https://image.volkskrant.nl/208214966/feature-crop/1200/630/een-blokkade-van-extinction-rebellion-voor-de-centrale-ingang,N,,2025-04-12 12:57:51.255316

Elles demandent à revoir ces contraintes en avançant le coût élevé de ces fuels durables et leur disponibilité aléatoire. Ce que contestent les producteurs.

Comme certains constructeurs automobiles, le monde de l’aérien cherche à revoir les obligations environnementales qui le touchent. Depuis cette année, une directive européenne, ReFuelEU, oblige les fournisseurs de carburant à distribuer du kérosène contenant au moins 2% de carburant durable, ou SAF (sustainable aviation fuel), pour tous les vols partant de l’UE.

La directive prévoit une proportion de 6% en 2030, et de 70% en 2050. En outre, elle impose qu’une part minimale de 1,2% de carburant de synthèse, ou e-fuel, fabriqué au départ d’hydrogène produit avec de l’électricité renouvelable, soit incorporée à partir de 2030, pour monter à 35% en 2050.

Pas d’autres solutions que les carburants durables

Les carburants durables sont la seule manière de réduire les émissions des vols. Avec l’achat d’avions de dernière génération dont les émissions peuvent être 15% inférieures à celles d’avions plus anciens. Les projets de vols électriques, avec des batteries ou via la production d’électricité au moyen d’hydrogène, sont lointains et improbables. Les autres solutions consistent à restreindre fortement les vols.

Les avions représentent environ 5% des émissions globales de CO2, un niveau qui pourrait doubler d’ici 2050.

Si l’on en croit les déclarations des compagnies aériennes et des aéroports, de grands efforts sont fournis. Ryanair multiplie les communiqués sur les achats de carburants durables. En janvier dernier, la compagnie Wizzair et l’aéroport de Charleroi conviaient la presse pour parler des vols recourant à ces carburants au départ de Gosselies. Déjà, en janvier 2023, Brussels Airport et Brussels Airlines avaient annoncé la première livraison de carburant SAF via un pipeline de l’Otan.

En coulisse, les transporteurs sont plus réticents. Ils avancent que l’offre est insuffisante et les prix trop chers. Le carburant SAF à base de biocarburant coûte 2,5 fois le prix du kérosène. Les carburants synthétiques, qui ne sont pas encore produits industriellement, pourraient arriver à 10 fois.

“La Commission européenne et les États membres doivent désormais prendre leurs responsabilités : les fournisseurs de carburants ne tiennent pas leurs engagements, écrit l’association A4E. Sans action urgente dans les mois à venir, la crédibilité du mandat sera gravement compromise, et une réévaluation des mandats sera nécessaire.” Soit, en fait, une révision des obligations imposées par la directive ReFuelEU. L’A4E met en avant une étude du Boston Consulting Group qui parle d’un déficit de l’offre à l’horizon 2030 (- 30% pour les SAF, – 45% pour les carburants synthétiques).

Neste regrette la timidité des compagnies

Les fournisseurs de carburants durables parlent plutôt d’une demande insuffisante, qui n’encourage pas à investir. L’an dernier, Shell a ainsi gelé un projet dans une usine qui devait produire 800.000 tonnes de SAF par an, à Rotterdam. Le raffineur finlandais Neste, champion européen des carburants durables, se plaint que la demande soit trop tiède. “La demande volontaire de SAF de la part des compagnies aériennes fixant leurs propres objectifs ou en offrant aux passagers la possibilité de payer plus pour compenser le coût supplémentaire du vol avec SAF ne s’est pas matérialisée en 2024 comme prévu, à l’exception de quelques compagnies”, explique Alexander Kueper, vice-président renewable aviation business. Neste ne réduit pas ses investissements mais traverse une période de restructuration pour devenir plus compétitif.

Les producteurs de carburants durables espéraient que les achats “volontaires” donneraient un coup de pouce à la demande et réduiraient davantage les émissions, car les 2% obligatoires cette année n’ont encore qu’un impact environnemental symbolique.

Les illusions des “green fares”

Officiellement, de nombreuses compagnies, comme Brussels Airlines, proposent un “green fare“, un supplément via lequel le passager finance l’achat volontaire de carburant SAF, en plus du minimum réglementaire. Souvent, la majorité de la somme va à une compensation d’émissions par le biais du financement de projets visant à capter du CO2 (notamment par des plantations d’arbres).

“La part de ces achats volontaires de SAF est très modeste. Quand on dissèque les accords annoncés par les compagnies, les volumes ne sont pas là”, confirme Camille Mutrelle, aviation policy officer au sein de l’ONG Transport&Environment.

Même quand une aide publique est fournie, les compagnies ne se précipitent pas forcément. Brussels Airport avait annoncé un petit budget de 1,345 million d’euros, financé par le gouvernement fédéral, pour contribuer à l’achat de carburants durables pour des vols au départ de Bruxelles. “Il n’a pas été entièrement dépensé en 2024, nous continuons à proposer l’aide cette année avec l’argent qui reste”, affirme Ihsane Chioua Lekhli, porte-parole de l’aéroport.

Transport&Environement a établi un classement des compagnies qui prend en compte les actions qu’elles accomplissent pour réduire les émissions de CO2. Ni Ryanair ni le groupe Lufthansa ne figurent dans le top 10. Le groupe le plus “vertueux” est Air France-KLM. “Leurs vols s’opèrent avec 5% de carburant durable sur la base des accords conclus”, relève Camille Mutrelle. Elle précise qu’au sein de la fédération A4E, “Ryanair et Lufthansa figurent parmi les compagnies qui sont les plus demandeuses d’un report des contraintes de la directive ReFuelEU.”

Les passagers payent des surcharges

À court terme, pourtant, les 2% de carburant SAF imposés ne représentent pas un coût énorme. Plusieurs transporteurs font payer une surcharge à leurs passagers. Le groupe Lufthansa, auquel appartient Brussels Airlines, facture, depuis janvier dernier, un supplément de 1 à 72 euros par ticket, selon la destination et la classe, à ne pas confondre avec le supplément “green fare” proposé en option. Air France-KLM facture, depuis 2022, 2 à 24 euros par ticket.

Les compagnies pensent à long terme, quand les obligations seront plus importantes et impacteront davantage le prix du billet. Le carburant constitue généralement une part substantielle des coûts, de 25% à plus de 30%.

Alors, les arguments avancés pour revoir les objectifs se multiplient. Outre le prix, il y a la difficulté à trouver des matières premières pour les biocarburants SAF. Neste, l’un des producteurs les plus importants, dément. “Il existe suffisamment de SAF disponible à l’échelle mondiale pour atteindre l’ensemble des objectifs annuels de ReFuelEU de 2025 à 2029, ainsi que suffisamment de bio-SAF pour respecter l’objectif de 6% de SAF fixé par ReFuelEU en 2030, affirme Alexander Kueper. Par exemple, la capacité de production de SAF de Neste atteindra 1,5 million de tonnes en 2025, ce qui suffirait à respecter l’objectif de 2% de SAF dans l’UE et au Royaume-Uni, estimé à environ 1,1 million de tonnes de SAF par an.”

Et Neste n’est pas le seul fournisseur. Il est même mis sous pression par la concurrence chinoise, qui propose des carburants durables moins chers. Une concurrence qui fait reculer les tarifs, sans toutefois rejoindre celui du kérosène.

“Ce qui préoccupe le plus les compagnies aériennes, ce sont les carburants synthétiques, dont l’incorporation sera obligatoire à partir de 2030”, pointe Camille Mutrelle. Leur surcoût, plus élevé que pour le biocarburant, les effraye.

“Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents”

L’experte de Transport&Environment convient, avec les compagnies aériennes, qu’il y a un souci pour les e-carburant. Qui va les produire ? “Le secteur pétrolier est aux abonnés absents, il porte une lourde responsabilité dans le manque d’investissements, ce sont surtout des start-up qui s’intéressent à ce marché en devenir, ainsi qu’Engie ou EDF”, poursuit Camille Mutrelle.

Pour produire à grande échelle, ces start-up ont besoin de contrats fermes à long terme. Mais les compagnies aériennes n’en signent guère. “Hormis IAG (British Airways), qui a signé des accords d’achat à long terme, et Norwegian. Aucune compagnie ne s’est vraiment engagée”, regrette l’aviation policy officer de T&E. Il est vrai que pour l’achat de carburant, les accords sont plutôt annuels. Les compagnies répugnent à signer des accords à long terme, à 10 ans. Avec un prix fixé, sans savoir si elles bénéficieront de la meilleure technologie.

La Commission européenne est consciente de ce problème d’œuf et de poule et cherche des solutions. Sinon, le secteur risque le même scénario que pour les voitures électriques et les batteries, les Chinois étant très actifs. “Ils ont de gros projets de production de carburants synthétiques dans le cartons”, confirme Camille Mutrelle.

Cela étant, même si des solutions étaient trouvées pour respecter les objectifs de la directive ReFuelEU, son impact resterait limité. La croissance attendue du trafic aérien, de 3,6% par an jusqu’en 2043, selon Airbus, devrait effacer les gains d’émissions qu’apporteraient les obligations d’incorporation de carburants durables, même avec l’achat d’avions dernier cri.

Pour obtenir une véritable réduction des émissions, il faudrait encore augmenter significativement la part des carburants durables, non pas la diminuer, et développer leur production. Les avions peuvent, en effet, voler avec 50% de carburant durable, sans doute davantage d’ici 10 ans…","https://img.static-rmg.be/a/view/q75/w1600/h836/f50.00,50.00/7160975/carbu-1-jpg.jpg",N,,2025-04-12 12:57:58.462086

SAS collaborates with a wide range of aviation and energy industry leaders to advocate for the widespread adoption of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), placing a special emphasis on the development of e-SAF (Electro-Sustainable Aviation Fuel).

“The shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels is not only necessary—it is essential. At SAS, we believe in driving progress through partnership and collaboration. A shared understanding of the pathway ahead is crucial for making real and lasting change while supporting the transformation of the industry,” says Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs at SAS.

E-SAF (electro-synthetic aviation fuel) is a type of fuel generated from renewable energy sources, including wind, solar, or hydropower. This fuel is considered carbon-neutral, as it releases only as much carbon as was absorbed during its production process.

The Bodø Declaration was introduced following the international SAF seminar held in Bodø on April 9–10. The seminar brought together stakeholders from various sectors, including industry leaders, researchers, NGOs, and representatives from the European Commission. The event emphasized the need for stable regulatory frameworks, secure investments, and collaborative efforts across sectors to enable a genuine transition to sustainable aviation fuels.

The declaration builds on initiatives like Project SkyPower, a letter sent to the European Commission in February 2025, spearheaded by SAS, with the support of a diverse coalition of aviation and energy professionals.

Through the Bodø e-SAF Declaration, key stakeholders — including producers, technology providers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airports, policymakers, and researchers — have come together with a shared goal: to ensure that aviation continues to fulfill its essential role in society while reducing its environmental footprint.

Strategic partnerships play a crucial role in SAS’s sustainability strategy, and the Bodø Declaration is a testament to the cross-industry collaboration needed to drive progress and meet the rapidly growing demand for sustainable aviation solutions. This commitment also traces back to November of the previous year, when SAS entered into an agreement with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport to support the production of e-SAF in Denmark. This partnership seeks to position Denmark as a leader in sustainable aviation, create jobs, and contribute to the decarbonization of the aviation sector through the Fjord PtX project — a Danish initiative aimed at producing synthetic e-SAF from renewable sources.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/b7bef76107d2829e_org-3-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 11:56:33.398976

He added: ""It is not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company is not comparable to the situation in this case.""

Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said an emergency law aimed at saving the Lincolnshire site from closure was an ""exceptional situation"".

SNP Westminster leader Stephen Flynn challenged Reynolds over similarities to the closure of the Scottish refinery on the Firth of Forth - with the loss of 400 jobs.

It came during a rare Saturday sitting of parliament to pass legislation to save the the British Steel plant, opening the door for full nationalisation.

Reynolds told the Commons: ""I understand that some have asked about precedent or referenced other troubled industrial situations.

""To be clear again, this is an exceptional situation, a unique situation.

""The question for all members is whether we as a country want to continue to possess a steel industry, do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the UK, or do we want to be dependent on overseas imports?""

Flynn asked Reynolds whether the Labour party would back a similar bill for Grangemouth.

Scotland's only oil refinery has been marked for closure by owner Petroineos

About 400 of the 2,000 jobs that are based at the industrial complex will be lost.

The Aberdeen South MP said: ""Many minds right now will be very much focused on the situation in Grangemouth, where we know that hundreds of jobs are going to be lost directly, thousands of jobs in the supply chain.

""Would the Labour Party back it in the same way as it is backing this Bill today?""

But Reynolds said the UK government had pledged £200m to secure Grangemouth's ""long-term future"".

He added: ""It is not a comparable situation and the behaviour of the company is not comparable to the situation in this case.""

A report published last month said up to 800 jobs could be created over the next 15 years at the Grangemouth site

The Project Willow study, funded jointly by the Scottish and UK governments, sets out nine areas where there are potential opportunities for green industries.

It said jobs could be created in areas like sustainable aviation fuel, hydrogen production and plastics recycling but it would require £3.5bn of private investment.

Brian Leishman, Labour MP for Alloa and Grangemouth, has also called for nationalisation of the Scottish refinery.

He told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland there were ""striking similarities between Scunthorpe and Grangemouth"".

He said: ""The government should intervene at Grangemouth to extend refinrery operations until the new energy industies of the future that we are going to need are ready.

E-SAF er et syntetisk drivstoff produsert fra fornybar elektrisitet, som vind, sol eller vannkraft. E-SAF er karbonnøytralt, da det bare slipper ut så mye karbon som ble fanget under produksjonen.

Bodø-erklæringen ble lansert etter det internasjonale SAF-seminaret i Bodø 9.–10. april, som samlet industrirepresentanter, forskere, frivillige organisasjoner og EU-kommisjonen. Arrangementet fremhevet behovet for langsiktige regulatoriske rammer, investeringssikkerhet og tverrsektorsamarbeid for å muliggjøre en troverdig overgang.

Erklæringen bygger på initiativer som Project SkyPower – et felles brev til EU-kommisjonen sendt i februar 2025, ledet av SAS og støttet av et bredt nettverk av luftfarts- og energiinteressenter.

Gjennom Bodø e-SAF-erklæringen forenes produsenter, teknologileverandører, fly- og motorprodusenter, flyplasser, beslutningstakere og forskere bak en felles ambisjon: å sikre at luftfart kan fortsette å tjene sin vitale rolle i samfunnet samtidig som den reduserer klimapåvirkningen.

Strategiske partnerskap er en vesentlig del av SAS sin bærekraftstilnærming, og Bodø-erklæringen reflekterer det tverrsektorielle samarbeidet som er nødvendig for å akselerere fremdriften og møte raskt voksende etterspørsel.

“The shift away from fossil-based aviation fuels is not only necessary—it is essential. At SAS, we believe in driving progress through partnership and collaboration. A shared understanding of the pathway ahead is crucial for making real and lasting change while supporting the transformation of the industry,” says Mads Brandstrup Nielsen, Senior Vice President Public Affairs at SAS.

E-SAF is a synthetic fuel produced from renewable electricity, such as wind, solar, or hydropower. E-SAF is carbon-neutral, as it only emits as much carbon as was captured during production.

The Bodø Declaration was launched following the international SAF seminar in Bodø on April 9–10, which brought together industry representatives, researchers, NGOs, and the European Commission. The event highlighted the need for long-term regulatory frameworks, investment security, and cross-sector collaboration to enable a credible transition.

The declaration builds on initiatives such as Project SkyPower—a joint letter to the European Commission submitted in February 2025, led by SAS and supported by a wide network of aviation and energy stakeholders.

Through the Bodø e-SAF Declaration, producers, technology providers, aircraft and engine manufacturers, airports, policymakers, and researchers unite behind a shared ambition: to ensure aviation can continue to serve its vital role in society while reducing its climate impact.

Strategic partnerships are an essential part of SAS’ sustainability approach, and the Bodø Declaration reflects the cross-sector collaboration needed to accelerate progress and meet fast-growing demand. This commitment also laid the foundation for action in November last year, when SAS signed a collaboration agreement to support Danish production of e-SAF together with Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Copenhagen Airport, and Aalborg Airport. The partnership aims to position Denmark as a leader in sustainable aviation, create jobs, and contribute to industry decarbonization through the Fjord PtX project — a Danish initiative dedicated to producing synthetic e-SAF from renewable energy.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age.
“I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.
The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation.
Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis.","When I call Blake Scholl from New York, he says it’s a shame we couldn’t have met at his office in Colorado. If only there were a supersonic jet that could cruise at 1.7 times the speed of sound, and get me there two hours quicker than the typical JFK-to-Denver route.

There soon might be. Scholl is the CEO of Boom Supersonic, a company betting that ordinary civilians want to shoot across the sky at 1,100 miles (1,700 kilometres) per hour. After the pandemic brought a slump to the skies, air travel has returned to its former levels, and in-person business events are back on track. As a faster option for these travellers, Boom is developing its breakneck jets to be operational by 2029 – nearly a quarter century after Concorde landed its last plane.

Aside from keeping the slender, pointed design, Boom distances itself from Concorde, which Scholl calls “a false start” to a supersonic age. In Boom’s revived version, its 64-seater airliners could whizz across the Atlantic in three-and-a-half hours, at least twice as fast as commercial carriers, and check off hundreds of new routes such as Madrid to Miami, or Tokyo to Seattle. They would lean into software and algorithms to tweak speed and altitude based on real-time conditions. Boom is already “a darling of the bros at Silicon Valley,” says Brian Foley, a US-based aviation industry analyst and former aerospace engineer, pointing to investors including OpenAI’s Sam Altman.

But sceptics will compare Boom to Concorde, and question whether it can overcome the list of issues that led to its predecessor’s decline, including price, demand, safety, regulation and the environment – all of which may remain stubborn barriers.

To its credit, Boom has appeared to solve one of Concorde’s major hurdles: the sonic boom, the ear-splitting thunderclap heard on the ground when an object travels through the air faster than the speed of sound. When an aeroplane moves, molecules ahead have to get out of the way; as it breaks the sound barrier, the craft catches up and drags the molecules along with it. The sudden disruption causes a shock wave, felt as a deafening roar.

Concorde couldn’t escape the boom as it flew at Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound. “When they got it wrong, it was smashing greenhouses and scaring little old ladies,” says Guy Gratton, associate professor of aviation and the environment at Cranfield University in Bedfordshire. The sheer sound forced noise regulations in Europe, and in the US an outright ban on supersonic flight in 1973, relegating Concorde to oceanic routes such as London to New York.

That isn’t enough for Boom, which wants to capture the domestic business market and fly above land at Mach 1.7. So, in quite the physics feat, Boom has eliminated the sonic boom.

It has put into practice a longstanding theory of refraction known as “Mach cutoff”, which works via the same law that makes a pencil appear to bend in a glass of water in the classic school lab experiment. As the plane flies, the sound wave refracts towards colder temperatures, curling upwards. It keeps turning upwards until it reaches space.

During two supersonic test flights in January and February, with a specially built craft a third of the proposed size, Boom demonstrated the Mach cutoff six times, without an audible boom on each occasion.

Boom’s planned aircraft, Overture, is still in early development and will be a different beast, especially because Boom is making its own engine. That’s rare in an industry where commercial craft invariably use engines from the established giants such as General Electric and Rolls-Royce. “I’m not convinced the current team assembled has the experience or depth or capability to develop a supersonic engine,” Foley says.

If they can do it, their timing is opportune. The first American-built civilian supersonic jet is likely to be welcomed by a protectionist federal administration gung-ho on US manufacture and deregulation. In the Oval Office in February, Donald Trump posed with an Overture model, and Elon Musk pledged to overturn the supersonic ban. The $600m infusion of funding from some of his billionaire peers won’t hurt.

Boom isn’t the only company developing a “quiet” supersonic aircraft. Nasa is testing its own experimental X-59 jet. And an aircraft from China’s state-owned manufacturer Comac is reportedly under way, according to a self-released paper. A patriotic aerospace race could further spur legislation. “Let’s beat ’em,” Scholl posted on X, with a US flag emoji.

But success will ultimately depend on consumer demand. The tragic crash in 2000 of an Air France Concorde catalysed its downfall, which was compounded by the downturn in air travel after 9/11. It’s unclear whether the public wants supersonic travel – or even knows of its existence. The only surveys that exist are Boom’s own (which unsurprisingly claim that 97% of passengers want it); two major aviation research firms told me there’s no real data.

Demand will be driven by affordability. “Concorde was for royalty and rock stars,” Scholl says of its $20,000 tickets in today’s money. He estimates Boom could start at $5,000 for a transatlantic flight, akin to some business-class fares. But at a time of inflation, it’s not cheap. Despite Scholl’s vision for our in-person meeting, freelance journalists are not the target market, though he says he predicts economy-level fares “for the rest of us” by the late 2030s.

Foley isn’t swayed. “This isn’t a ‘scale big’ aerospace segment,” he says. “It’s a very niche market.” Major carriers such as American and United have already put in orders for aircraft, but Foley says that’s a typical PR move for carriers to show their progressiveness. Eventually, they’ll cave to pure cost-per-seat-mile economics. The private jet market may be a better fit, but even with their participation, Foley estimates Boom would probably only sell about 300 aircraft over 10 years.

The private jet sector is routinely under fire for its poor environmental record, burning far more fuel per passenger mile. And while aviation in general accounts for 2.5% of all emissions, the industry continues to grow, leading to predictions it will double its carbon output by 2050.

Scholl says Overture will be built to be compatible with sustainable aviation fuel, and that choosing between innovative tech and the environment is a “mistaken trade-off”. The public may have different ideas. Even in the 1960s, Concorde faced eco-pushback around emerging ozone layer concerns, and advocacy from grassroots campaigns such as the Citizens League Against the Sonic Boom helped secure the bans.

Today, Gratton says it’s “irresponsible” for a supersonic jet that burns two to three times more fuel to be launched in a full-fledged climate crisis. “As an aeronautical engineer, I am absolutely thrilled with what Boom are doing,” he says. “As an environmental scientist, I’m horrified.”

“They are doing very clever work,” Gratton says. “Whether it’s a good idea that they do it – that’s the tougher question.”",https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b281431ab3b1f106c8688d789af70aeff3e8c01a/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=24d7e91e00af6514e2607fbaef3b5638,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:20.355495

And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.
But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.","Thank you, David, for that introduction.

Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the National Railway Museum in York.

I'm tempted to say we're in the country's finest transport museum, but as a Swindon MP and a former Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I feel I should tread carefully.

So welcome to ONE of the VERY BEST transport museums in the country!

It feels fitting for me to do my first big transport speech here.

The history of our transport network - the stories of the men and women who designed it, built it, operated and used it - are woven into the fabric of our communities in 21st century Britain.

And it's you - the people in THIS room - who are adding to that rich tapestry every day.

You keep life moving.

You get children to school, commuters to work, and families to their holidays.

You move the goods that stock our shelves, fuel our industries, and keep businesses thriving.

You don't just connect places - you connect people with the things that they need to get on in life.

And it's in the spirit of connection that I'd like to tell you a story.

I hope you won't be disappointed to learn that I haven't invited you here for a big policy announcement or news headline, but rather to share a little bit about who I am and what I believe.

I want to tell you a story about the people and places who have shaped my thinking.

I grew up in Swindon.

A proud railway town on the M4 corridor - a place with much to be proud of.

It's also a humble football town - and I can tell you, that as a Swindon Town supporter, I have learnt the lessons of humility all too well.

By fate and circumstance, that's where my journey began.

Outside our semi detached house, I remember my dad's first van parked up - 'Malcolm Alexander Electrical Services'.

I remember the first bike I was given - blue with a basket on the front - a bit like the blue crate I've got on my bike now.

And I remember learning to drive around the town's infamous Magic Roundabout.

And the car factories that punctuate the town's history - Rover, Honda and now, BMW.

It's fair to say that in 1980s Swindon, the car was king.

It still is.

The proliferation of out of town shopping centres, urban expansions and a minimal public transport network shaped the transport destiny of my town.

Now, I won't pretend that urban planning preoccupied my teenage mind too much.

Back then, I was much more concerned about whether Wham! were going to make it to Number 1.

But when I moved away and got my first job, I began to see the bigger picture…

… that a poor transport network will limit choices.

… that it can block the aspirations of young people.

And, most important of all, a good transport network can do precisely the opposite.

I was the first person in my family to go to university.

And like so many, I found work and opportunities in the capital.

And so it was, at the age of 29, I walked into Lewisham Town Hall as a newly elected councillor - becoming the cabinet member for regeneration just two years later.

I loved that job, and I fell in love with transport.

Now, I'll admit …

It wasn't the language of highways management that enthralled me: ""There's no such thing as a speed hump Cllr Alexander, only speed tables and speed cushions.""

But it was the extension of the East London Line, the creation of new brownfield sites around major railway stations, the improvements to walking and cycling links that really got me hooked.

I learnt quickly that transport shapes a lot more than roads and railways.

And equally important, I learnt that it takes a lot of people to shape transport itself.

At Lewisham, I saw first-hand how transport investment could make a dramatic difference to people's lives.

Take Brockley Railway Station.

For years, it was an uninspiring, inaccessible place.

Uninviting, a bit run down.

Not somewhere you'd instinctively love as you rocked up for your morning commute.

But working with local campaigners, we delivered step-free access, a stunning landscaped ramp and better connectivity along the London Overground.

Today, Brockley is thriving.

It's a place where the old and the new coexist.

The Wetherspoons on the corner and fried chicken shops sit side-by-side with bakeries, breweries and a pedestrianised square.

It was a transport scheme that built a stronger, more connected community.

And, it was transport that made the difference down the road in Lewisham too.

We transformed it - relocating and improving a bus station, moving a roundabout, redesigning the roads, creating land for new homes, new public spaces and new opportunity.

And when I say ""we"", I mean the hundreds of people from different organisations who made it happen - people like you.

When a few years later I became the Member of Parliament for Lewisham East, transport was always right at the top of the list of my constituents' concerns.

The longer train station platforms that were worse than useless without the longer trains to stop at them.

The toxic air being pumped into homes around the South Circular.

And when I later became Deputy Mayor for Transport in London, I had the privilege of working on those concerns more closely than I had ever done before.

Look, London is big.

So yes, naturally, I'm proud of the big stuff:

Straining to keep the capital moving through Covid.

Working on the Elizabeth line to deliver the jewel in the crown of the UK's rail network.

Sticking to my guns on the Silvertown Tunnel, a new river crossing that enables London's red double-deckers to go under the Thames to the east of Tower Bridge for the first time.

But honestly, big doesn't always mean beautiful.

Transport isn't just about the price tag on the project.

It's about delivering a better everyday experience - buses that come on time, accessible stations, well managed road works.

I'm just as proud of the smaller projects that made a big difference - many delivered in London by my good friend and then colleague Will Norman - segregated cycle lanes on Jamaica Road and Evelyn St, more secure cycle parking, slower speeds on roads with high KSIs, a direct vision scheme to improve visibility from the cabs of HGVs.

These were transport interventions which ultimately delivered better public health, as well as better public realm.

So when I moved back to Swindon a couple of years ago, I wasn't just carrying a dream about becoming the MP for my home town.

I arrived with baggage - determined to deliver for Swindon in a similar way to London.

Not the same solutions - as every place is different, but to give people options and opportunity.

There isn't something in the water that makes Swindonians love their cars more than Londoners.

Just a reality that public transport is better in London.

And I think it's a failure of imagination, as much as a failure of policy, that young people in Swindon don't have better options than I had decades ago.

Because change is possible.

Across the country - from Swindon to Shrewsbury, Rotherham to Peterborough - we have underused transport assets.

Unloved railway buildings - land surplus to requirements or land that could be made so.

Neglected stations, like Brockley.

Potential that shouldn't go to waste, but we know that, too often, it does.

And with vision, funding and collaboration, these could become hubs of regeneration, places that don't just usher people through - but bring people together.

We talk about delivering ""London style"" transport to other places.

But I think we should talk more about ""Swindon style"" transport for Swindon, or ""York style"" transport for York.

And I want to support the capability and capacity within councils and combined authorities to deliver regeneration, investment and tangible improvements.

We have great mayors.

We have great local leaders.

We have great organisations working nationally and regionally.

We have a lot of talent in this room and beyond.

So, the question for me, is how do we best harness that?

Obviously, this is a question that has vexed me particularly since I took a call from the Prime Minister at the tail end of November, asking me to serve as his Transport Secretary.

And as someone who has skin in the game as a local MP and a passion to build on the work started by the force of nature, Lou Haigh, I naturally said yes.

And here I am.

Full-circle in some ways, and trying to shape a new path in another.

And the task is to build a better decade for transport.

Towards a better railway…

Laying the foundations for reform - establishing Shadow Great British Railways and launching a consultation on the upcoming Railways Bill to unify track and train .

Towards public ownership…

Passing the Passenger Railway Services Act, with the first operators - Southwestern and c2c - moving into public hands in the coming months.

Towards better buses…

Introducing the Bus Services Bill, giving local authorities greater control over routes, timetables, and fares - backed by over £1 billion in investment to improve reliability and frequency.

Towards better roads…

Investing £1.6 billion in local highways, an uplift of £500 million on last year - enough to fill an extra 7 million potholes.

Towards fairer work…

Enshrining greater protections for seafarers in law.

Towards cleaner skies…

Introducing the Sustainable Aviation Fuel mandate and launching a consultation on the revenue certainty mechanism.

Towards a fossil-free future…

Supporting the installation of thousands of new EV charge points-helping to drive record electric car sales, with 31% of new cars sold in December last year being electric.

And towards a transport system that supports the aspirations of everyone in this country…

It's why I am so proud to work with the ministerial team at the Department for Transport.

Like me - and like all of us - they've seen the difference that good services make…

…Whether it's the tap-and-go trams and buses in Mike Kane's patch, with fares capped at £2 on Greater Manchester's Bee Network.

…Or in Simon Lightwood's patch, where the mass transit system will improve integrated travel options in West Yorkshire, improving access to opportunities for people in Leeds and Bradford.

…Or, in Nottingham, where one of the local bus operators, Nottingham City Transport, has been voted UK operator of the year a record six times, with passenger satisfaction amongst the highest in the country. I hear Lilian Greenwood is a pretty good local MP too …

And as for Peter Hendy, who is his own walking museum of transport knowledge, he has a phrase that I would like to steal.

He talks about transport needing to be ""boringly reliable"".

And he's right.

If public transport options are boringly reliable, then it means day-to-day life is easier for everyone.

So, by 2035, I want public transport to play a greater role in national life, becoming the easiest, most attractive choice… brilliantly and boringly reliable.

Enrique Peñalosa, a former mayor of Bogotá, once said:

""An advanced city is not one where the poor have to own a car, but one where the rich choose to use public transport.""

That's a vision I believe in.

But I can picture the headlines now - so let me counter the column inches before they emerge: there is no such thing as a war on motorists.

I drive. I own a car and I love it - a racing green Mini Cooper convertible.

I walk. I cycle.

I take buses, trains, and taxis.

And I'll bet most of you do too.

No serious person is proposing to ask people like my dad, a self employed electrician, to swap their van for a bus, forcing them to lug all their kit around - I certainly am not.

Through his career, my dad was a professional problem solver, and I hope I'll carry the torch for that family tradition.

But I'll be focussing on solving the real problems, not wasting time on the invented ones.

Because I'm sure everybody in this room would agree that where you live shouldn't determine what you can achieve…

…that your hometown, no matter how big or how small, should provide the transport options to meet your aspirations…

… and that - if transport doesn't nurture young people with the opportunities they deserve, then our entire economy misses out on the talent it needs to grow.

That's why we're here today.

To have the conversations that bring us closer together.

I want to harness your talents, your expertise and your drive to solve real problems.

Because, no matter where people are travelling to, they should be proud of where they're coming from.

Thank you, and have a lovely evening.",https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/668bb8ba7541f54efe51bb2d/heidi-alexander.jpeg,N,,2025-04-12 10:56:11.246317

Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one.","Owning a private jet is often perceived as the pinnacle of luxury and convenience, offering unparalleled flexibility and comfort in air travel. However, the financial commitment extends far beyond the initial purchase price. This article provides an in-depth exploration of the various expenses involved, offering a detailed overview to inform your decision-making process.​

Initial acquisition costs: new vs pre-owned

The journey to private jet ownership begins with the acquisition of the aircraft. Prices vary significantly based on factors such as the aircraft's size, range, manufacturer, and whether it's new or pre-owned.​

The next thing to consider when acquiring an aircraft is financing and depreciation. While some buyers may choose to purchase a jet outright, others might explore financing options. Interest rates and loan terms can significantly impact the overall cost. Additionally, private jets depreciate over time, affecting the aircraft's resale value.

Total annual operating costs

Fixed annual costs

Beyond the purchase price, owners must budget for recurring annual expenses that ensure the aircraft remains operational and compliant with aviation regulations.​ Fixed annual costs are expenditures that are incurred regardless of the number of hours flown, such as:

Crew salaries and training

Hangar fees

Insurance

Employing a qualified crew is essential. Annual salaries for pilots and crew members can vary based on experience, aircraft type, and region, with total compensation varying significantly based on factors such as aircraft size and operational requirements. According to BizJetJobs, the average salary of a Global 6000/6500 pilot is in excess of $150,000 a year. Regular training and certifications are also necessary to maintain proficiency and comply with regulations, adding to the overall crew-related expenses.​

Storing the aircraft in a hangar protects it from environmental elements and ensures security. Hangar rental fees can vary based on location, facility quality, and aircraft size. For instance, Singapore Air Charter reports that hangar fees can range from $36,000 to $96,000 a year, depending on the size of the aircraft. Annually, this can amount to significant sums, especially in high-demand areas.​

Lastly, comprehensive insurance coverage is vital to protect against potential liabilities and damages. Annual premiums can range widely based on factors such as aircraft value, usage, coverage limits, and pilot qualifications. According to Flying MAG, premiums can range from $10,000 to $500,000 per year. It's advisable to consult with an insurance broker to tailor coverage to specific needs and ensure adequate protection.​

Variable operating costs

On the flip side of fixed costs are variable costs, which are dependent on the number of hours flown. Operating the jet incurs variable costs that fluctuate based on usage, including:

Fuel expenses

Maintenance and repairs

Landing and handling fees

Fuel is one of the most significant operating expenses. The cost of jet fuel can vary based on market conditions and regions. For example, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) averaged the cost of jet fuel in 2025 to be about $87 per barrel, or approximately $2.07 per gallon, per OPIS. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours annually might consume around 36,000 gallons, totaling approximately $74,520 in fuel costs. However, fluctuations in fuel prices can significantly impact these expenses.​

Next up is maintenance – regular maintenance ensures safety and compliance with aviation standards. According to Singapore Air Charter, annual maintenance costs can range from $500,000 to $1,000,000 (or more), including routine servicing, inspections, and unexpected repairs, depending on the aircraft's age, type, and size. Additionally, older aircraft may require costly upgrades, such as installing Wi-Fi or refurbishing interiors, further adding to maintenance expenses.​

Airports charge fees for landing and ground handling services, which can accumulate significantly over time. These fees vary by airport and region and are influenced by factors such as aircraft size and the services required. While these fees may seem modest individually, they can add up, especially for frequent flyers.​

When combining fixed and variable expenses, the total annual cost of owning and operating a private jet can range widely. Estimates suggest annual costs between a few hundred thousand to a couple of million dollars, depending on factors like aircraft size, usage frequency, and operational choices. These figures underscore the importance of comprehensive budgeting and financial planning for prospective jet owners.​

Alternative ownership models

For those seeking the benefits of private aviation without the full financial commitment, alternative models exist.​

Fractional ownership

This model allows individuals to purchase a share of an aircraft, reducing upfront and operational costs. For example, fractional ownership programs may start at approximately $215,000 for a jet card with 275 hours of annual access, per Stratos Jets. Fractional ownership is particularly attractive for those who fly between 50 and 400 hours per year, offering guaranteed aircraft availability, professional management, and streamlined logistics without the hassle of full-time ownership responsibilities.

Jet cards and membership programs

Similarly, jet cards and private aviation memberships have gained popularity for offering prepaid access to private jet services without long-term commitments. With fixed hourly rates and guaranteed availability, jet card programs provide cost predictability and operational convenience.

In 2025, entry-level jet cards often start around $100,000 to $150,000, with hourly rates typically ranging from $5,000 to $15,000 depending on aircraft category and provider. While these programs do not offer the same level of customization or personal branding as full ownership, they eliminate maintenance and management concerns entirely.

Charter services

Chartering remains a flexible, pay-as-you-go option for occasional travelers. It’s ideal for those flying fewer than 50 hours annually or for those exploring private aviation before committing to ownership. Depending on the aircraft type, distance, and destination, charter flights in 2025 can cost anywhere between $2,000 per hour for a turboprop and over $12,000 per hour for a heavy jet.

Platforms like XO, Wheels Up, and JetASAP have made chartering more accessible by offering digital booking tools and real-time pricing, making this option increasingly appealing for infrequent flyers.

Tax implications and incentives

Private jet ownership offers unique tax implications that can be both a burden and a benefit depending on how the aircraft is used. In some jurisdictions, owners may be eligible for tax deductions on operational expenses if the aircraft is used for business purposes.

In the United States, bonus depreciation continues to be a significant incentive—allowing buyers to deduct a substantial portion of the purchase cost in the year of acquisition. However, this benefit is gradually reducing: according to Aviation Tax Consultants, 2025 offers only 40% bonus depreciation (down from 100% in 2022), unless the aircraft qualifies under a binding contract from prior years that still allows 60% depreciation.

Owners must work closely with aviation tax consultants to structure aircraft ownership and usage properly—especially if combining business and personal travel—to avoid running afoul of IRS scrutiny or triggering unintended tax liabilities.

Environmental considerations and sustainability costs

As global attention shifts towards sustainability, owning a private jet in 2025 also carries an environmental and social cost. The carbon footprint of private aviation is significantly higher than that of commercial flights. In response, many owners are adopting greener practices, such as carbon offsetting programs and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) usage.

Carbon offsetting typically costs between $10 to $50 per metric ton of CO₂. A mid-size jet flying 200 hours a year can produce around 500 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually, resulting in offset costs of approximately $5,000 to $25,000 each year. SAF, while reducing lifecycle emissions by up to 80%, is currently two to four times more expensive than conventional jet fuel.

However, as governments and industry invest in greener aviation, some regions offer subsidies or incentives for sustainable practices. The decision to operate sustainably may not be financially mandatory, but for many owners—especially high-profile individuals and corporations—it is becoming a reputational necessity.

Hidden and unexpected expenses

Beyond the obvious and recurring costs, owning a private jet includes several lesser-known expenses that can catch new owners off guard. For example:

Interior Refurbishment: Every few years, owners may opt to update cabin interiors for aesthetic reasons or to stay competitive in the charter market. These upgrades can cost anywhere from $100,000 to over $1 million depending on the materials, layout, and tech integrations.

Regulatory Compliance: Adhering to global aviation standards can result in unexpected costs, such as mandatory avionics upgrades (e.g., ADS-B compliance), international operating permits, or privacy services for flight tracking.

Management Fees: If the owner chooses to work with a management company to handle logistics, staffing, maintenance, and compliance, expect to pay between $100,000 to $250,000 annually for professional oversight.

Opportunity Cost: Tying up millions of dollars in a depreciating asset rather than investing it elsewhere is a financial trade-off often overlooked during the initial excitement of aircraft ownership.

The lifestyle value: is it worth it?

Despite the extensive costs, many jet owners will tell you the value lies not in dollars and cents, but in the lifestyle. The ability to fly on your schedule, access remote airports, avoid commercial travel disruptions, and create a personalized onboard environment offers convenience and peace of mind that money alone can’t measure. For high-level executives, celebrities, or individuals with tight travel schedules and security concerns, this freedom is often worth the expense.

That said, it’s vital to understand the economics. Private jet ownership is a financial decision as much as it is a lifestyle one. Anyone considering it in 2025 should have a clear picture of how often they’ll use the aircraft, what type of aircraft suits their needs, and whether alternative models might better align with their goals and budget.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/main-image-16_9-13-2.png,N,,2025-04-12 09:56:29.033158

E-SAF är ett syntetiskt bränsle som tillverkas med hjälp av förnybar el från exempelvis vind, sol eller vattenkraft. Det är koldioxidneutralt – eftersom det bara släpper ut den mängd koldioxid som tidigare fångats in vid produktionen.

Satsningen konkretiseras i Bodødeklarationen, som presenterades i samband med ett internationellt SAF-seminarium i norska Bodø den 9–10 april. Där samlades representanter från flygindustrin, forskarvärlden, NGO:er och EU-kommissionen.

Deklarationen bygger vidare på tidigare initiativ som Project SkyPower, där SAS i februari 2025 ledde ett upprop till EU-kommissionen tillsammans med en lång rad branschaktörer.

Målet med Bodødeklarationen är tydligt: att flyget även i framtiden ska kunna fylla sin viktiga roll i samhället – men med minskad klimatpåverkan. Här står flygbolag, teknikleverantörer, flygplatser, motor- och flygplanstillverkare, politiker och forskare enade bakom en gemensam ambition.

För SAS är strategiska partnerskap en nyckel i hållbarhetsarbetet. Ett tydligt exempel är samarbetet med Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, Köpenhamns flygplats och Aalborgs flygplats. I november 2024 tecknade parterna ett avtal om att stötta dansk e-SAF-produktion inom ramen för Fjord PtX-projektet – ett initiativ som ska göra Danmark till en ledare inom hållbart flyg, skapa nya arbetstillfällen och bidra till en fossilfri framtid för branschen.

It was said to have carried up to 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones, potentially valued at billions of dollars. Now, Australia has discovered another treasure that might be even bigger. Could you imagine? This treasure is very unique. It might not be gold, silver, or even uncut gemstones, but it will be seen as one of the biggest in history.

The biggest renewable energy treasure in history is green

Renewable energy has become the most sought-after treasure in the 21st century. Now, we might have the biggest treasure yet, thanks to Australian company Vast Renewables Limited. The renewable energy company provides clean energy solutions that enable 24/7 green, cost-effective heat and power. The aim is to decarbonize the grid, green fuel production for the transport industry, and hard-to-abate industries.

Vast’s latest project, the Port Augusta utility-scale clean energy project, Vast Solar 1 (VS1), will include a hydrogen-based green methanol plant, Solar Methanol 1 (SM1). After securing up to AUD180 million of conditional funding from the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), VS1’s construction can commence soon.

VS1 uses Vast’s next-generation concentrated solar thermal power (CSP) solution, and will be the first Australian project to supply essential long-duration renewable energy storage and production. Peak pricing intervals after sunset will be capitalized when isolated renewable energy, like solar energy, is unavailable. This will result in reliable, on-demand clean power to South Australia’s grid.

This treasure has practical applications

This historical treasure can potentially play a key role in pushing the global energy transition. Designed to supply carbon-free power and heat 24/7, VS1 will decarbonize the grid, fuel production for shipping and aviation, specialist industries such as data centers, and industries like mining and refining.

SM1 is being developed by Vast in alliance with a global energy company, Mabanaft. A real-world, in-demand application for hydrogen, green methanol has the potential to decarbonize shipping and is already utilized to power major container vessels.

These revolutionary projects will provide the foundation needed for the future exhibit of Vast’s global pipeline of clean energy projects that supplement intermittent solar panels and wind energy. VS1 and SM1 will contribute to generating green methanol and facilitate sustainable aviation fuel production.

The world will be able to see the result soon

With the much-needed funding from ARENA, VS1’s financing can almost be settled. The front-end engineering design (FEED) and commercial development have already been completed, giving Vast hope that the final investment decision (FID) will be reached. Additional investments are required to satisfy the range of AUD360 million. These additional investments will allow construction to begin in 2025.

Additional investors will also help boost the Australian economy, as Vast’s projects and production pursuits are expected to create dozens of Australian green manufacturing jobs, construction jobs, and long-term plant operations roles.

“By providing green, affordable electricity on demand when other renewables are not available to power homes, industry and fuel production, we deliver the missing piece of the puzzle.” – Craig Wood, CEO of Vast.

Wood announced he was grateful to ARENA and the Australian Government for their continued support for their project’s journey.",https://www.ecoportal.net/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/661ccc8c85a612bece77e040_vastt.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:07.102765

With a legacy spanning over 61 years, Royal Jordanian (RJ) is not just Jordan’s flag carrier but a strategic connector between the Levant and the world, fostering tourism, cultural exchange, and regional connectivity.

At the heart of RJ’s vision lies the goal to position Amman as the premier Middle Eastern gateway, supported by the newly launched ExploRJordan brand — a fresh initiative to promote Jordan as a boutique destination blending modernity with authentic Arabian heritage.

Mr. Makhlouf outlines RJ’s robust expansion plans, including a 25% growth target, new non-stop routes to Washington D.C., and a long-awaited return to the Indian market with flights to Mumbai and New Delhi. He also speaks on fleet modernization, the revival of service to Damascus, and RJ’s enhanced partnership with Dnata.

Sustainability is a major pillar of RJ’s future, with the airline aiming to cut carbon emissions by over 32% through new aircraft and eco-conscious practices. This conversation offers a comprehensive look at how Royal Jordanian is redefining itself as a boutique airline for a boutique destination.

Tell us something about Brand RJ.

Royal Jordanian (RJ) is more than just an airline; it is a bridge between cultures, a key enabler of tourism, and a vital connector between the Levant and the world. With over 61 years of heritage, RJ has continuously evolved to reflect the rich legacy and warm hospitality of Jordan. Our vision is to position Amman as the premier gateway in the Middle East, providing seamless connectivity to Europe, North America, Asia, and Africa. We developed a brand called ExploRJordan which is mainly positioning Jordan as contemporary, authentic Arabia with a variety of activities in the line with a new tourism strategy.

Share with our readers about Royal Jordanian’s growth plans for the year 2025.

2025 is going to be a milestone year for us. We are focused on a growth strategy that revolves around two key pillars: boosting tourism in to Jordan and strengthening Amman as a key regional hub. We aim to grow by 25% this year, opening new routes and expanding our fleet to accommodate the rising demand. Our network expansion includes launching direct flights to Washington D.C. and entering the Indian market, which are critical steps towards our vision of enhancing connectivity.

Tell us something about your partnership with Dnata

Our partnership with Dnata represents a strategic move toward strengthening Royal Jordanian’s operational and organizational structure. Recently, we expanded our stake in Dnata’s catering company in Jordan, acquiring a 51% majority shareholding. This step aligns with our broader vision of enhancing our service offerings and supporting our customers’ needs by ensuring top-quality in-flight catering services.

This partnership allows us to leverage Dnata’s global expertise in catering and hospitality while ensuring that our local operations reflect Jordanian culture and hospitality values. It demonstrates our commitment to continuous improvement, operational efficiency, and providing an elevated travel experience for our passengers. Through this collaboration, we aim to further position Royal Jordanian as a leading airline in the region, focusing on both passenger satisfaction and sustainable growth.

After a hiatus of 13 years, Royal Jordanian resumed its flight service to Damascus. How, in your opinion, will this impact global air travel?

In line with our levant strategy we always want to be the first to develop new markets and traffic within the levant region. We started the Syria flight on 31st January 2025 with daily flights allowing Syrians to use Amman as the preferred gateway to Europe, US and the Middle East with flight time of only 35 minutes from Amman to Damascus which is the shortest and fastest gateway to the world. With the increase geopolitical stability in the region, I expect traffic to and from Levant globally to over proportionally grow.

What are your plans to expand RJ’s fleet?

Fleet expansion is at the core of our growth strategy. Over the next one and a half years, we plan to introduce nearly 20 brand-new aircraft, including the Airbus A320neo family, Embraer E2 jets, and Boeing 787-9s for long-haul routes. These additions will not only enhance passenger comfort and experience but also contribute significantly to our sustainability goals by reducing carbon emissions by over 32%. RJ is set as a boutique airline to truly represent the boutique destination Jordan.

What markets do you target for your expansion plans?

Our expansion strategy is focused on strengthening connectivity with key global markets, where we opened more than 15 new routes in the last two years. While we have successfully grown our presence in Europe and North America, 2025 will see a stronger emphasis on Asia, with India being a major target. The Indian market holds immense potential, and we are dedicated to establishing Jordan as a boutique tourism destination for Indian travelers. Additionally, we opened new routes to Libya and Syria in line with our levant strategy. Casablanca will be added in the 3rd quarter to further increase our footprint in the region.

RJ will be launching non-stop flight service to Washington D.C. from mid-March 2025. How, in your opinion, this new route will be catering to the travel demands of passengers from the Middle East and North America?

The Washington D.C. route is a game-changer. There is a substantial demand for direct connectivity between Jordan and the U.S., especially for business travelers, diplomats, and the Jordanian diaspora. This route not only strengthens transatlantic travel but also provides seamless connections for passengers from surrounding Middle Eastern, North American and African countries traveling to the U.S. through Amman. The convenience of a direct flight will enhance travel options and elevate Royal Jordanian’s position in the US market.

Royal Jordanian returns to India after 10 years. Share your two cents on this new expansion plan with our readers.

We are introducing new flights to Mumbai and New Delhi with a complete new strategy in line with the new strategy of ExploRJordan, we are primarily promoting Jordan as a boutique destination. My aim is to double the number of tourism in India from 70,000 to 140,000 within the next 1-2 years. Furthermore, we will insure very high load factors through the selling of connecting flights via Amman to US, Canada, Middle East and North Africa with a global network of over 50 destinations. India as a booming aviation market will be key for our Asia growth strategy, and I foresee an increase in frequency within the next 12-18 months.

What are your goals and achievements in promoting and upholding sustainable aviation?

Sustainability is at the heart of our operations. Our fleet renewal plan is a major step towards reducing our carbon footprint by over 32% within three years. We are integrating fuel-efficient aircraft, optimizing routes, and exploring sustainable aviation fuel options. Additionally, through our ExploRJordan initiative, we actively promote eco-tourism and sustainable travel choices in Jordan, ensuring that we play our part in responsible tourism growth.

How do you describe your journey so far? Where do you wish to see your brand in the next five years?

The journey has been nothing short of remarkable. Despite geopolitical and economic challenges, Royal Jordanian has emerged stronger, with a clear growth vision and a renewed commitment to customer satisfaction. Looking ahead, in the next five years, I envision RJ as a leading boutique airline, setting new benchmarks in service excellence, sustainability, and connectivity. With our ambitious expansion plans and relentless focus on innovation, we are shaping the future of aviation in the region and beyond. RJ is following a strengthened growth with clear expansion targets. With our ExploRJordan initiative we will be the only airline in the region focusing primarily on tourism into Jordan.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SMR_3379-1-1.jpg,N,,2025-04-12 02:56:14.938629

But over the past seven or eight years, the global energy system has been undergoing a huge transformation.

Join us on Wednesday 16 April for ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition’, a virtual student event with global law firm White & Case.","White & Case’s Ryan Gawrych and Hannah Bragge unpack life in the firm’s busy Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance team

As governments and industries around the world race to decarbonise, lawyers are increasingly needed to advise on the new technologies and innovative deal structures driving the energy transition forward. From financing battery storage facilities to advising on green hydrogen projects, White & Case’s global Energy, Infrastructure, Project and Asset Finance (EIPAF) practice group is helping make it all happen.

Ahead next week’s virtual student event, ‘Understanding key trends in the energy transition — with White & Case‘, we caught up with the speakers, local partner Ryan Gawrych and associate Hannah Bragge, to hear what it’s like to work at the forefront of the energy transition.

Can you tell us a bit about your career journeys so far and what your day-to-day looks like in the EIPAF team at White & Case?

Bragge: I’m originally from Australia and started out at a different firm back home, but I’ve been with White & Case for a few years now, first in the Melbourne office, and more recently in London since August 2023. I focus mostly on project finance, especially in the renewables space, but I’ve also had great exposure to project development work, both at my previous firm and here at White & Case. One of the real strengths of our London team is that juniors and trainees get to work across both the financing and development sides of transactions. That kind of experience early on is really valuable for building a successful career.

Gawrych: Like Hannah, I’m Australian too, and I’ve had a bit of a global journey. I’ve worked in Australia, China, Mongolia, Indonesia, the UAE, the UK and now Germany. I’ve been with White & Case for just over two years and have a background that includes time at major resources companies and other international law firms. My practice is more focused on project development, commercial contracts, and M&A within the energy sector. That’s also what prompted my recent relocation to White & Case’s Hamburg office. I’m advising on low-carbon fuel projects across Europe, and Germany is right at the centre of a lot of the action.

What attracted you to this sector? What do you enjoy most about working on energy transition deals?

Bragge: It’s a mix of things. First, it’s just where the work is — this is where our clients are investing and building right now. But it’s also genuinely interesting. You’re dealing with emerging technologies, which means lenders aren’t always familiar with the risk profiles. A good example is batteries. They’re essential for balancing the grid, but the way they generate revenue differs from market to market and keeps changing. So, there’s a lot of creative legal thinking required. There’s definitely no copy-paste approach here. And personally, I find it exciting to be working on projects that are pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

Gawrych: I’ve been working in the energy sector for quite a while. My career started in mining and oil & gas, especially advising Asian investors in Australian projects. But over the past seven or eight years, the global energy system has been undergoing a huge transformation. The shift away from fossil fuels is driven by everything from the Paris Climate Accords to energy security concerns. Working with big energy clients as they pivot towards renewables and new business models has been fascinating. You’re dealing with projects that have never been done before, or trying to apply lessons from one jurisdiction — say, a hydrogen project in Saudi Arabia — to a totally different legal and commercial context, like France or Germany. It’s blue-sky thinking, and it keeps things interesting.

Have you noticed changes in the market recently, especially with global elections and policy shifts?

Gawrych: While some headlines might suggest a general slowdown in the market, we’re seeing more of a recalibration, with the overall fundamentals remaining solid.

In Europe, there’s still a strong policy drive behind decarbonisation, and building new energy infrastructure remains a top political priority. But as governments are being put under increasing pressure to reallocate funding to defence and other nearshoring initiatives, we’re also seeing regulators and investors apply a higher degree of scrutiny to deal certainty and value for money. The result is a shift away from speculative technologies and structures, toward more mature and commercially viable projects. In the Middle East, we are seeing a slight slowdown in new project announcements, as developers wait to see how other markets play out following recent elections. However, the overall policy focus on the energy transition remains strong.

In the Americas, while there appears to be a policy shift away from renewables in the US, there’s still a lot happening in the energy transition space in relation to sustainable technologies like carbon capture and storage (i.e. things that reduce emissions but don’t necessarily fall under the ‘renewables’ label). And in Asia Pacific, investment in new technologies is also going strong, in particular, in green hydrogen, ammonia, and sustainable aviation fuel. There’s also a lot of innovation coming out of the region around electrification and low-carbon fuels.

It sounds like a global and evolving landscape. What skills do aspiring lawyers need to thrive in this sector — and what should they be doing now to prepare?

Bragge: I think one of the biggest things to understand is that this area of law probably isn’t something you’ll study much at university, if at all. So, if you’re interested in it, you’ve got to be proactive. Read the Financial Times and The Economist. Follow project developers and green investors on LinkedIn to see how they are implementing the latest renewables, energy storage, and low-carbon technologies. White & Case publishes a lot of great materials on the intersection between the legal profession and the energy transitions that you should check-out, but there’s also plenty of other accessible content out there from other international law firms and legal commentators.

When you come into a transactional team like ours, you’ll be learning core legal skills like drafting and managing deal processes, but in our space, a broader awareness of the market really enhances the experience. And it helps you figure out if this work genuinely interests you. If you find yourself reading about a battery storage deal and thinking, “That’s cool, I want to know more,” then that’s a great sign.

Gawrych: I’d echo that. Our group probably has one of the steepest learning curves at the firm; not necessarily on the technical legal side, but in terms of understanding the industries we work in. You need to be curious. If you hear someone mention the HEFA process or green ammonia, and you’ve never come across those terms before, the instinct should be to go away, do some research, and get up to speed. That’s how you build context, which is crucial for our work. These are billion-dollar projects with huge moving parts, from engineering to policy to economics. You don’t have to be an expert from day one, and really our expertise will always be focussed on the law, but having a genuine interest and a willingness to learn about the industries that our clients operate in makes a huge difference.

And finally, what advice would you give students who are looking at firms like White & Case and thinking, ‘I want to be doing this kind of work’?

Bragge: Be curious, be informed, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you’re applying to White & Case, show that you understand what the firm actually does. We’re known for cross-border transactional work and complex infrastructure deals. If you’re passionate about global issues, climate change, or the energy sector, say so. And remember, everyone starts somewhere — you’re not expected to know everything, but showing a willingness to learn goes a long way.

Gawrych: I’d say embrace the complexity. It’s what makes the work challenging, but also what makes it rewarding. If you’re someone who likes puzzles, figuring out how different legal, commercial and technical elements all fit together, then this is a great place to be. And at White & Case, you’ll have opportunities to work on projects all over the world. That global perspective is baked into our culture and our deals, and it creates a really exciting environment to build your career. You do really need to get in there, lift up the bonnet, get stuck into the engine, and play around.

The Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act proposes a significant extension of this vital credit, pushing its expiration date an additional seven years to the end of 2034.
This provision directly addresses concerns about the potential for imported feedstocks to benefit from a tax credit intended to support domestic industries.","A bipartisan group of lawmakers in both the House and Senate have reintroduced the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act, signaling a renewed push to bolster the renewable fuels industry and prioritize American agriculture. The legislation, spearheaded by Representatives Marcy Kaptur (D-Iowa) and Tracey Mann (R-Kan.) in the House, and Senators Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) in the Senate, seeks to extend the crucial 45Z clean fuel production tax credit and ensure it primarily benefits fuels derived from domestically sourced feedstocks.

The bill, initially introduced in the previous legislative session, has garnered additional support this time around, with Senators Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), and Pete Ricketts (R-Neb.) joining as cosponsors. This bipartisan backing underscores the widespread recognition of the importance of renewable fuels to both the agricultural sector and the nation's energy security.

The 45Z tax credit, a key component of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, currently offers incentives for the production and sale of low-emission transportation fuels. The credit structure provides 20 cents per gallon for non-aviation fuels and 35 cents per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Notably, facilities that adhere to prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements can qualify for significantly higher credit values, reaching up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and $1.75 per gallon for SAF. This existing credit is slated to remain in effect for the years 2025, 2026, and 2027.

The Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act proposes a significant extension of this vital credit, pushing its expiration date an additional seven years to the end of 2034. This extended timeframe aims to provide greater long-term certainty for biofuel producers and farmers, encouraging further investment and innovation within the sector.

Beyond the extension, a central tenet of the bill is the inclusion of language that would restrict eligibility for the 45Z credit to fuels ""derived from a feedstock which was produced or grown in the United States."" This provision directly addresses concerns about the potential for imported feedstocks to benefit from a tax credit intended to support domestic industries. By prioritizing domestically sourced biomass, the legislation seeks to strengthen American agriculture, create rural economic opportunities, and reduce reliance on foreign inputs.

The reintroduced legislation has already garnered strong support from key industry stakeholders. Organizations such as Growth Energy, the American Soybean Association, the National Oilseed Processors Association, the National Corn Growers Association, the National Sorghum Producers, the U.S. Canola Association, and the Renewable Fuels Association have all voiced their approval.

Emily Skor, CEO of Growth Energy, emphasized the critical need for long-term certainty provided by the bill, stating, ""Farmers and businesses need to know this tax credit is here to stay before they can feel confident investing in dozens of new energy projects across rural America. With this bill they’ll have the certainty they need to accelerate innovation, create thousands of new jobs, and secure new markets for farmers and biofuel producers."" She further commended Senators Marshall and Klobuchar for their leadership and thanked other rural champions for their efforts.

The reintroduction of the Farmers First Fuel Incentives Act signals a strong commitment from a bipartisan coalition to support the growth of the domestic renewable fuels industry and ensure that American farmers are at the forefront of this burgeoning sector. As the bill moves through the legislative process, it will be closely watched by agricultural producers, biofuel companies, and environmental advocates alike.",https://www.chemanalyst.com/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-04-11 16:56:37.726822
