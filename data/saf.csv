The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.",https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2472/2025/07/13053002/y-s-9diw3tvlfnw-unsplash-1024x819.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 23:01:32.905562

Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) into Australia reached yet another record high of $141.1 billion representing 11.95% of all FDI into Australia.

A new high of 72 M&A transactions and 55 partnerships were executed in 2024, representing the third consecutive year of record activity involving Japanese companies.

Amid an increasingly uncertain economic environment with disruptive US tariffs, strategic competition between China and America and geopolitical headwinds, Australia offers a lower-risk and higher-reward market for Japanese companies, which are cash-rich but face a shrinking domestic customer base.

In its Japan-Australia Investment Report 2024, law firm Herbert Smith Freehills notes while the trend was temporarily stalled by the pandemic disruption, Japanese investors continue to show enormous confidence in the economic future of Australia and Japan’s role in its development.

Japanese foreign direct investment (FDI) into Australia reached yet another record high of $141.1 billion representing 11.95% of all FDI into Australia. Japan ranked third in terms of cumulative FDI into Australia, and the country remains the only foreign investor to have increased its FDI into Australia in every single year over the past 11 years.

Comparatively, Australia accounted for 8.3% of all Japanese FDI.

Two-way trade between Australia and Japan was in 2024 valued at $113.4 billion, making Japan Australia’s second largest trading partner and second-largest export destination at $80.5 billion.

For many years, there have been increasingly diverse sectors in which Japanese companies invest in Australia. From traditional sectors such as mining, energy, and agriculture, investment has now become well established in sectors including real estate, life insurance, and financial services.

Herbert Smith Freehill reports further diversification in 2024 is building on a trend from recent years shows the growing strength of new market sectors like sustainable aviation fuel, transport and logistics, data centres, pension, and share administration services platforms, food technology, AI, and enterprise IT services.

Japanese strategies: Bolt-on to take off

Takeovers of listed Australian companies by way of a scheme of arrangement are becoming increasingly common for larger transactions, with three occurring in 2024. These include Renesas’ (TYO:6723) $9.1 billion acquisition of Altium; Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Bank’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Link Group; and J-POWER’s $380 million acquisition of Genex Power.

“Under a scheme of arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated by the bidder with the board of the target company and is almost always approved by shareholders, which gives certainty of timing and budget to the Japanese acquirer,” Herbert Smith Freehill says.

Japanese businesses already well-established in Australia such as in beverages (ASAHI Group (TYO:2502) and Kirin (TYO:2503)), paper (Kokusai Pulp & Paper/Spicers Paper11 and Japan Pulp & Paper/Ball & Doggett), technology (Fujitsu, Fujifilm, Fujifilm Business Innovation (formerly Fuji Xerox), Hitachi, NEC and NRI), automotive (Optimus (TYO:9268) and IDOM (TYO:7599)), industrial gases (Nippon Sanso (TYO:4091)) and residential housing (Sumitomo Forestry and Asahi Kasei Homes) are growing market share and margins by acquiring “bolt-on” businesses to provide scale and achieve economies of scale.

There have been close to 200 partnerships between Japanese and Australian companies and institutions since 2019, and 55 in 2024.

The number of partnerships demonstrate the deep connection and mutual trust that exists between partners and they can form the economic foundation of future collaboration and cooperation, and ultimately new investment opportunities.

“Their increasing popularity with Japanese companies over the traditional minority interest in unincorporated joint ventures demonstrates an increasing sophistication amongst Japanese operators, and their understanding of and confidence in the Australian market,” Herbert Smith Freehill reports.

“Clean energy-related partnerships in sustainable aviation fuel, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy have been the most prominent and are likely to continue to grow.

“Science, technology and innovation is another area with trend growth in partnerships and large potential for future investments. There were only some partnerships in sports, defence, agriculture and space with each of these areas likely to see more partnerships in the future.”

Green energy direction unchanged

Divestments of thermal coal, which have risen to prominence in recent years, have slowed as Japan needs to secure energy for its industrial base, as well as coal production being very profitable.

Exports of coal were close to the record volumes of 2022 that were generated by restrictions on the importation of Russian coal and exceeded 2023’s export figures.

Major metallurgical coal acquisitions are back and more are likely in the near future as Japan needs to secure key minerals for its industrial base.

Iron ore continues to be a massive contributor to the economic wealth of Australia and an essential to Japan’s economic future.

Australia supplies 51.6% of Japan’s metallurgical coal and 55.1% of iron ore imports. Mitsui’s (TYO:8031) $8.4 billion acquisition of a 40% interest in the Rhodes Ridge iron ore project announced in early 2025 highlights this.

“Japanese companies have been very cautious about investing in greenfield projects or in companies without cash flow”

According to Herbert Smith Freehills, the direction of the green energy transition is unchanged but timing is being delayed. The commercial and technical challenges Australia needs to overcome in order to become a green hydrogen and green ammonia export superpower have become apparent.

“There are producers and buyers but not yet a ‘market’ that can support the increasing construction and renewables cost and allow for project financing. Unfortunately for Australia, unlike LNG and coal which are in limited supply globally, many countries have sun and wind and less red and green tape,” the firm says.

“Japanese companies have been very cautious about investing in greenfield projects or in companies without cash flow.

“There is a disconnect between the Japanese and Australian Governments’ geopolitical concerns about critical and strategic mineral supply chains and the risk and return for investors.

“Mining project development takes an average of 15 years to move from mineral discovery to commercial production and mineral market prices are volatile. The forces of demand do not align with the supply-side timing.”

Trade missions

The Queensland Government is launching a new Queensland-Japan Trade and Investment Strategy 2025-2028 to deepen ties with one of the state’s significant economic partners, as reported by this news service.

This is backed by a $18 million investment over four years, which is poised to turbocharge Trade and Investment Queensland’s market strategies and deliver real outcomes for exporters, innovators, and investors.

For the year ending May 2025, Japan was Queensland’s second-largest goods export market, with total exports valued at $14.4 billion.

The government’s new strategy addresses expanding international education, research, and innovation partnerships; growing Queensland’s food, agriculture, and agritech exports; boosting the State’s innovation, creative, and tech sectors; and, attracting investment into major infrastructure projects.

Meanwhile, Western Australian Premier Roger Cook last week visited Japan for high-level talks for continuing collaboration on the clean energy transition. The meetings with government and industry stakeholders aims to also reinforce Western Australia’s longstanding relationship with Japan.

The trade mission comes ahead of his visit in September to World Expo 2025 Osaka, where the Western Australian Government joined the Commonwealth Government as a Gold Partner at the Australian Pavillion.

In early October 2025, Western Australia will host the 62nd Australia Japan Business Co-operation Committee (AJBCC) Annual Joint Business Conference with the theme: Navigating New Realities – Turbulence, Transition and Technology, as reported by Mining.com.au.

BOSTON, MA, UNITED STATES, July 13, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- In a year marked by turbulence and technological upheaval, Boston Brand Research & Media’s Global Brand Frontier Awards 2025 are rewriting the narrative of corporate achievement. With fewer than 2% of brands reviewed earning a place on the winners’ list, this invitation-only recognition has become one of the most selective and influential accolades in international branding and innovation.

The 2025 edition has progressed with remarkable momentum, casting a wide net across sectors as varied as banking, consulting, healthcare, fintech, education, real estate, and emerging tech. What sets this year apart is the unrelenting focus on two imperatives: resilience in a post-pandemic economy and bold, operationalized AI integration. Winners are no longer just market leaders — they are adaptive, intelligent systems of excellence. These are the brands rewriting global business models by embedding AI in core workflows, improving decision-making precision, automating risk, and elevating customer experience at scale.

At the heart of this transformation is a new standard of brand integrity — one that blends data fluency with human values. The Global Brand Frontier Awards are structured not to reward the biggest balance sheets, but the brands building long-term value in smart, ethical, and inclusive ways. The judging panel — comprising data scientists, strategic consultants, branding experts, and economists — evaluates entries with a rigor and transparency that is unmatched in the global awards landscape.

Behind the prestige of these awards lies a multi-dimensional assessment model. The evaluation process combines precision analytics with deep qualitative inquiry. Proprietary scorecards track metrics like revenue growth, ESG compliance, digital maturity, customer experience, and innovation output. But data alone doesn’t dictate the results. Real-time sentiment analysis, stakeholder interviews, and peer evaluations shape a richer view of impact. Statistical models — such as regression analysis, factor analysis, and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) — identify brands that are outperforming expectations in volatile, high-risk environments. These brands are not just surviving — they are thriving by creating adaptive systems, resilient value chains, and predictive models that help anticipate and respond to disruption.

“We’re not just awarding success. We’re benchmarking the future,” said Shivakumar, President & CEO at Boston Brand Research & Media. “The 2025 awards reflect a tectonic shift in what leadership means — resilience, digital fluency, and human-centered AI are no longer add-ons. They’re prerequisites.”

This year’s awards are also more geographically inclusive than ever before. With entries and winners from over 60 countries, the 2025 edition has spotlighted high-performing brands from not just the expected financial capitals but also from rising economies and underserved markets. From Southeast Asia’s fintech disruptors to West Africa’s microfinance innovators, the winners’ map spans five continents and includes regional champions and multinational titans alike.

In banking, DBS Bank was named Asia’s Most Admired Banking Brand for building a frictionless digital ecosystem at scale. Ant Group redefined fintech with AI-powered financial services reaching millions, earning it the Most Innovative FinTech Company title. In Egypt, Banque Misr took home twin honors for Best CSR Bank and Best IT Bank, while Senegal’s CBAO Groupe Attijariwafa Bank was recognized for catalyzing access to finance across Francophone Africa. United Bank for Africa Ghana emerged as a dual winner for sustainability and CSR, setting the bar for ethical finance in West Africa. JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America both took home top North American distinctions for customer experience and financial inclusion, respectively.

Consulting powerhouses like Tata Consultancy Services (Asia) and McKinsey & Company (North America) stood out for their strategic foresight and digital agility. Meanwhile, Europe’s Elixirr was dubbed Most Disruptive Consulting Startup, proving that boutique can still mean bold. Accenture, another heavyweight, was recognized for its commitment to sustainable transformation and multi-sector digital enablement.

In the education sector, Duolingo and Coursera led the charge in democratizing learning. Their platforms have not only scaled across borders but also contributed to significant upskilling in underserved communities. The University of Oxford held its ground as a global research benchmark, while institutions like King Abdullah University in Saudi Arabia and the University of Sydney showcased new models of interdisciplinary excellence. These are not just educational institutions — they are knowledge engines driving next-generation innovation.

Energy and sustainability categories saw pioneers like Ørsted, Brunei Shell Petroleum, and Saudi Aramco taking home top honors — not just for output, but for shifting paradigms in renewable energy, advanced drilling, and regional empowerment. Ørsted’s long-term investments in offshore wind have made it a global symbol of renewable commitment. Aramco, often associated with scale, has demonstrated surprising agility in green hydrogen and digital infrastructure deployment.

In insurance and InsurTech, AXA, Gulf Insurance Group (GIG) and Bupa Arabia reinforced their reputations with models that blended risk intelligence, AI-enhanced underwriting, and hyper-personalized customer service. State Farm (North America) earned distinction as the Most Customer-Centric Insurance Provider — not just for its massive reach, but for its commitment to using AI and data-driven tools to tailor claims processing, reduce fraud, and enhance the speed of service delivery across its extensive policyholder network.

Technology and cybersecurity were another battleground of brilliance. Canva, Darktrace, and Jumio emerged as the vanguard of scalable creativity, digital identity, and proactive AI defense systems. Their stories read more like Silicon Valley origin myths than corporate case studies. Darktrace, in particular, has been praised for its self-learning neural networks that detect cyber anomalies without human input — a revolutionary leap in enterprise risk management.

In the airline sector, while award winners have not yet been officially announced, this year’s invitees include some of the most prestigious and forward-thinking names in global aviation. Among them are Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, and Etihad Airways — all of whom are currently under active pre-evaluation. These carriers have been selected not only for their operational excellence and premium customer experiences but for their pioneering work in sustainable aviation fuel adoption, AI-enabled maintenance protocols, and next-generation inflight technologies. The aviation segment at the 2025 Global Brand Frontier Awards captures the renewed momentum of an industry embracing digital transformation and climate responsibility while continuing to connect the world.

The awards also celebrated excellence in real estate and infrastructure. Frasers Property (Singapore) was lauded as the Real Estate Sustainability Champion, while Prologis, Inc. (USA) earned top marks for redefining industrial logistics spaces with smart IoT integrations. India’s Godrej Properties and L&T Realty were both recognized for their roles in driving sustainable and community-centered urban planning in one of the world’s most populous nations.

And yet — the awards are far from over.

The F-22 Raptor ban on exports helped the United States safeguard its most advanced technology.
Meanwhile, both the United States' F-22 Raptor and China's J-20 Mighty Dragon have been banned by those countries for export.","The Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor is regarded as the world's first fifth-generation fighter jet and was built to take command of the skies as the world's air-dominance fighter jet. It was designed to overmatch and replace the F-15 Eagle family, although the Air Force continues to rely on that older fighter. However, the F-22 fighter jet was never sold to export customers.

In the end, the program was canceled due to its immense cost and lack of a perceived need. Exports would have helped sustain the program and made it more affordable, much like how exports help sustain the now-successful F-35 program. However, it is unclear how many countries would have had the requirement and a sufficiently deep budget to acquire the Raptor.

Pinnacle Of American Engineering

The F-22 Raptor entered service in 2005. Soon reports emerged of it acing exercises, emerging victorious again and again against both other US fighter jets and allied fighter jets like the Eurofighter Typhoon. The rare occasion that an F-22 is defeated in air-to-air exercises tends to turn heads, being the exception that proves the rule. One example is when a German Eurofighter reportedly took out a Raptor with guns during an exercise.

When the Raptor entered service, it combined the bleeding edge of advanced technology, including stealth and sensor fusion. This combines to produce superb situational awareness. Adding to that, the Raptor's airframe is highly maneuverable and has the ability to supercruise or fly at supersonic speeds without the need for afterburners. While the Cobra Maneuver may have little to no real-life tactical value, the Raptor is one of the few US fighter jets able to pull it off.

The F-22 is able to carry a lethal suite of missiles for use in both with-visual-range and beyond-visual-range engagements. The aircraft is also able to carry two 1,000-lb GBU-32 JDAMs or eight 250-lb Small Diameter Bombs for close air support or precision strike missions. While it is best in its air-to-air role, it is able to carry out air-to-ground missions. In the unlikely event that an old-fashioned dogfight were to take place, it comes with 480 rounds for its M61A2 20-millimeter cannon.

US Ban On Exports

According to Sandboxx News, Israel, Japan, and Australia repeatedly asked the United States for permission to purchase the Raptor. However, in 1998, Congress explicitly coded into law that the Raptor was not for sale. The F-22 was only designed for the United States. This is in contrast to the F-35, which was built by the United States in cooperation with other nations that participated in the program. Notably, the United Kingdom contributes around 15% to every F-35 produced.

The Raptor is packed with classified technology that the United States wants to remain the sole proprietor of. Once an aircraft is sold, even to a trusted ally like Australia or Japan, then the US has less control over it. The risk is that technology will fall into the wrong hands or enemy nations will learn to exploit any weaknesses. The best way to keep a secret is always to not share it with anyone else.

It is not uncommon for countries to limit the export of their top-tier military equipment. Currently, there is debate over whether the US will be willing to export its new high-end combat aircraft like the B-21 Raider and F-47. It is common for countries to downgrade the capabilities of high-end equipment somewhat in the export market. President Trump recently stated the US would export the F-47 to allies, adding (seemingly arbitrarily) that it could be downgraded by 10% for export.

Trade-offs Of The Export Ban

Initially, the Pentagon had intended to purchase 750 F-22 Raptors. After the Cold War ended and the United States became more focused on counterinsurgency operations, the procurement of the jet was progressively scaled back until finally, only 187 examples were purchased. The Raptor is regarded as the best in the world in its intended role - air dominance. However, it is ill-suited for various other missions. The F-35, by contrast, is designed as a multi-role fighter.

Of the 187 Raptors produced, at least five have been lost to accidents over the years, meaning there are at most 183 usable airframes in Air Force inventory. Of these, 32 are Block 20 training variants that can't be used for combat. According to reporting by Sandboxx News, only around 130 Raptors were ever operational. The actual number of currently operational Raptors is classified, but the publication suggests fewer than 100 Raptors are likely combat-ready at any given time.

The export ban has had major implications for the US Raptor fleet. Not only was the per-unit cost higher due to a lack of economies of scale, but it also meant its production line was shuttered by Lockheed Martin after the Pentagon stopped ordering the jet. Today, that former F-22 production line is supporting the F-35 program. With production shuttered, there is a lack of spare parts, making it more and more difficult for the Air Force to keep its modest fleet of Raptors in the air.

Onto The F-35

By the time Washington may have been open to exporting the F-22, it was already too late. Countries were already moving on, looking to purchase the more versatile F-35 Lightning II. Few countries have the ability to sustain multiple types of high-end fighter jets, much less a dedicated air-superiority fighter like the F-22. The F-35 is a better fit for countries looking for aircraft able to fill multiple roles.

Today, the United States benefits from many countries around the world ordering the F-35. Even if the US were to slash its orders for the jet, these exports would keep the production line humming and ensure the US Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy will have access to a steady stream of new spare parts and components.

While Israel, Australia, and Japan may have liked to have the F-22 Raptor, the F-35 Lightning II also excels in the air superiority role. The capabilities of the F-35 to kick in the door, punch holes in an air defense system, and secure air superiority were recently on full display by Israel over Iran. Iran had been equipped with advanced Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missile air defense systems.

Different Levels Of Export Restrictions

All US fighter jets face varying levels of export restrictions, which tend to be relaxed as the jets age and their technologies become less sensitive. There was a time when the US prohibited all Latin American countries from purchasing its F-16 Fighting Falcon. Although this didn't last, it soon sold the jet to Venezuela and Chile. Today, the US is willing to sell the F-16 to almost any ally or partner nation.

The US was more restrictive with F-15 exports. During the Carter Administration, the US refused to sell the F-15 to any non-NATO nation or outside a select group of allies like Japan, Israel, and Australia. The F-15 is the larger, more expensive, and more capable counterpart to the smaller F-16. In the end, only Japan and some Middle Eastern countries purchased the F-15. In Europe, countries chose to invest in their own programs like the Eurofighter Typhoon and Dassault Rafale.

The F-35 is widely exported to US allies, although the US is very restrictive about whom it sells the aircraft. The US has refused sales to Turkey, Egypt, the UAE, Thailand, Taiwan, Qatar, and other nations, often after agreements to sell the jet were made. That said, the current Trump Administration is willing to sell it to more countries. The US often imposes ""onerous"" conditions on countries purchasing the jet. For example, Israeli pilots with dual passports are banned from flying it.

5th Gen Fighters: To Export Or Not To Export?

The F-22 Raptor ban on exports helped the United States safeguard its most advanced technology. At the same time, the ban aided in dooming the project as there was just less money and orders to sustain it. The decision to ban exports was a calculated trade-off.

While the United States sells its other fighters, it remains selective about which countries it sells them to. The US may be relaxed about the now-aging F-16, but it is highly protective of its F-35s. It does not tolerate other countries modifying the aircraft or its software. The US does not allow export countries to operate the F-35 around advanced Russian and Chinese systems that could gather information on it, including Russian-made S-400 SAMs and Chinese-made Huawei 5G networks.

Among fifth-generation fighters, the F-35 and Russia's Su-57 were designed with the intention of export. Russia's Su-57 has only found a single buyer, Algeria, while the list of countries ordering the F-35 continues to grow. Meanwhile, both the United States' F-22 Raptor and China's J-20 Mighty Dragon have been banned by those countries for export. There is speculation that China will export its new J-35 fighter, possibly as an alternative to countries unable to purchase the US F-35.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/why-the-f-22-is-banned-from-being-sold-to-other-countries.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:06.152813

By combining Sunoco's U.S. retail and wholesale networks with Parkland's Canadian and Caribbean infrastructure, the deal promises to create a vertically integrated powerhouse. For investors, the transaction's 25% premium, $250 million in synergies, and immediate distributable cash flow (DCF) accretion highlight compelling upside. Yet risks like regulatory hurdles and integration complexity loom large. Here's why this deal is a high-reward, high-stakes opportunity.

The 25% Premium: A Bold Move or Fair Value?

The premium—calculated against a 7-day VWAP—reflects Sunoco's confidence in Parkland's asset base, including its 200,000-barrel/day Burnaby refinery and Caribbean terminals. While critics may argue the premium overpays for Parkland's Canadian operations, the structure offers flexibility: shareholders can elect cash (C$44/share) or SUNCorp units (0.536 per share), mitigating perceived overvaluation risks.

This flexibility, coupled with the SUNCorp unit's dividend-equivalent structure (matching Sunoco's distributions for two years post-closing), should stabilize investor sentiment. The dividend mechanism also aligns with Sunoco's history of robust payouts, a critical hook for income-seeking investors.

Synergies and DCF Accretion: The Financial Engine

The $250 million in annual synergies—realized by Year 3—will stem from operational efficiencies:

- Cost Reduction: Consolidating back-office functions and optimizing logistics across 300+ retail sites in Canada and the U.S.

- Margin Expansion: Leveraging Parkland's low-carbon fuel expertise to command premium pricing in regulated markets like California.

- Capital Allocation: Redirecting free cash flow toward high-return projects, such as Parkland's proposed $1 billion expansion of the Burnaby refinery to produce sustainable aviation fuel.

The immediate 10%+ DCF per unit accretion is a game-changer. Sunoco's leverage ratio, which had ballooned to 6x pre-deal, is expected to normalize to 4x within 18 months—a critical step toward restoring credit ratings and lowering borrowing costs.

Geographic Diversification: A Hedge Against Regional Volatility

Sunoco's U.S.-centric model has historically exposed it to regional fuel demand swings. Parkland's Canadian operations, including 1,500 retail sites and 40% of the country's propane distribution, diversify revenue streams. Equally vital is Parkland's Caribbean terminal network, which provides access to high-margin international trade routes.

This diversification isn't just about geography—it's about resilience. In a world where climate policies and energy transitions are reshaping demand, SUNCorp's dual focus on conventional fuels and low-carbon innovation (via Burnaby) positions it to thrive across regulatory regimes.

Risks: Regulatory Hurdles and Integration Headwinds

The deal's success hinges on navigating two major barriers:

1. Regulatory Approvals: The Investment Canada Act review could delay closing beyond late 2025, especially if Canadian authorities demand concessions on jobs or the Burnaby refinery's emissions.

2. Cultural Integration: Merging Sunoco's U.S. corporate culture with Parkland's Canadian management—while retaining Calgary's HQ—will test leadership. Missteps here could erode synergies and employee morale.

Investors should monitor the June 24 shareholder vote closely. A failure to secure the 66⅔% majority would force a messy takeover bid, potentially triggering break fees and legal battles.

Investment Takeaway: A Buy with a Buffer

The SUNCorp structure offers a compelling entry point for investors willing to accept short-term volatility. Key catalysts include:

- Synergy Realization: Track the first $100 million in synergies by Year 1.

- Dividend Stability: Ensure Sunoco maintains its distribution rate as leverage improves.

- Regulatory Clearance: A positive Investment Canada ruling by Q4 2025 would remove a major overhang.

Risk-Adjusted Positioning:

- Bull Case (20% Upside): Synergies exceed $250M, leverage drops to 3.5x, and SUNCorp's stock trades at 12x EV/EBITDA.

- Bear Case (15% Drawdown): Delays in integration, regulatory fines, or a drop in U.S. fuel demand stifle DCF growth.

Recommendation:

Investors with a 2–3 year horizon should accumulate SUNCorp units at current prices, with a 10% buffer for regulatory risk. Pair this with a put option on SUN LP to hedge downside exposure. For income investors, the dividend-equivalent structure makes this a must-watch play in the energy midstream sector.

The acquisition is far from a sure bet, but in an era where scale and diversification define survival, SUNCorp's vision could ignite a renaissance in North American fuel distribution—if execution matches ambition.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:08.880296

Over the last 25 years, aviation has laid the groundwork for its sustainable transition, marked by increasing collaboration between governments and the industry.","The SAF bottleneck

It is a chicken-and-egg problem. While there may be demand for SAF from airlines, supply is limited and prices are projected to remain two to three times higher than jet fuel until 2030. However, it will be hard to boost production and reduce production costs without reaching greater scale.

SAF producers need to be confident that demand will continue to grow and need long-term offtake agreements to obtain the necessary funding to build production facilities from financiers.

According to Paul Griffiths, chief executive officer of Dubai Airports, “The global jet fuel market is worth around $254 billion per year, with SAF representing just 0.7% of total fuel production.”

If SAF production doubles every two years, he says, it would still take over seven and a half years for 10% of total jet fuel to come from sustainable sources.

“It’s a very big problem. It needs a big solution, and it needs huge investment,” says Griffiths.

“Industry and governments have got to work together to create a level playing field of investment that doesn’t incentivize poor behaviour.” He notes that one solution would be a levy on aviation fuel or ticket prices, such as the scheme recently applied in Singapore, where just under $2 per passenger is channelled towards SAF production.

Although it would result in “justifiable” costs being passed on to the consumer, he says “We could actually solve the problem if that was applied on a global basis.” Recently, the UK government also proposed a levy on fossil jet fuel to fund local SAF production.

High-stakes need for policy alignment

The introduction of new measures and regulations to support SAF by an increasing number of countries strengthens the importance of international standards and policy consistency.

To encourage investment and consistent SAF adoption worldwide, SAF policies benefit from international alignment and any subsidies to incentivise their production must provide long-term clarity to investors. If countries don’t act in unison in these areas, policy effectiveness will suffer.

Ayesha Choudhury, chief commercial officer at Infinium – a market leader in ultra-low carbon synthetic efuels – says “policy certainty” is key: “predictable revenue… that’s enabled by policy certainty… is really important for off-takers to be able to commit to the long- term agreements that are necessary to get the plants built.”

A great risk is that geopolitical headwinds can slow down aviation decarbonization efforts. Increasing protectionism and tariffs are sparking particular concern among aviation executives.

Geopolitical tensions are destabilizing exports of feedstock, the raw material for SAF, as well as fuelling domestic energy security concerns. With supply chains under stress, feedstock prices are rising, further squeezing the margins of active SAF plants and affecting their production outlooks.

In addition to political risks, magnified by last year’s “super elections” that threaten to shift government priorities and lead to policy reversals, there are also economic ones.

Despite lower inflation and strong growth in the aviation sector, with revenues exceeding $1 trillion for the first time this year, the global economic outlook remains a concern for aviation executives, particularly in emerging markets.

Net zero is within reach

Route closures, rising labour costs, supply chain bottlenecks and regulatory uncertainty are impacting profitability and could divert the sector’s focus from the net-zero agenda.

This is a critical moment for the aviation industry. Updated state action plans for decarbonization are due to be submitted to the International Civil Aviation Organisation by September, as stakeholders try to walk the fine line between accelerating decarbonization and boosting the sector’s growth in the wake of COVID-19.

Actions taken now will determine the viability of internationally agreed targets, such as reducing the carbon intensity of jet fuel by 5% by 2030.

Achieving net-zero aviation by 2050 is well within our collective grasp. SAF will undoubtedly play a key role in this journey, especially in the short to medium term. But it will not, by itself, be enough.

As other technologies become increasingly available, swift and concerted action – from governments and regulators to airports, airlines and businesses along the wider value chain – will be critical.

Over the last 25 years, aviation has laid the groundwork for its sustainable transition, marked by increasing collaboration between governments and the industry. This must continue to help aviation reach net zero by 2050.

SAF, czyli Sustainable Aviation Fuel, to paliwo, które w przeciwieństwie do tradycyjnej ropy naftowej, powstaje z surowców odnawialnych lub odpadowych. Mogą to być np. oleje posmażalnicze, odpady rolnicze, komunalne, a nawet resztki z przemysłu drzewnego.

Brzmi jak coś, co normalnie trafia na wysypisko? Zgadza się. Ale nowoczesne technologie pozwalają zamienić te niepozorne surowce w pełnoprawne paliwo lotnicze, które może być używane w takich samych silnikach, jakie dziś napędzają Boeingi czy Airbusy.

SAF to konkretna odpowiedź na potrzeby współczesnego świata, paliwo, które redukuje emisje CO2 nawet o 80 proc. w całym cyklu życia, czyli od momentu produkcji, przez transport, aż po spalenie w silniku samolotu. To właśnie dlatego Unia Europejska tak mocno naciska na jego wdrożenie.

SAF nie wymaga przebudowy samolotów. To mieszanka odnawialnego komponentu z klasycznym paliwem typu JET-A1. Dzięki temu linie lotnicze mogą z dnia na dzień zmniejszyć emisję swoich operacji, bez kosztownych inwestycji w nowe technologie.

A korzyści są konkretne i globalne. Lotnictwo odpowiada za około 3 - 4 proc. światowej emisji gazów cieplarnianych. Wydaje się niewiele? Może. Ale problem w tym, że emisje z tego sektora bardzo trudno ograniczyć, bo trudno przecież zasilić samolot z gniazdka, jak samochód elektryczny.

Dlatego SAF to dziś jeden z niewielu realnych sposobów na dekarbonizację lotnictwa.

Nowe paliwo dostępne jest już na trzech polskich lotniskach: w Warszawie (Lotnisko Chopina), Krakowie (Balice) oraz Katowicach (Pyrzowice). Dlaczego akurat tam? To właśnie te porty przekraczają wymagane przez Unię Europejską progi obsługiwanych pasażerów i cargo odpowiednio 800 tys. pasażerów i 100 tys. ton towarów rocznie.

Rozporządzenie ReFuelEU Aviation, które weszło w życie w 2025 r., zobowiązuje duże lotniska i operatorów paliw do wprowadzania SAF do swojej oferty. Na start minimum to 2 proc. całkowitej sprzedaży paliwa.

Ale to dopiero początek. Do 2030 r. udział SAF ma wzrosnąć do 6 proc., w 2035 r. do 20 proc., a w 2050 r. aż do 70 proc. Ambitnie? Owszem. Ale niezbędnie, jeśli chcemy zatrzymać zmiany klimatyczne.

Więcej o paliwach lotniczych na Spider's Web:

Aktualnie komponent SAF wykorzystywany przez Orlen pochodzi z zagranicy. Ale to rozwiązanie tymczasowe. Koncern buduje właśnie w Płocku nowoczesną instalację HVO (uwodornienia olejów roślinnych), która pozwoli na lokalną produkcję paliwa lotniczego z używanych olejów spożywczych, dokładnie takich, jakie wylewamy po smażeniu frytek.

To nie tylko ekologiczne, ale i gospodarczo uzasadnione: mniejsze uzależnienie od importu, większa kontrola nad jakością i kosztami.

Orlen nie poprzestaje na biopaliwach. W ramach europejskiego projektu HySPARK koncern planuje budowę stacji tankowania wodoru przy warszawskim Lotnisku Chopina. Wodorowe pojazdy będą wykorzystywane przez naziemną obsługę lotniska.

Mowa m.in. o ciągnikach bagażowych, autobusach i pojazdach technicznych. To kolejny krok w kierunku pełnej dekarbonizacji transportu lotniczego nie tylko w powietrzu, ale i na ziemi.

Choć SAF to nie lekarstwo na wszystkie bolączki klimatyczne, to ważny i konkretny krok naprzód. I choć dziś mowa tylko o trzech lotniskach i kilku procentach udziału w rynku paliw, za kilka lat ta technologia może być standardem, a nie wyjątkiem.

I właśnie takie zmiany chcemy widzieć częściej.",https://cdn-sw.spidersweb.pl/2025/07/orlen-paliwo-lotnicze.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 11:13:19.671624

Dari sosialisasi yang menjangkau ratusan warga, penanaman pohon dalam skala besar, hingga pelatihan petani kelapa sawit, inisiatif ini telah menunjukkan dampak nyata di tiga desa binaan yang terletak di Kecamatan Bengalon, yaitu Desa Tepian Indah, Desa Tepian Langsat, dan Desa Tepian Makmur.

Dirancang dengan pendekatan holistik, program ini berfokus pada empat prioritas utama, yaitu meningkatkan ketahanan mata pencaharian masyarakat melalui pemberdayaan, mempromosikan perlindungan dan konservasi hutan, mendorong transformasi rantai pasok, serta memperkuat kolaborasi dengan pemerintah daerah dan para pemangku kepentingan.

Salah satu fokus utama program SLV adalah perlindungan lingkungan melalui upaya penghijauan yang konsisten. Sebagai bagian dari target jangka panjang untuk menanam 90.000 pohon dalam tiga tahun, Apical Group telah berhasil menanam 30.000 pohon sepanjang tahun pertama.

Inisiatif ini berlanjut pada 9 Juli 2025 dengan penanaman 2.000 pohon tambahan untuk membuka tahun kedua. Kegiatan ini melibatkan 83 peserta dari berbagai unsur, termasuk dinas pemerintah, aparat desa, masyarakat, serta beberapa supplier Apical Group, seperti PT Bima Palma, PT Anugrah Energitama, dan PT Kutai Balian Nauli.

“Kami tidak hanya berhasil memenuhi target tahun pertama, tetapi justru melampauinya. Dari penanaman 30.000 pohon hingga pelatihan ratusan petani kelapa sawit, ini mencerminkan besarnya komitmen dan partisipasi masyarakat dalam mewujudkan desa yang berkelanjutan.” ujar CSR Manager Apical Group Agus Wiastono.

“Capaian ini menjadi fondasi kuat bagi langkah kami ke depan untuk menciptakan dampak yang lebih luas dan berkelanjutan di tahun-tahun berikutnya” tambahnya.

Selain aksi lingkungan, program ini juga memberikan perhatian besar pada peningkatan kapasitas petani kelapa sawit. Sepanjang tahun pertama, sebanyak 459 petani swadaya telah mengikuti pelatihan Best Management Practices (BMP), jauh melampaui target awal sebanyak 150 petani.

Tahun kedua dimulai dengan pelatihan lanjutan di Desa Tepian Indah pada 8 Juli, di mana 26 petani mempelajari teknik memilih bibit unggul dan metode pembibitan sawit yang tepat bersama mitra utama Earthworm Foundation.

Kemajuan juga terlihat dalam aspek legalitas. SLV turut mendampingi petani untuk memperoleh Surat Tanda Daftar Budidaya (STDB) sebagai pengakuan formal atas usaha mereka. Hingga kini, sebanyak 88 STDB telah diserahkan dari target 500 selama tiga tahun pelaksanaan. STDB ini penting untuk memberikan akses pembiayaan dan mendukung proses sertifikasi keberlanjutan seperti Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) dan Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).

Mendukung keberlanjutan ekonomi, program SLV juga mengembangkan alternatif mata pencaharian. Salah satu dari dua demonstration plot (demplot) kakao telah selesai dibangun dan mulai difungsikan sebagai lahan percontohan budidaya kakao yang baik.

Secara keseluruhan, seluruh rangkaian kegiatan dalam program SLV menunjukkan bahwa keberlanjutan tidak hanya berbicara tentang pelestarian lingkungan, tetapi juga menyentuh langsung kesejahteraan sosial dan ekonomi masyarakat.

Program SLV di Kutai Timur menjadi perwujudan nyata dari filosofi 5C Apical Group—Community, Country, Climate, Customer, dan Company—yang mendorong sinergi antara perusahaan, pemerintah, dan masyarakat dalam membangun desa yang tangguh serta masa depan yang lebih hijau dan berkelanjutan.

Menggoreng tentu tidak terlepas dari penggunaan minyak goreng, dimana selalu digunakan untuk menggoreng dan biasanya minyak yang digunakan untuk menggoreng ikan itu tidak akan digunakan lagi.

Minyak goreng biasanya setelah digunakan menggoreng ikan, ataupun daging maka tidak akan lagi digunakan karena warna gosong kehitaman akan merusak warna, sehingga biasanya minyak goreng bekas pakai, atau jelantah itu biasanya dibuang.

Setiap kali kita menyalakan wajan untuk menggoreng, kita tak hanya memasak makanan, kita sedang menciptakan peluang energi bersih yang selama ini terbuang sia-sia. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan benar, jelantah dapat menjadi fondasi bagi upaya Indonesia membangun industri bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan, yaitu Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang kini menjadi kebutuhan global.

Riset Traction Energy Asia memperkirakan, rumah tangga Indonesia membuang sedikitnya 1,2 juta kiloliter minyak goreng bekas setiap tahun. Jumlah ini belum termasuk dari sektor komersial seperti restoran, industri makanan, serta hotel, yang jika ditotal dapat mendorong volume realistis hingga sekitar 3 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Angka tersebut kini berpotensi meningkat seiring peluncuran program Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG) yang digagas pemerintah, melibatkan sekitar 32.000 dapur umum untuk menyajikan makanan setiap hari kepada lebih dari 82 juta siswa. Jika satu dapur umum menggunakan rata-rata 800 liter minyak per bulan, maka program MBG sendiri dapat menambah sekitar 300 ribu kiloliter jelantah setiap tahun.

Dengan demikian, potensi minyak goreng bekas yang dapat dikumpulkan secara nasional dapat mencapai 4,5 juta kiloliter per tahun. Angka ini tidak lagi dapat diabaikan, khususnya dalam konteks pencarian sumber energi rendah karbon yang tidak berbasis lahan baru.

Teknologi pengolahan jelantah menjadi SAF, seperti proses hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), telah terbukti mampu mengonversi satu liter jelantah menjadi sekitar 0,8 liter bahan bakar jet rendah emisi. Artinya, hanya dengan memanfaatkan separuh dari total jelantah nasional, Indonesia dapat menghasilkan hingga 1,8 juta kiloliter SAF per tahun. Perlu dicatat juga bahwa lebih dari separuh kebutuhan avtur domestik tahun 2023 yang tercatat sebesar 3,5 juta kiloliter.",https://assets.pikiran-rakyat.com/crop/0x0:0x0/1200x675/photo/2025/07/13/488398041.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 13:03:23.156367

Fadnavis stated that the airport will feature an advanced baggage-handling system using 360-degree barcode scanners to ensure accurate and quick sorting. He said efforts are being made to create the world’s fastest baggage claim system. Once both runways are functional, the airport will be capable of handling up to 90 million passengers annually. The airport will surpass the current Mumbai airport in size and functionality. By 2032, it is expected to handle up to 2.5 million tonnes of cargo. The domestic cargo terminal will cover 360,000 sq ft, while the international one will span 255,000 sq ft.

Infrastructure, Terminals, and Capacity Highlights

CM Fadnavis mentioned that more than 13,000 workers are currently on site, and more manpower will be deployed to meet the ambitious September deadline. All commercial licensing work is progressing simultaneously to ensure that operations can begin immediately after inauguration. The airport will have two runways and four terminal buildings, capable of parking 350 aircraft at once. Despite having multiple terminals, passengers will be able to access their flights easily from any terminal. The internal design ensures smooth and efficient passenger movement across the facility.

Project Timeline and Development Background

Located in Ulwe within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, planning for the Navi Mumbai airport began in 1990 and gained momentum in the 2000s. The foundation stone was laid by PM Modi in February 2018. The project is spread over 1,160 hectares. CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation) handled pre-development work, including river redirection, power line relocation, and land preparation. The airport is being developed by NMIAL (Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited), a joint venture between Adani Airport Holdings Ltd (74%) and CIDCO (26%).

Funding and Eco-Friendly Airport Design

The financial closure of the project occurred in March 2022, with the State Bank of India sanctioning Rs 12,770 crore out of the total project cost of Rs 19,647 crore. The airport features a distinctive lotus-inspired architectural design, paying tribute to India’s national flower. It is being built as a green airport, with 37 MW of renewable energy integrated into its functioning. Only electric or alternative-fuel vehicles will be used within the premises. There are plans to scale up the use of sustainable aviation fuel, making the airport a significant hub for eco-friendly air travel.

New-Age Baggage and Passenger Experience

Fadnavis stated that plans are underway to introduce city-based baggage check-in facilities so that travelers can arrive at the airport baggage-free. This initiative will significantly enhance the overall passenger experience. A massive 1,630,000 sq ft fuel farm and three aircraft hangars will also be part of the airport infrastructure. These advanced features reflect the airport’s goal of becoming a future-ready aviation hub. The CM assured that every element of the airport is being designed to set a benchmark in both efficiency and passenger convenience.

Seamless Multimodal Connectivity

The airport will be just 10 minutes from Panvel and easily accessible via roadways, metro lines, and suburban railway systems. It will be linked to Navi Mumbai Metro Line 1 and Mumbai’s Metro Line 8 (Gold Line). It will also serve as the starting point for the proposed Mumbai-Hyderabad high-speed rail line. Connectivity will further be strengthened by the Sewri-Nhava Sheva Trans-Harbor Link (MTHL), and the Coastal Road connection via Atal Setu is expected to finish by March next year. A direct elevated road from Thane is also under consideration.

Advanced In-Airport Transportation Plans

In the second phase of development, a metro-style train will operate within the airport premises, connecting all four terminals. This will eliminate the need for passengers to walk long distances or deal with vehicle congestion. The internal system will include travelators and will be designed to ensure no terminal is more than 500 meters from any gate. Fadnavis stated that the planning is already in motion for these features. Additionally, the airport will be linked to India’s upcoming bullet train network and the city’s expanding metro rail infrastructure.

The knowledge paper was released today at the 4th ACFI Annual Conclave in New Delhi. With India’s air cargo volumes projected to triple to 10 million metric tonnes per annum (MTPA) by 2030, the paper highlights the sectors rapid evolution, driven by the e-commerce boom, policy momentum, greenfield infrastructure and rising demand for high-value cargo, such as pharmaceuticals and perishables.

As part of the strategic roadmap for the air cargo industry, ACFI is proud to announce landmark partnership with The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) that will significantly bolster both regional connectivity and global knowledge sharing. Also, soon ACFI will be signing MoU’s with Government of Tripura and Government of Madhya Pradesh.

Speaking at the launch, Mr. Sanjiv Edward, President, ACFI, said, “The Indian air cargo sector is at a pivotal inflection point and undergoing rapid transformation. At this crucial juncture, this knowledge paper outlines the strategic roadmap until 2030, infrastructure requirements, policy reforms, and the initiatives by the air cargo industry to achieve the ambitious target of 10 MTPA of air cargo volumes set by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, Government of India. This paper has laid down a clear action plan for all stakeholders of the industry. India is uniquely positioned to redefine global cargo corridors. With bold policy reforms and strategic investments, we can build a resilient, digitised, and world-class logistics ecosystem.”

Shri. Piyush Srivastava, Sr. Economic Advisor, Ministry Of Civil Aviation said, “Air infrastructure today faces key global dichotomies-demand is rapidly growing in the Eastern Hemisphere, while critical services like manufacturing and MRO remain concentrated in the West. This imbalance is bound to shift. As demand grows, supply will follow. Its not just about Made in India; its about Make in India-a strategic priority for us moving forward.”

He further added, “The Aviation sector is highly sensitive to global geopolitical shifts. While events like the Red Sea crisis have offered temporary advantages for the Indian air cargo system. But prolonged airspace closures over Pakistan and over three years of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, have significantly disrupted operations and increased costs. These challenges are not only unpredictable but inevitable. The only sustainable path forward lies in embracing technology, innovation, and disruption.“

Speaking at the launch, Dheeraj Rastogi, Principal Commissioner Customs, Delhi, “India’s customs operations have undergone a significant transformation-from early digitization efforts to the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, and risk-based segmentation,” stated Mr. Dheeraj Rastogi. These innovations have contributed to a substantial reduction in transaction costs and improved the overall efficiency of cargo processing.”

He further added, “Currently, 52% of air cargo is cleared on the same day, with average clearance time at Delhi Air Cargo reduced from 41 hours to 35 hours. The department remains committed to maintaining a fine balance between revenue mobilization, national security, trade facilitation, and legal compliance. Given the increasing complexities introduced by e-commerce, a collaborative, data-driven approach between industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities is imperative. Our collective goal must be to build a seamless, AI-enabled ecosystem that supports India’s emergence as a global leader in air cargo logistics.”

According to Mr. Glyn Hughes, Director General, TIACA, “With TIACA representing the entire air cargo supply chain and ACFI representing the Indian air cargo industry, it is crucial we work together so that the world can receive Indian exports efficiently and bring the best practices achieved in other countries. Globally, every year, goods worth US$9 trillion are transported through air cargo, accounting for one-third of global trade. India is at the heart of the growing global trade, and we will work toward making air cargo an integral part of it. TIACA, with its global memberships, would be able to act as a support to the Indian air cargo industry in the fields of digitalisation, enhanced usage of modern technology, including AI and adoption of other global standards.”

Together with the Ministry of Civil Aviation, ACFI is shaping a forward-looking roadmap to meet the growing demands of domestic and international logistics. These partnerships reflect ACFI’s unwavering commitment to building a resilient, efficient and globally competitive air cargo ecosystem that supports India’s economic aspirations.

Key findings of the knowledge report

Capacity Concentration: 82% of air cargo is currently handled by just six airports (Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai and Kolkata), amplifying concentration risk and operational inefficiencies.

Growth Enablers: Digitisation, strategic airport locations in India, integrated multimodal corridors (PM Gati Shakti), and emerging connectivity in tier-2 cities.

Regulatory Gaps: Scalability of the sector is hindered by fragmented clearance systems, high dwell times (almost 12 hours for exports and 48 hours for imports) and limited transhipment readiness.

Investment Heatmap: High potential in cold-chain operations, Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production, automation and freighter fleet expansion.

The secondary airports have the potential to play a critical role. The Government of India’s initiative to significantly enhance air connectivity across India will give the required boost to the air cargo sector. At present, these secondary airports are underutilised due to poor infrastructure and limited airline networks.

The report highlights the strategic action areas to triple air cargo handling to 10 MTPA by 2030. These strategic actions include:

Creation of transhipment hubs with 24×7 clearance and zero rescreening

National Unified Digital Clearance Window and Cargo Command Centres

Freighter acquisition incentives and plug-and-play terminals across regional hubs

ESG integration via green infrastructure, SAF blending, and inclusive workforce practices

Global Inspiration, Local Action: Drawing on best practices from Singapore, Frankfurt and Dubai, the report advocates for modular warehousing, predictive slot allocation, and unified cargo community systems to manage rerouted and time-sensitive freight.

The paper serves as a call to action for industry, government, and private stakeholders to forge collaborative pathways and enhance India’s role in international trade and economic growth.

With governments and companies across Europe ploughing money into sustainable aviation technologies, cleaner, quieter and cheaper flying might soon be a reality.","Aviation remains one of the largest sources of carbon emissions, and given the rise of electric cars, electric flight has become a viable solution for the sector. This week, Beta Technologies took a big step forward when it completed the first-ever test flight of an electric plane in Denmark. Named ALIA CTOL, or Conventional Take-Off and Landing, the electric fixed-wing aircraft flew 200 kilometers between Sønderborg and Copenhagen airports, illustrating the potential for electric air travel on regional routes.

The US-based Beta Technologies created the ALIA CTOL as a small, energy-efficient plane, with a wingspan of only 15 meters, which is roughly the same size as a Sprinter van. Not as a big, but it can fly at a speed of 281 km/h. The most striking thing about this flying machine, though, is just how green it is: it generates up to 84% less carbon dioxide than a comparable conventional helicopter. This makes lighter-than-air a great choice for both passengers and cargo, with the added bonus of lower noise levels and a lower price point.

The future has started,” said Jákup Sverri Kass, the director of Sønderborg Airport, at the launch event. This is not just a test. This is the beginning of something new.” In fact, the accomplishment of ALIA CTOL’s flight marks for the major breakthrough for the electric aviation industry, which already kicked off on its journey through Europe. The aircraft is now on the European leg of its tour which started in May at Shannon Airport in Ireland. It would still display its all-electric services and charging infrastructure at several airports on the continent.

The Challenges of Electric Aviation

The positive news from Denmark for aircraft may be a good thing, but the industry is far from in the clear, and one of the biggest issues for them is charging infrastructure. As things stand, ALIA-CTOL uses truck car batteries and stops frequently to recharge at airfields. “There’s no infrastructure already on the ground in Europe like we have today in the United States,” said Shawn Hall, the chief revenue officer of Beta Technologies. That should change as airports, including Copenhagen Airport, move to suit the requirements of electric aviation. Christian Poulsen, CEO of Copenhagen Airport, noted that the airport will also have to be able to charge conventional and electric aircraft.

A second big hurdle for electric aviation is battery expense. The same concerns expressed about electric cars, around pricey batteries and lightweight materials, persist. Jørgen Mads Clausen, the chair emeritus of the Danish battery systems giant Danfoss, recently predicted that computer battery technology could support more significant electric aircraft in ten years. But he added, “You need to be ready when things take off. For when things do move quickly, with ripe technology.

The Future for Sustainable Aviation

The swift progress of electric aircraft is part of a wider European ambition to shrink the carbon footprint of aviation. Denmark is one of the trendsetters, it is planning to create its first sustainable domestic flight route by 2025, with an ultimate goal of making all domestic flights fossil-free by 2030. The Danish government, seeking to finance a move to green aviation, has proposed a flat fee of 13 Danish kroner (€1.74) per passenger for the same cause. Other Nordic countries are making similar inroads, with Norway planning for all domestic flights to be electric or hybrid by 2040 while Sweden hopes to have fossil-free domestic flights in place by 2030.

Sweden’s Heart Aerospace is also working on an electric plane, the ES-30, a 30-passenger plane with a fully battery-powered range of 200 kilometers. Although the range of electric planes is on limited area flights at this point the technology is more suited for short-haul transport within Europe. However, while electric flight is a positive step, it’s believed that other technologies including Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and hydrogen fuel may still also be needed for countries to reach their sustainability targets.

Lasse Stenhøj Ingvardsen, team manager at Renewable Energy Systems at the Danish Technological Institute, stressed that multiple technologies were needed to provide a sustainable future for aviation. “We don’t have to stick to just one,” he said. “Electric will be one tool. There should be hydrogen planes perhaps, and hybrid solutions will also have a role to play.”

Global Progress on Electric Aviation

Electric aviation is not just a phenomenon in Europe. Electric aircraft are also being developed in the United States. Companies such as Joby Aviation and Electra. aero are developing similar aircraft for urban air mobility and regional commerce. Improvements in battery technology, too, could make electric-powered planes a more practical option for commercial aviation in the future.

Still with a way to go, the success of ALIA and CTOL based engines in Denmark is a watershed for the industry. With governments and companies across Europe ploughing money into sustainable aviation technologies, cleaner, quieter and cheaper flying might soon be a reality.

A Green Future for Aviation?

As electric planes advance, the opportunity to shave emissions from aviation is unmistakable. There are still obstacles, battery expenses and infrastructure requirements among them, but the growing number of tests and even successful launches of electric planes demonstrates the image of a greener future for aviation is closer than we think. The increasing number of successful projects, among them the Beta Technologies’ ALIA CTOL, leaves us optimistic that sometime in the near future, we might behold a world where electric planes are as ordinary as their fossil-fueled equivalents.

So in conclusion, the electric aviation revolution is only getting started, and the first test findings show the first steps in a more climate friendly future beneath us in the air.",https://www.travelandtourworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/freepik__the-style-is-candid-image-photography-with-natural__53483-1.jpg,N,,2025-07-13 04:02:57.267131

Navi Mumbai Airport First Passenger Flight

Approximately 94% of construction work at the Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMI) is complete.

Advertisement

The target for commercial operations has been firmly set for September 30, 2025, with final inspections and preparations currently underway.

The airport is expected to be inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who also performed its foundation ceremony.

NMIA will become one of the most technologically advanced airports in India, with a focus on high-speed operations, sustainability, and smart passenger services.

A standout feature is its high-efficiency baggage handling system, using 360 degree barcode scanners to enhance speed and accuracy, with the goal of becoming the fastest baggage claim system in the world.

Advanced Infrastructure

NMIA is designed to eventually operate with two parallel runways and will be capable of handling up to 90 million passengers annually, a significant expansion compared to Mumbai’s existing airport.

The terminal building is nearly complete, with final interior and facade works ongoing. Over 13,000 workers are currently deployed to meet the September deadline, with an additional workforce planned to accelerate remaining tasks.

In terms of scale and technology, the airport will surpass most in India, offering ultra-modern facilities, sustainable fuel operations, and passenger-friendly systems.

Authorities are actively securing final commercial licenses in parallel with construction completion.

The NMIA project is being developed as a green airport, using 37 MW of renewable energy, with a commitment to operate all vehicles on electric or alternative fuels. Plans are also in place to make NMIA a major hub for sustainable aviation fuel.

The airport spans 1,160 hectares, with pre-development works such as river diversion and land preparation managed by CIDCO (City and Industrial Development Corporation).

The project secured financial closure in March 2022, with ₹12,770 crore funded by the State Bank of India out of a total cost of ₹19,647 crore.

Seamless Access

Connectivity is a top priority for NMIA. Infrastructure projects linking Atal Setu to the Coastal Road, and a proposed elevated expressway from Thane, are being fast-tracked.

Additionally, passengers will benefit from four-directional access via suburban rail, metro lines, highways, and water transport.

Innovative features such as remote baggage check-in in multiple cities are being introduced, allowing travelers to reach the airport baggage-free.

Internally, the airport will deploy an underground terminal train system in its second phase, ensuring easy and vehicle-free transit within terminals.

Naming Approval

The Maharashtra government has sent a naming proposal for NMIA to the Central Government.

Chief Minister Fadnavis and Deputy CM Eknath Shinde plan to follow up with the Prime Minister’s Office to finalize the airport’s official name before its inauguration.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn’t as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.

“This purported attempt to incentivize ‘clean fuels’ is little more than a giveaway to the conventional biofuels industry,” the organization said in a post on its website.",,N,,2025-07-13 11:14:07.834386

Setiap kali kita menyalakan wajan untuk menggoreng, kita tak hanya memasak makanan, kita sedang menciptakan peluang energi bersih yang selama ini terbuang sia-sia. Padahal, jika dikelola dengan benar, jelantah dapat menjadi fondasi bagi upaya Indonesia membangun industri bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan, yaitu Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) yang kini menjadi kebutuhan global.

Riset Traction Energy Asia memperkirakan, rumah tangga Indonesia membuang sedikitnya 1,2 juta kiloliter minyak goreng bekas setiap tahun. Jumlah ini belum termasuk dari sektor komersial seperti restoran, industri makanan, serta hotel, yang jika ditotal dapat mendorong volume realistis hingga sekitar 3 juta kiloliter per tahun.

Angka tersebut kini berpotensi meningkat seiring peluncuran program Makan Bergizi Gratis (MBG) yang digagas pemerintah, melibatkan sekitar 32.000 dapur umum untuk menyajikan makanan setiap hari kepada lebih dari 82 juta siswa. Jika satu dapur umum menggunakan rata-rata 800 liter minyak per bulan, maka program MBG sendiri dapat menambah sekitar 300 ribu kiloliter jelantah setiap tahun.

Dengan demikian, potensi minyak goreng bekas yang dapat dikumpulkan secara nasional dapat mencapai 4,5 juta kiloliter per tahun. Angka ini tidak lagi dapat diabaikan, khususnya dalam konteks pencarian sumber energi rendah karbon yang tidak berbasis lahan baru.

Teknologi pengolahan jelantah menjadi SAF, seperti proses hydroprocessed esters and fatty acids (HEFA), telah terbukti mampu mengonversi satu liter jelantah menjadi sekitar 0,8 liter bahan bakar jet rendah emisi. Artinya, hanya dengan memanfaatkan separuh dari total jelantah nasional, Indonesia dapat menghasilkan hingga 1,8 juta kiloliter SAF per tahun. Perlu dicatat juga bahwa lebih dari separuh kebutuhan avtur domestik tahun 2023 yang tercatat sebesar 3,5 juta kiloliter.

Langkah awal ke arah itu sudah dimulai. Kilang hijau milik Pertamina di Cilacap telah mengantongi sertifikasi ISCC dan tunduk pada skema CORSIA, dua prasyarat utama untuk memasuki pasar SAF global. Kilang ini akan mulai mengolah 6.000 barel jelantah per hari pada 2025, dengan kapasitas tahunan mencapai 300.000 kiloliter. Jika kilang serupa dibangun di Balongan dan Dumai, kapasitas nasional dapat berkembang secara signifikan.

Namun, kapasitas produksi tidak dapat berdiri sendiri tanpa sistem pasokan yang andal dan kebijakan yang mendukung. Singapura, misalnya, sejak 2017 telah menetapkan kebijakan bahwa semua pengumpul jelantah harus memiliki lisensi resmi.

Setiap liter minyak bekas dari restoran wajib diserahkan kepada kolektor terdaftar yang diawasi secara digital oleh National Environment Agency. Langkah ini bukan hanya menutup ruang bagi peredaran ""gutter oil"", tetapi juga memastikan bahwa kilang SAF mendapat bahan baku yang bersih dan dapat ditelusuri.

Indonesia, sayangnya, belum memiliki sistem pengelolaan jelantah yang terstruktur. Undang-Undang Nomor 32 Tahun 2009 tentang Perlindungan dan Pengelolaan Lingkungan Hidup sebenarnya telah memberi dasar hukum untuk pengelolaan limbah sebagai sumber daya alternatif.

Demikian pula Peraturan Presiden No. 98 Tahun 2021 tentang Nilai Ekonomi Karbon memberikan kerangka untuk insentif berbasis emisi. Namun hingga kini belum ada regulasi yang mewajibkan penyerahan jelantah ke kolektor bersertifikat, baik dari dapur MBG maupun pelaku usaha makanan.

Salah satu langkah yang dapat diambil pemerintah adalah menerbitkan peraturan turunan dalam bentuk Peraturan Menteri LHK atau ESDM mengenai kewajiban serah jelantah. Sistem pelacakan berbasis QR code, sebagaimana dilakukan di sektor kehutanan, dapat digunakan untuk menjamin keterlacakan dan mencegah kebocoran pasokan ke jalur ilegal.

Di sisi fiskal, sebagian kecil insentif BBM fosil dapat dikonversi menjadi kredit karbon berbasis intensitas emisi untuk mendorong produksi SAF. Dengan efisiensi emisi lebih dari 80% dibandingkan avtur konvensional, SAF dari jelantah berhak mendapatkan dukungan fiskal tertinggi.

Kementerian Perhubungan pun telah menyusun rencana kewajiban pencampuran SAF sebesar 1% pada 2027 dan meningkat menjadi 2,5% pada 2030 untuk penerbangan internasional. Namun rencana ini baru bersifat indikatif dan belum memiliki dasar hukum yang mengikat. Untuk memberi kepastian investasi bagi produsen dan maskapai, dibutuhkan penguatan dalam bentuk peraturan presiden.

Manfaat dari kebijakan semacam ini akan bersifat jamak. Secara ekonomi, SAF dari jelantah dapat menjadi komoditas ekspor baru, dengan potensi surplus ekspor hingga 850 juta liter per tahun dan devisa kotor yang diperkirakan mencapai US$ 340 juta.

Secara lingkungan, menurut riset NASA, pencampuran SAF 50% dalam mesin jet dapat menurunkan emisi partikel halus hingga 70%, sehingga berpotensi membuat udara lebih bersih bagi kota-kota besar seperti Jakarta dan Surabaya. Secara sosial, program ini berpeluang membuka ribuan lapangan kerja hijau baru sekaligus mengurangi risiko kesehatan akibat penggunaan ulang minyak goreng dalam skala rumah tangga.

Transformasi jelantah menjadi bahan bakar penerbangan berkelanjutan bukanlah skenario yang muluk. Ia justru lahir dari kenyataan sehari-hari yang selama ini diabaikan. Dari dapur rumah, warung kaki lima, hingga kantin sekolah, Indonesia sebenarnya telah menghasilkan bahan baku energi terbarukan yang potensial. Yang dibutuhkan kini hanyalah keberanian untuk menyusun kebijakan yang tegas, terintegrasi, dan berpihak pada masa depan.

Langit bersih dan ekonomi energi yang berdaulat tak harus dibangun dari ladang baru atau tambang tambahan. Ia bisa dimulai dari sisa minyak yang kita buang setiap hari, selama ada niat untuk mengaturnya secara bijak.

KUCHING, July 12: Cow dung, which produces methane, can be harnessed to generate hydrogen fuel as part of Sarawak’s green energy agenda, says Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.

Speaking at the International Day of Forests 2025 celebration today, Abang Johari said even livestock waste such as cow dung can be monetised through clean technology under the State’s circular economy model.

“If there are a lot of cows, you know the thing (cow dung) that they produce?

“The waste that comes out of the cows contains a lot of hydrogen, because it produces methane. And from that, it produces more hydrogen which we can use,” he said at the event held at Forest Research Center.

He emphasised that Sarawak is shifting away from a linear approach to waste by turning organic by-products into valuable resources, benefitting both the environment and economy.

As part of this effort, the State government has allocated RM30 million through Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA) to pioneer a circular economy project in Lubok Antu, aimed at converting palm oil waste into biomass and biofuel.

“Right now, we grow oil palm and sell the palm oil, but we don’t process or manage the waste it produces.

“So in Lubok Antu, together with SALCRA, we launched a new initiative with an investment of RM30 million to process the palm kernel into biomass and biofuel. The biomass can then be used to produce animal feed,” he explained.

The Premier said trials using the feed on cows and goats have shown that the animals respond well to the locally produced biomass feed.

With livestock prices surging, especially during festive seasons such as Hari Raya Korban, he pointed out that this strategy can help reduce animal feed costs.

“Our animals are now expensive. During Hari Raya Korban season, we have to pay RM12,000 per cow. That’s why the faces of our YBs (elected representatives) went sour because we have to pay RM12,000 for each cow,” he revealed.

He also said the biofuel produced from palm waste can be refined into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) to power aeroplanes.

Abang Johari also shared that his now-viral remark from a recent ASEAN Women Economic Summit 2025 (AWES 2025) keynote address in Kuala Lumpur—“Don’t waste the waste, monetise the waste”—has gained regional traction.

“I said, ‘don’t waste the waste, monetise the waste’. It became a quotation taken from them,” he disclosed.

He said these efforts are part of Sarawak’s Sustainability Blueprint, which integrates development in urban areas, agriculture and society in line with the United Nations’ ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) goals.

For example, agricultural waste is a “promising source” for 2-G biofuels.
Clearly, India needs to drive its technological edge to reap the benefits of biofuels, and blunt the negative effects.","It is a great ‘E Square-E Square’ win-win model. But then it clashes with the ‘F Square-F Square’ conundrum, with both positive benefits and allied challenges. Finally, there is invariably the ‘T’ factor that needs to be addressed.

The use of biofuels, or energy from organic sources (food crops and waste), as opposed to fossil fuels (coal, crude oil, and natural gas), offers a globally-relevant, economically-attractive, grandly-sustainable, environment-friendly, and citizen-centric solution to a host of current problems.

It is emerging as a panacea to tackle critical issues that not only threaten our lifestyles and economies, but the future of Planet Earth.

For instance, biofuels offer Earth Security, or saving of the planet, via Environment Security since they lead to a drastic reduction of harmful carbon emissions, and negate Climate Change effects, which are the ‘Achilles Heel’ of fossilised fuels.

Organic energy sources enable Economic Security, as they enhance Energy Security because they are easily produced domestically, and they dramatically lower imports of crude and gas that result in huge forex savings.

According to a document released during the recent G-20 Summit held in New Delhi, “there is vast feedstock potential to be unlocked which could result in an up-to 5x increase in biofuels produced.”

Critics contend that directing food crops such as sugar and corn for biofuels threatens Food Security. Organic fuel can improve Farmers’ Security, and the government estimates that they can hike farm incomes by over a billion dollars. But an article (www.context.news) highlights that biofuels need “land and water use that can have a larger climate impact than fossil fuel emissions.”

Although organic sources provide Factory Security through higher domestic energy production, they impact Financial Security. The G-20 document admits that while “fund-raising has been a major concern due to uncertainty of profit margins,” higher capital expenses ensures that “cost parity with fossil fuels is difficult to achieve.”

When it comes to replacing old fuels with new ones, Technology holds the key. The trick lies in shifting from First-Generation biofuels based on crops, which is in vogue in India, to Second-, Third-, and Fourth-Generation ones based on waste, algae, and genetically-modified (GM) microorganisms, respectively.

According to a website, waste-dependent biofuels are saddled with high costs and low yields, algae-based ones need “optimal environments,” and GM ones “face uncertainty around commercial scalability.” A recent piece on www.orfonline.org states that India needs to “expand the production of second-generation (2-G), or waste-based, fuels.”

There is no denying the fact that each of us (all the nations, and more than eight billion global citizens) need to save Planet Earth. Pollution from fossil fuels and other sources may destroy our world within a century.

A recent study by TERI (https://teriin.org) estimates that air pollution costs Indian businesses almost $100 billion every year. Couple this with the millions of deaths due to it, both in India and other nations. United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 states there is a need to “Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all.”

Since 2014, during the three tenures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has emerged as the leader in the “global fight against Climate Change,” Her aggression is evident through the commitment to green energy and biofuels.

India has set commendable targets to reach net-zero pollution levels by 2070, and meet half of its electricity needs from renewable sources by 2030. She advanced the target to use 20 per cent ethanol (sugarcane-based biofuel) in petrol from 2030 to 2025.

This is important since the TERI report claims that India is the third-largest user of automobiles in the world, and her dependence on fossil fuels for transport is “relatively high (70 per cent).”

Government subsidies and new policies have enthused biofuel-makers to invest huge sums. In 2022, the state-owned Indian Oil set up Asia’s first 2-G ethanol biorefinery, which can produce 30 million liters of ethanol from 200,000 tons of rice straw (waste).

Others have developed inhouse technologies for other biofuels like compressed biogas, and sustainable aviation fuel. The potential is immense. For example, agricultural waste is a “promising source” for 2-G biofuels.

The article on www.orfonline.org states that India generates more than 750 million tons of agricultural waste every year, of which nearly a third is “surplus and can be used for fuel production.”

According to NITI Aayog, the prominent government think-tank, India produced more than seven billion liters of blended ethanol in 2023-24 from sources such as molasses and sugar (42.6 per cent), maize (39.6 per cent), and damaged foodgrains (17.4 per cent). Estimates indicate that the country saved several billion dollars in foreign exchange in 2024-25, which will soon rise to $6.5 billion, due to lower crude and gas imports.

Farmers gained due to the sales to industries, although pricing of the raw materials remains a concern. Thousands of people gained direct and indirect employment in the biofuel sector.

India needs to factor in food security in the biofuel equation. According to a recent study (https://apps.fas.usda.gov), to enhance ethanol production, the country curbed sugar exports in 2022, and “limited the use of sugarcane and its derivatives for ethanol production” in 2023-24 to “mitigate inflationary pressure on domestic consumption.”

The report adds that lower rice production pushed policy-makers to ban the “use of broken rice for ethanol production due to the depleted foodgrain stock.” Biofuels can fuel the farmers’ enthusiasm to change cropping patterns, which have long-term effects. Higher sugarcane production, and use of agriculture waste can impact soil fertility, and water tables.

Clearly, India needs to drive its technological edge to reap the benefits of biofuels, and blunt the negative effects.

More investment needs to flow in R&D so that the country can quickly jump from 1-G organic energy sources to 2-G, 3-G, and 4-G. Apart from the positive socio-economic impact, it will transform areas such as energy, environment, agriculture, and manufacturing.

According to a study (https://apps.fas.usda.gov), there are huge consumer benefits. “Ethanol has a lower energy content compared to pure petrol, which can result in decreased mileage (of vehicles). Additionally, certain engine components may be more susceptible to erosion when exposed to higher ethanol concentrations, potentially leading to premature replacement, and increasing total cost of ownership,” it states.

Indonesia’s vision for its 2045 centenary is one of prosperity and sustainability, a “Golden Indonesia” standing as a top five global economy (Kadin Indonesia, 2023; Wahyudi, 2024). Yet, for the nation’s archipelago of over 17,500 islands, this ambition is challenged by the converging impacts of climate change and resource degradation (Lowe et al., 2024; World Bank, 2021). Millions of smallholder farmers and fishers, the bedrock of the food system, are caught in a perilous ""resilience trap."" Uncertain rainfall, rising temperatures, and extreme weather directly impact crop yields, forcing an intensification of conventional practices like the overuse of chemical fertilisers. This, in turn, degrades soil health and pollutes vital water sources, harming aquaculture and diminishing the natural resource base upon which communities depend, perpetuating a downward spiral of vulnerability (Centre for Indonesian Policy Studies, 2021; Fekete et al., 2022).

Achieving the 2045 vision requires a fundamental paradigm shift from fragile, centralised, and fossil-fuel-dependent systems toward a network of resilient, self-sufficient, and circular local economies. This article presents a blueprint for this transition: the SUN-H₂O nexus. This integrated system combines decentralised, solar-powered green ammonia production with on-site photocatalytic water treatment, offering a tangible framework to break the resilience trap and build a sovereign archipelagic future.

The Twin Crises of Nutrients and Water

Modern Indonesian agriculture is dependent on nitrogen fertilisers produced via the Haber-Bosch process, an energy-intensive method responsible for about 1.2% of all anthropogenic CO₂ emissions (Bhandari et al., 2021). This global issue is compounded locally by a reliance on volatile import markets and a fragile, costly inter-island distribution network. Global price swings, such as the fluctuation from US$400 to over US$1600 per ton between 2020-2023, directly threaten the livelihoods of smallholders for whom fertiliser can represent 10-30% of total production costs (Ali et al., 2023; Famela et al., 2023). The complex logistics of reaching remote islands often leads to scarcity and exorbitant prices, a problem government subsidy have failed to effectively resolve (Mulyono et al., 2023; Putri et al., 2024).

Parallel to this is a water crisis. An estimated 70% of the nation’s rivers are heavily polluted, with a significant portion of this contamination originating from untreated domestic and agricultural wastewater (Kurniawan et al., 2022). This is particularly acute for aquaculture, a key economic sector. Nutrient-rich effluent from fish farms, containing uneaten feed and metabolic waste, releases high concentrations of nitrogenous compounds and organic matter. This leads to a high Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), triggering eutrophication and explosive algal blooms. As the algae die and decompose, they consume vast amounts of dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic ""dead zones"" that cause mass die-offs of the farmed species, a destructive, self-defeating feedback loop (Lowe et al., 2024; Nugroho et al., 2024).

The SUN-H₂O Nexus: An Integrated Solution

The SUN-H₂O nexus reimagines production by moving it to small-scale, modular, solar-powered units at the point of use. Its first component, the Solar Ammonia Module, uses high-efficiency photovoltaic panels to power a water electrolyser using technologies like Proton-Exchange Membrane or Alkaline Water Electrolysis to split water (H₂O) into green hydrogen (H₂) (Ojelade et al., 2023). This hydrogen is then combined with nitrogen from the air in a compact synthesis loop to create green ammonia (NH₃) for use as a clean fertiliser (Ali et al., 2023). This process has virtually zero operational emissions and averts an estimated 2.7 tonnes of CO₂ for every tonne of ammonia produced from a full lifecycle perspective (Armijo & Philibert, 2020; Ghavam et al., 2021). Techno-economic modelling confirms its financial promise, indicating that its Levelized Cost of Ammonia (LCOA) is already competitive with peak import prices. Furthermore, a clear pathway exists for significant cost reductions by 2030, driven by falling solar and electrolyser costs (Ali et al., 2023; Djire et al., 2025).

The second component, the Photocatalytic Treatment Unit, harnesses sunlight to purify contaminated water using a nano-structured Titanium Dioxide (TiO₂) catalyst, a non-toxic and inexpensive semiconductor (Chong et al., 2010). When exposed to UV light, TiO₂ generates highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (OH) that break down complex organic pollutants and mineralize nitrogenous compounds (Devi & Kavitha, 2013). Studies have demonstrated its high efficacy, removing over 90% of COD from complex wastewaters (Ahmed et al., 2025; Malato et al., 2023). The economics of this process are highly compelling; research highlights its low capital requirements and minimal operational expenditures, as sunlight is a free resource and the catalyst is not consumed (Chong et al., 2010; El-Gohary et al., 2024). Crucially, Indonesia possesses significant reserves of ilmenite, the ore used to produce TiO₂, creating a pathway for technological sovereignty by transforming a domestic raw material into a high-tech solution (Aristanti et al., 2022).

Synergies and Strategic Implementation

The true innovation of the nexus lies in its integration. The electrolysis process yields a valuable co-product: high-purity oxygen. In this system, this ""oxygen bonus"" is captured and bubbled into aquaculture ponds (Mohammadpour et al., 2021). Low dissolved oxygen is a primary constraint in intensive aquaculture; increasing it by an estimated 30% or more can dramatically boost fish survival rates and yields, transforming a byproduct into a high-value input (Mohammadpour et al., 2021; Gustavsson et al., 2023). This completes circular loop: solar energy produces green fertiliser for crops and oxygen for fish farms; effluent from both is purified by the solar-powered treatment unit; and the clean water is reused for irrigation.

This technological solution is embedded in a social and political strategy. A cooperative-led ownership model leverages Indonesia's culture of cooperation (Gotong Royong), ensuring community trust and that economic benefits are retained locally (Zamagni, 2021). A proposed roadmap could guides this transition, beginning with pilot projects to prove viability and a proven payback period, before scaling to hundreds of sites while developing domestic manufacturing for key components like TiO₂. The final phase envisions full national integration, contributing significantly to Indonesia’s climate commitments (NDC) and establishing the nation as a regional technology leader (Ministry of Environment and Forestry, 2022). This entire endeavour embodies the spirit of SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) by bringing together government, academia, and communities to build a resilient and golden future, one island at a time.

The State of SAF Mandates Across the World

While the EU and UK often grab headlines for their ""stick"" approach to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) adoption through mandates, they're far from alone in this regulatory push.

A few days ago, Carbon Direct published a summary table about the state of SAF mandates in other parts of the world, as of H1 2025. To be fair, most of them are still either at a proposal stage, under consideration or not really binding, but, nevertheless, shows it is not just a “Western” thing.

Though most jurisdictions are still in proposal stages or under consideration—with many lacking binding enforcement mechanisms—the trend clearly demonstrates that SAF mandates aren't just a ""Western"" initiative. This global momentum is particularly significant given that most aviation growth is expected to come from regions outside Europe.

The adoption patterns tell a fascinating story about early movers and market concentration. According to data about of SAF adoption by the world’s main airlines shared by Aaron Robinson, VP SAF at IAG, European carriers account for a staggering 63% of global airline SAF consumption. Even more striking: just three carriers represent 54% of global airline SAF use.

Why this matters: The success of trailblazers in the EU, UK, and US (the latter relying on incentive programs and production capacity rather than mandates) will be crucial in scaling up production and demonstrating that SAF costs can be brought down to commercially viable levels.

The runway is fully ready, and the terminal building is nearly complete, with final interior and external ceiling work underway. “Everything else is progressing rapidly,” the CM said during a press briefing after inspecting the site with Deputy CM Eknath Shinde and Minister Ganesh Naik.

Fadnavis said NMIA will be a green airport, powered by 37 MW of renewable energy. All airport vehicles will run on electricity or alternative fuels. The airport will also promote the use of sustainable aviation fuel, making it a hub for green air travel.

Connectivity plans in full swing

The CM outlined an ambitious connectivity blueprint. The Atal Setu-Coastal Road link is expected to be completed by March next year, while an elevated road from Thane is also in the pipeline. Suburban trains, metro, and water transport options are being integrated to provide easy access from all directions.

To enhance passenger experience, baggage check-in facilities in other cities are being planned so travellers can reach the airport without carrying their luggage. “This will transform the way passengers travel,” Fadnavis said.

In the second phase of development, an underground train system will connect terminals inside the airport, ensuring passengers won’t have to walk long distances. Travelators and automated mobility solutions will ensure smooth movement, with terminal bays kept within 500 metres.

Project progress and workforce

Over 13,000 workers are currently deployed at the site. Fadnavis said additional workforce will be added if needed to meet the deadline. Commercial licensing work is being carried out in parallel to ensure immediate operational readiness.

On the naming of the airport, the Chief Minister said, “The state government has sent a proposal to the Centre, and Deputy CM Shinde and I will follow it up with the Prime Minister.”

Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Senior leaders and officials including Forest Minister Ganesh Naik, former MP Ramsheth Thakur, MLAs Prashant Thakur, Mahesh Baldi, and Manda Mhatre, along with top CIDCO and district officials, were also present during the inspection. The CM and DCM reviewed terminal infrastructure, passenger amenities, and cargo handling systems.

In June 2022, CIDCO granted complete access to 1,160 hectares of land, having spent nearly Rs 2,000 crore on land acquisition and rehabilitation. The Navi Mumbai International Airport Limited (NMIAL) achieved financial closure in March 2022, with the State Bank of India approving Rs 12,770 crore of the Rs 19,647 crore total estimated cost for Phases 1 and 2. NMIAL is contributing Rs 15,981 crore, while CIDCO has allocated Rs 3,665 crore.

Pre-construction work such as land development, diversion of the Ulwe River, and relocation of high-voltage power lines has been completed by CIDCO. As of June 30, the project has achieved 96.5% physical progress, with nearly 13,000 workers currently deployed on-site.

The airport witnessed its first military landing with a C-295 aircraft of the Indian Air Force on October 11, 2024, followed by two low passes by SU-30 jets. On December 29, 2024, IndiGo Airlines' Airbus A320 completed the first successful commercial test landing.

Once operational, the airport’s first two phases will be capable of handling 20 million passengers and 0.8 million metric tonnes of cargo annually.

DCM Shinde said, ""Once fully operational, this airport would be at par with the Heathrow airport of London and country's first multi model airport which would be accessible through, road, rail, water and also metro. This is centrally located airport which would be easily accessible for people from Mumbai due to Atal Setu, Pune due to Expressway and also for people from Raigad and Thane.

Around 94 per cent work of the airport is complete and the deadline of September 30 has been set for the launch of commercial operations, he said, adding that its inauguration will be done by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had also performed its ground-breaking ceremony.

This will be the ""most modern and fully-equipped"" airport in the country, and the authorities have been instructed to make the baggage claim system the fastest in the world, he said.

The CM, accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister Eknath Shinde and minister Ganesh Naik, conducted an inspection of the NMIA project.

In a press briefing after the inspection, Fadnavis said, ""Today, we came here to review the progress of the airport. We saw a detailed presentation on all aspects of the work - from the runway to the terminal building - and got all the information. Currently, 94 per cent of the project work is complete. The remaining six per cent will get over before September to ensure the airport is operational by then."" The first passenger flight from the airport will take off in September, he said.

The runway is fully-equipped and the work on the terminal building is largely complete with interior work currently underway. The outer facade and external ceiling work needs to be finished expeditiously. All other works are progressing at full pace, he said.

That fuel will then be mixed with standard aviation fuel and used in the private jets that use the facility.
Signature Aviation has had a sustainable fuel program since 2022, but that fuel is trucked in from outside Eagle County.
Sustainable fuel uses material that has already put carbon into the environment, extracts energy from it, and uses it as fuel.
And, he added, with people flying out of the Eagle County Regional Airport on sustainable fuel, ""Everybody's going to want to be you.""","Eagle County is a little closer to making ""sustainable"" aviation fuel from waste at the county landfill.

The Eagle County Board of Commissioners on Tuesday signed a letter of interest with SynTec Holdings of Morris, Illinois. That non-binding agreement is the first step toward SynTec building a plant on 13 acres of property at the landfill and using up to 90 tons per day of municipal solid waste to convert into aviation fuel.

According to the letter, which is a non-binding agreement, the county will authorize a 10-year lease with a 10-year renewal option with SynTec, which will build and operate a facility to convert solid waste into aviation fuel. That fuel would then be transported to Signature Aviation's private aviation facility at the Eagle County Regional Airport, formerly the Vail Valley Jet Center. That fuel will then be mixed with standard aviation fuel and used in the private jets that use the facility. Signature Aviation has had a sustainable fuel program since 2022, but that fuel is trucked in from outside Eagle County.

According to the document, SynTec will be responsible for obtaining all necessary county land use approvals and will also be responsible for all project financing.

The letter states that the county will benefit from extending the life of the landfill. Syntec's plant will use only ""clean"" household waste. No hazardous or construction waste will be allowed.

Asked by Commissioner Jeanne McQueeney to define ""sustainable aviation fuel,"" SynTec CEO Wayne McFarland said that his firm's process ""puts less or no new carbon into the environment."" Another gallon of fossil fuel drilled, refined and put into a vehicle puts more carbon into the environment, McFarland said. Sustainable fuel uses material that has already put carbon into the environment, extracts energy from it, and uses it as fuel.

McFarland said the project will ultimately be an ""amazing"" one for Eagle County.

""There are no downsides to this,"" he said, noting that the amount of waste used will allow the county to be almost ""landfill-free."" And, he added, with people flying out of the Eagle County Regional Airport on sustainable fuel, ""Everybody's going to want to be you.""

Commissioner Matt Scherr noted that the document approved Tuesday is just a letter of intent. But, he added, the SynTec proposal is ""an exciting idea.""

“Don’t waste the waste — monetise the waste,” he said, quoting what he had recently shared at the Asean Summit for economic leaders in Kuala Lumpur.
He said the phrase has since been picked up by organisers as a key branding theme, reflecting global interest in Sarawak’s approach to environmental sustainability.
He said Sarawak’s sustainability efforts are rooted in the Post-Covid Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030, where environmental sustainability is one of the three main pillars alongside economic prosperity and social inclusivity.
He recently returned from Tokyo, where he participated in a global hydrogen conference and shared Sarawak’s sustainability blueprint and hydrogen strategy.","KUCHING, July 12 — Sarawak is exploring the conversion of cow dung into hydrogen as part of its long-term circular green economy strategy, said Premier Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Abang Johari Tun Openg.

According to the Premier, cow dung, which emits methane as it decomposes, can be processed into a renewable fuel source, opening new avenues for sustainable energy generation.

“If there are many cows, there will be a lot coming out of the cows.

“What comes out of the cows contains a lot of hydrogen because it produces methane, and from that, hydrogen can be extracted and used,” he said in his speech during the launch of the state-level International Day of Forests (IDF) 2025 at the Forest Research Centre here today.

Abang Johari said this initiative aligns with Sarawak’s broader aim to monetise waste under its green growth model.

“Don’t waste the waste — monetise the waste,” he said, quoting what he had recently shared at the Asean Summit for economic leaders in Kuala Lumpur.

He said the phrase has since been picked up by organisers as a key branding theme, reflecting global interest in Sarawak’s approach to environmental sustainability.

Sharing recent developments, Abang Johari highlighted an initiative with Sarawak Land Custody and Rehabilitation Authority (Salcra) in Lubok Antu to extract biomass and biofuel from palm oil kernel waste, under a RM30 million pilot project.

“When we break the kernel, it produces biomass which we can use for animal feed.

“Early trials with cattle and goats showed that local feed produced from palm waste could support healthy livestock growth.

“At the moment our animals are thin, and expensive. During Hari Raya Korban, one cow can cost up to RM12,000. That means we can use this waste to support our livestock sector,” he said.

He also revealed plans to develop biofuel from the same waste — including sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) — as part of Sarawak’s efforts to reduce reliance on raw commodity exports and transition to value-added production.

Touching on the theme of this year’s IDF celebration, “Forests and Food”, Abang Johari reiterated the importance of forest conservation and sustainable resource use for long-term survival.

He praised the Forest Department Sarawak (FDS) for their achievements in seed planting efforts, noting that they had exceeded the original target of 35 million trees by planting over 50 million to date.

“I want to thank those who brought belian tree seeds. If we can nurture these, we can replant many forest species — not only belian, but also nyatoh, meranti and others,” he said.

Abang Johari also expressed strong interest in the department’s use of 3D data technology to monitor forest conditions and tree species, which could support Sarawak’s entry into carbon trading markets.

“Every species of tree has a different capacity to absorb carbon. If you have the technology to identify tree types and characteristics, you can determine aggregate carbon absorption. That’s how carbon pricing is determined,” he said.

He said Sarawak’s sustainability efforts are rooted in the Post-Covid Development Strategy (PCDS) 2030, where environmental sustainability is one of the three main pillars alongside economic prosperity and social inclusivity.

“We have to execute our policies considering the importance of our environment,” he said.

The Premier added that Sarawak’s approach has been recognised internationally.

He recently returned from Tokyo, where he participated in a global hydrogen conference and shared Sarawak’s sustainability blueprint and hydrogen strategy.

He also confirmed that Sarawak had been invited to present its policies at the World Economic Forum in Davos, after missing a previous engagement in Tianjin.

“In Tokyo, during a panel discussion, they acknowledged what Sarawak has done for the world in terms of environmental management and green energy. InsyaAllah, we’ve been told that we will be invited to Davos,” he added.

Abang Johari emphasised that any form of development must strike a balance with environmental protection.

He noted that extreme weather events around the world — from flooding in Texas to heatwaves in Japan and China — are a warning sign.

“If we cannot manage our environment by placing sustainability as the foundation, the world’s temperature will rise. That’s not just dangerous for nations, it’s a threat to the entire human race.

“Humans cannot survive in temperatures of 43°C, 46°C, or 48°C. This is one of the major global challenges we face today,” he said. — The Borneo Post",https://www.malaymail.com/malaymail/uploads/images/2025/07/12/287873.jpg,N,,2025-07-12 12:16:54.912268

As the Global 8000 enters service, this Canadian aviation giant is set to fly higher than ever.","The global ultra-long-range business jet market is undergoing a quiet revolution, driven by Bombardier's relentless pursuit of speed, range, and comfort. With its Global 7500 setting 135 speed records—the most by any business aircraft to date—and the upcoming Global 8000 poised to eclipse even the Concorde's civilian speed crown, Bombardier is cementing its position as the undisputed leader in this high-margin segment. These advancements are not just about engineering prowess; they represent a strategic play to capture a growing market for non-stop connectivity between emerging hubs and reduce reliance on congested hub airports. For investors, this is a story of technological dominance and long-term growth potential.

The Global 7500: Setting the Bar for Performance

The Global 7500, introduced in 2018, has already transformed the ultra-long-range category. Its 7,700-nautical-mile range and Mach 0.925 top speed enable transcontinental flights like Montreal to Paris in 5.5 hours—a journey that previously required multiple stops or commercial airlines with far less comfort. The 135 speed records it has shattered, including a Tokyo-to-San Francisco flight in under 10 hours, underscore its reliability and efficiency.

But performance alone isn't the only factor. Bombardier's Smooth Flēx Wing technology is a game-changer. By optimizing lift and drag at high speeds while enabling short-field takeoffs (as short as 2,130 feet), the Global 7500 can access airports like London City or St. Moritz, which larger jets cannot. This flexibility is a magnet for high-net-worth individuals and corporations seeking to bypass crowded hubs.

The Global 8000: Breaking the Supersonic Ceiling

The Global 8000, due for delivery in late 2025, takes this vision further. With a Mach 0.94 top speed (1,000 km/h) and 8,000-nautical-mile range, it will be the fastest civilian aircraft since the Concorde, while offering a low cabin altitude of 2,900 feet—critical for passenger comfort on long flights. This jet isn't just an upgrade; it's a new category-defining machine.

Crucially, the Global 8000 retains the Global 7500's short-field capabilities, ensuring access to small airports. Its enhanced GE Passport engines and optimized fuel efficiency (8% better than the Global Express XRS) reduce operating costs, a key factor for corporate buyers. With NetJets already converting 24 Global 7500 orders to Global 8000s, demand is primed for explosive growth.

Strategic Advantage: Redefining Connectivity

Bombardier's strategy is clear: dominate the $15 billion+ ultra-long-range business jet market by addressing two core trends:

1. Growing demand for non-stop connectivity between emerging markets (e.g., Dubai-Houston, Singapore-Los Angeles).

2. Reduced reliance on hub airports, which are increasingly congested and costly.

The Global 8000's specs make it ideal for routes previously impractical or too time-consuming. For instance, a flight from Dubai to Houston—a critical link between energy and finance hubs—can now be done non-stop in under 13 hours, avoiding layovers in Frankfurt or Dubai. This opens doors for companies to operate in real time across continents.

Investment Thesis: A Growth Engine with Sustained Demand

Bombardier's technological leadership positions it to capitalize on two key tailwinds:

- Structural growth in business aviation: The ultra-long-range segment is expected to grow at a 6-8% CAGR through 2030, driven by wealthy individuals and corporations seeking efficiency and privacy.

- Sustainability and efficiency: The Global 8000's fuel efficiency and compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) align with ESG trends, attracting eco-conscious buyers.

Risk factors are minimal but worth noting: delays in Global 8000 certification (though its first flight in May 2025 went smoothly), and competition from Gulfstream's G700 or Dassault's Falcon 6X. However, Bombardier's record of over 200 Global 7500 deliveries and a proven track record in setting speed benchmarks suggest it can outpace rivals.

Conclusion: A Long-Term Growth Play

Bombardier's Global series isn't just about building faster jets—it's about redefining global connectivity. With the Global 8000's capabilities, it's positioning itself to corner a market that values speed, comfort, and operational flexibility. For investors, this is a decade-long story: sustained demand from emerging economies, corporate relocations to decentralized hubs, and a shrinking pool of competitors capable of matching Bombardier's specs.

The 135 speed records are more than milestones—they're proof that Bombardier is the gold standard in ultra-long-range aviation. As the Global 8000 enters service, this Canadian aviation giant is set to fly higher than ever.

Cockpit voice recordings reveal that the pilots were confused about who had shut off the fuel supply and why.

According to the preliminary report, both engine fuel control switches — for engines 1 and 2 — were moved from “run” to “cutoff” within the span of one second. This action abruptly stopped the flow of fuel, causing both engines to lose thrust. Although fuel was re-engaged and one engine briefly regained power, it was already too late to recover.

The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, registered as VT-ANB, had only been airborne for around 30 seconds after taking off from Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport in Ahmedabad when it crashed into a residential neighborhood. Video footage shows the aircraft barely gaining altitude before it suddenly lost lift and descended rapidly.

Flight AI171 departed for London Gatwick, United Kingdom and carried 242 persons (230 passengers, 10 cabin crew, 2 flight crew). One passenger, seated on 11A near the emergency exit, survived the fatal crash.

Hosted by the RNG Coalition’s Senior Manager of Communications, Dylan Chase, the webinar kicked off with the exciting announcement that the coalition reached its 2025 Sustainable Methane Abatement & Recycling Timeline benchmark of 500 operational facilities in the U.S. months ahead of schedule, with a total of 505 operational facilities. Spearheaded by the RNG Coalition, SMART is an initiative to capture and control methane and CO2 produced from the 43,000-plus aggregated organic waste sites in North America by 2050, with incremental benchmarks set in 2025, 2030 and 2040.

Another 153 RNG facilities are under construction, according to the Coalition, and yet another 293 are in planning stages.

The RNG Coalition’s CEO, Johannes Escudero, shared renewable natural gas’s (RNG) history in the U.S. and the Coalition’s role in the industry’s explosive growth. RNG, according to Escudero, is “the derivative product from any organic material that decomposes naturally, creating a cocktail of gas constituents, primarily consisting of methane and CO2.” The first U.S. RNG facility appeared in New York in 1982. In 2011, nearly 30 years later, the Coalition was founded, he said, and at the time only 31 RNG facilities were operational in the U.S. “We knew what our industry was capable of with the right policy support, with the right public support and with sufficient market demand,” Escudero stated, citing the jump to 505 operational facilities only 14 years later.

Escudero attributed this success to the Coalition’s partners and supporters both at the federal and individual level. “Someone once said that if you’re leading and nobody is following, then you’re not really leading—you’re walking,” he continued. The Coalition’s mission—leadership, education and events, advocacy (U.S. and Canada), development and industry growth, and sustainable solutions and markets (LEADS)—ties it all together.

Following Escudero, Geoff Dietz, senior director of federal affairs for the Coalition, dove into the hot-button topic of federal tax credits, starting with the history behind the U.S. EPA’s Renewable Fuel Standard. The RFS’s goal, created in 2005, was to support the development and commercialization of biofuels. Under former President George W. Bush in 2007, the RFS was authorized via the Energy Independence and Security Act to expand feedstocks and fuel types, and another expansion in 2014 under the Obama administration permitted RNG and biogas under the cellulosic biofuel category. Today, RNG comprises 95% of available cellulosic biofuel credits.

As for more recently crafted policy, Dietz pointed to Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit—which currently offers up to $1 per gallon for non-aviation fuels and up to $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)—as opportunistic for RNG, though it is subject to change under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act making its way through Congress. Dietz also suggested potential for RNG in Section 45V, which focuses on clean hydrogen. “RNG can play a role as a feedstock of that clean hydrogen,” he explained. And although not as well-known as the other Section 45 policy, 45Q, the carbon sequestration credit, offers potential; one of the two main gases within RNG is biogenic CO2, which has encouraged interest to take advantage of the credit.

Sam Wade, vice president of public policy at RNG Coalition, briefly touched on state-specific RNG policies. At current, four states have a clean fuel standard passed and in effect, with more seeing statewide advocacy. California has led the way with its Low Carbon Fuel Standard, which has displaced over 70% of transportation diesel with cleaner alternatives and lowered California’s fuel carbon intensity (CI) by nearly 20%. RNG, according to Wade, offers the lowest-CI clean fuel.

Utilities are increasingly being subject to decarbonization goals through RNG channels, including renewable gas and clean heat standards. Oregon, which Wade described as a “leader in RNG,” set the statewide voluntary goal to add as much as 30% of RNG into the state’s pipeline system by 2050 under 2019’s Senate Bill 98.

In a jump to real-world examples, Coalition member Guidehouse’s Director of Energy Transition, Danielle Vitoff, demonstrated how far the industry has come in the past year, presenting economic data from mid-2024. Vitoff began with impressive statistics: the RNG industry supported 55,664 jobs in 2024, with 57% of employment coming from projects under construction, and generated $7.2 billion in gross domestic product. The majority of these RNG jobs were middle income and required no advanced degrees. Facilities in progress as of mid-2024 could support roughly 94,000 jobs and generate $10.8 billion in GDP, Vitoff said.

Municipal solid waste (MSW) was found to have the largest economic impact due to its high levels of RNG production, according to Vitoff. Utilization of such RNG is focused on three sectors: transportation and freight, in which RNG has found itself for the better part of its lifespan and garners support from policies including the RFS and LCFS; utilities, which have faced increasing pressure to decarbonize and develop RNG drop-in compatibilities; and the hard-to-abate industries, which also face decarbonization pressure along supply chains.

Michael O’Laughlin, CEO of Vanguard Renewables, spoke to the importance of localized anaerobic digestion and the advantage the U.S. currently holds. “The U.S. is really positioned well as a global leader because of the [pipeline] infrastructure that exists today,” he said. O’Laughlin cited Vanguard’s “fully circular RNG solution” as an example of such infrastructure. Food and beverage industry waste is supplied to anaerobic, farm-based digesters via organics preprocessing, which is then converted to animal bedding and fertilizer, effectively diverting waste from the landfill.

Anaerobic digesters benefit individual farmers and local economies by adding revenue, reducing farm odors and producing useful byproducts, as well as national companies looking to meet zero-waste-to-landfill goals, O’Laughlin continued. For now, he said, RNG must meet global regulation requirements, including production processes, existing gas and infrastructure, and multi-industry demand—a challenge the industry is hungry to take on.

Outer ceiling and façade work are being fast-tracked. 13,000–14,000 workers are deployed daily, and Fadnavis said the labour force will be doubled to meet the September 30 deadline.

Targeting a September 30 launch, pending PM’s nod

“This will be the most modern airport in the country... As we have to seek the appointment of Prime Minister Narendra Modi (for the project launch), we have set the target of September 30 before them. It is an ambitious target,” Fadnavis added, as reported by PTI.

He said commercial licences are being processed in parallel, and the final launch will depend on the PM’s availability. However, authorities have been told to complete all work by September-end to ensure readiness.

Massive capacity, green power, and AI-powered systems

The Navi Mumbai airport will eventually be equipped with two runways and a capacity to handle 90 million passengers annually, making it larger than Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.

Fadnavis said the new airport would be entirely powered by 37 MW of green energy, with electric and alternative fuel vehicles, and will actively promote sustainable aviation fuel.

“This airport has many features. It is a green airport... This airport will be a big centre where green fuel will be used on a large scale,” he said.

Seamless connectivity: air, road, rail, water

The CM also unveiled plans for multi-modal connectivity to NMIA:

Atal Setu–Coastal Road link to be ready by March 2026

Elevated road from Thane in the works

Suburban rail, metro, and water transport to offer 360-degree access

City-level baggage check-in facilities to reduce airport crowding

“Arrangements are being made for connecting the airport from four directions... baggage checking is being planned in different cities so passengers can travel without carrying it,” he said.

Underground mobility, zero walking, traffic-free terminals

The second phase will include a metro-style underground train to move passengers across terminals.

“Nobody will have to walk, and it will also prevent vehicles from creating traffic jams... The bay will be within 500 meters and travelators will be provided for passengers,” Fadnavis said.

To meet the proposed targets, soybean acreage must expand by 10 million acres, or roughly 12%, reaching 93 million acres by 2027.

Bernstein estimates soybean prices would rise 12%, from $10.57 to $11.85 per bushel, reducing the stock-to-use ratio from 7% to 5%.
If soybean oil regains prior feedstock share levels of up to 50%, equipment demand could increase 22%, pushing OEM EPS growth higher still.","Investing.com -- A major policy shift proposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency could trigger a resurgence in domestic biofuels, sharply boosting soybean demand and agricultural equipment sales.

According to Bernstein Research, the agency’s proposed update to the Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) mandates a 75% increase in biomass-based diesel production, from 3.4 billion gallons to 5.9 billion gallons by 2027, driven entirely by domestic feedstocks.

Soybean oil, already the largest contributor to biomass-based diesel at 30%, is expected to gain more ground as the EPA’s changes penalize imported feedstocks, which currently make up 45% of the supply.

Under the revised structure, imported fuels will generate only half the Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) of domestically produced equivalents.

Concurrently, the Trump Tax Bill extends the 45Z clean fuel tax credit to 2031, increasing subsidies for non-aviation biofuels from $0.20 to $1 per gallon and for sustainable aviation fuel from $0.35 to $1.75 per gallon.

To meet the proposed targets, soybean acreage must expand by 10 million acres, or roughly 12%, reaching 93 million acres by 2027.

This projection assumes soybean oil maintains a 29% share in the biofuel feedstock mix and that non-biofuel soybean use remains flat.

The policy echoes the 2005 ethanol mandate, which led to a 10 million acre jump in corn planting and a doubling of corn prices.

Bernstein estimates soybean prices would rise 12%, from $10.57 to $11.85 per bushel, reducing the stock-to-use ratio from 7% to 5%.

At these prices, real cash margins for farmers planting a 50/50 corn-soybean mix would increase from $0.23 to $1.52 per bushel.

This margin improvement historically correlates with a double-digit uptick in large ag equipment sales.

Manufacturers stand to benefit. Deere & Co (NYSE: )., AGCO, and CNH Industrial (NYSE: ) could see a 10% lift in North American ag equipment volumes in 2026.

That translates to 5–6% earnings growth and a 3–4% increase in share prices, based on Bernstein’s estimates.

If soybean oil regains prior feedstock share levels of up to 50%, equipment demand could increase 22%, pushing OEM EPS growth higher still.

Public hearings on the RFS proposal begin July 8, followed by a comment period ending August 8. A final rule is expected by October 31.

The current growing season, aided by favorable weather, is expected to maintain downward pressure on crop prices in the short term.

While market outcomes depend on final implementation and farmer response, the scale and structure of the proposed mandate suggest a substantial shift in U.S. biofuel policy that could echo the ethanol-driven ag cycle of the mid-2000s.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/moved_LYNXMPEJ4F0OT_L.jpg,N,,2025-07-12 11:09:11.441973

Here's why this sector is primed for growth—and where to look for opportunities.

The Geopolitical Catalyst: Why Energy Infrastructure Matters Now

Russia's relentless attacks on Ukraine's energy infrastructure—targeting power plants, grids, and pipelines—have exposed the fragility of centralized energy systems. Over 40% of Ukraine's power generation capacity has been damaged since 2022, while cyber-kinetic threats to submarine cables in the Baltic and North Seas further underscore the vulnerability of critical infrastructure. These risks extend beyond Ukraine: NATO members like Poland and the Baltic states now prioritize hardening their grids and diversifying energy sources to counter hybrid threats.

Opportunity 1: Renewable Energy Infrastructure

The EU's REPowerEU plan aims to replace Russian gas with renewables, targeting 42.5% renewable energy by 2030. This creates immediate demand for:

- Solar/Wind Projects: The EU added 53 GW of solar capacity in 2023, surpassing gas as a primary power source. Companies like and Vestas Wind Systems are key beneficiaries.

- Grid Modernization: Synchronizing Ukraine's grid with Europe's Continental Synchronous Area requires advanced interconnectors. Firms like ABB and Eaton, which specialize in smart grid tech, are positioned to profit.

- Energy Storage: Lithium-ion battery demand for grid stabilization is soaring. Tesla's Powerwall and Fluence Energy's grid-scale solutions are critical to balancing intermittent renewables.

Opportunity 2: Defense and Logistics Resilience

Military actions have also accelerated investment in defense infrastructure tied to energy security:

- Microgrids and Distributed Generation: The U.S. military's adoption of microgrids (e.g., solar + battery systems) is a model for European bases. Companies like NextEra Energy and Siemens Energy are expanding their microgrid offerings.

- Cybersecurity for Utilities: Attacks on energy infrastructure require advanced threat detection. CyberX (a Claroty company) and Dragos specialize in grid cybersecurity, with demand set to grow as NATO countries bolster defenses.

- Small Modular Reactors (SMRs): GE Hitachi and Westinghouse are developing SMRs for remote regions, offering a low-carbon alternative to diesel generators.

Opportunity 3: Synthetic Fuels and Energy Transition Tech

Liquid fuel dependency remains a vulnerability, but alternatives are emerging:

- Biofuels: Companies like Neste and ADM are scaling production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), which is mandated for EU airlines by 2030.

- Synthetic Fuels: INERATEC's modular plants in Germany convert renewable hydrogen into synthetic methane. Investors can access this space through ETFs like the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).

Risks and Considerations

Policy Delays: EU permitting bottlenecks for renewables projects remain a hurdle. Investors should favor firms with government partnerships (e.g., Orsted's offshore wind deals in Poland).

Funding Gaps: Ukraine's energy recovery requires €630M for winter 2025/26. Public-private partnerships (e.g., EBRD's funding for solar parks) offer safer entry points than direct equity.

Geopolitical Volatility: Short-term price swings in oil/gas (tracked via ) may pressure renewables stocks, but long-term fundamentals remain strong.

Investment Takeaways

Infrastructure Funds: Consider the Infravia European Infrastructure Fund or the Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP), which invest in grid and renewable projects.

Equity Picks: Siemens Gamesa (SGRE) for wind, ABB for grid tech, and Fluence Energy (FLNC) for storage.

The energy transition is no longer optional—it's a geopolitical imperative. Investors who back resilient infrastructure today will profit as Europe retools its energy systems for a post-Russia future.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-12 16:07:50.286282

Paraffin remains dominant, alternatives struggle to emerge and emissions remain high. However, in recent months an experiment that could mark a turning point is gaining ground: it is called Avelia, and it is a digital platform created to facilitate the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), bypassing the rigidities of physical distribution and creating a parallel, traceable and verifiable market. Behind Avelia are three well-known names: Shell, Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel. Each with a different role, but with a common goal: to enable companies to contribute, in a concrete and transparent way, to reducing air travel emissions.

How Avelia works

The core of the system is based on the ‘book and claim’ principle. In practice, the person who buys sustainable fuel (or the related environmental credits) is not necessarily the person who physically uses it. This allows a European company, for example, to invest in SAF used in Asia or North America, while getting the share of avoided emissions in its environmental accounts. Making everything more robust is the use of blockchain, which guarantees data traceability and prevents the same credits from being counted multiple times. Avelia was born in 2022, but it was in 2025 that it started moving significant numbers.

What it has achieved so far

According to the latest figures, by mid-2025 the platform had handled over 33 million gallons of SAF. In environmental terms, we are talking about 300,000 tonnes of CO₂ less. Today, at least 57 organisations including airlines, multinationals and institutional players participate in the project. Certified credit retirements exceed 900. Still small numbers, in absolute terms, but growing strongly compared to the starting point.

In an industry where SAF still accounts for less than 1% of the total used, an infrastructure like Avelia tries to change scale by focusing on what is really needed today: data reliability, openness to external parties and replicable models.

What’s new in 2025

In July 2025, the promoters of the platform announced an important development. The system, initially tied to Shell as the only fuel supplier, has been opened up to other producers. This means that credits generated by SAF from different sources, as long as they are certified, can be registered on the platform. Another major change concerns data management. Accenture has taken on the role of independent host, separating the technological part from the commercial part. In parallel, a governance committee with multiple representation is being set up to ensure shared criteria and greater transparency. Finally, Avelia has introduced the possibility for those who buy SAF outside the system to still register it on the platform. A feature called ‘Bring Your Own SAF’, which increases flexibility and paves the way for new ways of use.

The motivations of the protagonists

For Shell, the project is part of a broader climate strategy. The president of the aviation division, Raman Ojha, described the new opening as ‘a necessary step’ to scale the market. The company also intends to use the platform to offset its corporate emissions, with the goal of reducing them by 45 per cent by 2030. Accenture, which has supported the birth of Avelia from the very beginning, now aims to establish the platform as an industry standard. Jesko-Philipp Neuenburg, one of the main contact persons, pointed to fragmentation as the central problem. The idea is to build a common reference point that is technically sound and open to external contributions. Amex GBT, for its part, has been working to involve large companies, particularly those interested in reporting on Scope 3 emissions, i.e. those related to employee travel. Chief Product Officer, Evan Konwiser, spoke of “a practical and verifiable tool”, useful for those who have to manage increasingly binding ESG targets.

Regulatory and economic context

The growing interest in Avelia is also explained by the ongoing regulatory changes. In Europe, the new CSRD directive requires detailed reporting of environmental impacts. In the United States, the SEC is working on new rules on climate disclosure. In both cases, companies are looking for reliable tools to document their actions: Avelia is proposed as a concrete answer. On the economic side, the question of price remains. SAF still costs considerably more than paraffin. However, the ‘book and claim’ model allows costs to be spread over several parties, opening the way to forms of co-investment and risk sharing.

Where this road leads

It is too early to say whether Avelia will succeed in establishing itself as a global standard. Certainly, however, the project shows some key elements: a solid technical basis, an open vision and a potential growing market. Unlike many initiatives born to generate visibility, here an operating system has been built, which already works and could expand rapidly. Much will depend on who decides to get on board. If institutional actors, airports, manufacturers and airlines start using Avelia in a systemic way, the project may accelerate. If not, it will remain one of many virtuous but isolated experiments.",https://decripto.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/043bc144-d11d-4f10-9649-8b641605f497.png,N,,2025-07-12 11:09:40.514703

He said that this innovative approach fits well with Sarawak’s policy of reducing resource waste by recycling agricultural and livestock by-products into useful inputs for the state’s economy.

“If we have a lot of cattle, you know what they produce?

“Waste. And that actually contains a lot of hydrogen due to the methane it releases. From methane, we can extract hydrogen and convert it into energy.

“This supports the concept of sustainable development, where organic waste is transformed into high-value products through clean technologies.

“This is what we call the circular economy, reusing waste to protect the environment while at the same time generating economic opportunities,” he said during the launch of the International Day of Forests 2025 celebration, themed ‘Forests and Foods’, held here today.

He added that the Sarawak Government has allocated RM30 million through the Sarawak Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Authority (SALCRA) to implement a pilot project in Lubok Antu, aiming at converting oil palm waste into biomass and biofuel.

“For years, we’ve been cultivating oil palm and selling its oil, but the waste wasn’t properly managed. This project breaks down palm waste to produce biomass and biofuel.

“Beyond animal feed, the biofuel produced from palm waste can also be refined into Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) for aircraft use,” he said.

Abang Johari also recalled his remarks at the ASEAN Economic Leaders’ Summit in Kuala Lumpur, where he shared a simple but powerful quote: “Don’t waste the waste – monetise the waste.”

Richard Branson’s Virgin Atlantic became the first international carrier to offer a bar for passengers 30,000 feet in the air and the space helped create the well-known party atmosphere in the airline’s upper classes.

The airline has already discontinued the bar-lounge area on its newer planes, but it has recently been announced that they will also be taken out of older jets, too.

The bars will be phased out, starting in the next three years, with the final one removed towards the end of the decade.

Shai Weiss, Virgin’s chief executive, said he will personally miss the bars, but he said they were starting to look old-fashioned, with the area taking up space that could otherwise be used for seats.

“At Virgin Atlantic, people love a bar. It’s a very emotional word here. I love the bar and a lot of people love the bar,” he said, according to The Telegraph.

“But the world has moved on. You can’t stand still. We’ve made the decision, a bold decision, to try to make more of that space.”

The airline has made a U-turn on their bar feature. A year ago, Mr Branson vowed to bring the bars back after the “dreadful mistake” of removing them.

The billionaire entrepreneur said in June 2024: “We’re bringing back the bar as soon as we possibly can.”

Virgin Atlantic started phasing out the bars in 2019 for a “loft” space found between the upper class and premium economy.

Avoiding the answer over why the decision had been made to scrap the bar in the first place, he added: “If we make a mistake, let’s own up to it quickly and sort it. That’s what we’ll do.”

However, a final decision has now been made, and the bars will not be a permanent feature in Virgin Atlantic’s flight experience.

A Virgin Atlantic spokesperson told The Independent: “We have loved the bar, but we have a new vision for social spaces; the retreat suites, the private space built for sharing and socialising.

“A home away from home and an office in the sky. Our guests can still enjoy the bars until 2028, and our other social space, The Loft, will continue to fly board our Airbus A350s and nine of our A330neos.”

In 2026, Virgin Atlantic said 10 A330neo aircraft will join its fleet along with six Retreat Suites, larger premium cabins, 48 upper class and 56 premium suites.

The Retreat Suite is the “airline’s most spacious suite yet”, comprising of a 6ft 7” direct seat to a fully flat bed, a 27” touchscreen and an ottoman that doubles up as an extra seat. These suites will also become a feature on the 787-9 fleet.

The suites were announced amid Virgin’s recent shakeup of its flight experience, in which the airline also said it will be introducing free streaming-quality unlimited wifi through Elon Musk’s Starlink technology by 2027.

Cabin refurbishments on its Boeing fleet, new clubhouses at London Heathrow and New York JFK and an AI concierge service are also expected to debut over the coming years.","https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/11/8/38/Retreat-Suite-One.jpeg?trim=0,122,0,65&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800",N,,2025-07-12 06:04:07.406552

China mandates renewable power use for industry

Beijing, 11 July (Argus) — China's leading economic planning agency the NDRC and national energy administration NEA have set renewable power consumption goals for energy-intensive industries for this year and next, with green electricity certificates (GECs) serving as the key mechanism to achieve these targets. The new legislation sets renewable power consumption targets for the steel, cement, polysilicon and electrolytic aluminium production sectors, as well as for data centres, with the average ratio across all provinces set at 38pc in 2025 and 39pc in 2026. Data centres have a unilateral target of 80pc, while targets for other key industries vary by province. Provincial governments will this year assess the ratios set for the electrolytic aluminium sector. Yunnan and Sichuan provinces have the highest targets, needing to source 70pc of their industrial power use from renewables, owing to the high proportion of hydropower in their generation mixes. Provinces with concentrated wind and solar power projects, such as Gansu and Guangxi, have targets above 50pc. In contrast, Fujian province has the lowest ratio at 25.2pc. The targets follow an announcement by the NEA in March aiming to boost China's renewable power use , although the latest document does not specify penalties for failing to meet goals. Demand for GECs will rise as companies look to meet the new targets, with GECs being the key mechanism to achieve these goals. Market prices have risen since the announcement — Argus assessed 2025 vintage wind/solar GECs at Yn7.80/MWh ($1.09/MWh) on 10 July, up by Yn0.30/MWh from earlier in the week but down slightly from the assessment last week. 2024 wind/solar GECs were assessed at Yn3.10/MWh, also slightly lower week on week. Power utility association CEC expects Chinese power demand to grow by 5-6pc on the year in 2025, the organisation said this week in its annual industry report .

Indonesia’s Alfamart invests $1mn in UCO firm Noovoleum

Singapore, 11 July (Argus) — Indonesian convenience store retail chain Alfamart said this week it has invested $1mn into Singapore-based used cooking oil (UCO) collector Noovoleum. Noovoleum — established in 2023 — automates UCO collection in Indonesian cities, including in Java, Sumatra and Bali, with their ""UCOllect"" boxes, of which there are 100. It collects about 100t of UCO a month, which is sold to domestic buyers such as UCO aggregators, said the company's chief investment officer Egis Rimkus. Citizens deposit UCO into the boxes, which have an in-built quality testing system. They will then receive cash via the ""UCOllect"" application, if the quality of the oil is accepted. The rate varies every month and is currently at 5,500 rupiah/litre ($0.34/litre). There are now boxes at 12 Alfamart outlets across Indonesia. The final use of the UCO is unconfirmed, but some could be processed into biodiesel, market participants said. Indonesia has halted exports of UCO since January. There have been recent attempts to export refined UCO under a HS code unaffected by the ban, but bulk volume trades have likely still not been successful, traders told Argus . Noovoleum is in advanced negotiations with possible partners in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore in light of Indonesia's export halt, with at least one partnership to be launched this year, Rimkus added. Noovoleum also placed ""UCOllect"" boxes at 10 gas stations belonging to state-owned Indonesian refiner Pertamina last December. This was part of a pilot project between the two. Pertamina has been trialling sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production since the second quarter of 2025 , but large-scale production of SAF and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) is expected only in 2029 , the refiner said.

US biofuel support clears way for new crush capacity

New York, 10 July (Argus) — North American oilseed crushers told Argus that projects to increase processing capacity are on track for the next year, potentially enabling more renewable fuel production. After a difficult start to the year for biofuel producers, US policymakers are increasingly making clear that they want refiners to up their output in future years and rely more on domestic feedstocks like soybean oil. That could pave the way for more oilseed crush capacity to come online, after some facilities delayed or cancelled plans over the last year on stagnant demand. Companies confirmed to Argus that more than 620,000 bu/d of new soybean and canola crush capacity were on track to come online in North America in the next year, and other facilities that did not respond to requests for comment have plans in the coming years too. Greater vegetable oil supply also could at least partly address concerns from oil and biofuel refiners that Republicans' protectionist approach to biofuels threatens feedstock shortages and price spikes. A multi-seed crush facility under construction in Mitchell, South Dakota — which will be able to process up to 96,000 bu/d of soybeans — is scheduled to start up this October, South Dakota Soybean Processors chief executive Tom Kersting told Argus. US crush company Ag Processing similarly said that a new 137,000 bu/d soybean crush plant in David City, Nebraska, will open ""later this year"". In Canada, Cargill confirmed that a 121,000 bu/d canola processing plant in Regina, Saskatchewan is also on track to open this year. In the first half of next year, French agribusiness Louis Dreyfus said it plans to complete two major projects in North America. The company plans to open a 151,000 bu/d soybean crush plant in Upper Sandusky, Ohio, and to double capacity to more than 240,000 bu/d at a canola crush facility in Yorkton, Saskatchewan. US soybean oil futures have climbed by 12pc in the past month on recent policy shifts, providing more incentive for processors — already crushing more soybeans than ever before — to expand production. The US recently proposed record-high biofuel blend mandates for the next two years, projecting that domestic soybean oil production could increase by 250mn USG/yr. And President Donald Trump over the weekend signed legislation that retools a crucial US tax credit to increase subsidies for crop-based fuels. Canadian canola processors, which depend on US incentives because Canada's biofuel sector is far smaller, benefit less from some of these policy shifts. While US fuels made from Canadian feedstocks can still claim the tax incentive next year, the Trump administration has proposed halving credits generated under the biofuel blend mandate for fuels made from foreign feedstocks. That makes US soybean oil a far more attractive input for US refiners than Canadian canola oil. A Canadian farm cooperative earlier this year paused plans for a combined canola crush and renewable diesel plant in Regina, Saskatchewan, citing ""regulatory and political uncertainty"". And Bunge was vague about its plans for building the world's largest canola crush plant in the same city, which was initially envisioned to start up last year. The US-based agribusiness, which recently took over the project with its acquisition of Viterra, told Argus it was ""focused on integration to ensure a smooth transition for our customers"" and ""may be able to provide an update in the near future"". Even then, canola oil stands to benefit from increased demand from food companies if more US soybean oil is diverted to fuel markets. And despite recent struggles for other Canadian biorefineries, ExxonMobil subsidiary Imperial Oil has plans to soon open a 20,000 b/d renewable diesel plant in Alberta that will draw on canola oil. Canadian policymakers have taken steps to assuage local feedstock suppliers and refiners, including a domestic renewable fuel mandate in British Columbia and a proposed mandate in Ontario. Biofuel production and oilseed crush margins also will depend on interactions with other policies, including a temporary tax break through 2026 in the US for small biodiesel producers — historically more reliant on vegetable oils than more versatile renewable diesel plants — as well as low-carbon fuel standards in the US west coast region and Canada. The perennial risk for any company is that policy, especially around biofuels, often swings unexpectedly.

Conclusion Delta's engine stripping strategy is a masterclass in turning regulatory headwinds into tailwinds.
By creatively exploiting tariff loopholes, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, and maintaining fleet modernization, the airline has fortified its financial position amid a trade war.","In an era of escalating U.S.-EU trade tensions, Delta Air Lines (DAL) has emerged as a master of operational ingenuity. The airline's novel strategy of stripping U.S.-made engines from newly delivered European-built Airbus jets to avoid tariffs offers a compelling case study in supply chain optimization and regulatory arbitrage. By reclassifying aircraft as “used” and repurposing engines to reequip grounded fleets, Delta has turned a potential $100 million+ annual tariff liability into a competitive advantage. This article dissects Delta's tactics, evaluates their risks and rewards, and explores broader implications for investors in tariff-sensitive sectors.

Tariff Mitigation: A Legal Loophole Becomes a Lifeline

Delta's core challenge stems from Section 232 tariffs, which impose a 10% duty on European aircraft imports. To circumvent this, the airline employs a two-step process:

1. Engine Removal: Pratt & Whitney GTF engines (U.S.-made) are detached from new Airbus A321neos in Europe before delivery.

2. Rerouting: The engine-less planes are classified as “used” via third-country registrations (e.g., Japan, El Salvador), avoiding tariffs when they eventually enter the U.S.

This tactic mirrors Delta's prior maneuvers, such as rerouting A350s through Tokyo. The result? A projected $20–$30 million annual savings per Airbus jet, with CEO Ed Bastian vowing, “We are not planning to pay tariffs on aircraft deliveries.”

Supply Chain Optimization: Solving Two Problems at Once

Beyond tariff avoidance, Delta's strategy addresses two critical operational challenges:

- Engine Shortages: Contaminated metal powder in Pratt engines grounded 16 A320neo aircraft. Repurposed engines from newer models allow Delta to restore service to these planes, avoiding revenue loss.

- Regulatory Hurdles: Engine-less Airbuses await FAA seat certifications in Europe, but this delay is offset by the tariff savings and fleet reactivation.

The airline's broader supply chain adjustments include diversifying engine suppliers (e.g., CFM LEAP-1A for A321neos) and accelerating retirements of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft (e.g., CRJ-200). These moves align with Delta's sustainability goals, such as doubling Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) use by 2030.

Operational Agility: A Model for Supply Chain Innovation

Delta's success hinges on its ability to blend legal, logistical, and financial strategies:

- Cost Efficiency: By repurposing engines, Delta avoids both tariffs and the costs of engine repairs/replacements.

- Fleet Modernization: The airline's 2025–2030 pipeline includes 69 A220s, 82 A321neos, and 28 A350s—modern, fuel-efficient aircraft that enhance long-term competitiveness.

- Geopolitical Resilience: Delta's tactics underscore the need for companies to proactively hedge against trade disputes, a lesson for manufacturers in automotive, tech, and aerospace sectors.

Risks and Uncertainties

While Delta's strategy is innovative, risks remain:

- Tariff Expansion: The Biden administration could extend tariffs to engines or components, undermining the loophole.

- Logistical Delays: Engineless Airbuses stranded in Europe could strain capacity if seat certifications are delayed.

- Competitor Imitation: Rival carriers like American Airlines (AAL) may adopt similar tactics, intensifying competition for engines and third-country slots.

Investment Implications: Timing and Trade Policy Matter

Delta's stock (DAL) has outperformed peers in 2025, rising 12% year-to-date on optimism about its cost-saving strategies. Analysts project Q2 2025 EPS of $2.07 (up 5.3% YoY) and $16.21 billion in revenue. Key considerations for investors:

Near-Term Catalysts:

Trade Negotiations: Monitor U.S.-EU talks; a tariff resolution could unlock $1 billion+ in stranded Airbuses.

Regulatory Approvals: FAA seat certification timelines directly impact Delta's ability to redeploy aircraft.

Long-Term Risks:

Supply Chain Bottlenecks: Engine shortages or geopolitical friction could disrupt fleet modernization.

Valuation: Delta's forward P/E of 12x (vs. industry average 15x) reflects these risks but offers a margin of safety.

Investment Thesis:

Buy: For investors betting on a U.S.-EU trade détente and Delta's operational execution.

Hold: For those concerned about tariff escalation or delays in fleet reactivation.

Broader Implications for Tariff-Sensitive Sectors

Delta's playbook highlights opportunities for companies to:

- Leverage Component Sourcing: Prioritize U.S.-made parts to avoid tariffs on final goods.

- Reroute Strategically: Use third-country registrations to reclassify imports.

- Diversify Suppliers: Mitigate reliance on single manufacturers (e.g., Pratt & Whitney) to reduce disruption risk.

Conclusion

Delta's engine stripping strategy is a masterclass in turning regulatory headwinds into tailwinds. By creatively exploiting tariff loopholes, addressing supply chain bottlenecks, and maintaining fleet modernization, the airline has fortified its financial position amid a trade war. Investors should watch closely for geopolitical developments and Delta's execution on engine reactivation. For sectors facing similar trade challenges—from automotive to semiconductors—Delta's agility offers a blueprint for survival in turbulent times.",https://www.ainvest.com/wencai-ssr/og-image-news-20240226.png,N,,2025-07-12 11:09:53.428015

Watch Denmark's first test flight - Euronews,Roselyne Min,,,,,https://www.euronews.com/next/2025/07/12/could-electric-aeroplanes-be-the-future-of-flight-watch-denmarks-first-test-flight,"A small aeroplane cruising toward Copenhagen may have looked ordinary to most Danes on the ground – but unlike every other flight in Danish history, this aircraft was all electric.
The company says the fixed-wing electric aeroplane provides a safe, quiet, and low-cost alternative to traditional aircraft and helicopters.
The aeroplane also emits up to 84 per cent less carbon dioxide than a traditional helicopter of a similar size.
Many European countries are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of fuel made from renewable resources, as well as hydrogen fuel, which doesn’t emit carbon dioxide.
Maybe we will see hydrogen planes,” said Ingvardsen, who was not involved with the recent test flight.","A small aeroplane cruising toward Copenhagen may have looked ordinary to most Danes on the ground – but unlike every other flight in Danish history, this aircraft was all electric.

The US aerospace company Beta Technologies’ electric plane, ALIA CTOL, completed a 200 kilometre journey between Sønderborg and Copenhagen airports this week, marking Denmark’s first test flight with an aircraft that burns no fuel and can be charged in less than an hour.

The company says the fixed-wing electric aeroplane provides a safe, quiet, and low-cost alternative to traditional aircraft and helicopters.

With its wingspan of 15 metres, ALIA CTOL is the size of a Sprinter van. It can fly at a maximum speed of 281 kilometres per hour, according to Beta Technologies.

The aeroplane also emits up to 84 per cent less carbon dioxide than a traditional helicopter of a similar size.

“Many say that green aviation is something for the future,” Jákup Sverri Kass, director of Sønderborg Airport, said at the take-off event in the city 325 kilometres west of Copenhagen.

“But we are standing here today and seeing that the future has begun. This is not just a test. This is the start of something new,” he added.

The American aeroplane kicked off a European grand tour in May from Shannon Airport in Ireland. It has since dropped by multiple airports on the continent to demonstrate the aircraft’s all-electric operation and charging infrastructure.

In August, the plane will begin operating cargo flights between Bergen and Stavanger in Norway as part of tests on zero-emission aviation led by the Norwegian Civil Aviation Authority.

Charging is the main challenge

ALIA CTOL is designed for regional flight and can be configured for both passenger and cargo travel with up to five passenger seats.

Beta Technologies says the longest distance the aircraft has flown on a single charge is 622 kilometres.

The plane can be charged using a standard fast charger for electric cars in just 20 to 40 minutes, the company says.

The short-range aeroplane has been carrying its own charger and plugging it into a power unit at airports, which takes longer, due to the lack of permanent charging facilities. It has been making pit stops to charge at airports across Europe.

“There's no existing infrastructure on the ground in Europe like there is in the United States today,” Shawn Hall, the company’s chief revenue officer, said from the tarmac at Copenhagen Airport after the plane landed.

In Denmark, Copenhagen Airport CEO Christian Poulsen told Euronews Next the airport will need to adapt its infrastructure to be able to charge aircraft and accommodate a mix of traditional and electric aeroplanes “when these aircraft come to town”.

The cost of batteries and other lightweight materials will be another factor for electric aeroplane manufacturers to contend with, according to Jørgen Mads Clausen, chair emeritus of the Danish battery system giant Danfoss.

He predicts “battery technology” for larger electric planes will be available within the next decade.

“But just like with electric cars, it’s important to be ready when things take off. Because when the technology matures, things will move fast,” Clausen said at the take-off event.

Sustainable aviation in Europe

The Danish government has committed to launching its first fully sustainable domestic flight route by 2025, with a broader target that all domestic routes will be fossil-free by 2030.

This year, it has introduced a flat fee of 13 Danish kroner (€1.74) per passenger to finance the transition toward sustainable domestic flight.

Several Nordic countries have committed to climate goals for their aviation industries.

In Norway, all domestic flights aim to be electric or hybrid by 2040, while in Sweden, all domestic flights should be fossil-free by 2030 and international flights are expected to follow by 2045.

A Swedish-American company, Heart Aerospace, is developing a 30-passenger plane, the ES-30, designed to have a fully battery-powered range of 200 kilometres.

Other countries in Europe, such as the Netherlands, France, and the United Kingdom, have also tested similar-sized e-planes.

But currently electric planes can, at best, fly regionally within Europe because of their battery range, which means other technologies to reduce flight emissions could also help countries meet their sustainability targets.

Lasse Stenhøj Ingvardsen, a team manager of Renewable Energy Systems at the Danish Technological Institute, told Euronews Next that different technologies can be explored for sustainable aviation.

Many European countries are investing in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a type of fuel made from renewable resources, as well as hydrogen fuel, which doesn’t emit carbon dioxide.

“The SAF fuel will be one tool. The electric will be another tool. The hybrid solution will be a third tool. Maybe we will see hydrogen planes,” said Ingvardsen, who was not involved with the recent test flight.

Among them, XCF Global (NASDAQ: SAFX) has positioned itself as a contender with a $1 billion expansion plan that combines modular technology, geographic diversification, and regulatory tailwinds. By 2028, the company aims to produce 160 million gallons of SAF annually in the U.S. alone, while expanding into international markets like Australia. But is this ambition backed by the operational and strategic clarity needed to deliver outsized returns?

The Modular Edge: Scalability Without Sacrificing Flexibility

At the heart of XCF's strategy is its patent-pending modular production design, which allows facilities to be built incrementally while maintaining the ability to pivot between SAF and renewable diesel production. This is no small feat: the dual-use capability ensures that plants can adapt to market demand shifts, smoothing revenue streams. The New Rise Reno facility, already operational at 38 million gallons per year, serves as a template. Its adjacent Phase 2 expansion, New Rise Reno 2, will share infrastructure to cut costs—a model XCF plans to replicate in Florida and North Carolina.

The modular approach also accelerates deployment timelines. While traditional greenfield projects often take five years or more, XCF's facilities are targeting 24-30 months from groundbreaking to operation—a critical edge in a sector where policy mandates are tightening. By 2028, the three new U.S. sites (Florida, North Carolina, and Reno 2) will add 120 million gallons of capacity, tripling the firm's output from current levels.

Geographic Diversification: Tapping into Regulatory Momentum

XCF's expansion is not just about scale but also about geographic reach. Domestically, its sites are strategically placed to serve high-demand regions: the Southeast U.S. (Ft. Myers) and the East Coast (Wilson) are hubs for both air travel and port-based logistics. Internationally, the New Rise Australia venture with Continual Renewable Ventures targets a market where the Australian government's Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) mandates a 12% SAF blend by 2030.

The regulatory tailwinds here are undeniable. Over 2 billion people globally live under SAF mandates or tax incentives today, a figure projected to surpass 4 billion by 2030. This creates a “policy flywheel” where XCF's early mover advantage in regions like Australia could lock in long-term contracts with airlines and governments racing to meet targets.

Valuation and Risks: A High-Potential, High-Risk Play

XCF's stock (SAFX) currently trades at ~$X per share, with ~149.3 million shares outstanding and a low free float (<20%). While the company's growth trajectory is compelling, investors must weigh execution risks:

Regulatory headwinds: Mandates could shift or be delayed, particularly in regions with competing energy priorities.

Operational bottlenecks: Modular designs reduce construction time, but scaling to 160 million gallons by 2028 requires flawless execution.

Commodity price exposure: SAF production costs depend on feedstock availability and prices (e.g., used cooking oil, agricultural residues).

Investment Thesis: A Long-Term Play with Catalysts

For investors with a 3–5 year horizon, XCF presents an intriguing opportunity. The company's focus aligns with three key trends:

1. Policy-driven demand growth: SAF mandates are codified in laws from the EU to the U.S., creating a “regulatory backstop” for demand.

2. Modular scalability: XCF's design reduces the risk of overcapitalization, allowing it to grow in line with market absorption rates.

3. Multi-product flexibility: The ability to switch between SAF and renewable diesel creates a natural hedge against commodity price swings.

However, the stock's success hinges on two near-term catalysts:

- Project milestones: Confirmation of Ft. Myers and Wilson's 2028 completion dates.

- Partnership traction: Progress on New Rise Australia's permitting and financing.

Conclusion: A High-Conviction Idea for Green Energy Bulls

XCF Global is betting its future on a scalable production model and a global regulatory tailwind—a strategy that could pay off handsomely if aviation's decarbonization timeline holds. For investors willing to stomach execution risks, the company's 160-million-gallon target by 2028 represents a meaningful step toward addressing SAF's supply gap. With SAF prices projected to remain elevated due to scarcity, XCF's low-cost modular facilities could deliver strong margins.

But this is not a “set-it-and-forget-it” investment. Monitor regulatory developments in Australia and the U.S., track construction timelines, and assess feedstock cost trends. For the right investor—those with a long-term view on aviation's green transition—XCF's stock warrants serious consideration.

Still, the program amendments and changes to SB 237, along with recent action at the federal level, point to tightening balances and higher LCFS credit prices.
This dynamic could help absorb excess supply from California and soften the impact of the delayed implementation date of the California LCFS rulemaking from 2024.
This initiative, aimed at improving supply chain efficiency and reducing production costs, may help stabilize gasoline prices and encourage greater supply.
SB 237 is scheduled for a hearing on 16 July in the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Energy.","On July 10, California lawmakers amended proposed bill SB 237 to strike a controversial provision that would have capped LCFS credit prices at their January 2025 average, estimated at around USD 70 to 75 per metric ton. Sponsored by moderate Democrats and backed by Senate leadership, the bill is broadly framed as a gasoline affordability measure. The removal of the price cap language eliminates the most contentious component, easing state legislative risks for the LCFS market.

This follows news in late June that the LCFS amendments to tighten the balances in the program, adopted in November 2024, were finally approved with a 1 July implementation date. The 1 July implementation date was disappointing for those market participants hoping the stricter Carbon Intensity standards would take effect earlier in 2025 and prevent the market from adding to the oversupply. Still, the program amendments and changes to SB 237, along with recent action at the federal level, point to tightening balances and higher LCFS credit prices.

Market reaction is expected to be bullish. LCFS credit prices, currently trading near USD 48 per tonne, are now expected to firm as participants reprice the reduced likelihood of a structural credit suppression. The proposed price cap had raised strong concerns across the clean fuels sector, particularly for emerging segments like sustainable aviation fuel and heavy-duty electrification. These segments already operate with weaker support from complementary policies such as the RFS and WCI and rely heavily on LCFS credit value to support project economics.

Structural Shift and Federal Incentives

Market attention is expected to drift to deeper federal structural shifts, including the potential impacts of the One Big Beautiful Bill on ZEV adoption, tightening biofuel availability from reduced imports, and proposed EPA rules that could lower RIN generation from fuels produced with imported feedstocks. As a result, tightening LCFS fundamentals and credit balances are expected, driven by reduced clean fuel volumes and a rise in the average carbon intensity of major biofuels such as biomass-based diesel and SAF over the medium to long term. These structural shifts are expected to be bullish for the market in the medium-to-long term.

Implications for Fuel Standards Markets in Neighboring States

With the legislative threat receding in California, market players are also monitoring the contango developing in Oregon’s clean fuels market, where credit prices have recently risen above USD 100 as the state grapples with credit undersupply and looks to draw in fuel from California and Washington. This dynamic could help absorb excess supply from California and soften the impact of the delayed implementation date of the California LCFS rulemaking from 2024.

Next Steps for SB 237

The rest of SB 237 remains largely intact, including a directive for CARB and the California Energy Commission to explore a coordinated regional gasoline specification in partnership with western states. This initiative, aimed at improving supply chain efficiency and reducing production costs, may help stabilize gasoline prices and encourage greater supply. While potentially constructive for gasoline demand, it remains secondary to the clean fuel market focus. SB 237 is scheduled for a hearing on 16 July in the Assembly Committee on Utilities and Energy.

Despite this faster unwinding, oil market indicators continue to suggest the physical market remains tight, implying it should still be able to absorb additional barrels due to seasonally increasing oil demand.
Brent crude oil is forecast to remain stable at $68.0/b through March 2026.
For instance, in April, despite a 138Mb/d quota increase for April, production from these eight countries rose by only 16Mb/d.
Concurrently, analysis of US crude production trends indicates a considerable slowdown in year-on-year growth in recent months.","OPEC+ has continued its accelerated pace of unwinding production cuts, with eight member states agreeing to a production adjustment of 548Mb/d for August. This increase, exceeding market expectations of 411Mb/d, signals the group's response to a ""steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories,"" according to UBS.

The decision, reached during a 10-minute meeting on July 5, reflects broad support within the group and reiterates its flexibility, stating that ""gradual increases may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions."" Since the initial unwind of production cuts in March, the OPEC+ production quota has increased by approximately 1.919MMb/d.

Despite this faster unwinding, oil market indicators continue to suggest the physical market remains tight, implying it should still be able to absorb additional barrels due to seasonally increasing oil demand. However, rising risks, including ongoing trade tensions, suggest the market could appear less tight over the next six to 12 months, posing potential downside risks to prices. Brent crude oil is forecast to remain stable at $68.0/b through March 2026.

According to UBS, most of the announced increases in OPEC+ output may not fully translate into effective supply reaching the market. This is due to several member states still needing to implement compensation cuts for past overproduction and high domestic demand in the Middle East supporting oil consumption for power generation, particularly during hot temperatures. For instance, in April, despite a 138Mb/d quota increase for April, production from these eight countries rose by only 16Mb/d. Similarly, an early April decision to increase the quota by 411Mb/d from May resulted in an effective production increase of just 154Mb/d. OPEC+ crude exports have remained relatively stable versus March.

Concurrently, analysis of US crude production trends indicates a considerable slowdown in year-on-year growth in recent months. Lower oil prices are weighing on drilling activity, suggesting that US crude production might peak this year, particularly if prices experience renewed downward pressure. The report highlights that while the group decided to increase the production quota by 548Mb/d for August (more than anticipated by the market), indicators suggest that the physical crude market remains tight and could absorb additional barrels. Even so, downside risks persist due to trade tensions and slowing oil production growth in the United States. UBS anticipates that most of the announced increases will not be fully reflected in effective supply due to past overproduction from several countries and high domestic demand driven by summer in the Middle East.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn't as favorable as it was just a few years ago.
Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.
It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.
But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.","Congress’ passage of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cuts bill this month could help grow the market for sustainable aviation fuel, a nascent industry that could be a boon for corn-producing states as airline operators are betting on it to decarbonize the sector.

The Republican budget reconciliation law that Trump signed July 4 pared back some of the credits for sustainable energy in the law that congressional Democrats passed and President Joe Biden signed in 2022 — the Inflation Reduction Act.

But the recent law extended one energy tax credit for producing clean fuels, such as sustainable aviation fuel, an alternative to the typical jet fuel planes use. The credit initially went through 2027, but the GOP law extends it through 2029.

Advocates for sustainable aviation fuel had been pushing Congress to extend the tax credit to support production as states across the U.S. have passed or proposed their own tax credits to grow the sector and lure production within their borders. Lawmakers in Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and New York have introduced bills enacting tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

For airlines, increasing availability of the fuel is essential for the sector to meet its net-zero goal for 2050, with the International Air Transport Association estimating the cleaner fuel could get the industry 65% of the way toward its target.

“We’re not yet at commercial-scale production and you need that longer lead time for these types of projects so I think the extension is really key,” said Chris Bliley, senior vice president of regulatory affairs at Growth Energy, a biofuel industry group.

While the credit’s lifetime was extended, others say the environment for sustainable aviation fuel isn't as favorable as it was just a few years ago. The new budget reconciliation law also included provisions to lower the credit amount for sustainable aviation fuel specifically and clawed back unobligated grant funding to support the sector.

The amount of sustainable aviation fuel that producers make today is far from how much the airline industry needs to be able to use the alternative fuel regularly. U.S. production capacity over the last couple of years, however, has grown, jumping from less than 5,000 barrels per day at the start of 2024 to more than 30,000 by February of this year, according to a May report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Badger State bill

Wisconsin state Rep. David Steffen, a Republican who sponsored a bill to incentivize sustainable aviation fuel, said he learned about a sustainable aviation fuel production company based in Madison called Virent Inc., now a subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corp. Virent’s fuel helped power the first domestic flight powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel in one of its engines.

“I was intrigued that we had this company in our state and I want them and other companies of similar interest to find Wisconsin as their new home,” Steffen said. “It’s a great opportunity for not only the environmental benefits that come with it but for our farmers, dairies and timber producers to access a brand-new market for their product.”

Steffen’s bill also requires that to receive the tax credit, source materials for the fuel must be domestically sourced.

Wisconsin’s legislative session doesn’t end until next March and Steffen said he’s “very comfortable in saying (the bill) will have a clear path to the finish line.” Should it pass in its current state, the tax credit would go into effect in 2028.

Other states

Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska and Washington state all already have enacted laws to provide tax credits for sustainable aviation fuel.

Lawmakers in New York and Michigan have also proposed legislation to create their own tax credits. The New York bill barely moved in the most recent session, while legislation in Michigan has made it out of one committee and been referred to a second.

New York state Sen. Rachel May, a Democrat, plans to re-introduce the legislation next year. She said she wants to amend her bill to offer a larger tax credit for companies making sustainable aviation fuel specifically by mimicking photosynthesis so it doesn’t incentivize diverting feedstock like corn from being used for food, she said.

Her concern is moving the agriculture industry “away from both food production and maybe what might be the best uses of the land,” she added.

Corn ethanol, a common ingredient in automotive fuel, can be used to make sustainable aviation fuel.

Federal extension

While the extension of the federal clean fuels tax credit could be beneficial to the sustainable aviation fuel industry, the new law also lowers the amount of the tax credit for the fuel. It’s now the equivalent to what other biofuel producers qualify for, giving sustainable aviation fuel production less of a competitive advantage.

One version of the budget reconciliation bill also called for extending the tax credit by four years instead of two, but that got scaled back in the version of the bill ultimately signed into law.

The new law also took away any funding not yet obligated as part of a grant program for sustainable aviation fuel and makes fuels derived from feedstocks that come from outside the U.S., Canada or Mexico ineligible for the tax credit.

Despite any limitations, some analysts expect the law will still boost sustainable aviation fuel.

“The Trump administration has yet to outline its approach to SAF, but we expect the fuel to benefit from the administration’s focus on supporting biofuel-producing states,” analysts for Capstone DC, a firm that advises business clients on policy issues, said in a note in late June.

But changes to the federal tax credit could also make states more interested in adopting their own credit to support sustainable aviation fuel, Capstone added.

‘Not nearly as strong’

Tariffs, meanwhile, could also make U.S. feedstocks for producing the fuel more competitive, Paul Greenough, a vice president on Capstone’s energy team.

But Greenough cautioned that sentiment around sustainable aviation fuel still isn’t as rosy as it used to be.

“Momentum still exists for SAF but it’s not nearly as strong as it was under the Biden administration,” he said.

Some climate groups have also expressed concern over changing the clean fuels tax credit at the federal level. The Clean Air Task Force, ahead of the bill becoming law, said extending the credit will largely service other fuels that aren’t sustainable aviation fuel, which will in turn be costlier for the government.",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/2025-07/gettyimages-1153930084.jpg?h=71617716&itok=dS_vKy-I,N,,2025-07-11 20:07:19.143705

We have also published updated slides, including additional examples, which demonstrate the complexity of the new prohibited foreign entity rules, which many taxpayers seeking credits will need to understand and comply with going forward. We will continue to update this post and slides based on continued analysis and implementing guidance.

Last week, both houses of Congress approved a final version of the budget reconciliation bill, and President Trump signed the bill into law. Like earlier versions of this legislation, the law terminates many clean energy incentives almost immediately, including those for clean vehicles and home energy efficiency. It phases out the major investment tax credit (ITC) and production tax credit (PTC) for wind and solar energy within a short timeframe but continues those credits for other technologies, including energy storage, geothermal, hydropower, and nuclear. The law also includes complex and onerous new “prohibited foreign entity” rules that apply to the ITC and PTC, to the credit for clean energy-related manufacturing, and to a lesser degree to other clean energy tax credits. While drastically reducing tax incentives for clean energy, the final bill includes new tax cuts for oil, natural gas, and coal and leaves in place the many existing tax benefits enjoyed by fossil fuel industries.

Below is an analysis of what is in the final bill and what compliance looks like going forward, including:

Phaseouts and terminations

“Beginning of construction”

Prohibited foreign entity rules:

Entity-level rules

Specified foreign entities

Foreign-influenced entities

Payments

Material assistance

Other changes to clean energy credits

1. Phaseouts and Terminations

The final bill leaves in place the direct pay and transferability mechanisms, as well as the prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) rules and other credit bonuses.

2. ""Beginning of construction""

What does it mean to begin construction on a project?

For generation and hydrogen credits, under OBBBA, taxpayers will need to determine whether they can begin construction on projects in time. In general, solar and wind projects must commence by July 4, 2026, to claim the section 45Y or 48E credits. A solar or wind project commencing construction after that date must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, in order to be eligible for generation tax credits under sections 45Y or 48E. Other generation technologies and energy storage must commence before the end of 2033 to obtain the full value of the section 45Y or 48E credits, or by 2035 for partial value. (The legislation clarifies that energy storage at a wind or solar facility is eligible for the ITC for that longer period.) Hydrogen facilities must begin construction before the end of 2027 to claim the section 45V credit.

The new law does not change the definition of “beginning of construction.” The meaning of the term has been well understood in the context of energy tax credits for many years based on consistent IRS guidance dating back to 2013. The IRS has provided guidance providing two common pathways for taxpayers to demonstrate that they have begun construction: if they start physical work of a significant nature (the “physical work test”) or if they pay or incur at least 5% of the total project cost. Under both the physical work test and the 5% safe harbor, taxpayers must maintain continuous progress toward project completion (the “continuity requirement”). Whether taxpayers meet this requirement is based on the applicable facts and circumstances, but they are deemed to satisfy the continuity requirement if they place the project in service within four years of commencement.

These rules and safe harbors are set forth in Notice 2013-29 (describing the safe harbor tests and continuity rule as they apply generally to the PTC/ITC under 45/48) and Notice 2018-59 (providing more clarity and detail about how these rules apply specifically to ITC projects). Similar rules have been applied to sections 45Q, 48E, 45Y, 30C, 45V, 179D, and 48D.

Congress has modified the eligibility deadlines for energy tax credits several times based on beginning of construction dates without changing these IRS rules — including in OBBBA. In fact, OBBBA includes a provision seemingly intended to codify the IRS’s longstanding beginning of construction rules, which references Notice 2013-29 and Notice 2018-59. Confusingly, however, the provision only explicitly applies to a new paragraph of the tax code (section 7701(a)(51)) that includes definitions of “prohibited foreign entities” — definitions that do not contain the phrase “beginning of construction.” Our reading of the final text is that “beginning of construction” is presumed to be consistently used throughout the bill. The statutory reference to Notice 2013-29 affirms that the consistent body of past IRS guidance should apply.

How does the recent executive order (EO) impact beginning of construction?

Notwithstanding our reading of the text and the statutory structure, taxpayers should be aware that the White House issued an EO on July 7 directing Treasury to issue guidance to ensure the beginning of construction rules are not circumvented, stating the following:

Within 45 days following enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take all action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems necessary and appropriate to strictly enforce the termination of the clean electricity production and investment tax credits under sections 45Y and 48E of the Internal Revenue Code for wind and solar facilities. This includes issuing new and revised guidance as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to ensure that policies concerning the “beginning of construction” are not circumvented, including by preventing the artificial acceleration or manipulation of eligibility and by restricting the use of broad safe harbors unless a substantial portion of a subject facility has been built.

This executive order is not law, and the scope of the Treasury and IRS guidance called for by the executive order (and when it will become effective) is unclear. However, consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and typical practice of the IRS, any new subregulatory guidance would presumably be prospective and subject to abuse of discretion review under the APA.

Taxpayers will need to work closely with their advisors to plan and understand the activities that will satisfy the beginning of construction rules and take into account any new guidance issued under the executive order.

3. The prohibited foreign entity rules

Like all prior iterations of the legislation, the OBBBA as enacted includes a thicket of new and complex prohibited foreign entity (“PFE”) rules that will, at minimum, impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers. It is unclear why OBBBA applies these rules solely to a subset of energy credits and not the countless other subsidies that exist in the tax code — including tax benefits for fossil fuel energy sources and the many new tax breaks created by OBBBA.

In any event, the PFE rules are now law, and taxpayers must understand them in order to comply with the law if they are seeking tax credits. This section explains the three new sets of PFE rules and identifies key steps and key ambiguities.

The PFE rules fall into three categories:

Entity-level rules that disallow several clean energy tax credits if the taxpayer is a PFE — either a specified foreign entity (“SFE”) or a foreign influenced entity (“FIE”).

Payments rules under which taxpayers can lose eligibility for the 45Y, 48E, or 45X tax credits (or even have to repay 48E credits claimed up to a decade prior) if they make payments that are deemed to confer “effective control” to an SFE.

Material assistance rules that require taxpayers to determine if the manufactured products comprising their facilities (for 45Y and 48E) or inputs into the components they produce (for 45X) derive excessively from PFEs.

The following table outlines the key phase-in dates for the new PFE restrictions (bracketed dates shown for calendar year taxpayers):

OBBBA does not apply foreign entity rules to certain other energy credits, including the PTC and ITC for projects placed in service before 2025 (sections 45 and 48), the continuing ITC for geothermal heat pumps (also section 48), the section 45V clean hydrogen production credit, and the many clean energy credits that the law terminates within a year. It does, however, prohibit transfers of credits to SFEs under section 6418.

a. Entity-level rules

The new law establishes two categories of PFEs: (1) SFEs and (2) FIEs. Generally speaking, the law makes both types of entities ineligible for tax credits under sections 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45U, and 45Z, with some differences in rules for different credits.

Under the entity-level rules, taxpayers will need to determine whether they themselves are SFEs or FIEs. As described in more detail in the following sections, the payments and material assistance rules also reference the definitions of SFE and FIE, which means that taxpayers will also need to determine whether certain counterparties or suppliers are SFEs or FIEs.

What are the SFE rules?

The 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45U, and 45Z credits are disallowed for SFEs beginning in the first taxable year after the date of enactment. For calendar year taxpayers, this will generally mean calendar year 2026.

An entity is deemed an SFE, if on the last day of the taxable year, it is either (a) included on various lists under national security laws, including organizations that are designated as threats to national security by a variety of federal agencies, Chinese battery companies, and companies listed as part of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, or (b) a “foreign controlled entity.”

A foreign controlled entity includes

a government of a “covered nation” (North Korea, Iran, Russia, & China),

a citizen or national of a covered nation (excluding U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents),

an entity or qualified business unit incorporated or organized under laws of a covered nation or an entity having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or

any entity “controlled” by such entities.

“Control” means an entity owning greater than 50% vote or value, greater than 50% profit or capital interests, or greater than 50% of the beneficial ownership. Only section 318(a)(2) (upward attribution) applies in determining indirect ownership. In simple terms, this means that the ownership analysis is limited to testing entities/individuals that sit above the U.S. taxpayer in the chain of ownership, including partners and shareholders. We have included specific examples demonstrating how this ownership analysis works in our updated slides, which we encourage readers to review.

Importantly, US taxpayers do not need to examine/test the familial relationships (e.g., spouses, children, parents, siblings) of their owners/shareholders or whether related subsidiaries (i.e. those owned by a common parent) are foreign controlled entities. This expansive type of attribution testing, at least for purposes of testing for SFEs, was included in earlier versions of the bill but not included in the final legislation, meaning taxpayers only need to test the entities/shareholders sitting above them in the chain of ownership.

What does compliance with the entity-level SFE rules look like going forward?

U.S. taxpayers will generally know whether they are classified as a threat to national security or one of the entities included on the various lists referenced above. SFE testing for most taxpayers will therefore mainly consist of looking up the chain of ownership to determine whether any governments of covered nations, citizens of covered nations, or entities organized in covered nations own the taxpayer directly, or indirectly through another entity.

Determining whether a foreign controlled entity directly owns more than 50% of the taxpayer is relatively straightforward – the taxpayer considers its immediate shareholders, partners, or beneficial owners. Determining whether a foreign controlled entity indirectly owns more than 50% is more complicated, but it may still be manageable.

Critical to this analysis is when and how a taxpayer must attribute ownership proportionately to an entity several legs up the chain. For stock owned by an entity other than a corporation or trust (like a partnership) to a foreign controlled entity, taxpayers must attribute ownership proportionally up the chain regardless of the percentage of stock owned (under section 318(a)(2)(A)). So, if a Chinese entity owns 49% of US Partnership, which owns 25% of US Corp, the Chinese entity is treated as proportionally owning 12.25% of US Corp (49% x 25%).

If, however, stock owned by a corporation is being attributed to a foreign controlled entity, the stock is only attributed proportionally if the foreign controlled entity owns 50% (by value) or more of the stock of the corporation sitting immediately below it (under section 318(a)(2)(C)). So, if a Chinese entity owns 49% of US Corp 1, who owns 25% of US Corp 2, the Chinese entity is treated as proportionally owning 0% of US Corp 2. Ownership percentages are not multiplied up the chain, because the Chinese entity doesn’t own a sufficient amount of stock in US Corp 1 to be treated under section 318(a)(2)(C) as proportionally owning the stock that US Corp 1 owns.

The proportional ownership rules are slightly less clear if the ownership interest is something other than stock, since section 318 only covers stock ownership. OBBBA says that “similar” rules should apply when attributing non-stock interests for purposes of PFE testing, and we include examples in our linked slide deck showing how attribution presumably works in such cases.

Finally, even if a taxpayer is not excluded as an SFE by virtue of 50%+ Chinese (or Russian, Iranian, or North Korean) ownership (as in the examples above), other rules, discussed below, may exclude taxpayers that have less than 50% Chinese ownership thresholds.

What are the FIE rules?

The FIE rules apply to taxpayers seeking credits under sections 45Y, 48E, 45X, 45Q, 45U, and 45Z, except for the effective control payment test within the FIE rules (described below), which only applies to 45Y, 48E, and 45X. The FIE rules apply to 45Y, 48E, 45X, and 45Q in the taxable year after enactment and apply to 45Z and 45U in taxable years beginning after 2 years after the date of enactment.

Credits are disallowed if the taxpayer is an FIE, and like prior iterations of the OBBB, the FIE definitions layer onto the SFE definitions. An entity is an FIE if, on the last day of the tax year

an SFE has the direct authority to appoint a covered officer;,

a single SFE owns at least 25% of the entity,

one or more SFEs own at least 40% of the entity, or

at least 15% of the entity’s debt has been issued, in the aggregate, to one or more SFEs.

For the 45Y, 48E, and 45Z credits only, an entity is also deemed an FIE if it makes a payment to an SFE that is deemed to confer effective control. Since the payments rule is different in nature than the other FIE tests and very complex, we discuss it in the next section.

What is the publicly traded entity exception for the PFE rules?

The final version of the OBBBA provides modified SFE and FIE rules for publicly traded entities whose securities are regularly traded on a national securities exchange registered with the SEC (as well as several other types of markets and exchanges, but not a covered nation’s exchange).

First, for such publicly traded entities, the bill turns off the regular foreign controlled entity rule in section 7701(a)(51)(C)(v) that treats entities as SFEs if they are controlled by a government, citizen, or entity organized in a covered nation. It replaces this rule with a new (but similar) rule, which is that a publicly traded entity will be treated as a foreign controlled entity (and therefore an SFE) if the entity is controlled (i.e. >50% owned applying 318(a)(2)) by either

one or more SFEs listed on various national security lists, or

one or more governments of, citizens/nationals of, or entities organized in a covered nation,

who are required to report their beneficial ownership of the entity under SEC Rule 13d-3.

This rule provides some relief from the SFE rules for these companies, because shareholders only report as beneficial owners under 13d-3 if they own more than 5% of equity securities. Public companies therefore only need to track foreign connections of individual shareholders with large (>5%) ownership interests.

Second, for such publicly traded entities and their 80% owned subsidiaries, the final bill turns off the regular FIE triggers and replaces them with new (but again, very similar) FIE triggers. A publicly traded entity (and 80% subsidiaries) will be treated as an FIE if

an SFE has the authority (presumably including direct and indirect authority) to appoint a covered officer.

a single SFE who reports its beneficial ownership of the entity under 13d-3 owns at least 25%.

one or more SFEs who report beneficial ownership of the entity under 13d-3 own, in the aggregate, at least 40%, or

the publicly traded entity or its 80% sub has issued debt in excess of 15% of its publicly traded debt to one or more SFEs.

Importantly, publicly traded entities are, however, still subject to the full suite of effective control payment and material assistance rules, meaning these modified rules provide only limited relief.

What does FIE compliance look like going forward?

FIE compliance is going to require three key things.

Ownership: First, taxpayers need to look at their direct owners (i.e. immediate owners) and indirect owners (i.e. entities further up the ownership chain) to determine whether any of those entities are SFEs. The same attribution and proportional ownership rules of section 318(a)(2) that we described above apply. This task may seem daunting, because taxpayers will first need to perform SFE testing on their owners. In many (perhaps most) cases, however, the ownership analysis for SFE and FIE testing will merge, assuming taxpayers aren’t indirectly owned by entities included on various national security lists. Like the SFE test, the key FIE analysis for many taxpayers will also consist of looking up the chain of ownership to determine whether any governments of covered nations, citizens of covered nations, or entities organized in covered nations own the taxpayer directly, or indirectly through another entity. Based on this information, taxpayers will determine which owners are SFEs and then whether any single SFE owns 25% of the taxpayer or whether one or more SFEs own at least 40% in the aggregate. Part of this analysis will inherently involve understanding whether an SFE has direct authority to appoint a covered officer, which in many cases would only occur where the SFE is an immediate owner, not one that sits several entities up the chain.

Debt: Second, taxpayers need to look at whom their debt was “issued” to. The final OBBBA text moved away from requiring taxpayers to determine the percentage of debt “held by” SFEs to now require taxpayers to determine the percentage “issued to” SFEs. Though it is unknown how Treasury/IRS guidance would interpret this language, until guidance is released, our reading of the statute and the drafting history suggests that the analysis requires looking at the first issuance. For example, in the case of municipal bonds, a more than reasonable interpretation of the statute would suggest that a bond issuer seeking a tax credit would only test whether the underwriter is an SFE, not every investor who eventually holds the debt.

Payments: Third, taxpayers claiming 45Y, 48E, and 45X need to test contracts related to their qualified facilities and the production of eligible components to determine whether a payment was made to an SFE under a contract conferring “effective control.” This requirement applies for 10 years for credits claimed under section 48E (subject to recapture) and each year a credit is claimed under 45Y or 45X. Step 1 requires analyzing (a) whether the terms of contracts related to the taxpayer’s qualified facility, energy storage technology (EST), or production of eligible components confer effective control to a counterparty and (b) whether agreements with respect to such facilities and production confer effective control. Step 2 is to find out whether the payment recipient/counterparty to the agreement is an SFE. We discuss these steps in more detail below.

FIE compliance is onerous and complex. But it is not impossible. Taxpayers are likely to be able to satisfy these rules as long as they understand them and carefully apply each step of the analysis. Buckle up and keep reading.

b. Payments rules

The payments rules apply to the 45Y, 48E, and 45X credits. Under the payments rules, a single “bad” payment can have major repercussions, so taxpayers will need to understand the rules and monitor their contracts closely.

The payments rules are triggered if, during the prior taxable year, the entity makes a payment to an SFE under an agreement that gives the SFE “effective control” over either (1) a qualified facility or EST of the taxpayer or any person related to the taxpayer, or (2) critical mineral/eligible component production by the taxpayer or a person related to the taxpayer.

If a taxpayer has made any such payment in a prior year, it is deemed to be an FIE for the current year. The taxpayer will lose any credits for the facility (45Y/48E) or the production (45X) for the current year — and potentially credits from prior years, as discussed below.

The legislation is unclear whether a payment that is deemed to confer “effective control” over one facility renders the taxpayer an FIE for all purposes, which would mean that it loses credits for any other facility it has.

The general rule is that payments conferring effective control are those made pursuant to contracts that give one or more counterparties “specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation in a qualified facility, or energy storage.”

Taxpayers claiming tax credits under sections 45Y or 45X must monitor effective control payments in each year prior to the year they claim a tax credit or risk losing their credit for the subsequent year. Starting in 2028, taxpayers claiming tax credits under section 48E must monitor effective control payments (including potentially those for other facilities owned by the taxpayer) for a 10-year period beginning in the year prior to claiming the credit or risk having the credit recaptured. It is unclear whether a payment with respect to one facility can trigger recapture of prior section 48E tax credits for other facilities.

How can taxpayers comply with the payments rules to avoid triggering them?

Below, we describe the two main steps to compliance.

Step 1: Identify contracts/agreements related to qualified facilities, EST, or the production of eligible components that potentially confer effective control

Step 1 is for taxpayers to analyze all contracts related to their qualified facilities, EST, and production of eligible components to determine if such contracts fall into either of two categories of contracts conferring effective control.

Category I includes any contracts including triggering terms conferring “effective control.” Prior to the issuance of guidance (and likely after the issuance of guidance as well), that means contracts that provide counterparties any one of six specific contractual rights, including rights to

determine the quantity or timing of production of an eligible component produced by the taxpayer;

determine the amount or timing of activities related to the production of electricity at a qualified facility or the storage of energy in EST of the taxpayer;

determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a production unit that produces eligible components;

determine which entity may purchase or use the output of a qualified facility of the taxpayer;

restrict access to data critical to production or storage of energy at a qualified facility, or to the site of production or any part of a qualified facility or EST of the taxpayer, to personnel or agents of the counterparty; or

exclusively maintain, repair, or operate any plant or equipment which is necessary to the production by the taxpayer of eligible components or electricity.

Category II includes licensing agreements for the provision of intellectual property (IP) (and contracts related to such agreements) “with respect” to a qualified facility, EST, or the production of an eligible component that contain any one of six contractual rights/terms, including terms or rights that

specify or otherwise direct one or more sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals;

direct the operation of any qualified facility, any EST, or any production unit that produces an eligible component;

limit the taxpayer’s utilization of IP related to the operation of the qualified facility, EST, or production of an eligible component;

receive royalties under the licensing agreement or similar agreement beyond the 10th year of the agreement;

direct or require the taxpayer to enter into an agreement for the provision of services for a duration longer than two years; or

do not provide the licensee (the taxpayer) with all the technical data, info, and know-how necessary to produce the eligible component(s) subject to the agreement without further involvement from the counterparty/SFE.

In addition, category II also includes any licensing agreement for the provision of IP with respect to a qualified facility, EST, or production of eligible components that is entered into or modified after enactment (July 4, 2025), regardless of whether the contract contains one of the six contractual IP rights/terms above. Given the breadth of the payment rules related to licensing, a best practice for taxpayers is to assume that all licensing agreements warrant further analysis described in step 2.

Step 2: Determine whether counterparties/payment recipients of contracts conferring effective control are SFEs

After determining whether any contracts fall into categories I or II, step 2 is to find out whether the counterparties to such contracts are SFEs. In order to run afoul of the payment rules, the contract must (1) result in payment to an SFE, and (2) confer effective control to an SFE or person “related” to an SFE under sections 267(b) or 707(b). Importantly, a plain reading of the text indicates that the entity must make a payment to an SFE, not just a person related to an SFE, to violate the rule. Once a taxpayer determines that a payment has been/will be made to an SFE under the contract, then the taxpayer must determine whether the contract gives effective control over the facility or production (including the facility or production of a related person) to an SFE or a person related to an SFE (under the principles of 267(b) and 707(b), which are extremely broad).

The upshot of this reading is that taxpayers would not need to perform the related person portion of this analysis unless the payment recipient and counterparty receiving effective control are different persons/entities under the contract. Taxpayers should monitor future guidance on this closely, however. Additionally, any single payment, no matter how small, can trigger these rules. Contracts falling into the contract categories described above must therefore be reviewed closely for compliance.

It is also worth noting that determining the SFE status of a counterparty could be difficult; the counterparty may not know whether it is an SFE or want to share its ownership structure with the taxpayer. And, the statute does not provide any specific path to obtaining certification from counterparties nor does it provide a “knowingly” standard, meaning taxpayers can violate the rule regardless of knowledge or reasonable efforts. That said, taxpayers will need to devise measures to get comfortable with compliance, which could still potentially involve the use of certifying statements from counterparties or similar.

Are existing contracts safe from the FIE effective control payment test?

In short, no. Taxpayers claiming credits under sections 45Y, 48E, and 45X will be subject to the FIE rules beginning in taxable years 2026 regardless of when they commenced construction and regardless of whether they are in the middle of their 45Y or 45X credit period. Those taxpayers are party to existing contracts, and payments made in the prior year pursuant to those contracts are subject to these effective control payment rules.

c. Material assistance rules

What are the final material assistance rules?

OBBBA denies 45Y and 48E credits if the construction of a facility or EST includes “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity. Material assistance essentially means that too much of the facility or EST was produced by PFEs, as determined by a set of highly complex rules that apply to facilities and EST beginning construction after 2025. Similarly, OBBBA denies 45X credits if eligible components are made with too many inputs from PFEs. The 45X material assistance rules apply to components sold in taxable years beginning after the date of enactment.

Whether a facility, EST, or eligible component satisfies the material assistance rules is determined by a “material assistance cost ratio.” That ratio must meet certain threshold percentages, which escalate year-by-year. In simple terms, the cost ratio is the total cost of non-PFE parts divided by the total cost of all parts incorporated into the facility or eligible component. Below, we describe in more detail how the ratios are calculated for qualified facilities, EST, and eligible components, and which “parts” appear to be subject to the analysis.

For qualified facilities and EST, the cost ratio equals

For 45X eligible components, the cost ratio equals

In order to determine these ratios, taxpayers will need to understand what constitutes “manufactured products” for qualified facilities/EST and what constitutes “direct material costs” for 45X eligible components and critical minerals, which we discuss below. Taxpayers must ensure that the ratios for each qualified facility or eligible component meet the required statutory thresholds. For qualified facilities and EST, those thresholds are based on when the facility begins construction; for eligible components it is based on when the component is sold.

Here are the statutory thresholds for qualified facilities and EST:

And here are the thresholds for 45X eligible components, which differ depending on the type of eligible component sold:

Notably, Treasury is directed to adjust the applicable critical minerals percentages upward based on domestic geographic availability, supply chain constraints, domestic processing capacity needs, and national security concerns.

What is included in “manufactured product” for 45Y/48E and “direct material cost” for 45X?

For 45Y/48E, the final bill defines “manufactured product” as “a component of a qualified facility, as described in section 45Y(g)(11)(B) and any guidance issued thereunder” or any product identified by Treasury in subsequent guidance. Section 45Y(g)(11)(B) contains the requirements for the domestic content bonus. It defines manufactured product by reference to the Buy America regulations under section 661 of title 49, which distinguishes between manufactured product and steel and iron that is not incorporated into components, like structural steel and iron. Given this reference, it appears that the material assistance rules only require taxpayers to determine the sourcing of manufactured products, including components, not structural steel or iron, which presumably is excluded from the cost ratio calculation. In the language of the domestic content regime established in Notice 2023-38, this would mean taxpayers need to evaluate applicable project components (“APCs”) that are manufactured products; it is ambiguous whether taxpayers would also need to evaluate manufactured product components (“MPCs”) - i.e. whether the parenthetical “(including components)” in the cost ratio formula is meant to refer to MPCs.

In this respect, like prior iterations of the bill, the final OBBBA text remains ambiguous regarding how far up the supply chain taxpayers must look when calculating the cost ratio. However, in the final text, the cost ratio is calculated based upon “direct costs” (48E/45Y) and “direct material costs” (45X) in accordance with the meaning under section 461 and any regulations issued under 263A. In particular, during Senate floor consideration of OBBBA, “costs” for 48E/45Y were clarified to be “direct costs.” The term direct costs is an indication that the law only requires the taxpayer to analyze purchases that it makes without looking through to embedded components - but it remains unclear.

The text directs Treasury to issue safe harbor cost tables and other guidance by December 31, 2026, to identify “direct costs” of any manufactured products attributable to a PFE and the “direct material costs” of any eligible components attributable to a PFE, presumably by facility/component type. In the interim, taxpayers have the option of using the safe harbor tables included in Notice 2025-08, both for purposes of 45Y/48E and 45X, and to rely on certifications from suppliers stating that a product was not produced by a PFE (i.e. a production certification). In the interim they also have the option to obtain and rely on certifications from suppliers stating the “total direct costs or the total direct material costs, as applicable, of such product or component that was not produced or manufactured by a prohibited foreign entity” (i.e. a cost certification). Taxpayers cannot rely on product and cost certifications that they know or have reason to know are inaccurate and are subject to penalties if they violate this rule. Suppliers are also subject to penalties for false statements made in certifications.

What must be included in the optional supplier certification?

The supplier certification must include the supplier’s employer ID number or similar number issued by a foreign government, be signed under penalty of perjury, and be retained by the supplier and taxpayer for at least 6 years. The certification must state that the supplier does not know or have reason to know that (1) the property the taxpayer purchased was produced or manufactured by a PFE and (2) “that any prior supplier in the chain of production of that property is a prohibited foreign entity.” In addition, for 45X, the certification must specify the total direct material costs for the components and subcomponents that were not produced by a PFE, and for 45Y/48E, the total direct cost attributed to manufactured products that were not produced by a PFE.

This certification requirement appears to be mismatched with the substantive cost ratio requirements, which do not appear to require tracing fully up the chain, and with the provisions allowing taxpayers to use the safe harbor cost tables provided in Notice 2025-08.

How do taxpayers use the safe harbor tables provided in Notice 2025-08 leading up to new guidance? What’s the path forward for technologies without tables?

Notice 2025-08 helps taxpayers claim the domestic content bonus. It provides default cost percentages for APCs and MPCs. Under Notice 2023-38 (domestic content guidance), APCs are items that are directly incorporated into a project (i.e. directly incorporated into a qualified facility or into energy storage technology). MPCs are items that are directly incorporated into a manufactured product. Under the domestic content rules, the origin of subcomponents is not considered, so taxpayers do not need to analyze further upstream than the MPC level. The tables in Notice 2025-08 are meant to be used as exclusive lists of components.

How taxpayers should use the tables in Notice 2025-08 for the material assistance cost ratio is not entirely clear. The tables list manufactured products (referred to in the tables as APCs) for solar, land-based wind, and battery storage projects. The tables break each manufactured product into components (referred to in the tables as MPCs), and ascribe default cost percentages to each component and to production of the manufactured product.

It seems evident that since OBBBA gives taxpayers the option of relying on the domestic content tables, they only need to determine – at most – whether the APCs and MPCs in their projects were produced by prohibited foreign entities without looking further upstream. If subcomponents were part of the analysis, the tables would provide little or no help. But given that the material assistance cost ratio is based on “direct costs,” it is not clear whether taxpayers determine their cost ratio at the APC level or the MPC level.

So, what would that look like? As an example, if the analysis were applied at an MPC level, assume a taxpayer seeks to develop and place in service a qualified facility that is a land-based wind facility. Notice 2025-08 specifically provides a cost percentage table for the APC and MPCs incorporated into such a facility:

The table indicates that the nacelle (an MPC) makes up 47.5% of the cost of all MPCs in a land-based wind facility, and the rest of the MPCs make up the other roughly 52.5%. Assuming the taxpayer purchases nacelles from a non-PFE and all other MPCs from PFEs, the cost ratio for this facility would presumably be 47.5% (the non-PFE total direct manufactured product cost/total direct manufactured product cost), which would meet the cost ratio threshold for facilities beginning construction in 2026. This assumes that the “direct cost” referred to in the statute refers to the purchase cost of MPCs, meaning purchasing the MPC from a non-PFE is sufficient.

This approach, however, carries risk given the references to supply chain tracing in the supplier certification rules.

If the analysis is performed at a APC and MPC level, for facility types that are not included in Notice 2025-28, including nuclear, hydropower, geothermal, and fuel cells, taxpayers will need to make their own determination about which components are considered APCs and MPCs and perform their own cost analysis based on the best reading of the statute. This will be a difficult task, and many taxpayers will likely need to wait for the IRS to issue safe harbor tables.

In applying the material assistance rules, do taxpayers need to determine whether their suppliers have made any payments to SFEs that trigger the effective control rules, rendering the supplier a “foreign-influenced entity”?

The effective control payment rule appears to apply only to the taxpayer and the contracts they enter into with respect to their qualified facilities or their production of eligible components. That means that taxpayers claiming the 45Y or 48E credits generally would not need to test payments made by their suppliers in determining whether those suppliers are FIEs for purposes of the taxpayer’s material assistance test. However, any suppliers claiming the section 45X credit must conduct their own FIE analysis, including applying the payments test with respect to their production of eligible components. for purposes of claiming the 45X tax credit. There are multiple ways to interpret the language in the statute, though, and the text could also be read to apply the payments test to suppliers in some cases.

Is there an exception from the material assistance rules for purchases of manufactured products and direct materials under an existing contract?

Yes. The material assistance provisions provide a limited “existing contract” exception. The exception excludes from the cost ratio the cost of any manufactured product, eligible component, or constituent element, material, or subcomponent of an eligible component that is acquired by/manufactured for the taxpayer pursuant to a binding written contract entered into before June 16, 2025. For sections 48E and 45Y, the facility that the materials are incorporated into must begin construction before August 1, 2025 and be placed in service before 2030 (except for wind and solar facilities, which must be placed in service before 2028). For 45X, the eligible component that the materials are used in must be sold before January 1, 2030.

4. Other changes to clean energy credits

In addition to the changes to the credit eligibility dates and the new foreign entity rules, the law makes a number of other policy changes. Below is a non-exhaustive list.

45Y/48E Clean Electricity Investment and Production Credits:

Domestic content bonus. The law raises the threshold percentages of domestic manufactured products required to claim the domestic content bonus for the section 48E ITC to generally match those for the section 45Y PTC. (The mismatch may have been unintended by the IRA.) This change does not apply to the section 48 ITC.

Domestic content/elective pay: Unlike prior versions of the Senate bill, the final legislation leaves in place the two exceptions from the requirement that projects of 1 MW or more must satisfy the domestic content rules to claim any credit. Those exceptions are for instances where domestic sourcing would raise construction costs by more than 25% or where relevant products are not sufficiently available.

Fuel cells: The law makes fuel cells eligible for the section 48E ITC, with a special exclusion from the zero-greenhouse gas emissions requirement that applies to other electricity-producing technologies. The fuel cell ITC rate is a flat 30%: there are no prevailing wage and apprenticeship rules or credit bonuses.

Lifecycle analysis: The law includes language directing the Secretary of the Treasury to “consider” studies that use “widely accepted lifecycle assessment concepts, such as concepts described in standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization.” This change does not require Treasury to take any new action that would expand eligibility for the credit. ​​

Leased property: The final legislation does not include a provision excluding residential solar installations that are leased or rented to homeowners from the section 48E credit. However, leased or rented solar water heaters and small wind property are made ineligible.

10% ITC: The final legislation terminates the provision that would have continued the ITC indefinitely at a 10% rate (or 2% without PWA).​​

45V Clean Hydrogen Production Credit: Under the final legislation, clean hydrogen facilities must begin construction before 2028, as opposed to 2033 under the IRA. The final bill does not apply foreign entity rules or make any other changes to the section 45V credit.

45Q Credit for Carbon Oxide Sequestration: The legislation raises the credit rates for captured carbon that is injected underground to extract oil or natural gas (“enhanced oil recovery”) or used in other ways (such as in a commercial product). For carbon capture equipment placed in service after enactment, those rates are raised from $60 per metric ton to $85 (assuming PWA rules are met), equaling the rate for CO2 that is captured and sequestered.

45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit:

Wind components: The legislation terminates the 45X credit for U.S. production of wind components (blades, nacelles, towers, etc.) after 2027.

Metallurgical coal: The law makes metallurgical coal eligible for the 45X credit through 2029 at a rate of 2.5% of production costs. The law does not restrict the use of such coal, with the result that the credit can now go to coal that is exported to foreign steelmakers, including those in China.

Integrated components: The law establishes additional requirements beginning in 2027 for taxpayers producing 45X-eligible components that are integrated into each other. If they wish to claim 45X credits for “primary components” that are integrated into “secondary components,” both components need to be produced in the same facility; 65% of the producer’s direct material costs for the secondary component must be for primary components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States; and the secondary component must be sold to an unrelated third party.

45Z Clean Fuels Credit:

Two-year extension: The credit is extended from the end of 2027 to the end of 2029.

SAF rate: The legislation eliminates the higher rate for sustainable aviation fuel.

GHG determination:

ILUC: Under pre-OBBBA law, eligibility for the 45Z credit is restricted to fuels with a lifecycle GHG emissions rate below certain thresholds, with lower-emissions fuels receiving a higher credit. The emissions rate determination must take into account both direct and significant indirect emissions. However, OBBBA includes a new provision that specifically directs Treasury to ignore a major source of emissions — the indirect land use changes resulting from the use of crops as fuel feedstocks. This mandate will result in broader eligibility and higher credits for higher-emissions fuels.

Negative emissions rates: Under the legislation, emissions rates for fuels cannot be negative. That effectively caps the 45Z credit at $1 per gallon or gallon-equivalent (with inflation adjustments), with one significant exception, described below.

RNG from manures: Under current 45Z guidance, emissions rates for RNG from U.S. animal manures are determined based on average national manure types and management practices. The legislation directs Treasury to provide distinct emissions rates for fuels based on specific types of animal manure feedstock. Fuels derived from manures are specifically excluded from the prohibition on negative emissions rates. The upshot of these changes is that such fuels may become eligible for credits exceeding $1, depending on Treasury’s future emissions rate determinations, with no statutory upper limit.

Foreign feedstocks: The legislation limits eligibility for the 45Z credit to fuels exclusively services from feedstocks produced or grown in the United States, Mexico, or Canada.

Preventing double crediting: The legislation prevents double-crediting by providing that 45Z-eligible fuels cannot be produced from fuels that are themselves eligible for 45Z and by terminating the former sustainable aviation fuel excise tax credit.

Small agri-biodiesel credit: The legislation provides a 20-cent per gallon additional credit for agri-biodiesel with a per-producer cap through 2026 and makes the credit eligible for transferability.

45U Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit: The House-passed bill would have modified the termination date for 45U and earlier versions of the Senate bill would have imposed restrictions on sourcing nuclear fuel from covered nations. However, those provisions were dropped. The final bill’s only change to 45U is the addition of the foreign entity provisions described above.",https://taxlawcenter.org/images/_full/thumbnail_2025-03-20-125634_gyoy.png,N,,2025-07-11 21:07:41.175214

This would be a major breakthrough if it pans out, since biocrude has had trouble finding a use case due to its high oxygen content versus fossil fuels. It also provides a new pathway for producing SAF in the first place, which can power planes while lowering planet-killing emissions by 80%. We're rooting for this one.

Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, with help from the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation, tested whether molybdenum carbide nanocatalysts, once dispersed onto the mineral zeolite, could remove oxygen from biocrude. They then upgraded the tar-like substance using hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL), a process that does in mere minutes what it takes the Earth eons to do — namely, turn dead biomass into explodey stuff that makes engines go vroom.

That all concluded with some very promising results, including complete oxygen removal and a high heating value (HHV) very near to the industry standard fuel, called Jet A. Getting rid of the oxygen is key, since the famously corrosive gas would eat through the actual plane engines, which would be very bad. In addition, this treated substance hit its targets in surface tension, density, freeze point, and other key metrics in order to qualify as SAF. While it's not quite ready to go into aircraft just yet, this is a huge step towards getting there.

There are already a number of ways to make SAF, and it can be made from a variety of sources (called feedstocks), including vegetable oils, fats, and greases. Did you flush your leftovers down the disposal last night? Should have put it in an airplane instead, it could have flown to Argentina with that.

Okay, not quite. But 360,000 commercial flights have already been powered by SAF, and Virgin Atlantic recently flew an entire flight with 100% SAF, so this is a proven technology that works. Plus, it just slots right into existing infrastructure; it can be piped through the same pipes and pumped into the same planes as ordinary fuel, so nothing needs to be re-engineered. It's a truly drop-in solution. The trick, as it ever is, is money. Right now, SAF is just more expensive than petroleum jet fuel, and given that fuel is one of an airline's highest costs, switching to it just isn't going to happen on its own. Either governments will need to subsidize SAF, or SAF will need to get cheaper. Plus, for the industry to switch over entirely, we're going to need to be able to make a lot more of the stuff.

The breakthrough these scientists have made doesn't necessarily solve those problems immediately, but it does open up another pathway to the production of SAF. The more we know about making the stuff, the likelier we'll find a cost-efficient solution. In this case, it also has the benefit of giving biocrude, which has otherwise struggled to find a use case, a new lease on life.

Air travel accounts for 2% of CO2 emissions globally, and fully 12% from the transportation sector, per the U.S. Department of Energy. Due to battery weight, electric planes for commercial use aren't plausible. So if aviation wants to go green, the best way to do it is with SAF, which creates 80% fewer net emissions. In other words, that banana peel rotting in your trash right now just might save the planet, if we can just find a way to turn it into jet fuel on the cheap.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/scientists-find-new-way-to-power-your-next-flight-with-rotted-food/l-intro-1752262017.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 16:12:54.934053

When Texas-based Operation Airdrop put out a call for volunteers to help those impacted by the catastrophic flooding in Texas, Colton Miller was one of those who answered the call.

Miller, a Texas-based pilot with a large fractional charter company, said he was aware of Operation Airdrop for a while, but this is the first mission he’d been able to take part in, piloting a King Air owned by his friend Andy Smith, and based at McKinney National Airport (TKI).

On Monday, July 7, Miller loaded up the King Air with supplies and flew to the Million Air FBO at Addison Airport (ADS) to add in more donated supplies. He then flew down to Operation Airdrop’s established base at the Commemorative Air Force Museum at Burnet Municipal Airport (BMQ) northeast of Kerrville, TX, where the supplies were loaded onto a truck and driven directly to those in need.

Miller called the operation a “well-oiled machine” as supplies were quickly loaded, unloaded and trucked to the impacted area. He thanked Million Air for donating fuel and personnel, and the CAF Highland Lakes Squadron for the help with packing and unpacking supplies. He also acknowledged his friend Smith for stepping up and offering the use of his plane for the mission.

While he couldn’t see the flood damage from the Kerrville airport, Miller said the devastation was visible when flying over Lake Travis, which was littered with foliage and debris from the floods.

Miller, who has been flying professionally since he was 19, said there were a good number of planes coming and going from Northern Texas to help flood victims.

“We’re a tight-knit community in the state. We’re all Texans. We’re all friends,” he said. “We’re willing to help anytime. It felt like helping family.”

Operation Airdrop has information on its Facebook page on needed supplies.

We're going to start with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, as everyone knows, was signed into law by the president on July 4.
I think, as we know, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act essentially stripped away several key provisions or titles of the traditional Farm Bill and put them into the act itself.
Liz, Isabel, I don't know what you've got to add to that.","Peter Tabor: Hello, and welcome to another session of ""The Eyes on Washington"" podcast from Holland & Knight. I'm Pete Tabor, a senior policy advisor with Holland & Knight and co-lead of our Agriculture & Food [Policy] Team here in the Public Policy & Regulation Group. And I'm joined by my colleagues, Liz Craddock and Isabel Lane. I'll let Liz and Isabel introduce themselves.

Liz Craddock: Hi everybody. Liz Craddock, partner at Holland & Knight and co-lead with Peter of our Agriculture & Food [Policy] practice in our Public Policy & Regulation Group.

Isabel Lane: Hi everyone. Isabel Lane, also with the Public Policy & Regulation Group, a senior public affairs advisor focusing on energy, climate, agriculture and the intersection of those things with tax and funding.

Peter Tabor: Great. So I'm really thrilled to be working with Liz and Isabel, but also to be giving you this really quick update on a couple of things. There's been a lot going on, we're going to cover in the next few minutes. We're going to start with the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which, as everyone knows, was signed into law by the president on July 4. There are a lot of implications outside of agriculture. We're going to focus on those that really do impact food and agriculture.

And so I think we'll start with Isabel on a couple of topics there. Just to familiarize everybody, this is a massive piece of legislation that folks weren't sure it would get across the finish line, but it's primarily focused on tax cuts and some spending on defense and immigration. But we'll kick it over to Isabel for an overview of the impact on ag with respect to biofuels and energy.

Isabel Lane: So with the One Big Beautiful Bill's passage, it includes a number of changes that are going to have significant impacts on the intersection between agriculture and energy, particularly on renewable energy and biofuels. One of the highest profile issues in the One Big Beautiful Bill was the rollback of a number of the IRA clean energy tax credits that were developed and created in the Inflation Reduction Act in order to advance the clean energy transition in the United States and to support biofuels producers as well. The bill does include rollbacks and significant changes to a number of those credits. In particular, wind, solar are hit hard. And both terminations to those credits and restrictions on foreign entities of concern or FEOCs and the incorporation of components and sub-components in renewable energy products from countries of concern will have significant impacts on the usability of a number of those credits. For the purposes of anyone that is doing solar on farmland or looking at renewable energy in conjunction with any of their agricultural products, there are a number of changes in this bill that are important to look at. And the Energy Tax Team here at Holland & Knight is doing a great job covering that. So I'll encourage you to go take a look at some of those.

I also do want to mention very quickly the changes to the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit, which is the technology-neutral biofuels credit, originally established in the IRA. It was only a two-year credit in the IRA, so it went through 2027. This bill actually extends it through 2029, but does make some changes in its implementation that will have significant impacts for biofuel producers and the feedstock growers here in the United States. The proposal will ban foreign feedstocks under the tax credit grown outside of the U.S., Mexico and Canada. It also changes some of the emissions calculations and changes the value given to gallons of sustainable aviation fuel, or SAF, under the credit. So the impacts there will hit biofuel producers and American agricultural producers different. There was a lot of lobbying on this. Ultimately, I think between the House and the Senate, they ended up in a compromised position. But again, this is an area where H&K is going to be covering both implementation at Treasury and also the changes that are going to be happening in the biofuels market because of this credit and the One Big Beautiful Bill's extension and revision of it. So with that, I'll turn it to Liz to cover some of the other pieces impacting ag in the bill.

Liz Craddock: Thanks, Isabel. Yeah, there's a lot of changes, I think, on the tax side that will relate to energy and how that will impact farmers and the agriculture industry that has been partaking and utilizing some of those technologies to provide energy and create fuel, you know, produce fuel for the country. So a lot of exciting and potential changes there.

Another big change that occurred during this reconciliation package is on SNAP, or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. This is the program that provides what most people call ""food stamps"" to our economically distressed families and individuals across the country. There are several changes that are mainly on the administrative side, but there's one major one also on the participant side that I want to just quickly review. On the administrative side, while SNAP is a federal program, this bill is going to shift additional administrative costs to individual states in 2027. So the impacts here are delayed a few years, but it's going to increase the state's burden [by] 25 percent of the administrative costs. Currently, it's at 50 percent, so this will be an additional burden for states in implementing and doling out SNAP benefits to residents of those states. In addition, states with high error rates, and error rates can result from a whole host of reasons — the two main ones are either from overpayment or from an underpayment to the beneficiaries — but if states have a high error rate, then they will have to begin actually paying for their SNAP benefits to the beneficiaries on top of the extra administrative costs that I had mentioned earlier going to 75 percent. So this is going to be a big additional cost to states in the years to come. States mainly have balanced budgets. That's how a lot of states operate, unlike the federal government. And shifting these priorities, they'll have to shift a lot of their priorities around in the individual states to absorb these additional costs and administrating the SNAP program.

On the participant side, there are about 43 million people in the country, including 16 million children, who are on SNAP benefits. It's approximately 13 percent of the U.S. population. And just to give a little bit more of a fulsome picture, states with the highest participation include New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Oregon, Oklahoma. So we're talking about blue states, red states, from coast to coast. While the legislation doesn't touch the amount of a benefit a SNAP participant will receive, which is roughly around $200 a month in fiscal year (FY) 2024, it does change the work requirements for participants, raising the age of those required to work from 49 to 65 and having to work for at least 20 hours a week. So you heard a lot if you're paying attention to the passage of this bill in Congress about the decrease in SNAP benefits to participants. That's mainly twofold. One from the extra costs that states will have to endure in administrating the program, but also on the work requirement side. There's about 3 million Americans, they believe, who will lose their existing benefits under this new requirement. So, that's a significant change for that program.

Also on the SNAP front, while we didn't see any changes to items that are eligible for SNAP purchase under this legislation, that has been a hot topic here in D.C., especially under the new Make America Healthy Again mantra. And so while SNAP does a great benefit to economically distressed in the U.S., it's also a giant economic engine for grocery stores and American farm products, including food and beverage here in the U.S. So Pete, perhaps this is a great time to segue over to you on what you're hearing in regards to MAHA and developments there that will impact the U.S. food and agriculture sector.

Peter Tabor: Thanks, Liz. Yeah, while it's not involved directly in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, you rightly pointed out that the changes to SNAP really do, they're perhaps an outgrowth of the MAHA movement under the Trump Administration. And one thing I'll note as well is that Secretary Rollins, when she came into office, made it a point that she was going to be very willing to approve SNAP waivers submitted by states. And I believe some states, several states have already made those requests and those SNAP wavers might involve, you know, the eligibility of certain products for SNAP programming in certain states.

With respect to MAHA overall, just to kind of give folks a quick overview, the MAHA Commission Report was issued in May, and it focuses on childhood chronic disease. And four specific factors it identifies include poor diet, environmental chemical exposure, lack of exercise or more screen time, that kind of thing, and chronic stress. Again, all related to childhood chronic disease. And then it comes up with some recommendations, I think, that have folks in the food and ag sector in certain sense, very interested.

Eating more whole foods. The specialty crop industry is perhaps encouraged by the MAHA Commission Report emphasis on eating whole foods and fruits and vegetables. Everybody is still trying to better understand in terms of the environmental stressors that there's two factors, I think, that really come up for food and ag stakeholders. That's the use of pesticides and herbicides. The MAHA Commission Report really stresses that there needs to be more scrutiny paid to the use of pesticides and herbicides. As folks know, RFK Jr. has spoken and even litigated issues related to the use of certain pesticides and herbicides.

The other area is ultra-processed foods, which is a term that doesn't quite have a definition. It's not an agreed definition. And so that's an area that has many food producers in the United States concerned in terms of the implications for SNAP and eligibility of certain products, including soft drinks, etc. We've already seen, I think, some voluntary moves by the food industry to remove certain additives and chemicals. And that kind of bleeds over into this other issue that's addressed a little bit in the MAHA Commission Report. But it's another issue that the Department of Health and Human Services has emphasized, and that is the generally recognized safe standard that is used by many in the food industry to essentially self-approve food additives without FDA formal review. And the MAHA Commission Report and RFK Jr. have indicated they want to revisit that, get independent studies to review the process and some of the additives. So I think those are things that we need to be watching out for and clients need to view and those in the food sector need to watching very closely.

In a very short segment, I want to also touch on an event that Secretary Rollins hosted on the steps of the Whitten Building. And this relates to, I'm switching gears a little bit here, the issues of immigrant labor and foreign ag land ownership in the United States. Secretary Rollins was joined by several administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and several governors. And they really focused on, I think, from an ag labor standpoint, the fact that we should not expect relief in the food and ag sector in terms of immigration enforcement. And so that is an issue that I think stakeholders will need to be paying very close attention to. And then on the issue of foreign ag land ownership, I think there's a lot of attention paid to this, but it looks like it's going to be an issue of putting in place measures that have already been discussed and agreed, adding the Secretary of Agriculture to CFIUS and updating the AFIDA provisions to ensure a closer oversight of acquisitions of U.S. agricultural land by foreign entities. I think, a lot of factors related to SNAP that Liz covered and related to this MAHA Commission Report, really looking at what we produce and how it goes into programs that many Americans rely on.

Now, I think we'll shift gears really quickly to the Farm Bill and the implications of all of this for the Farm Bill. And I'll start us off and then ask my colleagues to chime in. I think, as we know, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act essentially stripped away several key provisions or titles of the traditional Farm Bill and put them into the act itself. Those relate to reference prices for crops, crop insurance, as Liz mentioned, the SNAP provisions that were updated, and that leaves us with the big question mark as to whether we will see a ""skinny"" Farm Bill excluding those provisions that were addressed in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act — and if so, what the timing might be. And I think we're hearing that the House is eager to begin work on a ""skinny"" Farm Bill. Agriculture Committee Chair GT Thompson has indicated that he'd like to get the ball rolling on this. And he even threw out a number or something in the neighborhood of $8 billion for the Farm Bill in the late summer, early fall. And then I think we're hearing on the Senate side that there is an appetite to address this and move some of these other issues forward that weren't addressed in the recent legislation, but that their timeline is maybe more looking at early 2026. Liz, Isabel, I don't know what you've got to add to that. I'm sure you've been hearing and talking with other folks as well.

Liz Craddock: Yeah, thanks Pete. You know, as you mentioned, a ton of priorities were already carried in the One Big Beautiful Bill, whether it was, you know, disaster assistance or crop insurance or commodities, etc. So I think the state of play now is to see what wasn't taken care of. I think there are some priorities that still remain. I know that both chairmen of the Senate and the House committees are very eager to get a Farm Bill done. So their focus will still remain on trying to move forward on it. But I think the pressure is off a little bit on timing, given that some of the more critical needs in the agriculture sector were taken care of, but it's a great time to sort of dust off what wasn't taken care of, maybe some long-standing priorities for the ag sector that still remain that maybe haven't received a lot of attention in past Farm Bills because, you know, the commodity title sort of reigns or the nutrition title reigns. So it's a great, I think, time to sort of see how we can advance forward, maybe on ag tech and some other issues that are out there that people have as priorities that they'd like to move forward on. Isabel, you have any additional things to add?

Isabel Lane: Just from the energy perspective, echoing a lot of what you just covered, Liz. There are a lot of pain points after some of the changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill for some biofuels producers and for renewable energy interests in the United States. And looking for opportunities to use the Farm Bill to sort of tackle and address and create more opportunities where those changes were made could be something that the energy industry is trying to focus in on and carry into the next year and into the next Congress. So some appetite there from those interests for sure.

Peter Tabor: Well, thanks to you both. The Farm Bill discussion we'll be very closely monitoring and engaged on that. And so for clients or potential clients with interest, please contact us. We're very much involved in that process to see whether a Farm Bill moves forward.

Shifting gears to trade, I just wanted to spend a minute or two looking at the trade landscape because it does affect U.S. food and agriculture production, U.S. food and ag exports. There has been so much going on that we probably need to devote a separate podcast to that, but suffice to say that Holland & Knight has a Tariff Task Force comprised of many attorneys and professionals who are covering this topic, addressing these issues. And I'm going to cover them very briefly here. With respect to reciprocal tariffs, they were supposed to have taken effect [July 9]. President Trump issued letters. This week he's issued, I think, a total of 21 letters to countries — and they've been made public — advising them of the tariff they will pay effective August 1. I guess serving as an incentive to those countries to come to the negotiating table. Again, the Commerce Secretary, the Treasury Secretary and the USTR are heavily engaged and involved in their teams, the administration, heavily engaged involved in negotiations with multiple countries. And so we've got a handle on that. I think the implications for U.S. agriculture involve possible retaliation if we don't see resolution that results in some sort of agreement. I'll add too that we're probably looking at 10 percent baseline tariffs as the cost of entry into the U.S. market for many products from our trading partners. And so that's something to keep in mind. The negotiations to date have pretty much factored that in. And I think it's becoming more and more accepted in many of the discussions that are happening, including with the European Union, with Japan, Korea, etc. There are also 232 investigations going. These are handled by the Department of Commerce. You're well aware that we've got steel and aluminum tariffs at 50 percent right now. We've got auto tariffs and parts tariffs at 25 percent. There is a raft of investigations. This week, the president announced that there would be tariffs increased on imports of copper into the United States, and we're expecting tariff investigations to conclude on timber, lumber and derivatives, and pharmaceuticals. So there's a lot happening there and other investigations as well underway.

And finally, in the trade space, not specific to tariffs, is USMCA review. We've been following this very closely. We understand that USTR is poised to issue the notice requesting input from stakeholders that will allow it to complete its work and deliver a report to Congress by January 1 on recommendations for updates to USMCA. Canada and Mexico are currently operating in a slightly different tariff environment, but this USMCA review piece, looking at how the Trump Administration has worked on some of these issues, I think this is going to be an opportunity for many food and ag stakeholders to really weigh in with the administration, ensure that their voice is heard and that their concerns are addressed in the USMCA review process. So that's a very quick overview.

And now I think we're going to shift gears again to look at what's coming, especially with respect to the FY of 2026, which starts October 1. The process is already well underway in both the House and the Senate for appropriations. And Liz, what are you seeing, hearing? What should we be focusing on in the coming weeks and months?

Liz Craddock: Thanks, Pete. Yeah, as you said, we've already seen the House move forward with their Agriculture Appropriations Bill. They were able to vote it out of committee in late June. So that process has already occurred. One of the first ones out of the gate. It is a decrease. The House bill is a decrease over FY25 funding by about $1.1 billion dollars or 4.2 percent. So the overall bill [that] is going to be on the House side is $25 billion. So we are continuing to see other Republicans on the House side want to decrease discretionary spending out of the federal government. Some of the key things I just want to highlight. While the overall bill includes USDA, it also includes FDA. So there are a few other agencies included in it. For the Department of Agriculture or USDA, the bill would provide $21.9 billion, which is about $800 million below FY25-enacted level. So again, we're seeing a decrease in the amount of discretionary spending for the agency. Some of the key priorities I just wanted to highlight is there was an increase for the Agriculture Research Service of about $2.5 million above FY25-enacted levels. This includes high-priority initiatives for emerging pests and diseases. So we continue to see, I think, a big focus from USDA on pests and disease and focusing on those over at the agency. Unfortunately, for a lot of our research institutions, is a decrease. In the National Institute for Food and Agriculture, or NIFA, it's about $25 million below the enacted FY25 level. Again, this is competitive research and capacity programs that support our nation's land grant universities. So I know a lot of those universities will be disappointed to see that number coming out of the House. It does maintain the amount of funding for APHIS, or the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, at $1.1 billion dollars. So again, that sort of pairs with the money that was focused on emerging pests and diseases. So that kind of, at the moment, seems to be a big priority for the House Ag Appropriations Committee, I think in pairing and keeping close on USDA and what their priorities are. We're taping this literally the day before the Senate full committee will be marking up their Ag Appropriations Bill. So we don't have the Senate framework yet, but they will eventually work their bill through the process. And by the end of it, hopefully by the end of September, we'll have a final Ag Appropriation Bill for FY26 and funding all of the USDA programs. So that's what's next for funding for USDA. I don't know if Isabel or Peter, you all have any other additional what's next on the agenda?

Isabel Lane: Sure, I do want to jump in and just mention a few items on the regulatory front. Now that the One Big Beautiful Bill is law, Treasury is going to need to implement many of the changes to the tax credits that I had previously mentioned. So there's going to be a good amount of attention paid to the Treasury and IRS rulemakings and notices coming out on some of those new provisions. The Holland & Knight Energy Tax Team is doing a lot of coverage of that, so I encourage you to keep eyes on that insofar as energy impacts your agricultural footprint. Also on the biofuels front, the renewable fuel standard is, of course, the most important policy driver for the biofuel industry in the United States. The EPA has issued a proposed rule to set volumes under that program for 2026 and 2027 and is aiming to finalize that rule by October 31 this year. So there's going to be an open comment period and a flurry of activity to try and shape the rule of that. That also has a protectionist slant like we are seeing in some of the tax credits. There's a restriction on the participation of imported feedstocks under the program and imported fuels. So, you know, a lot of back and forth between American agricultural interests on that and fuel producers. So an area to keep eyes on as well, certainly going to be a contentious and hot button issue in the months to come as the agency tries to finalize that rulemaking.

Peter Tabor: Yeah, I think there's so much to review, to discuss, to analyze, for our own benefit, for our client's benefit. I think the best bet for many of you listening is to contact us if you've got questions. We serve as a resource for clients. We're always happy to share more information. We're constantly gathering intelligence on all these issues.

Virgin Atlantic will phase out in-flight bars. Here’s why

Amelia Neath

Friday 11 July 2025 18:38 BST

Virgin Atlantic is phasing out its iconic in-flight bars, a feature known for creating a social atmosphere on its premium flights.

The decision was made to replace the bars with more seating areas, specifically new ""Retreat Suites,"" as the current setup is considered an old-fashioned and inefficient use of space.

The removal of the bars will begin within the next three years, with the final ones expected to be gone by 2028.

This move marks a U-turn for the airline, as Richard Branson had previously pledged to reintroduce the bars after their initial removal was deemed a ""dreadful mistake.""

The introduction of the spacious ""Retreat Suites"" is part of a broader overhaul of Virgin Atlantic's flight experience, which also includes plans for free Wi-Fi and other cabin enhancements.

The aviation sector is undergoing a critical shift. As pressure mounts to meet net zero targets by 2050, the International Air Transport Association has introduced a transformative digital solution: the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker platform. This move represents more than just a technological upgrade—it signals a shift toward market maturity for sustainable aviation fuel.

For an industry that has long been grappling with fragmented procurement processes, scattered supply chains, and opaque pricing structures, this platform could serve as the silent engine behind a more fluid and connected SAF marketplace.

Unifying the SAF Ecosystem: Why This Matters

The current sustainable aviation fuel landscape is evolving—but still fragile. Demand exists, yet access to reliable, scalable supply remains a bottleneck. The Matchmaker platform is positioned to address three persistent challenges: efficiency, connectivity, and visibility.

Through a centralized digital interface, the platform enables airlines to find SAF suppliers quickly and seamlessly. Importantly, it allows SAF producers to post available or planned volumes with detailed metadata: type of feedstock, emissions reduction data, production location, and certification compliance with frameworks like ICAO’s CORSIA and the EU Renewable Energy Directive.

The quiet genius of the platform lies in its operational simplicity. It is not a trading exchange, nor does it impose fees. Instead, it acts as an intelligent matchmaker, connecting supply with demand and leaving negotiations offline. This preserves commercial confidentiality while facilitating trust-building—two crucial components for a nascent voluntary SAF market.

The Platform in Context: Why Timing Is Critical

This launch is not occurring in a vacuum. Airlines are under pressure from regulators, investors, and increasingly climate-conscious passengers to decarbonize. At the same time, many corporate players—especially those with science-based targets—are beginning to show interest in supporting SAF adoption, either directly or through partnerships.

While initially limited to airlines and SAF producers, the platform’s design indicates eventual inclusion of non-aviation buyers. This could unlock broader value-chain alignment, integrating logistics, corporate travel, and green finance into the procurement flow. In doing so, the platform is building not just access, but ecosystem readiness.

Aligning Digital Tools with Decarbonisation Strategy

Beyond matchmaking, the platform is embedded within the broader Aviation Energy Hub, a digital infrastructure envisioned to support long-term aviation energy management. This centralization of tools reflects a clear recognition: achieving net zero in aviation requires systems thinking—not just cleaner fuels, but smarter procurement, coordinated reporting, and better transparency.

By reducing the time and cost of SAF acquisition, the Matchmaker lowers the threshold for engagement. It empowers small and mid-sized carriers, not just industry giants, to begin decarbonizing without navigating convoluted bilateral arrangements. This inclusive design is essential for scaling climate action equitably across the sector.

The Untold Opportunity: Embedding Sustainability into Procurement Norms

What is particularly powerful—but not immediately obvious—about this development is its potential to make sustainability a normalised part of procurement culture. As more airlines engage with the Matchmaker, demand signals become stronger, more consistent, and more actionable. This can, in turn, incentivise SAF producers to invest with confidence in future capacity.

As visibility improves, new stakeholders—logistics firms, airport operators, and policy advisors—can begin aligning with verified SAF activity. The result is a shift from isolated green initiatives to an integrated climate economy for aviation.

Conclusion: From Connection to Acceleration

The Sustainable Aviation Fuel Matchmaker is not simply a convenience tool—it is a market signal. It says the SAF economy is no longer an aspirational frontier, but a tangible, evolving network. It replaces confusion with clarity, and latency with immediacy.

As the aviation sector races toward its climate goals, such platforms will be the bridges between intent and action. In this quietly powerful move, IATA is building not just functionality, but future confidence.

This is the kind of subtle acceleration that sustainability professionals must watch closely. The future of clean aviation might not roar in with headlines, but arrive steadily, platform by platform, connection by connection.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQFW-_VBkSu1Nw/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56Zf3xi1JHoAM-/0/1752208663627?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=Cs4A_qJ4v3n-Qur8ixqjQItGU0sEkNFZlxa1Q8sfLxY,N,,2025-07-11 18:10:57.815734

Imperative for Sustainable Aviation Fuel

Aviation has emerged as a critical sector as it is estimated to contribute nearly 2.5 percent of global annual carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, alongside almost 4 per cent of the total anthropogenic contribution to global warming.

This share is projected to increase as global air travel expands and other high-emission sectors transition to cleaner alternatives.

SAF, also known as aviation biofuel, is the most impactful solution for aviation decarbonisation, expected to achieve over 60 per cent of the required reductions.

About Sustainable Aviation Fuel

SAF is a type of biofuel – meaning it is made from plant or animal materials rather than fossil fuels – and it has the potential to cut aviation’s greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% compared with traditional jet fuels.

It possesses similar characteristics to Aviation Turbine Fuel (ATF) but boasts a significantly smaller carbon footprint.

SAF is a ‘drop-in’ fuel, meaning it blends seamlessly with ATF without requiring any modifications to existing aircraft, engines, or refuelling infrastructure.

Advantages of SAF

Emission Reduction: SAF can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in air travel by up to 80 per cent compared to traditional jet fuel.

Its combustion also produces fewer harmful gases and particulate matter, leading to cleaner skies.

Compatibility: It is fully compatible with the current global aircraft fleet, ensuring immediate usability.

Economic Opportunities: SAF adoption stimulates new demand for feedstock, creating revenue streams in agriculture and waste management sectors.

It also generates employment opportunities within the sustainability sector.

Energy Security: Diversifying fuel sources through SAF production reduces India’s dependence on imported oil, shielding the aviation sector from global oil price volatility and potentially making air travel more accessible.

There are other innovations like Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origins (RFNBOs).

It is produced using renewable electricity through Power to Liquid (PtL) technology that combines Green Hydrogen with Carbon captured from atmospheric CO₂.

It offers the potential for even net negative emissions.

SAF combustion produces far less harmful gases and particulate matter, contributing to cleaner skies.

Challenges in the widespread adoption of SAF

High Production Cost: SAF production is currently more than double the cost of conventional fuels, making large-scale adoption challenging without passing the burden to consumers.

Infrastructure Development: The production, storage, blending, and transportation of SAF require the development of new infrastructure, which would add significantly to the initial cost of adoption.

Feedstock Supply: Another key issue is the availability and sustainability of feedstock required for SAF production.

The characteristics and variety of necessary feedstock mean that there is no guarantee of year-round supply.

Environmental Impact Management: For SAF to be considered truly sustainable and to ensure a significant reduction in GHG emissions, it is crucial to ensure that its production does not have negative social or environmental impacts.

SAF reshapes global and Indian aviation

ICAO’s CORSIA: The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) – the UN’s specialised agency for the development of air transport – has established the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

It mandates that international airlines must offset their emissions growth post-2020, and the use of SAF is incentivised as a compliance mechanism.

European Union’s ReFuelEU Aviation: Legally binding SAF blending targets:

2% by 2025

6% by 2030

70% by 2050

with sub-mandates for synthetic fuels

World Economic Forum’s Clean Skies for Tomorrow Initiative: Aims for 10% SAF blending by 2030.

It also seeks to address the high cost of SAF through innovative financing and supportive policy frameworks.

India’s Robust Biofuel Potential

India’s potential in SAF manufacturing is immense, with a projected capacity of 40 million tonnes by 2050.

This capacity is underpinned by a diverse range of sustainable feedstock materials available within the country:

Oils and Fats: This includes Used Cooking Oil (UCO), oil-rich seeds from plants, algae oils, and animal fats.

Waste Streams: Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) serves as a viable raw material.

Agricultural and Forestry Residues: Abundant resources like wood waste, sugarcane bagasse, corn stover, husks, straw, sugars, and starches are critical inputs.

India’s abundant agricultural residues specifically bolster its ambition to become an SAF exporter.

For SAF to be truly sustainable, it is imperative that its production does not compete with food production, cause deforestation, or harm biodiversity.

India’s Leadership in the Global SAF Landscape

India has adopted a pragmatic and nuanced approach to SAF, prioritising energy security and food security while balancing sustainability goals with passenger demand.

Despite advocating for nationally determined targets over binding international mandates, India is a party to the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).

Key initiatives demonstrating India’s leadership

Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA): Launched by India during the 2023 G20 Summit in New Delhi, the GBA aims to expedite the worldwide adoption of biofuels, including SAF.

Domestic Blending Targets: India has established clear SAF blending targets:

1 percent for domestic airlines by 2025.

1-2 per cent for international flights by 2027-2028.

5 percent by 2030, with the potential to scale up to 15 per cent by 2040.

This assertive stance positions India as a key player in shaping the future of global aviation decarbonisation.

Way Forward

To address such issues, policies like tax incentives and public-private partnerships have been proposed. SAF presents a near-term, drop-in solution to reduce emissions from the aviation sector while longer term decarbonisation technologies continue to evolve.

Conclusion

India’s robust biofuel potential, particularly its abundant agricultural residues, directly complements its ambition to be a market leader and exporter in the SAF sector.

By leveraging its domestic resources and strategic global initiatives, India is poised to make substantial contributions to global decarbonisation while simultaneously achieving its national energy security and economic growth objectives",https://pwonlyias.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Daily-Editorial-Analysis-PWOnlyias-1.webp,N,,2025-07-12 01:02:11.171956

The shift marks a stark departure from Ghasemi’s high-capex, first-mover strategy, which activist investor Mantle Ridge had accused of “dramatically underperforming.”

At the heart of its concerns were the company’s large-scale clean hydrogen projects.

Ghasemi had positioned the high-capex drive as a way to capture “first mover advantages.” However, the strategy showed clear divergence from the company’s peers, typically known for delivering stable, long-term returns through take-or-pay contracts.

As more projects came onto the books, cash reserves fell significantly, while debt steadily increased.

Once in post, Menezes announced a $3.1bn write-down as it exited three US projects, including a green hydrogen plant and a hydrogen-based sustainable aviation fuel project.

The company also announced changes to the 2.2GW Neom green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia – for which it is the owner, operator, and sole offtaker. Instead of selling green hydrogen from start-up in 2027, the company will supply ammonia free-on-board until 2030, when the first offtaker is expected to begin deliveries.

Major’s exit could be the first a several boardroom departures, it has been speculated, as Menezes steers Air Products away from Ghasemi’s high-capex hydrogen strategy and toward a more disciplined, returns-focused model.","https://www.gasworld.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1200,height=900,fit=contain,quality=75,metadata=none,format=auto,gravity=auto/https://www.gasworld.com/wp-content/files/2025/05/AP012955-scaled-e1746103589937.webp",N,,2025-07-11 14:11:35.180939

On July 4, 2025, President Trump signed H.R. 1—dubbed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)—enacting significant modifications to clean‑energy credits previously enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

OBBBA scales back clean‑energy tax incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) including speeding up phase‑outs for certain energy credits, tightening domestic content rules and foreign‑entity restrictions, and imposing new deadlines for projects to qualify. Below is a summary of these changes along with our insights. Frost Brown Todd will continue to monitor any regulatory guidance or executive orders as they are published.

Foreign Entity Definitions

At the outset, OBBBA restricts access to certain credits[1] from certain Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) and those who receive material assistance from such entities. A Prohibited Foreign Entity (PFE) includes Specified Foreign Entities (SFE) and Foreign Influenced Entities (FIE), each of which are defined below:

An SFE includes the following:

An entity designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the Secretary of State under Section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189);[2]

An entity included on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC);[3]

An entity alleged by the Attorney General to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained under certain national security laws;[4]

An entity identified as a Chinese military company operating in the United States[5] pursuant to 1260H of the 2021 NDAA;

An entity included on the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act list;[6]

Certain Chinese battery manufacturers;[7]

A foreign controlled entity (FCE).[8]

A FIE is an entity, excluding certain public corporations, in which:

A SFE has direct or indirect authority to appoint a covered officer (such as a member of the board or an executive officer) of such entity;

A single SFE owns at least 25% of such entity;

Multiple SFEs combined own at least 40% of such entity;

At least 15% or more of the entity’s debt is held in aggregate by one or more SFEs; or

An “applicable payment” to an SFE is made pursuant to a contract, agreement, or other arrangement granting the SFE effective control over qualified facility or energy storage technology or production of eligible components.

Material Assistance from a Prohibited Foreign Entity: Under OBBBA, a project’s eligibility for key energy credits turns on whether it receives “material assistance” of goods or service used within a facility. To measure this, the statute uses the Material Assistance Cost Ratio (MACR), which is calculated by subtracting the cost of PFE‑sourced goods from the total cost of goods, and then dividing that result by the total. A project must meet or exceed certain MACR thresholds, which vary by technology and construction year, to remain eligible for the credits.[9]

The MACR calculation differs by credit type. For the Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y) and the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E), the ratio includes all manufactured products (and their subcomponents) incorporated into a facility. For the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§ 45X), only direct materials used to produce the eligible component are counted. In either case, if any portion of the product or its inputs originates from a PFE, that portion must be removed from the numerator.

To help taxpayers navigate this test, the Treasury Department is required to release safe harbor cost tables no later than December 31, 2026.[10] Until then, and for a brief period after the tables are released, taxpayers can rely on existing guidance under IRS Notice 2025-08 to estimate the total cost of eligible components and manufactured products. Taxpayers may also rely on certifications from suppliers confirming that the product or any of its components were not sourced from a PFE.[11] These certifications must include the supplier’s EIN, be signed under penalty of perjury, retained for at least six years, and either attest that the property was not manufactured by a PFE (and that the supplier has no reason to believe otherwise), or specify the portion of costs not attributable to PFEs.[12]

A separate grandfathering rule, the binding contract exception, applies to any facility using products or components acquired under a written agreement executed before June 16, 2025, provided that the facility begins construction before August 1, 2025, and is placed in service by January 1, 2030 (or, for some solar and wind facilities, January 1, 2028). In those cases, the costs covered by the contract are excluded from the MACR entirely.

To enforce these requirements, the statute allows the IRS to assess any deficiency tied to an incorrect MACR calculation for up to six years after a return is filed. If a taxpayer overstates the MACR and receives a disallowed credit, a 20% accuracy-related penalty may apply. In the case of direct pay for applicable entities under § 6417, the disallowed credit triggers an excessive payment penalty of 20%. Suppliers that submit false certifications may also face penalties if the error results in a disallowed credit and the tax understatement exceeds certain thresholds.

Accelerated/Bonus Depreciation

Property that qualifies for the Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y) and the Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E) will continue to be treated as five‑year MACRS property under § 168(a). By contrast, any “energy property” as defined in § 48(a)(3)(A)—including wind, solar, and standalone storage—with construction beginning after December 31, 2024, is removed from the five‑year class designation. These assets may nonetheless qualify for 100 percent bonus depreciation (restored under OBBBA) if acquired and placed in service after January 19, 2025 (subject to the utility‑owned property exclusion). In the absence of explicit guidance, taxpayers can rely on Rev. Proc. 87‑56 and the general MACRS‑classification rules to establish an appropriate recovery period, or they may elect the Alternative Depreciation System under § 168(g) for a 12‑year straight‑line schedule.

Investment Tax Credits (ITC)

Clean Electricity Investment Credit (§ 48E)

Overview: Under current law, § 48E provides a base investment tax credit of 6% for expenditures on zero‑emission electricity or standalone energy‑storage facilities. If prevailing‑wage and apprenticeship requirements (or applicable exceptions) are satisfied, the credit rises to 30%.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA terminates the eligibility of wind and solar projects placed in service after December 31, 2027, for § 48E credits, with an exception for wind and solar projects that begin construction within twelve months of enactment of the legislation. By contrast, other qualifying facilities, such as nuclear, geothermal, and clean‑hydrogen projects, remain on the original statutory timeline, phasing down after 2032 at 100% in 2033, 75% in 2034, 50% in 2035, and 0% in 2036.

OBBBA also disallows the credit for residential solar‑water‑heating or small wind installations leased to third-party customers. Taxpayers who begin construction on qualified facilities after December 31, 2025, are not permitted to receive material assistance from a PFE (as defined above). Taxpayers that are considered a PFE are no longer eligible for § 48E for tax year beginning after enactment. Finally, OBBBA adjusts the domestic content percentages that qualified facilities and energy storage technology must satisfy to qualify for the domestic content bonus as follows:

40% (20% for an offshore wind facility) if construction began before June 16, 2025;

45% (27.5% for an offshore wind facility) if construction begins on or after June 16, 2025, and before January 1, 2026;

50% (35% for an offshore wind facility) if construction begins during the calendar year of 2026; and

55% if construction begins after December 31, 2026.

These percentages are consistent with the current domestic content requirements under current § 45Y.

Guidance: Wind and solar developments face a compressed window to secure § 48E credits where projects may want to target commencing construction within the next 12 months to satisfy the start of construction exception due to the general uncertainty of when a project may be placed in service to avoid the risk of becoming ineligible for the credits in their entirety. Developers should confirm prevailing‑wage compliance early to maximize the 30% rate and evaluate transferability as a tool to monetize credits if they lack sufficient tax liability. Those working on other advanced technologies can rely on the later 2032 timeline but must track domestic‑emissions metrics in case the alternative threshold date applies. Finally, all sponsors should undertake due‑diligence on their supply chains and ownership structures to screen for any prohibited‑foreign‑entity implicatures that would irrevocably disqualify § 48E benefits.

Qualifying Advanced Energy Project Credit (§ 48C)

Overview: Under § 48C as previously enacted, taxpayers may claim a 30% investment credit for certified “advanced energy” projects. Congress capped total allocations at $10 billion, including $4 billion reserved for projects in low‑income or disadvantaged areas, and required applicants to secure Treasury certification within two years and place their project in service within two years thereafter.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA stipulates that any § 48C allocation withdrawn for missing the two‑year in‑service deadline will be permanently retired from the $10 billion pool, rather than reissued to another project.

Guidance: Awardees of the credit should treat their in‑service deadlines as non‑negotiable since missing the window forfeits their credit and reduces the total program capacity. Sponsors should consider frontloading project planning by securing permits, equipment, and financing early to ensure timely completion.

Production Tax Credits

Clean Electricity Production Credit (§ 45Y)

Overview: 45Y provides a production tax credit of 0.3 ¢ per kWh for electricity generated by zero‑emitting facilities for ten years after they’re placed in service. Meeting prevailing‑wage and apprenticeship rules raises the rate to 1.5 ¢ per kWh.

Enacted Changes: Wind and solar projects that begin construction more than one year after enactment must be placed in service by December 31, 2027, to claim any § 45Y credit. Accordingly, those wind and solar facilities that start construction within the first post‑enactment year do not face a placed in-service deadline. Wind and solar projects starting on January 1, 2025, until July 4, 2025, (i.e., the date of enactment) will receive credits at the full rate. Non‑wind/solar facilities follow the existing post‑2033 phase‑out: 100% credit for 2033 starts, 75% for 2034, 50% for 2035, and zero thereafter. The credit no longer applies to residential solar‑water‑heating or small wind installations leased to third parties. Additionally, new measurement methods for capacity additions grant developers greater flexibility in calculating eligible output. Taxpayers who begin construction on qualified facilities after December 31, 2025, are not permitted to receive material assistance from a PFE (as defined above). Taxpayers that are considered a PFE are no longer eligible for 45Y for tax years beginning after enactment.

Guidance: Developers of wind and solar may want to consider prioritizing meeting the start of construction exception to the December 31, 2027, placed‑in‑service deadline given the general uncertainty of construction timelines, accelerating procurement and construction schedules to secure full benefits. Those working on geothermal, nuclear, hydrogen, or other zero‑emission projects can rely on the extended timeline through 2033 but should monitor Treasury’s forthcoming capacity‑addition guidance to optimize credit calculations. All sponsors must perform rigorous foreign‑entity due diligence, including supplier certifications and ownership reviews, to avoid inadvertent disqualification under the material‑assistance and prohibited‑entity rules.

Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit (§ 45X)

Overview: 45X offers a production tax credit for manufacturing certain eligible components and critical minerals within the United States. Credit amounts differ by component type. Under current law, component credits phase down after 2029 on a five‑year schedule (100% for sales before 2030; 75% in 2030; 50% in 2031; 25% in 2032; and 0% thereafter), while credits for critical mineral extraction remain available indefinitely.

Enacted Changes:

Critical Mineral Phase Out: The permanent credit for critical minerals (other than metallurgical coal) would instead taper off beginning in 2030 as follows:

Wind Component Sunset: All wind‑related component credits would be eliminated for items produced and sold in 2028 and beyond.

Metallurgical Coal: OBBBA treats metallurgical coal as an eligible component under §45X. However, metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029, would not be eligible for the credit.

Integration Rule Repeal: The option to claim a credit on components incorporated into a larger eligible product sold to an unrelated buyer would be removed.

Foreign‑Entity Exclusions: Any component made with material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity after December 31, 2025 is ineligible, and taxpayers classified as specified foreign entities or foreign‑influenced entities lose § 45X eligibility for tax years beginning after enactment.

Guidance: Manufacturers should accelerate production of wind components before the end of 2027 to capture remaining credits and reassess assembly strategies that rely on integration elections. Firms in the critical‑minerals sector must plan extraction or processing activities to occur before 2034 or qualify projects ahead of accelerated phase‑outs. Given the new foreign‑entity bar, clients need to strengthen supplier due‑diligence processes—tracking key inputs to ensure no impermissible material assistance—and maintain documentation proving domestic origin. Finally, companies should evaluate whether credit transfers remain the optimal monetization route or if reshaping operations to fully absorb credits in‑house yields better after‑tax returns.

Clean Hydrogen Production Credit (§ 45V)

Overview: Qualified clean hydrogen produced by the taxpayer is eligible for a per kilogram credit percentage of $0.60 that ranges from 20% to 100% depending on the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate that occurs in the process. The credit applies to the hydrogen produced during the ten-year period that the facility is placed in service.

Enacted Changes: Facilities that commence construction after December 31, 2027, would no longer be eligible for any § 45V credit. No new FEOC rules would apply to § 45V.

Guidance: Project developers should prioritize breaking ground on or before December 31, 2027, to preserve § 45V eligibility and avoid forfeiting the credit entirely. They must also optimize production processes and feedstock choices to qualify for the lowest‑emission tier and secure the maximum per‑kilogram rate. Early planning for credit transfers will help monetize benefits if on‑site tax capacity is insufficient. Because § 45V is not subject to foreign‑entity restrictions, sponsors can concentrate their due diligence on operational execution and offtake agreements rather than supply‑chain or ownership concerns.

Zero-Emission Nuclear Power Production Credit (§ 45U)

Overview: Electricity produced by existing nuclear power plants is eligible for a credit equal to 0.3¢ per kWh or, if prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions in constructing, repairing, or altering the facility are met, 1.5¢ per kWh with the credit being reduced as power prices rise above $25 per MWh.

Enacted Changes: Beginning in 2028, taxpayers must certify that any nuclear fuel they use was not sourced from “covered nations” or covered entities—unless acquired under a binding contract in force prior to January 1, 2023. In addition, OBBBA bars SFEs from claiming § 45U for tax years beginning after enactment and disqualifies FIEs from claiming § 45U for tax years beginning two years after enactment.

Client Guidance: Operators should inventory their fuel supply chains now and secure certifications to demonstrate compliance or rely on pre‑2023 contracts to grandfather existing arrangements. Nuclear plant owners must implement robust tracking and documentation systems for fuel procurement to satisfy new certification requirements. Foreign‑owned or -affiliated operators should evaluate their corporate structures immediately to determine whether they face outright ineligibility under the SFE/FIE bans and, if so, explore alternative credit monetization strategies before the two‑year FIE cutoff. Finally, continuing to meet wage and apprenticeship rules remains the fastest route to the enhanced 1.5 ¢ rate, so workforce compliance programs should be maintained without interruption.

Clean Production Fuel Credit (§ 45Z)

Overview: Certain transportation fuel is eligible for a credit equal to the applicable amount multiplied by an emissions factor. The applicable amount for transportation fuel is $0.20 per gallon, and the applicable amount for sustainable aviation fuel is $0.35 per gallon. If prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements or exceptions are met, the credit is increased by a factor of five ($1 per gallon for transportation fuel and $1.75 per gallon for sustainable aviation fuel). The credit applies to fuel sold before 2028.

Enacted Changes: The proposed legislation extends the availability of the § 45Z credit through the end of 2029 but introduces a suite of significant eligibility and calculation changes starting in 2026. Most notably, the credit would no longer be available for fuel derived from feedstocks sourced outside of the United States, Mexico, or Canada, narrowing the geographic scope of eligible inputs. Additionally, the credit value for fuels derived from foreign feedstocks would be reduced by 20% beginning in 2026. The enhanced rates for sustainable aviation fuel are eliminated for fuel sold after December 31, 2025. In a move to standardize emissions accounting, the proposal bars the use of negative lifecycle emissions rates for most fuels starting in 2026, except in the case of animal-manure-based fuels. For those fuels, the Treasury Department is directed to issue specific lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rates tailored to the type of manure feedstock (e.g., dairy, swine, or poultry). Further, lifecycle emissions calculations would be required to exclude emissions attributable to indirect land use changes, thereby aligning more closely with international sustainability standards. To prevent double-dipping, the credit is reduced by the amount of any excise tax credit under § 6426(k)(1) for fuel sold after 2024, and the § 6426(k)(1) credit itself would sunset on September 30, 2025. OBBBA also directs Treasury to issue guidance clarifying how related-party sales of qualifying fuel should be treated under § 45Z. Finally, the credit would no longer be available to SFEs for tax years beginning after the date of enactment. FIEs would lose eligibility for § 45Z in tax years beginning two years after enactment. These changes reinforce broader FEOC compliance themes present throughout the legislation and could significantly affect multinational producers and joint ventures operating in the biofuels space.

Guidance: Producers should ensure compliance with prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements in order to maximize the available credit rate. Given the restrictions on foreign entities, clients need to strengthen supplier due‑diligence processes, tracking key inputs to ensure feed stocks are of a domestic origin and maintaining documentation proving domestic origin. Clients that produce fuel made from foreign feedstocks should evaluate costs and look to potential domestic feedstocks as a cost-alternative option in production.

Carbon Oxide Sequestration Credit (§ 45Q)

Overview: 45Q provides a federal tax incentive for projects that capture carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide emissions and either permanently store them in secure geological formations or utilize them in specific commercial applications such as enhanced oil recovery or chemical production. The credit is designed to encourage decarbonization across heavy industry and power generation by reducing the effective cost of deploying carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology. Eligibility generally hinges on placing qualified capture equipment in service and beginning construction by a statutory deadline. Once in operation, eligible facilities can claim the credit for a 12-year period. The amount of the credit per metric ton varies depending on whether the carbon is permanently sequestered or utilized and can be significantly increased for projects that comply with prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards.

Enacted Changes: OBBBA simplifies the credit structure by equalizing the rates for sequestration and utilization for qualified facilities placed in service after a certain date, with the base and enhanced rates fixed across project types. The base rate is now $17 per metric ton of carbon and the rate for qualified facilities placed in service after 2022 is $36. Additionally, the legislation imposes foreign-entity restrictions to prevent credits from flowing to entities tied to certain adversarial governments. Specifically, SFEs become ineligible for the credit in tax years beginning after OBBBA’s enactment. Foreign-influenced entities FIEs, including those with material ownership or control links to SFEs, lose eligibility two years later. These restrictions apply regardless of whether the foreign involvement is direct or contractual and are aligned with similar limitations adopted for other clean energy incentives.

Guidance: Developers and investors should carefully evaluate their ownership structures and supply chains in light of the new foreign-entity prohibitions. Companies with any degree of foreign participation should review whether their arrangements could compromise eligibility. While transferability remains available under § 6418, taxpayers may not transfer § 45Q credits to SFEs, which could reduce the pool of eligible transferees and impact monetization strategies. As a result, sponsors should consider whether capturing the credit directly, or using partnerships or tax equity structures, better suits their project economics. Finally, sponsors pursuing carbon utilization strategies should review updated credit amounts and ensure that lifecycle emissions reporting, measurement, and verification procedures comply with evolving federal guidance. Robust documentation, early engagement with qualified independent engineers, and conservative tax position reviews will be critical to protecting the credit over the full claim period.

Clean Vehicle Credits

Overview: Taxpayers may claim a credit for previously owned clean vehicles (§25E), new clean vehicles (§30D), and qualified commercial clean vehicles (§45W).

Enacted Changes: OBBBA eliminates these clean-vehicle credits for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, and taxpayers may only claim them for purchases completed by that date.

Guidance: Businesses should expeditiously evaluate future vehicle needs to take advantage of the clean vehicle credits during the brief window they remain available.

Residential Energy Credits

Overview: Taxpayers may claim several credits or a deduction related to residential clean energy expenditures. The currently available tax incentives are the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (§25C), the Residential Clean Energy Credit (§25D), the Energy Efficient Commercial Buildings Deduction (§179D), and the New Energy Efficient Home Credit (§45L).

Enacted Changes: The §25C and §25D credits terminate for property placed in service or cost paid after December 31, 2025. The §179D deduction now terminates for property the construction of which begins after June 30, 2026. The §45L credit terminates for qualified property acquired after June 30, 2026.

Guidance: Homeowners planning efficiency upgrades or renewable installations should consider starting work well before late 2025. Contractors or builders of energy-efficient homes should time construction and sales to meet eligibility. With respect to the §45L credit, it may be difficult for contractors or builders (especially with respect to multifamily developments) to meet the June 30, 2026, requirement to sell or lease the qualified property. Taxpayers should maintain documentation and ensure equipment meets quality standards (Energy Star, etc.).

Transferability

Section 6418 preserves the ability to transfer credits, including those under §§ 45Q, 45U, 45X, 45Y, 45Z, and 48E, without imposing a new sunset on transfer elections, but it explicitly prohibits any transfer of these credits to an SPE. Under OBBBA, taxpayers would still be free to sell their credits broadly—subject only to the FEOC’s prohibitions on certain purchasers—without any added constraints. In addition, the measure introduces a twelfth sellable credit: the biodiesel incentive under section 40A for small agricultural producers, which had lapsed after 2024. OBBBA would resurrect that incentive through the end of 2026 and increase the subsidy from ten cents to twenty cents per gallon. While this maintains transferability in principle, clients should note that the overall value of these elections may be diminished by the accelerated phase‑outs and placed‑in‑service deadlines embedded elsewhere in OBBBA. Moreover, OBBBA additional foreign‑entity restrictions onto §§ 45Y, 48E, and 45X, rules that do not extend to credits under §§ 45U, 45Q, 45Z, or the broader § 48 investment credits, further complicating structuring for affected taxpayers.

Penalties

Taxpayers who choose to avail themselves of the energy tax credits must be diligent in ensuring compliance with the requirements and restrictions of the sought-after credits. Noncompliance may be accompanied by strict penalties. Taxpayers who understate income by 1% or more due to disallowed energy credits (§§45X, 45Y, or 48E) are hit with a penalty equal to 20% of the understatement under a change to § 6662. Credits disallowed due to FEOC or foreign-sourcing restrictions may contribute to a taxpayer’s understatement, so it is critical that clients are diligent in ensuring compliance through their supply chains. Misstatements on certifications made by suppliers regarding domestic content or foreign sourcing after 2025 will be subject to a penalty that is the greater of $5,000 or 10% of credit amount claimed by the taxpayer relying on the misstated certification.

[8] A foreign controlled entity includes the government of a covered nation (North Korea, China, Russia, and Iran), an agency or instrumentality of a covered nation, a person who is a citizen or national of a covered nation, an entity or business unit incorporated or organized or having its principal place of business in a covered nation, or any entity “controlled” by those described in this parenthetical) (where “control” = 50 percent vote or value of stock of corporation or 50 percent capital interest or beneficial interests). Publicly traded entities are excluded from this restriction except to the extent that (i) any exchange or market which is incorporated or organized under the laws of a covered nation or has its principal place of business in a covered nation, or (ii) 1 or more specified foreign entities or foreign-controlled entities controls more than 50%.

[9] The MACR thresholds vary by technology and start‐of‐construction date. For example, qualified facilities under §§ 45Y & 48E must meet 40 percent in 2026, rising to 60 percent for projects starting after 2029; energy storage thresholds begin at 55 percent in 2026 and climb to 75 percent post‑2029; solar‑component sales require 50 percent in 2026 up to 85 percent after 2029; and similar step‑ups apply to wind, inverters, batteries, and critical minerals.

[10] Until the tables are issued, taxpayers may use the domestic content cost tables in IRS Notice 2025-08 and rely on supplier certifications. Projects beginning within 60 days of the tables’ release may also use this transitional approach.

[11] Certifications must: (i) include the supplier’s EIN; (ii) be signed under penalty of perjury; (iii) be kept for at least six years; and (iv) state either that no PFEs were involved and that the supplier has no contrary knowledge, or disclose the cost share not linked to PFEs.

[12] However, if a taxpayer has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that a product or component was manufactured by a PFE, then the taxpayer must treat all associated costs as PFE-sourced and may not rely on the supplier’s certification. Treasury is also directed to issue regulations aimed at preventing abuse of these rules, such as through misleading licensing arrangements or attempts to stockpile materials under the binding contract exception.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16362_5006.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 13:18:54.887706

This major infrastructure programme marks Heathrow’s most significant transformation in over a decade.

London Heathrow Airport is currently Europe’s most punctual major airport and remains the world’s best-connected, continuing to deliver strong value for both the UK and its passengers. The five-year plan that the airport has announced today marks the next step in its strategy to reclaim its place among the world’s top airports – building an extraordinary, future-ready hub.

Shaped by what matters most to passengers, this plan is said to enhance the airport experience, strengthen operational resilience, and unlock growth opportunities for airlines and UK businesses alike – including a boost for the UK supply chain within this parliamentary term. Backed entirely by private investment, it positions Heathrow to become more sustainable and digitally advanced, all while keeping costs down. Thanks to ambitious efficiency savings of over £800 million, the airport charge will remain below its level from a decade ago in real terms.

Over the past 12 months, Heathrow says it has been working closely with airline partners – including hosting over 120 hours of joint planning – and heard from more than two million passengers to understand what matters most, resulting in a customer-led investment plan which will span from 2027 – 2031.

This major infrastructure programme marks Heathrow’s most significant transformation in over a decade – including creating new space within existing terminals equivalent in size to 10 football pitches. From smoother journeys to new lounges, shops and restaurants, the changes will make Heathrow a more enjoyable, resilient and efficient hub for millions of passengers each year.

The aim? A delightful journey from check-in to take-off:

99% of bags travelling with passengers

80% of flights departing on-time

95% of passengers waiting less than five minutes at security

A step-change in service with more choice for passengers requiring additional support

The result: a travel experience where 95% of passengers rate their journey as “good” or “excellent”.

How will the Heathrow private investment boost capacity, trade and Britain’s global reach?

The upgrade is designed to do more than improve the airport – it’s set to boost the country. Once complete, Heathrow will be able to serve 10 million more passengers a year, a 12% increase in capacity that supports our airlines’ growth plans. Cargo handling will also get a significant lift, with plans to increase freight capacity by 20%, giving UK businesses a more efficient gateway to international markets.

Behind the scenes, we are planning the redevelopment of the Central Terminal Area and will seek planning permission to demolish the old Terminal 1, extend Terminal 2 and build a new southern road tunnel to improve access.

Built in Britain, backed by Britain

The project will be delivered by a UK-based supply chain 60% of which is based outside London and the South East, supporting skilled jobs and local businesses around the country in this Parliament. Crucially, it is funded entirely through private investment, not taxpayer money, and is designed to be cost-effective. A £2bn equity contribution from Heathrow shareholders will mean that the investment plan can be delivered affordably. Heathrow’s airport charge has dropped 23% over the past decade and, even with this investment, the new £33.26 charge remains below 2014 levels in real terms.

The airport is also committed to driving efficiency:

Stretching operating cost efficiencies of 6%

£500 million efficiency savings on the capital spend

What are the sustainability plans?

The future of Heathrow must be sustainable. The investment includes steps toward reducing the airport’s environmental footprint:

Removing 3,000,000 tonnes of carbon – equivalent to 15% of 2024 footprint

Noise insulation for 6,500 homes and 15 schools

A sustainable and secure energy supply that maintains 100% renewable electricity

10% cut in waste and 20% rise in recycling

And Heathrow is keeping its promise to give back – aiming to reach 1 million people locally with programmes in skills, education and community support by 2030.

Commenting on the investment plan, Heathrow CEO Thomas Woldbye said:

“We’re making good progress on our strategy to become an extraordinary airport – having become Europe’s most punctual major airport so far this year. But our customers want us to improve our international rankings further, as do we. To compete with global hubs, we must invest. Our five-year plan boosts operational resilience, delivers the better service passengers expect and unlocks the growth capacity airlines want with stretching efficiency targets and a like-for-like lower airport charge than a decade ago. With Heathrow’s UK-based supply chain, this private investment will create jobs and drive national growth during this Parliament. We are ready to deliver the more efficient, sustainable Heathrow that will keep Britain connected to the world.”

Next steps

The Civil Aviation Authority will now review and evaluate the plan. The airport will support this process alongside our airline partners and look forward to getting started with delivering improvements to make Heathrow an extraordinary airport, fit for the future.",https://www.internationalairportreview.com/wp-content/uploads/shutterstock_2373868775-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 13:18:58.014234

This proposal reflects the Trump Administration’s efforts to protect and grow domestic renewable fuel production while disfavoring foreign feedstocks and fuel.

Changes to Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit The Act includes changes to the eligibility for and the calculation of the amount of the Section 45Z Tax Credit.
This change would limit the Section 45Z Tax Credit available with respect to SAF produced after December 31, 2025.","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has recently proposed a new rule and the U.S. Congress has recently enacted a new law affecting the global renewable fuel industry.

First, EPA announced its proposed changes to the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program through its “Set 2 Rule”.1 This proposed rule seeks to promote the growth of domestic feedstock and renewable fuel production by increasing volume obligations for 2026 and 2027 while curbing the use of foreign-made feedstocks and fuel. EPA is currently taking comments on the proposed Set 2 Rule through August 8, 2025.

Second, on July 4, 2025, the President of the United States signed into law the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (the “Act”). The Act made sweeping changes to the rules under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), relating to energy tax credits, including the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit (“Section 45Z Tax Credit”) under Section 45Z of the Code.

This Client Alert summarizes key proposed changes to the RFS program and to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

EPA’s Proposed Set 2 Rule Seeks to Expand Renewable Fuel Volumes While Disfavoring Foreign Feedstock and Fuel

On June 17, 2025, EPA proposed the Set 2 Rule. This proposal reflects the Trump Administration’s efforts to protect and grow domestic renewable fuel production while disfavoring foreign feedstocks and fuel.

First, EPA intends to continue expanding the renewable fuel volume requirements for 2026 and 2027 at a rate similar to the 2023–2025 rule—leading to the highest volume requirements in the history of the RFS program.2 As shown below, EPA has taken a particular interest in increasing biomass-based diesel production, which EPA states will provide support for domestic soybean farmers and feedstock producers.

More importantly, though, EPA proposes reducing the number of Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) generated for imported renewable fuel and domestic renewable fuel produced from foreign feedstocks by half. As such, domestic renewable feedstocks and fuels are intended to outpace foreign sources in RIN generation, incentivizing businesses to end their reliance on foreign feedstocks and production facilities. To support this change, EPA has asserted a need to decrease America’s reliance on imports, promote American production, support rural agricultural sectors, and increase American energy security.

To implement and enforce this change, EPA also proposes that domestic renewable fuel producers will be required to keep records of feedstock purchases and transfers (e.g., bills of sale or delivery receipts) and report each feedstock’s point of origin (i.e., foreign or domestic) as part of their renewable fuel batch reports. These requirements are added as EPA expresses concern that bad actors may try to claim foreign feedstock as domestic to gain a financial benefit. EPA states that these new recordkeeping and reporting requirements are “minimally onerous” given the RFS program’s current recordkeeping obligations. EPA is also adding requirements for attest engagement auditors and QAP providers to verify that feedstock point of origin was correctly reported.

Finally, EPA proposes to reduce the equivalence value for renewable diesel from 1.7 to 1.6 to account for the non-renewable portion of the fuel. Likewise, EPA proposes an equivalence value of 1.6 for jet fuel, which previously had been determined on a facility-by-facility basis.

Comments on the proposed Set 2 Rule are due by August 8, 2025.

Changes to Section 45Z Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit

The Act includes changes to the eligibility for and the calculation of the amount of the Section 45Z Tax Credit. The Act also includes new foreign entities of concern restrictions, which largely uphold the prior Senate version of the Act. Below is a summary of key changes in the Act as they relate to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

Section 45Z of the Code provides for a production tax credit for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) and non-SAF clean transportation fuels produced at a qualified facility and sold to an unrelated buyer. The producer must be registered as a clean fuel producer.

The credit amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable amount per gallon of qualifying fuel by the “emissions factor” for SAF or non-SAF transportation fuel. Prior to the Act and for fuel produced through December 31, 2025, the applicable amount was 35 cents per gallon for SAF and 20 cents per gallon for non-SAF clean transportation fuel. The applicable amount was increased to $1.00 per gallon and $1.75 per gallon, respectively, if certain “prevailing wage and apprenticeship” requirements are satisfied. In order to qualify for the Section 45Z Tax Credit, transportation fuel and SAF cannot have an emissions rate greater than 50 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. The statute authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to publish annual emissions rate requirements the fuel must meet to qualify for the credit and to issue guidance for implementation of Section 45Z.

The Act eliminates the “special rate” of the credit currently available for SAF (i.e., up to $1.75 per gallon) by capping the value of the credit at $1 per gallon for all eligible fuels, including SAF. This change would limit the Section 45Z Tax Credit available with respect to SAF produced after December 31, 2025.

The Section 45Z Tax Credit was scheduled to expire at the end of 2027 under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The Act extends the Section 45Z Credit through 2029. Although this extension is down from 2031 proposed in the earlier House and Senate versions of the Act, it still provides certainty for renewable fuel project developers and investors for the next four years.

The Act also changes how lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions are calculated for purposes of the Section 45Z Tax Credit. Specifically, the Act excludes any emissions associated with indirect land use change. Effective January 1, 2026, the proposal would increase the value of the credit for renewable fuels produced from crop-based feedstocks such as corn ethanol and canola biodiesel. Furthermore, under the Act, for transportation fuels derived from animal manure—such as dairy manure, swine manure, and poultry manure—a distinct emissions rate would be provided with respect to each of the specific feedstocks used to produce eligible fuel.

The Act imposes certain limits on the use of foreign feedstocks. The Act modifies Section 45Z to prevent the use of certain foreign feedstocks outside of North America (i.e., United States, Mexico, and Canada), such as used cooking oil from China. This is consistent with the prior House version of the Act. The prior Senate version would have allowed the use of feedstocks outside the United States but would reduce the credit amount by 20% effective January 1, 2026.

The Act includes new foreign entity of concern provisions applicable to many energy tax credits, including the Section 45Z Tax Credit. In general, these rules restrict various energy tax credits by prohibiting them from being claimed by taxpayers or projects that engage in certain activities with, or otherwise have, significant relationships to “prohibited foreign entities.” There are two sets of restrictions applicable to energy tax credits: Under the first set of restrictions, no Section 45Z Tax Credit would be allowed if a renewable fuel project is owned by a “specified foreign entity” or a “foreign-influenced entity” (as defined in proposed Section 7701(a)(51) of the Code). Under the second set of restrictions, no Section 45Z Tax Credit would be allowed if the project received “material assistance” from a prohibited foreign entity (i.e., a specified foreign entity or a foreign-influenced entity); however, restrictions based on “material assistance” are not applicable to the Section 45Z Tax Credit.

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 added Section 6418 to the Code, which allows eligible taxpayers to transfer all or portion of their eligible credits (including the Section 45Z Tax Credit) for cash to an unrelated taxpayer. The prior House version proposed repealing the tax credit transferability, including for the Section 45Z Tax Credit attributable to SAF or non-SAF clean transportation fuel produced after December 31, 2027. The Act retains the tax credit transferability provision under Section 6418 but prohibits transfers of any portion of eligible tax credits to specified foreign entities.

Outlook

With the U.S. Congress’s and the Trump Administration’s focus on domestic renewable fuel, companies should consider the financial impact of overseas operations. Fuel producers should also be prepared for new reporting requirements to ensure their RFS eligibility and to obtain the benefits of the Section 45Z Tax credit.

One example is Air New Zealand, which currently has 14 Trent 1000-powered 787s but no GEnx models, but has three GEnx 787s on order.
Rolls-Royce introduced the Trent 1000 TEN in 2016, which upgraded the engine's heat resistance, high-pressure turbine blade, and software.
These strengths have led some airlines that previously received Rolls-Royce-powered 787s to opt for purchasing new aircraft with General Electric engines.
However, this engine also has its drawbacks that may leave some airlines regretting their decision to shift towards the General Electric engine.","Issues with Trent 1000-powered aircraft have severely hampered many Boeing 787 operators. British Airways has blamed many of these issues on shortages caused by Rolls-Royce. This is the latest in a string of bad news for the Trent 1000 program, which has seen some airlines switching to General Electric's GEnx for their Boeing 787 Dreamliner orders.

This article explores the combination of GEnx strengths and Trent 1000 weaknesses that have led many airlines to opt for the GEnx, along with signs that General Electric will continue to hold dominance over the widebody aircraft market. It finishes with thoughts on whether some airlines may start to regret their commitment to GEnx-powered 787s over the coming years.

The Airlines Choosing GEnx-Powered 787s

Recent months have seen many airlines, some of whom operate Trent 1000-powered 787s, opting for the GEnx on their pending orders. One example is Air New Zealand, which currently has 14 Trent 1000-powered 787s but no GEnx models, but has three GEnx 787s on order. More significant is All Nippon Airways, which has 78 Rolls-Royce-powered 787s and just seven GEnx examples. Meanwhile, the carrier has 15 GEnx 787s on order.

Perhaps the most damning example for Rolls-Royce is British Airways, which currently operates 41 Trent 1000-powered 787s. However, the carrier has opted to order six GEnx-powered Dreamliners. This indicates a split between two iconic British companies that have previously shared exceptionally close relationships. For example, in 2007, British Airways opted for more Boeing 777s powered by Trent 800 engines. Mike Terrett, then-President of Civil Aerospace at Rolls-Royce, reflected on the two companies' closeness:

""The Trent’s selection reflects British Airways’ positive view of the engine’s in-service performance, while the extension of the TotalCare contract is an endorsement of the maintenance agreements which have been in place for the last seven years. Repeat business sends a strong signal, and I’m delighted that we are expanding our fleet presence with a world-class customer.”

Smaller 787 operators have also opted to move away from the Trent 1000. For example, Air Tanzania operates 2 Trent 1000 and 1 GEnx-powered Dreamliners. The African carrier has opted for GEnx engines on its single 787 on order.

Why Might Airlines Prefer The GEnx-1B?

The GEnx-1B is the ideal engine for the 787 Dreamliner's mission of achieving low operating costs and high efficiency in aviation for several reasons. It outperforms the Trent 1000 in operating expenses and carbon emissions. The GEnx is also a more reliable engine, with fewer unscheduled removals, which allows for fewer disrupted flights.

The table below compares the key statistics for the 787 engine operations. The selected GEnx variant (-1b74/75) is the engine used for the 787-9:

The GEnx is also attractive in the marketplace because it powers the 747-8, although only the -2B67B variant has this role. That makes General Electric's engine ideal for carriers that have a mixture of 787s and 747s, as this combination represents a reduction in maintenance challenges.

Reliability Concerns Continue To Hamper The Dreamliner

A key reason that many carriers have opted to move away from the Trent 1000 is its seemingly endless reliability issues. A significant problem is blade cracking, first experienced by All Nippon Airways, and later impacting Air New Zealand and Virgin Atlantic. These airlines had to ground some 787s in 2017. High-pressure turbine wear and compressor fatigue have also caused airlines problems. These issues necessitate financially crippling maintenance and repairs.

Rolls-Royce's 2017 annual report promised that these issues would be addressed. The company wrote:

""“We continue to make solid progress with longer-term solutions, largely through the re-design of affected parts, and we expect these to be fully embodied in the Trent 1000 fleet by 2022.”

However, given the unconvincing nature of Rolls-Royce's past efforts to improve the Trent 1000's reliability, this promise will not inspire confidence in its customers. Rolls-Royce introduced the Trent 1000 TEN in 2016, which upgraded the engine's heat resistance, high-pressure turbine blade, and software. The fact that the market is moving away from the Trent 1000 indicates such efforts have not managed to turn around negative perceptions of the engine.

The 777X And Another Case of General Electric's Widebody Dominance

Rolls-Royce was able to secure its position as one of the engine options for the Dreamliner, although its performance has underwhelmed some carriers. This was not achieved for the upcoming 777X, which will be powered exclusively by the General Electric GE-9X, demonstrating an impressive dominance for General Electric in the widebody industry.

The GE-9X is slated to be the largest and most powerful commercial jet engine ever built. Such power is necessary because just two of these engines will power an enormous aircraft. This engine has already undergone 27,000 cycles and 17,000 hours of testing, including 1,600 cycles of dust ingestion tests. This testing is more than any other GE Aerospace engine of previous years has undergone before entering into service. It has now started rolling off the production line, allowing 777X production to get back on track. Tyler-Blair Sheppard, head of marketing for the GE9X, said:

“We’ve run the heck out of the engine, and customers have been really impressed by the dust test data coming back, which is the equivalent of almost three years of normal use on the engine... It will all result in a more durable engine in harsh environments.”

However, the 777X has continued to be delayed, and deliveries are not expected until 2026. In this context, the GE-9X is yet to be tested under actual commercial operating conditions. No matter how many hours the engine puts in on the testbed, its actual capacity cannot be known until its trials in the real world begin.

Rolls-Royce Fights Back

Rolls-Royce isn't going down from the widebody aircraft market without a fight. It has been working on the UltraFan, the world's largest commercial aviation engine. This jet can produce 85,000 lbs of thrust, and Airbus wants to work with the manufacturer to produce the most efficient long-range engine yet.

This engine was first tested in 2023, powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Chief executive, Tufan Erginbilgic, described the importance of the engine for Rolls-Royce and aviation's future:

""The UltraFan demonstrator is a game changer - the technologies we are testing as part of this programme have the capability to improve the engines of today as well as the engines of tomorrow. That is why this announcement is so important - we are witnessing history in the making, a step-change in engine efficiency improvement.""

Not only will the UltraFan be highly efficient and powerful, but it is also set to be compatible with 100% sustainable aviation fuel. Such capabilities will allow Rolls-Royce to be at the forefront of achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the aviation sector.

Will The Shift Towards General Electric Have Drawbacks?

As has been seen, the GEnx-1B is a preferable choice for a huge number of 787 operators. This engine is more reliable and efficient, leading to more profitable services that depart on time. These strengths have led some airlines that previously received Rolls-Royce-powered 787s to opt for purchasing new aircraft with General Electric engines. This decision will come at a substantial cost for carriers as many will need to invest in new maintenance infrastructure to keep their General Electric-powered aircraft in the skies.

However, this engine also has its drawbacks that may leave some airlines regretting their decision to shift towards the General Electric engine. The primary concern is that some airlines have experienced performance drops when operating in high temperatures. Such issues can cause airlines to struggle when operating in particularly warm climates, such as the deserts of the Middle East. General Electric has been working to overcome the difficulties of operating in such environments by undertaking 400 hours of 'sandstorm' testing in 2020. Shawn Pearson, GEnx Engineering Leader, said:

“These tests are specifically conducted for operators and our direct customers who use their aircraft in areas of the world that we technically call ‘Severe Operating Environment’ or SOE—desert areas, such as Africa and the Middle East, or regions affected by certain environmental phenomena that spread sand or dust. Sand can degrade the cooling muscle in our hot section components—like combustors, but also turbines—and create distress in protective coatings, accelerating hardware damage and leading to early engine removals.",https://static1.simpleflyingimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/engines.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 11:19:26.223536

The move is part of ORLEN’s wider plan to support cleaner energy use and reduce pollution caused by air travel.

The new fuel, which is made using waste materials like used cooking oil and agricultural or industrial leftovers, can cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80% over its full production and use cycle, depending on the materials and process used. The SAF is blended with regular jet fuel, so it works in current aircraft without the need for any modifications.

“We’re introducing SAF to help lower emissions from aviation and offer airlines a practical way to fly cleaner,” said an ORLEN spokesperson. “This is a big step toward our long-term goal of offering more eco-friendly energy options.”

SAF is already being used in other countries, and now Poland is joining the push for cleaner skies. Airlines using Polish airports have welcomed the change, noting that it helps them meet growing environmental expectations.

The new offering also helps ORLEN meet upcoming European Union rules. Starting in 2025, the EU’s ReFuelEU Aviation Regulation will require that 2% of all jet fuel sold in the region comes from sustainable sources. That share is set to rise to 6% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. The rules apply to EU airports that served over 800,000 passengers or moved 100,000 tonnes of cargo the previous year.

To meet the growing need for SAF and reduce dependence on imported components, ORLEN is building a special facility at its Plock refinery. The plant will make aviation fuel from used cooking oil and is expected to be ready in 2025. Until then, the company will continue importing SAF materials from abroad.

“This is just the beginning,” said the spokesperson. “We’re working hard to build the supply here in Poland, so the aviation sector can make real progress in cutting emissions.”",https://bioenergytimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/saf-17.png,N,,2025-07-11 11:19:45.768066

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOCL) will temporarily shut its 3,00,000 barrels-per-day diesel desulphuriser at the Panipat refinery to upgrade it for producing sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) from used cooking oil (UCO).

SAF Production to Begin by 2026

The upgrade, scheduled for late 2025 or early 2026, is expected to yield 30,000 metric tons of SAF annually, according to Arvind Kumar, Head of Refineries at IOCL. Nevertheless, diesel production will remain unaffected during the shutdown, as backup hydrotreaters at the site will continue to ensure uninterrupted output.

Supporting India’s SAF Blending Targets

The strategic move is part of India’s broader effort to reduce carbon emissions in the aviation sector. The government has set a target to blend one percent SAF by 2027, with plans to increase this to two percent by 2028. IOCL’s Panipat upgrade aligns directly with these national goals.

More SAF Projects in the Pipeline

Beyond Panipat, IOCL is evaluating retrofit options for other kerosene-producing units across its network of refineries. These upgrades will further expand SAF production capacity and contribute to India’s decarbonisation agenda.

Green Hydrogen Bids to Open Soon

IOCL plans to invite bids shortly for a new 70,000 tonnes-per-year green hydrogen facility and an additional SAF project. This comes as part of IOCL’s commitment to scaling up clean energy initiatives.

Major carriers like United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL), Alaska Air Group (ALK), and Southwest Airlines (LUV) saw big gains. This happened after Delta shared its positive financial report and full-year guidance update.

But what about the airline’s environmental and sustainability impact? The company’s net-zero journey shows equally impressive progress.

Delta’s Q2 Performance Sparks Market Optimism

Delta’s stock alone jumped by about 12.5%, making it the top mover of the day. The company reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.10, beating analyst forecasts of $2.05–$2.08. Revenue climbed to $15.5 billion, exceeding the expected range of $15.42–$16.41 billion.

Delta also restored its full-year 2025 guidance, showing management’s confidence. This was important because most major airlines, like Delta, stopped giving forecasts earlier this year. They were worried about global economic instability, especially due to President Trump’s new tariff policies.

Now, Delta expects full-year earnings per share between $5.25 and $6.25, with free cash flow projected to range from $3 billion to $4 billion. These results gave investors a clear signal that the travel sector may be turning a corner.

Sympathy Rally Lifts the Entire Airline Sector

Delta’s upbeat results caused a “sympathy rally.” This is when good news from one company boosts others in the same industry. Here’s how key players performed:

United Airlines (UAL) surged between 9.4%and 14%, reaching over $89 per share.

American Airlines (AAL) rose by 7.8% to 13%, closing in on its 200-day moving average.

Alaska Airlines (ALK) gained nearly 10%, adding more than $5 per share.

Southwest Airlines (LUV) posted a more modest gain of 2.8% to 3.4%.

This rise shows that investors are more confident now. This comes after a tough start to 2025, which was marked by trade tensions and fluctuating fuel prices.

Analysts liked Delta’s earnings report. They expect United and American Airlines will also do well in their next earnings announcements. Deutsche Bank, among others, forecast continued strong results across the sector.

For investors, these trends suggest that the airline sector may be entering a more stable and profitable phase, following the turbulence of early 2025. But how about the sector’s environmental footprint? Let’s take a closer look at Delta’s sustainability and climate goals.

Delta Airlines: In Route Toward Net Zero

As climate concerns grow and investor pressure mounts, Delta Air Lines has taken firm steps toward its long-term sustainability goals. The company aims to become the first carbon-neutral airline globally and has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.

This goal covers three areas: Direct operations (Scope 1), indirect emissions from energy use (Scope 2), and some Scope 3 emissions like upstream fuel production and corporate travel.

Since nearly 90% of its greenhouse gas emissions come from jet fuel, reaching net-zero by 2050 requires Delta to effectively decarbonize its flight operations. The company’s sustainability strategy is designed to support this goal by focusing on:

What We Fly — transitioning its fleet to more fuel-efficient aircraft

How We Fly — adopting new technologies, procedures, and other strategies to improve fuel efficiency

The Fuel We Use — collaborating to scale supply and reduce the cost of SAF

Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF): A Key Ingredient

One of Delta’s biggest bets in reducing emissions is sustainable aviation fuel. SAF comes from renewable sources like used cooking oil or plant waste. It can cut lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% when compared to traditional jet fuel.

Delta has signed several major SAF purchase agreements, including:

A long-term agreement with Neste to purchase 10 million gallons of SAF per year.

A partnership with Gevo, with the potential for 75 million gallons annually starting in 2026.

The company’s goal is to replace at least 10% of its conventional jet fuel with SAF by 2030, a target aligned with broader aviation industry goals. Below is the company’s SAF purchases:

Cleaner Planes and Smarter Flying

Delta is also focused on fleet renewal—replacing older planes with newer, more efficient models. The latest Airbus A321neos and A220s offer 20–25% better fuel efficiency per seat, helping lower emissions on each flight.

In addition, Delta uses AI and data analytics to optimize flight routes and reduce fuel burn. The company added lighter seats and cabin materials to cut aircraft weight. It also improved aerodynamics to save energy while flying.

Ground Operations and Renewable Energy

Beyond the skies, Delta is greening its ground operations. So far, the airline has:

Converted over 25% of its ground service equipment to electric or hybrid.

Purchased renewable electricity for 100% of its operations at Atlanta’s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport—Delta’s largest hub.

Set a goal to electrify 50% of its ground operations by 2025.

Carbon Offsets: A Transitional Tool

While Delta previously announced carbon neutrality starting in 2020, it primarily relied on carbon offset credits to compensate for emissions. These carbon credits supported projects like forest protection and methane capture. In 2022, Delta shifted away from offsets. They decided to focus on reducing actual emissions instead of using compensatory measures.

This move reflects the industry-wide demand for real climate impact and transparency in offset claims. Delta now uses offsets sparingly and only in cases where decarbonization options are limited.

Tracking Progress

According to Delta’s latest difference report, the company has emitted over 60 million tonnes of CO2e. It has achieved the following progress in cutting its emissions:

The company cut its Scope 1 emissions intensity by 13% compared to 2019 levels.

Delta invested $1 billion over 10 years in a long-term climate strategy starting in 2020.

It avoided 1.7 million metric tons of CO₂ through efficiency improvements and SAF use between 2021 and 2023.

Public Accountability and Disclosure

Delta regularly publishes climate data through its annual ESG and TCFD reports. The company joined the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi). It shares risks about climate change, policies, and fuel prices. In 2023, Delta ranked among the top U.S. airlines for climate transparency.

Earnings Up, Green Goals Still in Sight

Delta’s net-zero plan is one of the most comprehensive in the airline industry. It combines technology, SAF, operational efficiency, and transparency to make measurable progress. The company faces challenges, like scaling SAF production and electrifying long trips. Still, its recent actions show a strong commitment to growth and environmental responsibility.

Delta’s strong Q2 2025 results have not only boosted its stock but also lifted the entire airline industry. Behind the numbers is a broader story of operational resilience, pricing discipline, and strategic planning during uncertain times.

At the same time, Delta is showing that profitability and sustainability can go hand in hand.

Background information

The Regulation that put the Flight Emissions Label (FEL) in place was adopted in December 2024 by the European Commission and aims to empower passengers with information on flight-related emissions, allowing them to make informed decisions when booking and comparing flights. The label will also increase accountability within the aviation sector by establishing a harmonised emissions calculation methodology, data reporting, and emissions display for all airlines in the European Union. Building on a fully digitalised process, FEL will also reduce the administrative burden for the sector.

The FEL provides a trustworthy framework for airlines to share flight emissions data with passengers. Airlines from both EU and non-EU countries, covered under the scope of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 “ReFuelEU Aviation”, can voluntarily join the FEL. Only those airlines that have joined are allowed to display emissions to their passengers in the European Union, in accordance with Article 6(5) of the Regulation. The European Commission and EASA encourage airlines to join the FEL if they want to display flight emissions and use these estimates when, for example, offering sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) or other emissions offsets to passengers.

The Memorandum of Cooperation (MoC) will support the internal decision-making process within the aircraft operators through a guided onboarding process performed by EASA experts. This will allow the group to have an initial pre-assessment of the label values generated, as well as an indication of the efforts involved. As part of this, Air France-KLM will test the digital channels as the EASA Flight Emission Portal, the data reporting process, and the administrative effort required.

For its part, Air France-KLM voluntarily agrees to provide emissions-related data under Article 3 FEL to support the assessment and indicative generation of flight emissions pursuant to Article 5 FEL. The data submitted will include, in accordance with Article 3 FEL, actual flight performance data, such as the aviation fuel consumption and time per flight, the average load factors and freight carried, as well as the amount and type of aviation fuels (fossil kerosene and SAF) consumed per airport. This will enable the prospective coverage of emissions labels for upcoming operations.

Note: Article 14(1) of Regulation (EU) 2023/2405 (ReFuelEU Aviation) establishes a voluntary environmental labelling scheme enabling the environmental performance of flights to be measured, open to all aircraft operators falling within the scope of that Regulation.

After four decades of partnership, China has become Airbus' largest single-country market for commercial aircraft, with Airbus planes now accounting for over 50 percent of the active fleet in the country's civil aviation sector.

Moreover, Airbus' collaboration with China has evolved beyond aircraft exports to encompass the entire product lifecycle, ranging from R&D to manufacturing, assembly, operational support and even end-of-life disassembly and recycling.

""The past 40 years of Airbus in China have represented an extraordinary success story achieved with our Chinese partners,"" said Erik Buschmann, chief operating officer of Airbus China, adding that not only has China's aviation industry flourished, but Airbus has also witnessed the rapid expansion of its fleet in the country.

Airbus has established deep roots in China, extending beyond aircraft sales by maintaining full-function teams across all business segments nationwide. ""Most notably, our cooperation has evolved from pure aircraft sales to deep industrial collaboration, which gives us a competitive edge,"" Xu said.

According to the CEO, Airbus has established comprehensive industrial facilities in China, including an engineering center in Beijing, a composite materials manufacturing center in Heilongjiang Province, and an aircraft Final Assembly Line (FAL) in Tianjin Municipality.

Airbus established its A320 family FAL in Tianjin in 2008, marking its first commercial aircraft assembly line outside Europe. To date, the facility has assembled over 750 A320 family aircraft for customers worldwide, becoming a flagship project of China-Europe economic and trade cooperation.

""This series of mutually beneficial collaborations has propelled the development of China's aviation industry while significantly boosting Airbus' market share and industrial resilience in China,"" Xu said.

Currently, around 200 Chinese suppliers support Airbus' commercial aircraft production, covering the entire industrial chain from upstream raw materials to downstream fuselage equipping. All Airbus commercial aircraft models now incorporate components manufactured in China. The annual value of Airbus' industrial cooperation with the country exceeds 1 billion U.S. dollars.

The second A320 family FAL project in Tianjin serves as a cornerstone of Airbus' five-year development plan and marks the next major milestone in its growth journey in China.

The project is expected to start operation in early 2026. Upon completion, Tianjin will establish a complete setup comprising two single-aisle aircraft production lines and one wide-body aircraft completion center. This will double Airbus' A320 family FAL production capacity in China, providing strong support for the company's global production ramp-up, according to the company.

Buschmann noted that the second A320 family FAL currently under construction also reflects Airbus' commitment to doubling its overall industrial footprint in China. ""Looking ahead to the next 40 years, we are highly confident in growing together with China's civil aviation industry. Airbus remains dedicated to deepening its presence in the Chinese market and maintaining excellent partnerships,"" Buschmann said.

Green and digital transformation will become key focus areas for bilateral supply chain collaboration.

""Europe and China share similar decarbonization commitments. Airbus is acting as a catalyst to accelerate the application of sustainable aviation fuel, while China holds multiple advantages in sustainable energy. There are significant prospects for our collaboration in markets, technology, and production capacity,"" Xu said.

Earlier this year, Airbus became the first foreign aviation enterprise in China to obtain a value-added telecom license. ""We see vast potential for future cooperation in building smart civil aviation and are willing to continue working with Chinese partners to forge a sustainable future for the aviation industry,"" Xu added. ■",,N,,2025-07-11 11:20:18.789771

While the company's Q1 2025 results disappointed on earnings and revenue, its stock soared 7.8% on the day of the release—a signal that Wall Street sees more than meets the eye. Let's dive into why Neste's long-term bets on sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and its relentless cost-cutting could make this a “buy the dip” opportunity.

The Near-Term Storm: Missed Targets, but a Strategic Shift

Neste's Q1 2025 results were a mixed bag. Revenue fell short of forecasts, and the company reported a negative cash flow of €225 million, largely due to inventory normalization after prior-quarter refinery outages. Comparable EBITDA of €210 million also lagged expectations, with the Renewable Products segment hit by high feedstock costs for Chinese YUKO and Indonesian oils.

But here's the key takeaway: Neste is not just a fuel company—it's a climate tech play. The stock's surge suggests investors are pricing in the future, not the past. The company's performance improvement program, targeting €350 million in annualized cost savings by 2026, is already yielding results, with a €52 million annualized run rate achieved in Q1. This program includes refinery efficiency gains, streamlined logistics, and procurement overhauls—moves that will directly boost EBITDA margins as production scales.

The Green Bond Gambit: Funding Growth Without Breaking the Bank

Neste's issuance of a €700 million green bond in Q1 2025 wasn't just a financing move—it was a strategic masterstroke. The funds are fueling the expansion of its Rotterdam refinery into a 1.5 million-ton SAF powerhouse, which will be critical to meeting Europe's ReFuelEU mandate (6% SAF blend by 2030). This expansion, paired with its Singapore facility's flexibility to dodge U.S. tariffs, positions Neste to dominate SAF distribution in both regions.

Meanwhile, Neste's leverage ratio remains disciplined at below 40%, thanks to a refinanced €1.3 billion credit facility. This financial flexibility is vital as it ramps up capital expenditures to €1.2 billion in 2025—a bet that could pay off handsomely as SAF demand surges.

The DHL Deal: A Lifeline for SAF Demand

Neste's partnership with DHL, announced in Q1, is a game-changer. The logistics giant committed to buying 300,000 tons of neat SAF annually by 2030, locking in a massive customer for Neste's Rotterdam output. This deal isn't just about volume—it's about proving SAF's commercial viability. DHL's Sustainability Roadmap, which aims for 30% SAF blending by 2030, aligns perfectly with Neste's production timeline.

The Overhang? Overblown.

Critics will point to near-term headwinds: oversupply in renewable fuels, margin pressure from feedstock costs, and geopolitical risks. But here's why they're wrong:

1. SAF's regulatory tailwinds: The EU's ReFuelEU and U.S. incentives will force airlines to buy SAF, even at higher prices.

2. Neste's feedstock advantage: Its reliance on 97% waste/residue-based feedstocks ensures compliance with strict sustainability standards, giving it a leg up on competitors.

3. Cost-cutting is real: The performance program's savings are already materializing, and further refinery efficiencies could flip margins in 2026.

The Bull Case: SAF is the Next Big Thing

The global SAF market is set to explode. Analysts project demand to hit 20 million tons annually by 2030, up from just 1 million tons today. Neste's first-mover advantage—with 130 kilotons sold in Q1, tripling year-over-year—is a goldmine.

Buy, Hold, or Bail?

Neste isn't a “set it and forget it” investment. The path to profitability is littered with potholes like feedstock price spikes and geopolitical trade wars. But for investors with a 3-5 year horizon, here's why Neste is a buy:

- Valuation: The stock trades at just 7.95 euros, a discount to its peers in sustainable energy.

- Catalysts: Rotterdam's ramp-up, DHL's offtake, and 2026 EBITDA targets all create potential upside.

- Moat: Neste's technical expertise in refining complex feedstocks and its existing scale in SAF production are hard to replicate.

Final Call

Neste Oyj is a company in transition—fighting short-term pain for long-term gain. While Q1's misses are a speed bump, its strategic moves in SAF, cost discipline, and partnerships like DHL make it a must-watch stock for green investors. If you believe in the future of sustainable aviation, Neste is the jet fuel of choice.

Action: Buy Neste at current levels, with a 12-month price target of €10-12 euros as SAF demand takes off.

In the 100 years since Fred Rentschler formed Pratt & Whitney (P&W), the company has been at the forefront of aero-engine technologies, leading the way with a series of era-defining milestone projects.

In July 1925, Rentschler teamed up with George J Mead and a small cadre of colleagues with whom they had both previously worked at Wright Aeronautical to develop a new, lightweight, air-cooled, radial engine for the US Navy. With a promising concept, but lacking funds, Rentschler approached the Pratt & Whitney Machine Tool Company, which was emerging from the WW1-era with cash in hand and a glut of manufacturing capacity. The organisation loaned Rentschler $250,000 (around $4.5m today), the use of the P&W name and space in its building. It proved to be a shrewd investment as the first example of the 425hp P&W R-1340 Wasp engine was completed by Christmas Eve. By the time production finished, more than 363,000 members of the Wasp family had been built.

Shifts in architecture

To mark the centenary of P&W, AEROSPACE spoke with Dr Michael ‘Doc’ Winter FRAeS, chief scientist at RTX, the global aerospace and defence giant which is now the engine maker’s parent company.

“When you are designing an aircraft or an engine, it is the architecture that matters most,” explained Winter. “The radial configuration of the Wasp allowed air cooling and this step change in architecture was groundbreaking as it led to an increase in thrust to weight ratio by a factor of around 2.5:1.”

This shift, Winter emphasises, is what the company has done repeatedly over the past century and continues to do today. “After WW2 we took the basic jet engine and, via an architectural shift, created the twin-spool J-57 which, although it was designed for military use, also opened up economics that enabled commercial jet travel.”

Low bypass engines in turn led to high bypass turbofans and, by the late 1990s, the company began working on what Winter considers the next ‘step change’ – the PW1000G geared turbofan (GTF) family, which ultimately entered service in 2016 on the Airbus A320neo. “The GTF represents about a 16% improvement in fuel burn,” he explained, adding that, “I take pride in the fact that the modern gas turbine engine is the most sophisticated mass-produced device known to humankind.”

More runway ahead

One of P&W’s significant step changes in recent years has been the introduction of the PW1000G geared turbofan, which provided around a 16% improvement in fuel burn compared to earlier engines. (RTX)

In today's engines, the performance is governed by the efficiency of the fan, the bypass duct and the nozzle. “That propulsive efficiency is then multiplied by the thermal efficiency of the core,” explained Winter. “This is where we take the energy that is stored in the fuel, liberate it and turn it into motion on the shaft. When we introduced the GTF we created a step change in propulsive efficiency but we also recognised that there was a lot of runway ahead of us to go much deeper into the design.”

Further investigation is under way, looking at increasing the gear ratio and boosting the bypass ratio to allow more air to bypass the engine’s core. “We have so far improved the thermal efficiency of the jet engine by 400%, compared to Frank Whittle and Hans von Ohain’s pioneering engines,” added Winter. “If you plot that relative to the ideal thermodynamics, we're tracking at about 60-70% of ideal efficiencies. However, it turns out that if you extend that line to higher temperatures and pressures all the way to the stoichiometric limit of the fuel, then we've only come halfway.”

Hybrid sweet spot

The engine manufacturer has tested its various engines using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), including the most recent GTF Advantage – the latest iteration of the original GTF, which offers improved fuel efficiency, thrust and durability. “Once there is a certified 100% SAF, our engines will be ready for it,” he said.

Meanwhile, P&W engineers are reimagining commercial propulsion systems as what he refers to as “a hybrid-electric, cyber-physical machine that I can control in new and important ways.” Having looked across all the domains of flight, P&W has found what Winter refers to as “a sweet spot” somewhere between a half a megawatt to a megawatt for hybrid-electric. “That size of power output is enabling urban air mobility (UAM), whereas a [conventionally-powered] regional turboprop is powered by 2,000-3,000shp – which is roughly 2MW to 3MW,” he explained. “In a mild hybrid electric configuration 0.5-1MW can contribute meaningfully to performance.”

It is an area where P&W collaborates closely with its RTX sister business Collins Aerospace, a pioneer in aircraft electric systems, which today offers a range of power-dense electric motor and control systems, ranging from 250kW to 1MW and beyond. The businesses are currently exploring hybrid-electric applications of these motors across various demonstrator programmes.

In terms of regional turboprops, P&W has developed a system which uses the same novel gas generator, motors and drives but architected to be used as a parallel hybrid. “In this configuration you can either draw power from the electrical system or from the gas generator into a common gearbox that drives the propeller on a turboprop,” he explained. “We have built that engine and run it through the mission up to full power and we are now integrating that onto a Dash-8-100 airframe that is likely to fly in 2026. We anticipate the hybrid system will generate up to 50% of the total power required, allowing for a fuel improvement of up to 30%.”

The company has also partnered with Airbus Helicopters to develop a hybrid-electric propulsion for the PioneerLab demonstrator project, which will combine two 0.25MW scale electric motor generators alongside a P&W Canada PW210 turboshaft. Winter also emphasised that work is under way with the EU’s Clean Aviation programme as part of Phase 1 of the Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics (SWITCH) project, which will develop a hybrid-electric GTF demonstrator engine. It is important to note that using such a system will allow times in the mission where the engine can work at its optimal efficiency – “we are not just replacing fuel with electrons,” emphasises Winter. “In fact, we land with full batteries.”

Hydrogen hopes

P&W’s Hydrogen Steam Injected, Inter‐Cooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE) harnesses the cold of the hydrogen to condense the water. It is then trapped by the exhaust and reinvested in the thermodynamic cycle. (RTX)

Many airframe and propulsion developers have pinned great hopes on hydrogen as a wonder fuel. “It has three times the energy density per unit mass of kerosene at 121 megajoules (MJ) per kg,” explained Winter, “but it takes up four times the volume and you really need to store it as a cryogenic liquid. That means finding space for both the fuel and the means to keep it at -253C.”

However, P&W has experience in hydrogen exploration going back 60 years. “In the 1950s, when the CIA discovered that the USSR had missiles capable of reaching the high-altitude Lockheed U-2 spyplanes, designer Clarence ‘Kelly’ Johnson conceived of an aeroplane that burned hydrogen and flew at 100,000ft,” shared Winter. “We [P&W] had the contract to develop the engine for what was codenamed Project Suntan. It used a thermodynamic expander cycle and we ran that engine in 1958. In the first quarter of this current decade, we dusted off those blueprints and studied the architecture to see how it could be used in a modern gas turbine.”

Of course, there are different considerations today than in the 1950s and the fact that burning hydrogen produces higher levels of nitrogen oxides is no longer acceptable. “When I burn hydrogen, if I balance the chemical reaction at the equivalent thrust point, I will produce 2.6 times more water [than kerosene],” added Winter. “Water, of course, plays a role in the formation of contrails, which are known to participate in the overall albedo of the Earth and its climate.”

However, Winter suggests there is a way to turn these challenges into opportunities: “We have conceived the new architecture of an engine called the Hydrogen Steam Injected, Intercooled Turbine Engine (HySIITE). This takes the cold of the hydrogen and harnesses it to condense the water. The exhaust of the engine traps that water so that it does not escape as emissions and reinvests it in the thermodynamic cycle.”

It has been known since the dawn of the jet age that injecting water into engines produces more thrust – as evidenced by film of smoky B-52s taking off in the 1960s. Winter explained: “we take advantage of the water byproduct to cool the flow and increase the density. In turn, we can shrink the size of the engine, reducing its mass and improving the thermal efficiency. Research by the stationary gas turbine industry also shows that adding water reduces the oxides of nitrogen.”

The key enablers for such an engine are a heat exchanger that can be mounted in the exhaust temperature and pressure flows. Recent rig tests of key components – part of a project supported by the US Department of Energy’s ARPA-E agency – delivered promising results. “We have demonstrated, first and foremost, that we can get that heat exchanger to function and continue to function in that environment,” he continued. “That was the first technology ‘brick’. The second was when we discovered that we could capture significant amounts of the water by using the coolant flow in the equivalent exhaust system. In fact, we have been able to capture the equivalent of one gallon of water every three seconds. The third ‘brick’ was being able to inject that water into a combustor system and look at the impact on the oxides of nitrogen.”

In rig testing of key engine components, the scientists discovered that if the engine was fed with 100% hydrogen, they could reduce the oxides of nitrogen by 99.3%, compared to a benchmark GTF engine. Furthermore, Winter claims a 35% increase in fuel efficiency compared to today’s conventional engines, mostly thanks to the ability to shrink the size of the engine core and recover heat energy. With both airlines and air forces quoting 30-40% of their costs coming from fuel burn, these efficiency savings show immense promise.

While the HySIITE project has concluded, P&W continues to study hydrogen-enabling technologies, including at its Canadian arm where engineers are working to demonstrate hydrogen combustion on PW127XT turboprop engines as part of a project known as HyADES (Hydrogen ADvanced Engine Study). However, hydrogen’s long-term future is currently limited – not because of its capabilities but because of the sheer lack of available ‘green’ hydrogen.

Around 95% of the hydrogen produced in the world today is manufactured using fossil fuel sources and, furthermore, is mostly used in the production of ammonia. “Ammonia is a main ingredient in fertiliser and so we do not want to compromise the food chain,” clarified Winter. “Plus, if we are relying on the grid to make hydrogen, clean water is also something of a limited commodity. Crucially, if you use 90% of the hydrogen that was produced last year you would only have enough energy to power 10% of the commercial airline fleet on an equivalent energy basis.” The investment in the infrastructure to generate, move and store green hydrogen must be a priority if this wonder fuel is to be make a difference to net zero targets.

Demand for engines (and engineers)

Pratt & Whitney is collaborating with the EU’s Clean Aviation consortium under the Sustainable Water-Injecting Turbofan Comprising Hybrid-Electrics (SWITCH) project. (RTX)

When pressed on the biggest threats and opportunities to the powerplant sector, Winter thought carefully before saying: “they are one and the same. We are in an era where technologies are moving at an exponentially faster pace than ever before and, at the same time, we are enjoying an era where there is unprecedented demand from around the world.""

""The order backlog for engines is the greatest it has been since WW2 and we are seeing a shift from demand constrained to supply constrained economics. At the same time, we are under pressure to bring ever more efficient and capable products to market. The plus side of this is that aero-engineering is a secure career option, as well as an exciting one. It also provides a tremendous opportunity for public private partnerships to accelerate these new technologies into the market.”

For such a large organisation, P&W aims to emulate the ‘start-up’ ethos that Fred Rentschler and his cohort brought to the industry a century ago. Working fast and clever, they designed the Wasp inside a garage and completed the first engine in under six months. “We reach for that same agile development,” Winter told AEROSPACE. “As with HySIITE, we focus on the hardest things first as that is the mentality that we bring to innovation.” Perhaps that is why 57,000 of the company’s 185,000 employees (almost one in three) is an engineer and why the company holds 60,000 patents – more than one per engineer.

A lot of that innovation takes place in the RTX Technology Research Center, which itself marks its 96th anniversary this year, and traces its roots to a facility first established by Fred Rentschler in 1929, soon after the company opened its doors. Winter began his career there “as a fresh lab rat PhD student” and today, it is one of the groups within RTX that incubates the new technologies and ideas that form the group’s ten technology roadmaps.

One hundred years and well in excess of half a million engines since the first Wasp was conceived, P&W remains at the forefront of propulsion technology and ‘Doc’ Winter retains his infectious enthusiasm for creating better, more efficient aero-engines.",https://www.aerosociety.com/media/26940/pw5a.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 11:21:13.666406

When used as a marine fuel, biomethanol offers up to 95% lower CO2 emissions (tank-to-wake) than conventional fuels.
While methanol synthesis technology is proven, the commercial viability of biomass-to-methanol still depends on access to incentives, predictable feedstock pricing and buyers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon methanol.
To support this high-capacity production, SunGas has selected JM as its methanol synthesis technology partner, along with Linde and Merichem.
Biomass-to-methanol sits at the intersection of energy, waste and industrial policy.","As the global energy system undergoes a fundamental transformation, pressure mounts to find low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels across hard-to-abate sectors. Methanol, a clean-burning fuel with wide-ranging applications in shipping, power generation and sustainable chemicals, offers an alternative to traditional fuels. But biomethanol, technically mature and increasingly scalable, is building its case as a critical enabler of the net-zero transition.

Biomethanol, distinct from e-methanol (which is produced entirely from captured CO2 and green hydrogen), is produced by converting sustainable biomass sources into low-carbon methanol. It helps tackle two major challenges: cutting carbon emissions and reducing organic waste. Coupled with its compatibility with proven industrial processes, biomethanol stands a practical and attractive fuel option in the transition to cleaner energy systems. Biomethanol also lays a road to compliance with upcoming maritime emissions regulations, provides a renewable alternative to current chemical feedstocks facing Scope 3 reduction goals, and offers an outlet for organic waste disposal.

Process Pathways and Technical Readiness

The production of methanol from biomass typically follows one of two routes: biochemical conversion or thermochemical conversion. The former uses anaerobic digestion to create biogas, which can then be reformed into synthesis gas (syngas—a mixture of CO, H2, and CO2). Thermochemical conversion involves converting solid biomass into syngas. Biomass-derived syngas contains different toxins than fossil-based syngas, layering additional challenges in gasification and methanol synthesis. The gas is then cleaned and catalytically converted into methanol. Some advanced systems also incorporate partial oxidation during gasification to enhance syngas quality and increase methanol yield. Green hydrogen may also optionally be integrated into the biomass-to-methanol process to enhance syngas composition and increase methanol yield.

The process can accommodate a wide range of typically nonedible lignocellulosic and organic waste feedstocks such as forestry residues (branches, bark, wood chips) agricultural byproducts (straw, husks, corn stover); black liquor (a byproduct of the pulp and paper industry); and biogenic municipal solid waste (food scraps, green waste).

While the underlying chemistry is well understood, the integration of biomass gasification with methanol synthesis requires careful engineering. Companies with deep experience in methanol production, such as Johnson Matthey, have adapted their synthesis loop and catalyst platforms to manage biomass-derived syngas. These solutions are tailored to tolerate feedstock variability, including hydrogen availability, high-conversion efficiency maintenance, and product purity assurance—all critical for commercial viability. This is not an experimental pathway, however. Biomass-to-methanol leverages decades of industrial methanol expertise and infrastructure at significant scale. This means deployment can happen more quickly than some emerging fuel technologies.

Environmental Impact and Growing Policy Relevance

A 2021 study by the International Renewable Energy Agency estimated that methanol production and use contribute around 0.3 gigatonnes of CO2 annually, or about 10% of global emissions from the chemical industry. Lifecycle analysis shows that biomethanol can reduce global warming potential by up to 185% (cradle-to-gate) relative to fossil-based methanol, depending on feedstock type and carbon accounting assumptions (this figure reflects the CO2 absorbed during biomass growth). Methanol produced from residual or waste biomass has the potential to deliver large carbon footprint savings, especially when it displaces fuels like heavy fuel oil or naphtha.

When used as a marine fuel, biomethanol offers up to 95% lower CO2 emissions (tank-to-wake) than conventional fuels. It also provides immediate improvements in air quality by producing lower nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulphur oxides (SOX) and particulate matter during combustion. In regions facing tightening emissions standards for shipping, these benefits strengthen biomethanol’s case as a compliance-friendly fuel option.

Global maritime regulations are increasing momentum for low-carbon fuels. The FuelEU Maritime Regulation initiative mandates a progressive reduction in greenhouse gas intensity from marine fuels, creating long-term renewables demand signals. Meanwhile, the International Maritime Organization has set a global decarbonization trajectory, including a 20% reduction in shipping’s total GHG emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050, with a global carbon price set in April 2025. These regulations are expected to accelerate the adoption of drop-in fuels, which offer compatibility with existing infrastructure and measurable lifecycle emission benefits. Policy support is not only helping close the investment gap but also solidifying biomethanol’s role in the maritime sector’s energy transition. However, many jurisdictions still lack specific frameworks to differentiate between fossil-based and renewable methanol, or to reward the full lifecycle emissions savings of biobased production. Closing this policy gap will be essential for investment certainty.

Scaling Challenges and Collaboration Needs

Scaling biomass-to-methanol is not without challenges. Feedstock availability, logistics and supply chain integration are common barriers. While biomass is theoretically abundant, practical access is shaped by geography, seasonality and competing demand from other sectors such as bioenergy, animal feed or composting. Effective scaling will depend on the development of stable, regional biomass supply chains. This includes investment in collection and preprocessing infrastructure, better data on feedstock volumes and quality, and systems for tracking sustainability credentials.

Technical challenges also remain. Biomass-derived syngas can contain a range of impurities including tars, sulphur compounds and chlorine, which can impair catalyst performance if not properly managed. Methanol synthesis technology must be resilient to variable gas composition and impurities. Here, advancements in catalyst design and process engineering such as those pioneered by companies like JM are helping make the utilization of sustainable feedstocks more reliable.

Equally important is project financing. While methanol synthesis technology is proven, the commercial viability of biomass-to-methanol still depends on access to incentives, predictable feedstock pricing and buyers willing to pay a premium for low-carbon methanol. Emerging low-carbon fuel standards and voluntary corporate commitments are helping close this gap, but market confidence remains essential. Project viability improves significantly when developers can partner with experienced technology licensors and supply chain integrators who can derisk project delivery.

Case Study: SunGas Renewable Energy Project

One of the most significant projects highlighting the commercial viability and scaling potential of biomethanol is the Beaver Lake Renewable Energy project by SunGas Renewables in Pineville, Louisiana. With a planned investment of $2 billion, this facility will be one of the largest biomethanol plants currently being developed in the U.S. Set on the site of a former paper mill, it reflects a growing trend toward repurposing existing industrial infrastructure to support the energy transition. The plant is expected to produce approximately 500,000 metric tons of biomethanol annually, enough to power up to nine large oceangoing container vessels per year. This output is aimed primarily at the marine fuels market, but it will also serve as a feedstock for sustainable aviation fuel and other renewable chemical applications.

To support this high-capacity production, SunGas has selected JM as its methanol synthesis technology partner, along with Linde and Merichem. A final investment decision is expected by 2026, with operations commencing by late 2028. SunGas has already secured an offtake agreement with shipping giant Maersk.

A Pragmatic Fuel for a Complex Transition

The long-term role of biomethanol will likely vary by region. In feedstock-rich countries, it could become a dominant fuel. In others, it may complement hydrogen or e-methanol solutions, offering a near-term option during scaling. What will ultimately determine its success is not just technical performance, but system thinking. Biomass-to-methanol sits at the intersection of energy, waste and industrial policy. Making it work at scale will require alignment across sectors, coordinated planning and smart regulation. It also calls for pragmatic partnerships between technology providers, feedstock suppliers, policymakers and end users.

As the world confronts the dual pressures of climate action and sustainable growth, fuels like biomethanol deserve close attention. It offers a flexible platform for converting available sustainable feedstocks into low-carbon fuel. In terms of impact, readiness and relevance, biomethanol is proving to be a vital contributor to decarbonization.

The record-breaking aircraft has set 135 city-pair missions, further highlighting its incredible performance attributes

With more than 200 aircraft in service achieving more than 250,000 flying hours, the proven Global 7500 sets the stage for the company’s Global 8000(2), which is ready to enter into service later this year

MONTREAL, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bombardier today announced that its performance-leading Global 7500 business jet has achieved another record-breaking milestone: 135 speed records(1), the most ever set by a single business aircraft type. Some of the blazing-fast aircraft’s impressive city-pair speed records include key city pairs such as Tokyo to San Francisco, London to Riyadh, Oakland to Tokyo, Hartford to Dubai, Tokyo to Toronto and Montreal to Paris, among many others.

Earlier achievements on the Global 7500 include the longest flight ever recorded in business aviation – an 8,225 nautical mile (15,232.7 km) flight from Sydney to Detroit – as well as the industry’s longest range non-stop mission from London City Airport to Los Angeles.

“This is the ultimate recognition, the most speed records of all time – and it’s precisely what Bombardier’s discerning customers need: a reliable, fast, efficient business tool that gets them to destination quickly and efficiently,” said Jean-Christophe Gallagher, Executive Vice President, Aircraft Sales and Bombardier Defense. “Even more impressive is the fact some of these records have been set with passengers on board in varying conditions and airports. It’s a testament to how well engineered the aircraft is, ensuring customers fully benefit from the aircraft’s outstanding performance attributes for their everyday important missions.”

With its incredible performance attributes, the Global 7500 aircraft has achieved an impressive number of speed records since coming to market. Boasting a top speed of Mach 0.925 and a baseline range of 7,700 nautical miles (14,260 km), the Global 7500 sets a new benchmark for performance in the ultra-long-range category. The aircraft’s unique Smooth Flĕx Wing is like an in-air shock absorber, designed with a sophisticated slats and flap system that generates exceptional lift on takeoff and approach, maximizing aerodynamic efficiency and boosting performance while improving safety and offering the industry’s smoothest ride. It also reduces fuel burn, lowers emissions and produces excellent short-field and high-speed performance – producing the perfect platform for our discerning customers.

The industry-defining attributes of the Global 7500 aircraft will soon be enhanced with the introduction of the Global 8000 (2) aircraft. Bombardier’s flagship for a new era is anticipated to have an industry-leading range of 8,000 nautical miles (14,816 km) and a top speed of Mach 0.94, making it the ultimate all-in-one business aircraft. It will also have a low cabin altitude of less than 2,900 feet when flying at 41,000 ft.

Bombardier’s nimble Global 8000 also possesses impressive runway performance comparable to a light jet. Its unique design and cutting-edge engineering provide customers with the ability to access smaller airports other aircraft in its category can’t access.

Renewable Diesel has that alignment.
What will you build—an SAF dream factory or a Renewable Diesel fortress?","If you had the keys to America’s first commercial SAF refinery, how would you play it?Welcome, new Sheriff in town.

You’re not just acquiring some sleepy old plant. You’re stepping into the long, layered saga of the Paramount Sustainable Fuels Facility—a place whose ownership story is less a deed than a palimpsest. In 2018, World Energy bought the old Delek refinery outright, proudly declaring it a wholly-owned renewable showcase. Then Air Products quietly financed, built, or assumed control of critical infrastructure—new hydrogen units, expanded renewable fuels plants—until they were issuing sale memos describing Paramount as their domain. And now, a Guggenheim Securities teaser advises us that the facility is back on the market, the world’s most heavily rebranded and “Monster Deliverer of Actual Fuel” is looking for its next Daddy.

Who really owns Paramount? It depends on the week you ask. But as GTESI reminds us, it hardly matters. Systems like this endure beyond the names on the balance sheet. They persist because barrels keep rolling, contracts keep signing, and the story keeps getting told.

What You’re Getting

Let’s be clear about what’s in the box:

Current Production: 3,500 barrels per day with nearly 100% liquid yield—1,800 barrels SAF, 1,056 RD, the rest Renewable Naphtha.

Expansion Potential: A paused project to scale to 25,000 barrels per day—most of it SAF.

Feedstock Flexibility: Tallow, soybean oil, lard, used cooking oil.

Strategic Position: Locked into California’s logistics—pipelines, rail, trucking, port access, and an aviation fuel market desperate for decarbonization.

On paper, this is an irreplicable platform. But the path you choose will decide whether it becomes a legend or a cautionary tale.

Renewable Diesel: The Quiet Empire

Today, Renewable Diesel is the quiet empire of low-carbon fuels. It doesn’t get headlines, but it dominates the volumes. Last year, RD made up 65% of distillate fuels in California. SAF? Barely 2%.

GTESI gives us language for why: RD is a system with high persistence:

Trust Rituals: Regular earnings calls, expansions, clear policy.

Narrative Coherence: Everyone understands “cooking oil becomes diesel.”

Entropy Export: The processes are mature, the infrastructure stable.

The result is a fuel that just works—and keeps working. If your goal is to keep barrels moving and investors calm, Renewable Diesel is the path of least resistance.

Sustainable Aviation Fuel: The Aspirational System

SAF, in contrast, is still learning to walk. Even with subsidies and tax credits, it’s an ecosystem with structural stress:

Symbolic Compression: Big claims—“the first SAF refinery!”—compressed from complex realities.

Entropy Hoarding: Conversion pathways like ethanol-to-jet are energy- and water-intensive, with carbon value diluted at each step.

Trust Ritual Fragility: No large-scale ATJ plants have proven themselves yet. Announcements outpace delivery.

Yet, SAF also carries the biggest upside if you believe the aviation industry’s decarbonization promises will turn into mandates—and if you’re willing to bet on the policies and rituals catching up to the narrative.

The GTESI Lens

GTESI argues that systems thrive when their stories, processes, and symbolic rituals align. Renewable Diesel has that alignment. SAF is still stitching it together.

In GTESI terms:

RD has a high Inverse Persistence Ratio—its story and reality match.

SAF suffers from Symbolic Compression Divergence—its story is ahead of its actual production footprint.

RD exports entropy efficiently—integrated refineries and proven logistics.

SAF hoards entropy—more complexity, more fragility.

Your Decision

As the new sheriff, you must decide whether to double down on an aspirational narrative or build on operational reality.

If you choose SAF, prepare for extraordinary trust rituals, policy fortification, and the patience to wait out technological growing pains.

If you choose RD, you inherit a system that already knows how to persist.

Remember: the molecules don’t care who owns the plant. But the system does care whether it can keep moving barrels through it, week after week, year after year.

What will you build—an SAF dream factory or a Renewable Diesel fortress?

The choice is yours. And the barrels are waiting.",,N,,2025-07-11 11:22:17.182700

He said while he would have preferred a stand-alone Farm Bill — which hasn't passed since 2018 — the measure goes a long way in providing relief.
Boosting production of sustainable aviation fuel is particularly exciting, he said, because it provides an emerging market to sell his crop.
Cuts to SNAP divide the farm bill coalition and reductions in Medicaid will have harmful effects on millions of Americans.
This approach undermines the foundation of the farm bill and puts its future at risk,"" he said.","Farmers are set to see a boost from the so-called ""big, beautiful bill"" that Congress cleared and President Trump signed into law last week.

That tax and spending package includes $66.4 billion in new money for programs assisting farmers, strengthening the safety net if there is significant volatility in crop prices and revenues. There are also enhancements to crop insurance.

While the legislation rolls back climate friendly tax incentives established in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar development, it extends the clean energy fuel production credit until 2029 — though the value of that credit is reduced. That supports sustainable aviation fuel, which can cut down on carbon emissions from air travel.

Rob Tate, who is on the board of the Minnesota Corn Growers Association and has a farm in Cannon Falls, Minnesota, said he gives the bill high marks for supporting agriculture. He said while he would have preferred a stand-alone Farm Bill — which hasn't passed since 2018 — the measure goes a long way in providing relief.

""For all the provisions that are in that bill, I would have to give it an 'A.' There's really a lot of things that hit home to us,"" he said.

Boosting production of sustainable aviation fuel is particularly exciting, he said, because it provides an emerging market to sell his crop. Some of the corn he grows is used to produce ethanol, which is blended with gasoline and available at gas stations across the country.

And ethanol is an option for sustainable aviation fuel. The first plant doing so opened last year in Georgia, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Minnesota is the fifth-largest ethanol producer in the country.

""We've talked about other alternatives for aviation fuel, which is great, but we have to be able to have a large volume to be able to supply the aviation industry,"" he said. ""And corn and ethanol can do that, so I'm excited about the potential that's there.""

But not everyone is pleased with the GOP-backed law that includes many signature pieces of Mr. Trump's second agenda for his second term. Cuts to Medicaid and food assistance draw fierce pushback.

In a statement, the National Farmers Union said there are meaningful provisions in the bill to help farmers and ranchers and praised many of the same policies as Tate. But union president Rob Larew raised concerns with the changes to those welfare programs.

""These gains are paired with harmful tradeoffs. Cuts to SNAP divide the farm bill coalition and reductions in Medicaid will have harmful effects on millions of Americans. Farm policy should unite us. This approach undermines the foundation of the farm bill and puts its future at risk,"" he said.

He also called on Congress to pass a comprehensive farm policy bill, too. The process is supposed to happen every five years, but the Farm Bill is also the mechanism by which lawmakers reauthorize nutrition and food assistance programs.",https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/11/16a1e604-8dd8-4a48-a02b-8da901d4ea85/thumbnail/1200x630/6f41e77c6c346f7fc08298ea9c912193/6p-pkg-mn-farmer-budget-bill-wcco887t.jpg,N,,2025-07-11 02:01:28.127855
